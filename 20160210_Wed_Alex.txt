[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.040 --> 00:28.720]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this day after the New Hampshire primary we're gonna break down
[00:28.720 --> 00:33.560]  what's what happened last night and what's going to be happening in the future Richard Reeves our
[00:33.560 --> 00:36.200]  reporter who was live on the ground in New Hampshire is going to be joining us at the
[00:36.200 --> 00:42.360]  bottom of the hour we're also going to be talking in the second hour to the vice president of the
[00:42.360 --> 00:48.240]  Border Patrol Union and he's going to talk to us about what the president recently said the
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.800]  president of the Border Patrol Association the Union they're saying if you're going to have
[00:53.800 --> 01:00.240]  us release people that we have caught you might as well just erase the immigration laws and that's
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.600]  essentially what Obama is doing so we're gonna talk to him about a wide variety of things on the
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.760]  immigration front I was just down at the border last week took a couple of days off with my wife
[01:10.760 --> 01:16.000]  it was her birthday went down to the Big Bend National Park first time I'd been there down to
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.160]  the Rio Grande and we ran into the permanent Border Patrol station about 50 miles north of the
[01:22.160 --> 01:28.480]  Rio Grande border quite a bit north of the border just drive up and they ask you are you an American
[01:28.480 --> 01:36.160]  citizen okay you can go on I said are we at the border what is this about what what possible good
[01:36.160 --> 01:43.160]  could that do there's absolutely no sense to what's happening with the Border Patrol with the
[01:43.160 --> 01:46.440]  borders that we have it's been erased the laws been erased the borders have been erased so we're
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.720]  gonna talking to him in the second hour about the issues and the frustrations that they feel you
[01:51.720 --> 01:55.840]  know we feel frustrated I felt frustrated with the border agents who were asking me that stupid
[01:55.840 --> 02:00.280]  question is nothing but security theater but that's what they've been told to do they've also been
[02:00.280 --> 02:05.960]  told to release people that they have captured and not to track them because so many people were
[02:05.960 --> 02:12.440]  just ignoring their notices to appear in court it was an embarrassment to the Justice Department so
[02:12.440 --> 02:17.840]  they said well let's just forget all of this and sweep it under the carpet here so they're frustrated
[02:17.840 --> 02:23.200]  in both directions they see dangerous people coming across we have MS-13 other gangs that
[02:23.200 --> 02:30.680]  really are a consequence intended or unintended a consequence of the war on drugs and of course
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.720]  the rest of the people who are coming across this is part of the amnesty program that Obama and
[02:36.720 --> 02:41.280]  others have done going all the way back to Ronald Reagan but when we look at what happened last
[02:41.280 --> 02:49.120]  night it truly is a shake-up of the establishment especially on the GOP side New Hampshire was
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.440]  where we were supposed to see the champion of the establishment pop out and of course there's
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.360]  a lot of establishment connections there I was listening last night after our live coverage on
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.760]  the way home there was an interview with a former governor John Sununu who was I think the chief
[03:02.760 --> 03:09.960]  of staff if I recall correctly with the administration of George the first and he was talking about the
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.240]  various issues and of course he was all about the governors we were going to push the governor's
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.300]  well they didn't work out too well for the governor's it didn't work out too well for their
[03:18.300 --> 03:26.040]  chosen robot Marco Rubio so now the situation is essentially help us Obi-Wan Kasich you are only
[03:26.040 --> 03:33.200]  hope that's what they're trying to do is is now push John Kasich he's there their last hope is
[03:33.200 --> 03:37.960]  an establishment candidate we've got a lot of news to cover today we're going to break down what's
[03:37.960 --> 03:43.040]  going to happen with these candidates we have Chris Christie now apparently considering whether
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.000]  or not he's going to continue to run we're going to look at what people are saying about Hillary
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.120]  Clinton the collapse of the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire was staggering for everybody who
[03:54.120 --> 03:57.840]  was watching it and we're going to break down the different metrics of that of course another
[03:57.840 --> 04:03.840]  angle to this is the that Trump has single-handedly brought back freedom of speech that's what an
[04:03.840 --> 04:08.640]  article we have up on info wars.com is pointing out at the same time we got a major city now
[04:08.640 --> 04:16.320]  banishing the term founding fathers we've also got some videos about how students are being
[04:16.320 --> 04:24.240]  shown an unequal opportunity race propaganda for students to drive home the idea of white
[04:24.240 --> 04:30.400]  privilege we have a major Supreme Court decision where they have put on hold Obama's war on coal
[04:30.400 --> 04:35.200]  they said they are not going to take a look at this they have put a stay on the execution of
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.440]  these executive orders that are being implemented through the EPA they say that's not going to
[04:39.440 --> 04:45.280]  happen until the next president takes office so that's a very interesting development and
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.800]  that's going to have a lot of bearing on the presidential race as well as Supreme Court
[04:49.800 --> 04:53.760]  appointments that may be possible we're going to talk about that as well stay with us we've got a
[04:53.760 --> 05:03.760]  lot of news a pro abortion group is attacking a Doritos Super Bowl ad for humanizing baby fetuses
[05:03.760 --> 05:09.160]  in the ad a pregnant woman is getting an ultrasound why man besides her realizes the unborn baby will
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.160]  move in the direction of the Doritos he's snacking on the man toys with the baby attempting in
[05:13.160 --> 05:16.520]  vain to reach the chips from the womb until the mother throws the Doritos across the room
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.920]  which prompts a child to launch itself outside mom and towards the chips in response to national
[05:20.920 --> 05:26.200]  abortion reproductive rights action league said the ad used an anti-choice tactic of humanizing
[05:26.200 --> 05:30.600]  fetuses the statement are sourced out in oral and similar groups to humanize the unborn in a
[05:30.600 --> 05:34.920]  vain attempt to justify abortions especially in the aftermath of the Planned Parenthood sting
[05:34.920 --> 05:38.560]  videos exposing its officials admitting they sell aborted baby organs for profit
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.480]  Narl however didn't stop there the group also called out a Snickers ad for being transphobic
[05:43.480 --> 05:47.880]  in a Hyundai ad for showing a dad take away his daughter's autonomy this is all part of the
[05:47.880 --> 05:52.280]  political correctness campaign spearheaded by the authoritarian left to not only control free
[05:52.280 --> 05:56.800]  speech but also how people think this is a kid Daniels with info worse dot com reporting

[08:16.600 --> 08:26.600]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today on this wednesday
[08:26.600 --> 08:31.080]  after the new hampshire primary the first uh voting first primary in the nation of course
[08:31.080 --> 08:37.000]  we had the iowa caucus a little bit different we had a record turnout for the jp yesterday the
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.080]  democrats were lagging a bit behind that according to washington times yet the excitement wasn't there
[08:43.080 --> 08:50.520]  for jeb gocker reports that a yahoo reporter asked jeb this weekend says uh what gives with a
[08:50.520 --> 08:57.240]  exclamation mark and jeb came back take a hike man he's getting tough or maybe frustrated uh they
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.440]  say how the how the tune has changed for jeb just last week in iowa he was very proud to be an
[09:02.440 --> 09:09.640]  exclamation mark this guy i think his exclamation mark is now a question mark a very big question mark
[09:09.640 --> 09:16.440]  behind jeb's name uh he spent a great deal of time in uh new hampshire and he had
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.680]  precious little to show for it as a matter of fact christ christie was also there kasek christie
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.040]  jeb they put a lot of time invested a lot of time in new hampshire as well as did rubio rubio
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.160]  melted down in the debate as we all know and of course jeb uh did poorly uh coming in i think
[09:35.160 --> 09:40.760]  his fourth or fifth place and christie is down so low he finished below the 10 threshold that's
[09:40.760 --> 09:48.360]  significant anybody who finished below 10 percent all their votes rolled over to the first place
[09:48.360 --> 09:55.000]  winner which is donald trump so his delegate count was skewed way ahead even of his strong
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.720]  34 35 percent showing in the actual vote totals he got even more delegates from that but of course
[10:01.720 --> 10:08.040]  the person who is way ahead in the delegate count is hillary clinton she may have taken a
[10:08.040 --> 10:15.800]  shellacking in the popular vote yesterday but she already had the bases loaded when she began the
[10:15.800 --> 10:23.240]  campaign back in november as reported last night she had 422 delegates bernie sanders had about
[10:23.240 --> 10:30.520]  30 some odd delegates so she had 15 percent of what she needed before the election even started
[10:30.520 --> 10:37.720]  how could that be possible you may say well it's the super delegates the delegates that are above
[10:37.720 --> 10:42.520]  that's the sense i guess in which they are super they are above the wishes of the voters these are
[10:42.520 --> 10:49.480]  people who are members of congress people who are democrat party officials they get to vote however
[10:49.480 --> 10:55.560]  they wish and 62 percent of them had already gone to hillary clinton there was one percent for
[10:55.560 --> 11:01.480]  bernie sanders back in november and then the rest of them 30 some odd percent 37 whatever was
[11:02.760 --> 11:10.280]  available as as super delegates so she had a huge a huge advantage as i said the bases
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.880]  were loaded for her before this thing even began it's a little bit different on the on the republican
[11:15.880 --> 11:21.000]  side yes they have super delegates they don't have quite as many of them but they do have their
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.160]  ways of rigging the system and of course we have to watch that very carefully they have a different
[11:27.160 --> 11:33.160]  game they each play a different game they each have ways that the establishment rigs the system
[11:33.160 --> 11:38.840]  i thought it was interesting that marco rubio just squeaked out right over the 10 percent
[11:39.640 --> 11:47.080]  number i think he was like 10.7 percent almost lost his votes to to uh donald trump in that it
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.720]  almost fell below 10 percent but you know when it's close like that that's when they can nudge
[11:51.720 --> 11:57.160]  that's when they can push things that's what we saw happen in iowa with hillary clinton and bernie
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.200]  sanders let's take a look real quickly at what the guardian says i think they really summed it up
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.320]  with donald trump they say he tore up the rule book of american politics and he is winning as
[12:07.320 --> 12:11.560]  donald trump would say trump did not just tear up the rule book in new hampshire the guardian
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.600]  writes he shredded it he burned its remains his defiance ran to both the large and the small
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.640]  conventional wisdom says the voters of new hampshire can only be one over one at a time
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.440]  by retail politics of the most intimate kind they won't give you their votes unless they've
[12:26.440 --> 12:32.040]  seen you eyeball to eyeball ideally several times but that was a logic that informed i ho i
[12:32.040 --> 12:38.760]  ohio governor john casick's campaign he did 100 town hall meetings in the state and of course that
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.080]  got him to second place and as rickard reeves who's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[12:43.080 --> 12:47.720]  uh was reporting from new hampshire he said nobody had a ground game like casick he spent
[12:47.720 --> 12:54.280]  a great deal of time there he and christie spent over 70 days there they spent the most amount
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.560]  of time i think jeb was there probably at that same amount of time the graphic that i saw surprisingly
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.920]  omitted the number of days that jeb bush had been there but the two that they reported as being
[13:04.920 --> 13:11.480]  there the most were uh casick and christie say trump though did none of this he skipped all
[13:11.480 --> 13:17.480]  the tiny meetings he didn't do any drop buys to diners okay what he did was he would fly in
[13:18.120 --> 13:24.520]  pull these massive rallies and then fly back out he didn't spend a single night in new hampshire the
[13:24.520 --> 13:30.920]  other thing that he did was he broke as i point out the golden rule thou shalt not cross fox
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.360]  news okay he did it and it didn't hurt him as a matter of fact they said it gave him favorable
[13:36.360 --> 13:42.600]  coverage from other outlets who were more than happy to see meghan kelly get her come up and so i
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.320]  i gotta say that's one of the things i've enjoyed most of the this campaign is the back and forth
[13:47.320 --> 13:52.360]  between donald trump and meghan kelly and he has uh he's done a great deal with that
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.920]  you know when you look at at jeb bush uh he came back and last night he celebrated and this is what
[13:56.920 --> 14:03.880]  he had to say and by coming in fourth or fifth he said i'm not dead that was his big victory last
[14:03.880 --> 14:13.560]  night uh he was not dead and i think when you look at jeb bush he just cannot communicate even worse
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.720]  than his brother w you know he had that speech where he went in and talked about how you needed
[14:18.360 --> 14:22.920]  strength you needed a strong leader who wasn't going to be bragging about things and then he
[14:22.920 --> 14:28.280]  kind of stops and he goes sheepishly after he's been talking about how america needs a strong
[14:28.280 --> 14:34.200]  silent type he kind of sheepishly says please clap remember that well you know he's also said he
[14:34.200 --> 14:40.920]  could drop his pants and no one would notice he's absolutely clueless as to how he insults himself
[14:40.920 --> 14:46.360]  he doesn't even understand what an insult that is to himself he has no idea when he attacks trump
[14:46.360 --> 14:53.080]  on imminent domain he has no idea that the keystone pipeline is private he thinks it's public or at
[14:53.080 --> 14:57.160]  least he wants to pretend that it's public because he doesn't want to offend the coke brothers who
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.800]  want to get that pipeline through there but then he also is clueless about the fact that
[15:01.800 --> 15:07.720]  his brother and the bush family used imminent domain for private use in texas when they built
[15:07.720 --> 15:13.320]  their stadium but of course donald trump was quick to point that out as well but he points out i'm
[15:13.320 --> 15:20.360]  not dead yet okay it's kind of like a money python skit you know i'm i'm getting better you know when
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.480]  he comes out there so for the moment it didn't matter that bush spent 36 million dollars in new
[15:25.480 --> 15:32.360]  hampshire he built the best organization in the state and he came in in fourth place yes it was a
[15:32.360 --> 15:40.120]  victory he's not dead yet okay but that day is coming meanwhile chris christie looks like he
[15:40.120 --> 15:44.440]  may be considering dropping out he's canceled to south carolina primary event of course that's the
[15:44.440 --> 15:49.240]  next place they're all going he'd been due to speak at a forum on legal and constitutional
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.960]  issues and charlson today he will not be attending he said publicly that he's going to take a deep
[15:53.960 --> 16:01.240]  breath assess what comes next and he was going to go back home and consider that with his family
[16:01.240 --> 16:06.360]  meanwhile we hear from donald trump today that he had a long talk with christie last night the two
[16:06.360 --> 16:11.800]  discuss the idea the governor getting out of the contest said trump and trump was very complimentary
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.520]  of chris christie said he did an amazing job in terms of the debate as a prosecutor he's a friend
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.520]  of mine he actually called me last night we had a long talk he's a little disappointed because he
[16:20.520 --> 16:26.360]  really did do a great job he did an amazing job during the debate he congratulated me trump continued
[16:26.360 --> 16:30.920]  and said it was just unbelievable what you've done i mean the numbers were fantastic etc he says
[16:32.040 --> 16:36.200]  he's a friend of mine i thought he was very effective but here's the deal folks he finished
[16:36.200 --> 16:45.400]  in sixth place and it was a must win at least into a fifth place position for kasek for christie
[16:45.400 --> 16:51.160]  and for fiorina if they didn't come in and at least fifth place they were not going to be
[16:51.160 --> 16:57.480]  in the next debate in south carolina coming up this saturday christie finished in sixth place
[16:58.520 --> 17:05.080]  the arena was i think next to last so they will not be in this debate and that's really key for
[17:05.080 --> 17:11.160]  christie that's where he is going to to shine as we've seen that's his strength he's a prosecutor
[17:11.160 --> 17:18.520]  he's a lawyer he's very good at that he really nailed rubio to the wall a classic exchange classic
[17:18.520 --> 17:26.520]  exchange that will always be remembered he spent 72 days in new hampshire just as we saw jeb bush
[17:26.520 --> 17:32.120]  and kasek go there and of course jeb bush did the traditional thing kasek did the traditional
[17:32.120 --> 17:37.880]  thing and it's really not working folks you know coming in 1920 points behind the leader
[17:37.880 --> 17:44.520]  uh in a race that is uh that divided that's really not much of a victory uh they the establishment
[17:44.520 --> 17:49.080]  thinks that they're going to be able to move forward with kasek but it's really kind of a
[17:49.080 --> 17:56.120]  case of uh you know a desperate reach out to uh an obiwan kasek as i said in the last segment

[18:10.840 --> 18:19.000]  involved in making a ton of money selling junk stuff to people kasek in his particular case he
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.080]  was selling uh junk investments to public pension funds and getting hundreds of thousands of dollars
[18:25.080 --> 18:32.280]  for it just before layman brothers went belly up that's the amazing thing that these guys can do this
[18:32.280 --> 18:36.920]  and continue to do this and get away with it that is going to come back to haunt him i guarantee

[24:11.640 --> 24:14.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in this segment we're going to take a look
[24:14.840 --> 24:20.920]  at what happened on the democrat side there's an interesting article on rt from julien assange
[24:20.920 --> 24:28.040]  he said a vote for hillary clinton is a vote for endless stupid war that spreads terrorism and of
[24:28.040 --> 24:31.480]  course he kind of ran down her resume i thought it was very interesting i want to read a couple
[24:31.480 --> 24:36.440]  of quotes of of what he tweeted out julien assange said a vote today for hillary clinton is a vote
[24:36.440 --> 24:42.440]  for endless stupid war years of experience in dealing with hillary clinton have and have read
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.560]  thousands of her cables he said hillary lacks judgment will push us into endless wars which
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.640]  will spread terrorism and then he kind of summed up her experience here because you know when you
[24:51.640 --> 24:59.480]  look at the exit polls coming out of new hampshire the breakdown in terms of the democrat voters
[24:59.480 --> 25:04.040]  they said 32 percent of them were looking for a candidate who was honest and trustworthy
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.040]  another 27 percent said the thing that they were looking for first in a candidate was someone who
[25:08.040 --> 25:14.360]  cared about people okay now if you total those up the 32 the 27 that's 59 percent that's basically
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.880]  what bernie sanders got then you've got another 27 percent who said they wanted a candidate with
[25:19.880 --> 25:25.240]  the right experience 13 percent who said they wanted electability you total those two up
[25:25.240 --> 25:29.800]  you got 40 percent that's essentially what hillary got so on hillary's side you know people are
[25:29.800 --> 25:35.240]  voting for bernie sanders because they think he's honest authentic that he's trustworthy he cares
[25:35.240 --> 25:39.800]  about people okay the people who are supporting hillary clinton are supporting her because
[25:39.800 --> 25:46.440]  they like her experience they like her electability now her electability took a big hit yesterday but
[25:46.440 --> 25:52.760]  let's talk first about her experience and let's let julien assange speak what he said was libya
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.680]  has been destroyed it's been come a haven for isis the libyan national army armory was looted
[25:58.680 --> 26:03.800]  hundreds of tons of weapons were transferred to jihadists in syria having learned nothing from
[26:03.800 --> 26:09.000]  the libyan disaster hillary then set about trying to do the same thing in syria hillary's war has
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.520]  increased terrorism killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians has set back women's
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.640]  rights in the middle east by hundreds of years okay so that's from someone who is essentially
[26:19.640 --> 26:25.320]  on the on the democrat side speaking as a democrat who's looking at it when they start to understand
[26:25.320 --> 26:31.160]  what hillary's experience quote unquote amounts to they're going to be very angry if they really
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.360]  take an honest assessment an honest look at it and that's what julien assange talked about
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.720]  and of course there's the issues about how she is not the trustworthy candidate she is not the
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.600]  candidate who cares about people but if you take away the people who think that she's got the right
[26:46.600 --> 26:53.880]  experience okay she's already losing 60 40 you take away that 27 percent let's say they want
[26:53.880 --> 27:01.320]  somebody with the right experience okay now she's losing 87 to 13 and then you look at those last
[27:01.320 --> 27:07.400]  13 percent you've got people now wondering is she really electable of course that's why
[27:07.400 --> 27:12.280]  michael bloomberg has been talking so much about this that's why he's floated the idea that he's
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.760]  going to get in and of course the presidential debate commission is saying well he would welcome
[27:16.760 --> 27:21.240]  michael bloomberg not going to welcome a third party candidate not going to welcome other independent
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.360]  candidates but yeah michael bloomberg would welcome him think about the fact that in order to get into
[27:26.360 --> 27:34.280]  these various debates being run by fox or cnn or cbs they've got thresholds that are like three four
[27:34.280 --> 27:41.720]  or five percent to get into the debates if you want to get into the non-crowded debate for the
[27:41.720 --> 27:46.840]  final presidential debate as an independent as a third party to get in there and talk to the other
[27:46.840 --> 27:55.880]  two candidates you have to have 15 percent before they let you speak 15 percent if they had that kind
[27:55.880 --> 28:02.680]  of threshold you would have basically a debate between donald trump and uh john casick that would
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.880]  basically be a donald trump and maybe that had ted cruise now the rest of people would be able to
[28:07.880 --> 28:13.720]  speak is that really what we want is that something that really serves us i mean one of the few things
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.680]  that is valuable i think about the presidential races are the fact that we have a discussion of
[28:18.680 --> 28:24.360]  policy that we get to see who these guys really are are they empty suits like marco rubio who've
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.040]  just been wound up and put up on stage and given some talking points or do can they really think
[28:30.040 --> 28:36.440]  do they really have principles that they believe in that they can support that they can articulate
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.960]  from one speech to the other or do they just repeat these talking points like a robot so when
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.920]  you look at this from this standpoint you've not got people like bill mower coming out and
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.800]  in the la times and saying that hillary clinton is essentially a charlie brown
[28:55.080 --> 28:58.840]  so when they're looking at this now they're starting to look at her electability
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.640]  and now her even that is starting to look bad but you look at this tenuous hold and i think
[29:03.640 --> 29:08.840]  the what we saw there in new hampshire with a breakdown 60 40 between the people that think
[29:08.840 --> 29:14.520]  all right she can win she's got great experience not so much that's only 40 percent the other
[29:14.520 --> 29:20.840]  60 percent of the people are looking at bernie sanders and saying you know not only do we trust
[29:20.840 --> 29:26.840]  him more than hillary trust anybody really more than hillary but this guy could probably win the
[29:26.840 --> 29:34.280]  nomination she is in deep trouble i don't think it's going to help them to float michael bloomberg
[29:34.280 --> 29:40.200]  i think that's simply going to split the liberal vote and i can't imagine anyone voting for mr nanny
[29:40.200 --> 29:45.560]  state stay with us we'll be right back with richard reese fresh uh return from new hampshire our
[29:45.560 --> 29:54.360]  reporter on the ground there we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:54.360 --> 30:04.200]  network this is joe vicks with info wars dot com campaign aid trump has single-handedly
[30:04.200 --> 30:11.000]  brought back freedom of speech article up by steve watson appearing on cnn tuesday katrina pierce
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.920]  and defended trump's use of the word vagina or actually another word that starts with the p&n's
[30:16.920 --> 30:22.360]  in a while during a rally when he was talking about rival ted cruise now the video of trump
[30:22.360 --> 30:26.920]  repeating a supporter's jab at cruise went viral as the crowd in attendance whooped and
[30:26.920 --> 30:32.280]  hollered in support cnn asked pierce and whether she wished trump had not used the language if
[30:32.280 --> 30:38.120]  we're looking politically at the conditioning of the voters maybe yes but with my personal response
[30:38.120 --> 30:43.720]  absolutely not she replied we have a full blown assault on the first amendment donald trump has
[30:43.720 --> 30:48.200]  single-handedly brought back freedom of speech look regardless of how you feel about donald
[30:48.200 --> 30:51.720]  trump guess what there's not that many uh people to choose from at the end of the day you can find

[35:16.040 --> 35:21.720]  Carolina coming up and then the Nevada caucuses coming up during this month and we've had Chris
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.560]  Christie as I reported earlier says that he took some time off he canceled an event today in South
[35:27.560 --> 35:34.040]  Carolina and let's play a clip from Chris Christie where he says he's going to take a little bit
[35:34.040 --> 35:40.360]  of time to reconsider things Mary Pat and I spoke tonight and we've decided that we're going to go
[35:40.360 --> 35:47.240]  home to New Jersey tomorrow and we're going to take a deep breath see what the final results are
[35:47.240 --> 35:52.680]  tonight because that matters whether we're sixth or fifth and exactly how all the final votes will
[35:52.680 --> 35:57.720]  be counted in because so many New Hampshire residents came out to vote today it's going to take a
[35:57.720 --> 36:02.600]  while to count these votes so we want to see exactly what happens and so we're going to go home to
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.920]  New Jersey to wait by tomorrow morning tomorrow afternoon we should know we should know what the
[36:06.920 --> 36:13.000]  vote count is and that's going to allow us to make a decision about how we move from here in this
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.160]  race but there's no reason to go to sit in South Carolina in a hotel room to hear that we'll go
[36:19.160 --> 36:25.640]  home we haven't been home for two weeks so we can actually get a change of clothes which would be a
[36:25.640 --> 36:33.880]  nice thing and that's right and so so we will go home to New Jersey tomorrow morning we will make
[36:33.880 --> 36:40.440]  a decision on our next step forward based upon the results that come in here completed here in New
[36:40.440 --> 36:47.320]  Hampshire but on behalf of Mary Pat and okay let's let's stop it there of course he was saying he
[36:47.320 --> 36:50.360]  didn't we're just going to go back and see if he was going to come in at fifth or sixth place
[36:50.360 --> 36:55.560]  we did was he came in sixth place he needed to come in and fifth place in order to stay alive in the
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.440]  debates they're going to have a debate in South Carolina on Saturday he didn't make that so he's
[37:00.440 --> 37:05.080]  going to be out of the debate that's been his forte he spent 72 days in New Hampshire he spent a lot
[37:05.080 --> 37:09.400]  of time there worked that very hard just like Kasich did but he didn't even he didn't make fifth
[37:09.400 --> 37:15.240]  place he didn't make 10% so all of his votes went to Donald Trump who was the winner very disappointing
[37:15.240 --> 37:21.400]  for him and as we reported earlier he called Donald Trump last night and they talked about the
[37:21.400 --> 37:27.160]  future didn't say what what was discussed but of course Donald Trump was very complimentary
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.800]  of Chris Christie he would like to have his support one way the other well sooner or later
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.480]  he's got to put the hammer lock on Chris Christie later on to get him to cooperate with his agenda
[37:37.480 --> 37:42.760]  yeah you know he's starting that game already which is good to see because you know if you just
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.240]  totally make enemies salted earth nuclear political wasteland yeah and you can't get
[37:47.240 --> 37:52.120]  stuff done well that's interesting because we've seen this now with both Chris Christie and with
[37:52.120 --> 37:57.320]  Ben Carson when you see the kind of the train wreck that really wasn't the fault of the candidates
[37:57.320 --> 38:01.400]  so if you got that beautiful guy she can put that up there the train wreck where they were
[38:01.400 --> 38:06.440]  announcing the candidates on the Saturday debate and Ben Carson came out part of the way and because
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.560]  of applause and because he was between backstage and front stage he was confused couldn't hear his
[38:11.560 --> 38:16.520]  name and Donald Trump came out there and stood behind him kind of said not I think they want
[38:16.520 --> 38:20.840]  you to go out Ben Ben wasn't sure so he said there and he stayed there with him and then you know
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.840]  Jeb Bush goes around him kind of gives him a funky look you can see this happen we're playing
[38:24.840 --> 38:30.360]  it here for people looking at it but you know it's kind of a conciliatory move towards Ben Carson
[38:31.320 --> 38:37.720]  Ben Carson was asked by Neil Cavuto if he'd consider being a VP nominee for Donald Trump he
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.880]  said yeah I'd consider it I mean that's unusual you don't usually hear that most of the time they'll
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.840]  just say we're not going to talk about that I'm still in the race so he's he's reached out he's
[38:46.840 --> 38:52.600]  been conciliatory he's been kind of nice to Ben Carson nice to Chris Christie on his remarks last
[38:52.600 --> 38:58.840]  night so yeah he's trying to be a little bit more of a politician a diplomat with some of the people
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.240]  who are possibly going to be dropping out soon right well as I'm sure you probably saw in the
[39:03.240 --> 39:08.600]  info warriors in the audience probably saw that when Trump was angry and attacking Cruz harshly
[39:08.600 --> 39:14.120]  occasionally and attacking Jeb Bush harshly then they would they would seize on those moments
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.640]  making Donald Trump look very angry you know so that was part of the game so that's just like on our
[39:19.640 --> 39:25.240]  homepage today on info wars I see here that you know they're they're fox making it look like
[39:26.200 --> 39:32.040]  that Trump dropped an f-bomb yeah in a in an audience in a speech and by the way
[39:32.040 --> 39:35.960]  that scene that you just showed about the Saturday night debate where Ben Carson
[39:35.960 --> 39:40.520]  held up because he thought he didn't get called out yet to come to the stage
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.240]  Trump talked about that in his speech and said you really could not hear you could not hear what
[39:45.240 --> 39:49.320]  was going on so it was a matter of the Carson actually you know he didn't hear the cue well
[39:49.320 --> 39:54.360]  it was a total train wreck I mean David had uh after they did get uh Trump and Carson out on
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.480]  stage they still had uh John Kasich way back there Chris Christie said you want me to introduce
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.600]  Kasich because they had forgotten to introduce Kasich so it was really it wasn't really the
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.760]  candidates fault it was really uh the people who were running and I had not seen that particular
[40:08.760 --> 40:13.480]  shot but there's actually one guy in the background that's waving Carson yeah on there he comes out
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.640]  a couple of times from the back takes his head around and goes go on go on sees he's on television
[40:17.640 --> 40:21.640]  and pulls back so but it was a real train wreck it was kind of funny going back to the Chris
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.480]  Christie situation you know last night as we discussed I was really concerned that the powers
[40:25.480 --> 40:30.760]  that be we're going to jigger his numbers up to the 10% threshold uh and as I'm looking this morning
[40:30.760 --> 40:36.680]  I see that he actually dropped down a percentage so really but they did get Rubio just a hair over 10
[40:36.680 --> 40:41.240]  percent 10.7 percent I'm telling you they're not done with Rubio they might have they might have
[40:41.240 --> 40:46.600]  kicked him down a notch yeah for this for this uh New Hampshire primary but I think I still think
[40:46.600 --> 40:51.800]  he's a fair-haired child a fair-haired boy of the New World Order oh they like him he gave them
[40:51.800 --> 40:57.960]  everything that they wanted and what he did was he played the conservatives the tea parties for
[40:57.960 --> 41:03.240]  suckers that's why Phyllis Schlafly and others are so angry at him he came in and he campaigned as
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.280]  somebody who was with them on immigration on many other issues and as soon and I remember when
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.080]  they came in I you know I remember uh Rand Paul was part of that class Mike Lee Marco Rubio and
[41:13.080 --> 41:18.040]  everybody said oh good we got some uh some people who we think are going to do what conservatives
[41:18.040 --> 41:23.240]  want to do and he was the one who betrayed everybody worse than anyone worse than anyone
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.320]  and see I think that key point that you make David is one of the things that makes him a
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.120]  favored son oh yeah the New World Order is hey we want these guys that can really deceive
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.680]  the people and the masses out there and so Marco Rubio's uh he will say or do anything the chameleon
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.240]  that he is to look like a tea parrier to look like somebody that's interested in the Constitution
[41:43.240 --> 41:48.840]  liberty freedom etc and then stab them in the back that ability right there that you know that's
[41:48.840 --> 41:52.440]  like hey you rise to the top when you have that in the New World Order system well the interesting
[41:52.440 --> 41:58.200]  thing is as I reported uh just a few minutes ago there was record turnout on the GOP side
[41:58.200 --> 42:03.320]  not so much on the democrat side it wasn't a record for them but still uh if you look at the
[42:03.320 --> 42:10.120]  demographics across the board for both Trump and Sanders they basically carried everything across
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.960]  the board so when you look at the 33 35 percent that Trump got he got that in pretty much every
[42:15.960 --> 42:22.760]  demographic uh whether you're breaking it down by uh income or by race or by age or by sex and the
[42:22.760 --> 42:28.760]  same thing for Bernie Sanders I mean he really clobbered Hillary Clinton he beat her in everything
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.240]  except for the over 65 I guess she got the grandma vote you know she was telling the Spanish people
[42:33.240 --> 42:37.640]  yeah I'm gonna be your uh Abulah or whatever the uh the Spanish term for grandmother is
[42:37.640 --> 42:41.880]  well that's I guess that's what she was she got the grandma vote and I think that
[42:41.880 --> 42:48.760]  when you look at that faction the over 65 clearly what are they watching you know they're not on a
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.480]  computer good point not reading good point not online you know that they don't have smartphones
[42:53.480 --> 42:58.600]  even probably they still got you know they've got a cell phone but it's just basically text and phone
[42:58.600 --> 43:03.320]  calls it shows the power of the mainstream they still have it they're dangerous they're dangerous
[43:03.320 --> 43:07.800]  when is an animal most dangerous yeah when they're cornered when they're wounded and we've got a cornered
[43:07.800 --> 43:12.840]  folks well I told the story I'll briefly recap it back in 1992 when I was with the Libertarian Party
[43:13.560 --> 43:19.000]  we had a very unknown candidate Andre Maruti been the VP for Ron Paul when he ran four years earlier
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.320]  he was a state rep in Alaska and he was running as a libertarian but an activist had given a
[43:25.320 --> 43:29.640]  subscription to Libertarian magazine to everybody in Dixville Notch little town that votes at midnight
[43:29.640 --> 43:35.240]  okay where Kasich prevailed and Bernie prevailed yeah but they had but they had given a subscription
[43:35.240 --> 43:41.960]  to a Libertarian magazine to everybody there and Andre Maruti won that and when I saw that I thought
[43:41.960 --> 43:48.040]  that's the power of being able to inform people and there wasn't any way back in 1992 there wasn't
[43:48.040 --> 43:54.120]  any way to to break that monopoly that mainstream media has I call them the eyewash media because
[43:54.120 --> 44:00.760]  it really is a propaganda method you couldn't break that you couldn't afford to give a subscription
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.920]  to that many different people right and and you didn't have the internet you didn't have
[44:04.920 --> 44:08.360]  infowars you didn't have the drudge report you didn't have these alternative ways that people
[44:08.360 --> 44:12.040]  could get their information and that's what we're seeing it's a good point we point out the people
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.800]  over 65 they're getting all their information from watching mainstream news and we can see what a lock
[44:17.800 --> 44:21.880]  that gives the establishment you know they're watching Good Morning America they're watching the
[44:21.880 --> 44:26.360]  ABC CBS I mean they're they're not even watching the news channels like CNN and Fox most likely
[44:26.360 --> 44:33.640]  most likely they're getting everything from that 530 ABC CBS NBC big national news that's right and
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.040]  another thing you talked about when you just mentioned Maru about how he went up to Dixiel
[44:38.040 --> 44:43.720]  Notch in New Hampshire and did retail politics and was victorious with that well you know the big
[44:43.720 --> 44:49.640]  states of Iowa well he didn't he didn't even go there oh it was it was simply the the strength
[44:49.640 --> 44:54.920]  of the information coming from a monthly subscription giving people just a little bit of a different
[44:54.920 --> 44:59.480]  insight a different perspective giving them the liberty perspective on the retail politics in
[44:59.480 --> 45:05.960]  the mailbox yeah exactly the retail politics in the mailbox and you know with Iowa and New Hampshire
[45:06.600 --> 45:11.320]  you know they're not big necessarily in geographical size but they're big as far as you know these
[45:11.320 --> 45:16.920]  presidential races retail politicking is at a premium and we've learned that we've seen
[45:16.920 --> 45:23.480]  you know in 2008 with Mike Huckabee on you know on the ground stomping winning the state out of
[45:23.480 --> 45:28.200]  nowhere with the mainstream media push so he added he had that big advantage right there because
[45:28.200 --> 45:34.040]  the mainstream media literally brought him in as the foe Ron Paul in 2008 I know we talked about
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.240]  it before but it's still important to look back and see those moments in history then Santorum
[45:39.240 --> 45:46.680]  with his ground game and a big mainstream media push but Cruz really did earn that Iowa victory
[45:46.680 --> 45:51.960]  I think now the shenanigans that he did with Carson not good you know I don't it really has
[45:51.960 --> 45:57.160]  but he did shake the most hands now in New Hampshire we had John Kasich was the leader
[45:57.160 --> 46:01.480]  with the ground game Christy was number two but that didn't benefit Christy as much because
[46:01.480 --> 46:06.280]  you know people when they see him in person whatever they'll come in and see him in an event
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.320]  or whatever but I just don't think he's a likable guy yeah when they see him they like some of things
[46:11.320 --> 46:16.200]  he says about national security and things like that but uh we did have just a little bit more
[46:16.200 --> 46:22.440]  liberal maybe they don't oppose his policies but I mean Chris Christy is uh I mean he's been somebody
[46:22.440 --> 46:28.760]  who campaigned to put in an assault weapon ban and he's not with us on very many issues this guy is
[46:28.760 --> 46:34.440]  very authoritarian uh in terms of you know he comes at it from perspective of a prosecutor
[46:34.440 --> 46:40.920]  and in spite of all of the personal stories that he has about a family member who was uh
[46:40.920 --> 46:45.560]  you know or actually it wasn't a family member that was Callie Fiorina but he talks about a
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.520]  colleague of his whose life was destroyed by prescription drug abuse but he still wants to
[46:50.520 --> 46:56.040]  hammer this war on drugs and he still wants to shut down uh the 10th amendment and tell these
[46:56.040 --> 46:59.560]  states that have said we're not going to send people to prison for marijuana he says no I'm
[46:59.560 --> 47:03.320]  going to do it as president well he's very authoritarian if Chris Christy drops out of the
[47:03.320 --> 47:08.680]  race maybe Hollywood calls him and they start a new series of the Sopranos that's what he would do
[47:08.680 --> 47:15.160]  really well that's a possible thing but uh anyway one of the ways that we would kind of try to gauge
[47:15.160 --> 47:20.040]  whether the polls were correct or what the census out there is literally by going to events and
[47:20.680 --> 47:25.800]  we would pop into you know as many different events as we could in some cases we would stay for the
[47:25.800 --> 47:31.160]  whole event in other cases we would just pop in and with Chris Christy on the last pop-in event
[47:31.160 --> 47:37.800]  that we did with Chris Christy it was literally at an internet cloud-based uh business where the
[47:37.800 --> 47:43.080]  majority of the crowd well probably a third of the crowd was press out of maybe somewhere 100
[47:43.080 --> 47:50.280]  150 people and probably about 150 people total so you're talking about 50 of it was press and the other
[47:50.280 --> 47:56.280]  probably out of the hundred probably 70 80 were people that worked there at that facility you
[47:56.280 --> 48:01.240]  know taking a break yeah yeah which was uh you know just basically a set up deal so uh
[48:01.240 --> 48:07.640]  you know probably 20 or 30 people came from the outside as guests to actually see Chris Christy
[48:07.640 --> 48:12.200]  and so when I saw that I knew that uh you know even though he's done all the ground work and etc
[48:12.200 --> 48:16.760]  then shaking the hands that he was going to be single digits well I think it's not inviting
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.120]  they didn't get engaged black box voting he's not going to do too well going down to South
[48:20.120 --> 48:24.040]  Carolina especially if he's not in the debate I think he's smart enough to try to cut a deal
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.680]  for something with the person who now looks like the nominee Donald Trump while he still
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.960]  got eight or nine percent uh of course Carly Fiorina is just going to ride this train into the
[48:33.960 --> 48:38.840]  ground she's not going to get out no matter what she can see you just you just you just made me
[48:38.840 --> 48:45.240]  think of something right there uh you know Chris Christy calling Donald Trump uh you know I don't
[48:45.240 --> 48:51.160]  know you know we know that at eight percent Chris Christy gets either one or two dollars at least
[48:51.160 --> 48:56.440]  one maybe two New Hampshire delegates or would have but they passed the Trump yeah no he didn't
[48:56.440 --> 49:02.760]  yeah yeah now what what this phone call might be is Chris Chris here's here's how it works folks
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.480]  you know we talked about how every state has a different system on how they get the delegates
[49:07.480 --> 49:14.280]  to Cleveland they have a system in New Hampshire that I could not have imagined okay the way the
[49:14.280 --> 49:20.840]  system is in New Hampshire is is the candidates file to run for president back in November of
[49:20.840 --> 49:29.800]  2015 and then a week or two after filing they each have to submit a list of about 40 candidates
[49:29.800 --> 49:34.120]  that they like that they know in New Hampshire that are registered eligible voters in New Hampshire
[49:34.120 --> 49:41.640]  each candidate lists their slate of potential delegates of like 40 names okay so this phone
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.920]  call what it may really be about is Chris Christy saying hey you know normally I would get X number
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.480]  delegates here's a couple of names off my list I I want you to put them on there in case it goes to
[49:51.480 --> 49:57.160]  a brokered convention yeah so that that's a danger that's a danger right there so Donald Trump if
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.920]  you hear this episode this show today don't fall for that uh well who knows I mean he might be
[50:02.920 --> 50:09.800]  negotiating for an attorney general position well he could be but do we want that well I don't I don't
[50:09.800 --> 50:15.080]  and that's one of the things that concerns me you know I agree with Donald Trump on the trade
[50:15.080 --> 50:19.880]  issue we've talked about that I think it's very important I think he is really the only block
[50:19.880 --> 50:25.400]  that we've got at the moment to TPP I think anybody else in the GOP or the Democrat side has been
[50:25.400 --> 50:31.640]  basically signed on to TPP I don't trust Bernie Sanders to to push that back certainly Hillary
[50:31.640 --> 50:35.640]  Clinton is all for it the rest of the establishment candidates so that's important but when you look
[50:35.640 --> 50:41.000]  at the other stuff it does concern me so much about Donald Trump's authoritarian urges that's
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.640]  something that I'm very concerned about but I think the key thing here is that we have to understand

[54:13.720 --> 54:17.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to our reporter Richard
[54:17.160 --> 54:22.440]  Reeves who's been live in the ground in Iowa and in New Hampshire he's going to be heading back now
[54:22.440 --> 54:27.000]  to South Carolina to see what happens there we're just kind of getting his impressions he's been
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.880]  following a lot of reports but of course just talking to him about the things that he saw on the
[54:31.880 --> 54:37.480]  ground we were talking during the break I asked him if he saw any rallies on the Democrat side tell
[54:37.480 --> 54:42.680]  us what you saw with the Sanders and well on this New Hampshire trip route we weren't able to squeeze
[54:42.680 --> 54:48.760]  in going to an actual big event but we did see an impromptu Bernie Sanders rally marching down the
[54:48.760 --> 54:53.480]  streets with Bernie Sanders in the midst of it no gotta give him credit man I got him do they have
[54:53.480 --> 55:00.280]  like hemorrhage flags and Che Guevara t-shirts or well that not quite yet but they are the most
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.560]  fervent supporters anybody could have the Trump supporters are fervent they're they're hot to do
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.480]  the work make the phone calls you know knock on doors and all that but Bernie Sanders that group
[55:11.480 --> 55:17.000]  that's unparalleled you know because they are younger they're gonna get their college loans
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.400]  paid off that's a motivating factor there right they want their health care paid for they want
[55:21.400 --> 55:28.600]  their college loans paid off and they want free college so yeah it's amazing that instead of
[55:28.600 --> 55:32.280]  actually paying them you know it's talking about well you're not going to have to pay for this or
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.080]  whatever so I guess that's what's really firing them but you know Bernie is really right about
[55:37.080 --> 55:44.920]  one giant issue one big issue and that's campaign finance campaign finance you know for anybody to
[55:44.920 --> 55:52.280]  run a us senate race or for anybody to run for us house race you know you gotta get you gotta
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.760]  get on that political casting couch here's the problem it's the same thing we've got with like
[55:56.760 --> 56:02.280]  the wall at the border I think that's the wrong solution to a real problem okay and you get the
[56:02.280 --> 56:07.080]  wrong solution when you don't understand what the source of the problem is we're gonna be talking to
[56:07.080 --> 56:13.160]  the vice president of the border patrol association in the next hour but when you don't understand
[56:13.160 --> 56:18.680]  that the situation at the border is because you're offering people amnesty and free tuition and all
[56:18.680 --> 56:23.640]  kinds of you know the welfare state and because of the war on drugs you're bringing in the violence
[56:23.640 --> 56:27.400]  and you've you've created these gangs when you don't understand the root cause then you're not
[56:27.400 --> 56:32.360]  going to come up with the right solution and the thing about campaign finance is that's an
[56:32.360 --> 56:37.320]  artificial construct that never works they'll always find a way around it because you have
[56:37.320 --> 56:43.480]  incentivize there's such an incentive for companies to buy access to Washington because there's so
[56:43.480 --> 56:48.760]  much money and power there that's the problem there's too much money and power in Washington
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.360]  that's the problem and you're never going to be able to solve it with some kind of artificial
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.920]  campaign finance reform that I'll never solve the problem you gotta get the power and the money
[56:56.920 --> 57:01.560]  out of Washington it's the corruption well then that's gotta be addressed because like I said
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.920]  if you're a us senator that these guys are all sold out yeah and that's don trump's thing too
[57:06.920 --> 57:10.760]  on the other side is he of course he's bringing his own money to the table
[57:10.760 --> 57:15.160]  and he talks about that these guys are sold out they they belong to their donors they're
[57:15.160 --> 57:19.640]  going to answer to their donors so uh but I want to shift into real quick before we out of time
[57:19.640 --> 57:23.640]  in this segment is talking about the current delegate count because that's one thing that
[57:23.640 --> 57:29.320]  we really need to watch folks uh trump has come out now with the delegates from Iowa and New
[57:29.320 --> 57:37.160]  Hampshire total up to 17 delegates and the total complete total with all the delegates for Iowa
[57:37.160 --> 57:45.480]  New Hampshire add up to 45 45 delegates so he's standing at 37 percent of the current delegates
[57:45.480 --> 57:50.680]  and as we talked about you mentioned earlier in the show about super delegates etc trump really
[57:50.680 --> 57:57.960]  needs to be going into Cleveland Ohio at the RNC in July with a 60 percent cash of delegates
[57:57.960 --> 58:01.080]  because of the games that are played with the super delegates that are part of the
[58:01.080 --> 58:05.560]  establishment both republicans and democrats we saw how they stacked that delegation that
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.320]  showed up saturday yeah and that's and that's why these establishment candidates other than
[58:11.320 --> 58:17.400]  marco rubio you've got chris christie you've got jeb bush you've got kasey they will not talk about
[58:17.400 --> 58:23.160]  hey get yourself to cleveland because they don't need to because it's always been just hey status
[58:23.160 --> 58:26.920]  quo for them yeah their people show up well we're going to continue with richard in the next

[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:17.560]  i lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way in defense of human liberty alex jones
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.640]  and i welcome back this segment we're gonna still talk to uh richard reeves our reporter who's
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.320]  been on the ground in new hampshire and i will gonna ask him a couple questions about what he
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:35.480]  thinks is ahead in south carolina of course uh then karsten didn't really campaign much in
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:40.200]  new hampshire he's going to be uh going to south carolina but of course cruise looks like he's
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.800]  going to become more of a factor in south carolina that's more conservative area than
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.280]  new hampshire he still came in in third place uh in new hampshire he claims that that was a win
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.840]  you know because i mean you know third place is a win for rubio and iowa right brown is the new
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:59.640]  gold well he came in third place i guess he had a win there but he will be more of a factor in
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:05.480]  south carolina absolutely uh i think that ted cruise actually is going to garner the number
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:12.360]  two position in primary voting barring barring black box voting being engaged and look for
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:19.480]  donald trump in the upcoming south carolina election to get up into the 40 percentage
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:27.160]  points i think that i think donald trump has been paying a retail politic penalty i think that
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:33.960]  like said in iowa retail politics ted cruise shaking hands in new hampshire john kasey
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:41.080]  shaking hands looking people in the eye uh they garnered the retail politic benefits well that's
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.760]  not going to be as big a factor certainly when you see something like chris christy calling up
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:51.320]  donald trump to talk to him uh that's a recognition by somebody who's probably a lot more savvy than
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:58.760]  say rick santorum in terms of the rick santorum endorsed rubio it's a lot more i think chris christy
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.680]  is a lot more politically savvy so it's kind of a recognition of him being far and away the front
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.800]  leader there i thought it was interesting uh in terms of talking about cruise i mean he is the
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:17.240]  consummate sneaky politician not only with what he did and as the iowa caucuses were were beginning
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.040]  telling people that he thought that carson would you know spreading the rumor that carson is going
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.480]  to be dropping out but then he went to uh new hampshire and he started telling people started
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.360]  raising expectations for marco rubio saying i think it's quite possible marco rubio might
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.240]  come in first well he'll be coming in in first place actually prior to the saturday debate
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.400]  that's how it looked that i think that was a real assessment by cruise because that's actually
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.720]  what i was saying really i didn't see that i need a poll oh yeah they were they were they were
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.680]  lavishing on marco rubio coming out of iowa remember said oh wow what a wonderful performance third
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:57.000]  place in iowa marco mentham marco mentham marco mentham but i never saw any polls where he was
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.040]  any closer than say 14 or 15 percent an actual polls i know the media was pushing it that way
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:08.280]  i know cruise was trying to build expectations that way but there was never any uh any evidence of
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:14.520]  of that in terms of any polls and as uh politico pointed out they they called uh his suggestion
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.320]  mischievous uh well but 14 15 percent in this particular race in new hampshire garner's in
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.680]  the third place over cruise if he gets the 14 or 15 percent so would have been another third for
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:30.520]  marco not much marco mentham there but uh well saturday knocked the wind out of marco sales
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.600]  but they're not done you know the new world order they've got you know we talked about the splitter
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:41.640]  strategy on a previous interview back in december with rob do the splitter strategy where the
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.160]  establishment basically they've got uh let's say chris christie drops out so we're talking about
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.400]  kasek bush rubio three establishment candidates and then you'll have trump and then cruise who
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.640]  we don't know who he's going to double cross somebody cruise is he's going to double cross
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.160]  the constitutionalists the patriots or he's going to double cross the money master the
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.280]  golden sacks the new world order we just don't know yet well i mean who do you think you would
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.520]  double cross you think he's going to double cross the money masters i mean he has brought in
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:16.520]  more money than uh pretty much anybody else on on that side except for for jeb okay in terms of
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.480]  big donations uh he's been right up there with jeb and hillary in terms of the money from the
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.520]  bankers and wall street and the super packs and that sort of thing well then it sounds like uh
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.480]  you know i think it's i think the people are going to get the shaft so are going to be the
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.680]  the mainstream conservative libertarian voters from the tag crews i don't think he's going to give
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.600]  the shaft to goldman sacks well if that's the case with the money then yes we're in trouble so
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.800]  potentially it's going to boil down to don trump versus four establishment people which we talked
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.600]  about the splitter strategy don trump needs to be getting 60 of the delegates the sooner that
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.560]  starts happening the better the sooner he starts getting over that 50 threshold in the primaries
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.680]  with the popular votes and the closer you can get to getting those thank you richard richard
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:06.840]  rage jr base with info wars.com anti-biance rally plan for next week at nfl headquarters controversial
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.880]  continues to swirl around Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime show performance the pop superstar is
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:17.640]  being accused of using her performance to attack police officers Beyonce and her dancers were wearing
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:22.600]  leather and black berets which was apparently a nod to the black panthers movement. one dance
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:27.800]  formation seemed to acknowledge malcolm x and other dancers had fists in the air which was
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:33.560]  reminiscent of the Black power salutes of the 1960s and 1970s.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.920]  Representative Peter King of New York told CBS2 that the NFL should have cancelled her
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920]  appearance.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.080]  I found the entire show objectionable.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.640]  Despite the criticism, Beyoncé has seen her sheriff supporters for her performance.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.440]  Black Lives Matter activist Melina Abdul appraise her for being like artists who are willing
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:55.240]  to raise social consciousness and use her artistry to advance social justice.

[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:06.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.280]  a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:16.960]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and we just have put up an article
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.520]  that Chris Christie has in fact dropped out of the race, you can see that at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.240]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.680]  Right now we're going to go to the Vice President of the Border Patrol Association and his name
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.360]  is Sean Moran.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.880]  He testified a year ago for Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee about the
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.880]  problems at the border, you know, we're all frustrated about what's going on with the
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.760]  open borders and no one is more frustrated about it than the Border Patrol itself, they're
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.480]  very angry about the fact that our government is essentially telling them to stand down,
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.720]  to release people that are coming into our country that are being intercepted, caught,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.360]  given court dates, they're not showing up.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.360]  So the response of the Obama administration was, well, let's just let them go because
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.880]  it looks bad when people don't show up to court.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:11.080]  We had an article last week from the President of the National Border Patrol Council who
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:17.040]  said we might as well abolish our immigration laws and that's true, we might as well just
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.320]  do that I guess if we're not going to enforce that, but that's essentially what our President
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.200]  has done by executive order.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.880]  He has essentially abolished our immigration laws.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.640]  So we're going to talk to Sean Moran again, he is the Vice President of the National
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:38.240]  Border Patrol Council, you can find him at BPUnion.org, you can get information about
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:46.320]  this, the council that he's part of, and they represent Border Patrol officers who are the
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.640]  front line on the border and they are very, very concerned about what they see happening,
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.400]  very frustrated about this, actually they represent 18,000 Border Patrol agents and
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.920]  support personnel assigned to the U.S. border.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:04.680]  So joining us now is Sean Moran, thank you for speaking to us Mr. Moran.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.720]  Oh thanks for having me, it's good to be back on the show.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.400]  Now we've got a lot of people concerned about what's going on, we see what's happening,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.560]  I was just in the Big Bend region with my wife last week and of course we, as we were
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.480]  there, we got the Rio Grande, a very narrow shallow river as we were walking around a
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:29.440]  canyon there, went around a corner, there was a guy who was serenading us on the other
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.360]  side, a Mexican guy, he had a tip jar on the American side, they're going back and forth
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:39.000]  very easily with that, and yet there was no presence in terms of Border Patrol there as
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.280]  we left the park, about 40 miles north of the park, there was a permanent station set
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.200]  up on one of the roads going north and they were just asking people, are you an American
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200]  citizen?
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.480]  And we'd say, yeah, you know, they'd say, well go ahead, what does that accomplish?
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.680]  Do you, are you frustrated by that kind of approach?
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:05.000]  Well, we are because that is part of our defense in depth, but we've forgotten about certain
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.160]  parts of the strategy, under Operation Gatekeeper, Operation Hold the Line in El Paso that all
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.160]  started in the mid to late 90s, you're supposed to have agents at the border, stopping people
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.160]  from coming in, apprehending the ones that are there, you have those permanent checkpoints
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:27.680]  that you referenced, and those are set up so that we can interdict people and drugs
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.960]  on the way to major cities in the US, and then we're supposed to have Interior Patrol,
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.120]  unfortunately you don't have Border Patrol agents going out there doing that, it's been
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:43.880]  delegated away to ICE, and ICE seems more interested in doing other types of activity
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.640]  that don't really relate to immigration enforcement.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.840]  Yeah, I mean, there's another one that we encountered close to Corpus Christi, there's
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.680]  a couple of different roads that we can go south from Austin to Corpus Christi, and as
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:02.200]  we go down one route down, there's no permanent station, and another route that's coming up,
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:07.800]  there is a permanent station, so I would assume that the drug cartels know where these permanent
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.080]  locations are, I wouldn't think that would be very effective.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:17.160]  Yeah, obviously the permanent ones are well known, and we try to set up what are called
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.800]  tactical checkpoints where we give little notice and we put them up so that we can hopefully
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.960]  interdict people.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:32.440]  We've found that the temporary checkpoints are far more effective than permanent checkpoints
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.520]  on every road because they will just find a way around them, so the effectiveness is
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.200]  definitely cut down if they're open all the time, if you can randomize it and use them
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.720]  to help apprehend and interdict drugs and people, then they're far more effective.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.800]  Just from our perspective, I mean, it just seems like there are these stations that
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.080]  are set up that don't really do anything except harass American citizens, and yet there's
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.400]  no presence at the actual border itself from our perspective.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.960]  Well, it's two different things because you have stations that are checkpoint stations,
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:19.240]  that's all they do, but then you also have stations that work the border itself.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:26.280]  Both types of stations are undermanned, and at any one time you could have, depending
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:32.600]  on how many linear miles of border you have, it could be quite a bit of territory that
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:39.160]  you have to cover, so you can't see a border patrol agent linking arms from Brownsville
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.160]  to San Diego.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.160]  Right, right.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.000]  I'm not sure that could ever happen.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.200]  Well, there's a lot of frustration with the public, I mean, looking at the response from
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.880]  the exit polls and the election that we saw yesterday in New Hampshire, it was a big issue
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.320]  in New Hampshire, and New Hampshire is a long way from the border, but you had 63% of Republican
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.320]  New Hampshire voters that said a candidate would need to agree with them on immigration,
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.840]  and what they said was 86% of them said illegal immigrants had broken the law, should be penalized,
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:15.600]  83% said illegal immigrants harm national security, more than 75% said that illegal immigrants
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.040]  were driving down wages.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.520]  So even in a northern state like New Hampshire, as far away from the border, because most
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.000]  of this is happening with the southern border, they're very concerned about it.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.200]  They feel that it is something that, when they talk about harming national security,
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.960]  they're concerned that terrorist organizations are going to come in, drug gangs are going
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.480]  to come in, they feel that it's driving down wages.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.400]  So there's frustration that nothing is being done, but I understand you're frustrated as
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.800]  well because you've got an administration that has decided that they're essentially going
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.560]  to abolish the immigration laws by executive order, and that's what the president of the
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.200]  National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd, said last week.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.520]  He said, we might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:06.080]  You've got a policy where they are telling you that you have to release people because
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.480]  they're not showing up to court.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.320]  Just let them go and do not track them.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]  Talk to us about that.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.160]  Well, first let me say, I believe immigration affects every community in this country, and
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:22.720]  I think that's why we see such importance in the current presidential elections and in
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.840]  places like New Hampshire.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.680]  New Hampshire knows about the borders.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:33.800]  They have, I believe it's over 100 miles of border with Canada, so they know what it's
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]  like.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.560]  They know the threat is real, that people can slip across the Canadian border just as easily,
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.760]  probably easier than they can with the US-Mexico border.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:51.080]  But the Obama administration getting back to that, they have enacted executive actions
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:57.800]  and policies that have gutted our immigration enforcement, and it runs counter to what the
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.080]  American people want.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:05.520]  I think over the past 10 years, we have seen an increase in awareness of the border, support
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.520]  for border patrol agents, support for immigration enforcement, and that's just not happening
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.520]  because we are carving out whole sections of the law and throwing them away so that
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.600]  border patrol agents are effectively handcuffed and unable to do their job as they're supposed
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.600]  to do.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:30.120]  One of the things that they're doing now in this new policy from Obama is you're looking
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:34.920]  at people and say that, well, as long as they don't have a previous felony arrest conviction,
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:41.000]  as long as they claim to have been continuously in the United States since January of 2014,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  you have to release them.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.920]  And of course, the point is they can just claim that they've been here.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.000]  They don't have to prove that in any way.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.440]  That's absolutely amazing.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.840]  That really is just shutting down the border, the immigration laws.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.680]  Yeah, I would agree with you.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.600]  I think it's irresponsible.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.440]  Anytime we have any type of curtailment of enforcement or we have a new policy that might
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.480]  restrict something we can do, previous to our current, I'll use this as an example,
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:19.880]  our current pursuit policy when we have criminals that are trying to abscond in a vehicle.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:25.100]  During the 1990s and early 2000s, we basically had no pursuit policy.
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:31.720]  If anybody committed any type of traffic infraction or failed to stop for a border patrol vehicle,
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.360]  we were ordered to shut down the pursuit, turn around and go the other way.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.080]  And we often left other agencies holding the bag on that.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.360]  If it crashed and burned or people were killed in the pursuit, other agencies had to clean
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.240]  up the mess.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.280]  And that is just wrong.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.160]  This is an immigration violation.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.000]  It may be a Homeland Security violation or a customs violation.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.760]  And that's our responsibility to deal with.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.400]  So it shouldn't be agencies like the Texas Rangers or Arizona DPS or California Highway
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.680]  Patrol that have to deal with criminals like this that are fleeing through their towns.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:17.200]  So these groups, these smuggling organizations know very quickly what our restrictions are,
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:22.080]  how far we can go, what we can do, how we respond, and they will exploit that.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.480]  And we're seeing that in South Texas with all the unaccompanied minors and the family
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.400]  groups that are coming across.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:36.160]  This is a huge payday for the cartels because they are able to use them as cover to distract
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.720]  and preoccupy Border Patrol agents, and then they're able to run the people and drugs and
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.280]  weapons and whatever they want.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.760]  It could be potential terrorists across the Rio Grande, basically unimpeded.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.960]  We're seeing different stories from the press.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:58.880]  We see the liberal media saying, oh, well, the number of crossings has declined from
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.000]  a month ago.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  Yet we've seen Governor Abbott and Democrat Congressman Henry Quellar asking Obama
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.240]  why the number of Border Patrol agents are being cut in half, and they point out that
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.160]  if you look at a three or four month period, it's up 170% versus a year ago.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.360]  You can cherry pick data and things are going to go up or down based on weather, based on
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.200]  holiday seasons, that sort of thing.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.360]  And that's what the liberal press is doing.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.840]  They're cherry picking that.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:34.280]  But when you look at a few months, you've got both Republicans and Democrats saying,
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.640]  you've got a 170% increase, and yet you're cutting the number of Border Patrol agents
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640]  by 50%.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.320]  When we come back, we're going to continue talking to Sean Moran.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.760]  I want to get your feedback on that.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.160]  Again, it's a bipartisan concern about what's going on at the border.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:59.280]  We'll be right back with Sean Moran, and he is with the National Border Patrol Council.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.880]  Today more than ever, it's imperative that you protect your digital privacy.

[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.240]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because

[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.880]  at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.920]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.680]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.120]  immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.400]  Since poor diet, injuries, or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.400]  inflammation.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.200]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200]  is glutathione.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.400]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.200]  Hi, my name is Jason, I'm 44 years old.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.360]  For 10 years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.680]  down into my feet.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.160]  After three weeks on one roadway, the pain in my feet reduced by 50 percent and the overall
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.800]  pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.360]  I ran out of one roadway and the pain returned.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.520]  I got another container and again after three weeks, the pain reduced significantly throughout
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]  my body.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.920]  I highly recommend one roadway to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.

[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:09.760]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.640]  I'm David Knight and we've been talking to Sean Moran.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.440]  He's the Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.920]  When we look at the election results in New Hampshire, we look at the strong showing of
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.320]  Donald Trump.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.760]  The key factor in Donald Trump's rise has been the public's frustration with open borders
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.760]  and how that's been shut down.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.760]  And of course, it's not just the public's frustration with it.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.000]  The border patrol is frustrated with this.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.880]  They're very concerned about what's going on.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.680]  I want to play for you real quickly a clip from the Border Patrol talking about how they're
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.680]  essentially completing the smuggling process.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.800]  Let me ask you about this.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:51.760]  When you say that the federal government is aiding in a bedding, it sounds like they're
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.000]  supposed to be protecting this border.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  You mean aiding in a bedding.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.320]  What do you mean specifically?
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.760]  Actually, what's happening is that the federal government is actually completing the smuggling
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:02.000]  cycle.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.920]  By having a parent sending their child to the U.S. border, having them smuggled, that
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.400]  is only part of the smuggling cycle.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.280]  When it comes to the federal government steps in, we apprehend them, we process these illegal
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.120]  agents, and then we release them to their family members in the U.S. We just completed
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.240]  that smuggling cycle.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.160]  Now, why would anybody want to hire a smuggler when the U.S. government is actually doing
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160]  it for free?
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160]  Exactly.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160]  Now, that's Hector Garza.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.880]  He's a Border Patrol agent.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.840]  We're talking to the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, Sean Moran.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.320]  Just as we went to break, we were talking about the plans by the feds to cut border
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.400]  monitoring by half, and the governor here in Texas, as well as Democrat Congressman
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:49.160]  Henry Cuellar, they're in a border area of Texas, are asking why.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.920]  We see a 170% increase from a year ago in terms of the number of crossings.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.920]  Go ahead.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:04.720]  2014 was the highest year, and then 2015 was surprisingly the second highest year that
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:07.560]  they've seen in the Rio Grande Valley.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.760]  But to listen to the Obama administration and to summon the media, you would think that
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.080]  everything was under control in 2015.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:20.720]  But historically, it was a very high year, but it wasn't as high as 2014, so it was
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:21.720]  a non-story.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.680]  But now the numbers are higher than 2014.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.920]  We don't know if that will continue.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.560]  We don't know why it has dropped a bit.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:34.680]  But even with the dropping, our agents are still overwhelmed in the Rio Grande Valley
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:40.360]  and need the assistance, we're not sending agents down there currently on a temporary
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:45.360]  duty status, and we believe that the manpower needs to be supplemented and that we need
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.640]  to continue to enforce the border down there and try to regain control.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:55.600]  Now, you testified about a year ago, February 4th, 2015, you testified before the U.S. Senate's
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.400]  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:04.200]  You were talking about what had, at that point, was the recent push towards amnesty
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.920]  by the Obama administration.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.560]  Tell us about your concerns with that and how you see that exacerbating the situation.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:19.560]  Well, anytime we talk about amnesty or immigration reform or any type of adjustment in our immigration
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.880]  policies, we see an increase out in the field of people coming across, and it comes through
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.080]  all our different sectors, primarily along the southwest border, but we still see some
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.440]  on the Canadian border as well.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:39.200]  So it puts our people in danger, and I think what Mr. Garza was also referencing is the
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.000]  fact that we are giving people exactly what they want, and we've created no disincentive
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.720]  for them to come to the United States.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.680]  If they know that they are going to be released into the United States, which was their goal
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:56.240]  in the first place, that word is going to spread, and we believe that's why we're seeing
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:02.720]  more unaccompanied minors again and more families coming through the Rio Grande Valley from
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:05.280]  Central America, and we said that in 2014.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.840]  We said we need to hold these people pending their hearings, and if they're allowed to
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.320]  stay by an immigration judge, that's fine.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.960]  They're then following the law, but if they're not, they need to be removed from the country.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.560]  They can't be given a notice to appear and a court date that may be two years down the
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.000]  road, because one, they're never going to show up, and two, the word is going to spread
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.880]  that, hey, we're going to be here in America for at least a few years.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.200]  You might as well come up from Honduras or whatever country they're coming from at that
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]  time.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.880]  Well, of course, we've incentivized them coming, and that's what the amnesty does.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.960]  We give, and that's my concern about it.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.880]  I would like to be able to move about freely.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.840]  I don't want to be carted when I move about in my country within the borders, or I would
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.680]  prefer not even to be carted really honestly as I'm crossing a border.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.160]  I mean, we used to not have that kind of a situation.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.880]  It is a function of the fact that we've created a welfare state, and once we create a massive
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:06.280]  welfare state, an entitlement state, and say that we're going to extend those benefits
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.200]  to people who are not citizens, we cannot sustain that in this country.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:15.640]  We cannot provide a free education to anyone who wants to come here from wherever in the
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:21.400]  world, give them benefits that are superior even to people who have lived here all of
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.320]  their lives, paid taxes all of their lives.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.120]  There's no way that we can sustain that.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.960]  You understand that even if you don't see the tax bill, if you're a renter, you may
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.080]  not see the itemization, but it's the schools that are one of the key things that you're
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.920]  paying for in your property taxes.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.400]  You're not going to be able to afford a home if we're going to provide free education to
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.880]  everyone from every country in the world without any qualification, without any control.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.680]  We'll be right back with Sean Moran.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.040]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:59.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:04.120]  Leftist media labels, Trump supporters, racist, sexist zombies after New Hampshire win, vitriolic
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.640]  headlines, highlight, unhinged sentiment.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.560]  Article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:13.360]  Some trounce nearest contender John Kasich taking 34% of the vote with establishment
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.080]  favor Marco Rubio lagging behind in fifth place.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.920]  The Huffington Post exploded with resentment.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.440]  Running the headline, New Hampshire goes racist, sexist, homophobic and huge red capital letters.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.520]  A short time later, the headline was changed to WTF GOP.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.080]  This was just the latest salvo in the publication's long-running feud with Trump.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.920]  It had previously relegated news stories about him to the entertainment section.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.760]  Last month, the Huffington Post took the unprecedented step of adding a note to the bottom of every
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.640]  article about Trump, which described him as a liar, a racist and a xenophobe.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:53.480]  However, not to be outdone, the New York Daily News reacted to Trump's win by portraying
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.280]  the business mogul as a clown.

[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.240]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.560]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.040]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:13.280]  health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.920]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.200]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.360]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.080]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.000]  your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.560]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:08.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:15.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.120]  I'm David Knight and we've been talking to Sean Moran.
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.000]  He's vice president of the National Border Patrol Council.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.120]  As we pointed out last week, the president of the Border Patrol Council said, the way
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.840]  the Obama administration is moving in the new directions that they've given us to release
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:36.520]  people if they claim that they've been here since January 2014.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:37.960]  They don't have to substantiate that.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.240]  If they don't have any felonies, we have to release them and we cannot track them.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.920]  And so that kind of frustration, we're all frustrated with what we see in terms of the
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.240]  open borders, but certainly the Border Patrol itself is frustrated with this.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:56.240]  I mean, clearly the public frustration with what's going on is what is behind the massive
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.560]  rise of Donald Trump.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.920]  That has been his key issue from the very beginning and we've got to do something about
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.920]  the border.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:07.000]  If we don't have a border, we don't have a nation and quite frankly, as long as we've
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.760]  got a welfare state, as I was saying in the last segment, if we've got a welfare state
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.840]  and we're not going to control access to that welfare state, but we're going to open it
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.400]  up to the entire world and we're going to give them access to free education and other
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:26.000]  issues, we will cease to exist not only just as a national entity, but we will bankrupt
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  ourselves.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  And of course, that's a plan.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.320]  Socialists came out with that plan back in the 1960s.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.840]  A couple of socialist economists, Claude and Piven, said that's what we need to do.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:38.640]  We need to tear down America so we can then rebuild it into a socialist utopia.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:44.820]  The way we're going to do that is by offering an expanded welfare state that bankrupts the
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:45.820]  system.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:53.240]  I want to go back to Officer Moran and talk to him about what is ahead with this.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.200]  But before we do, I want to let you know about a couple of specials that we've got that
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.400]  are ending today at infowarslife.com.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.440]  Of course, we have our new product, Anthroplex.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.720]  We've had an introductory sell with that.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.920]  If you buy that along with supermail vitality, you get both of those for 15% off plus free
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:10.920]  shipping.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:14.480]  And again, they are designed to work together to complement each other.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:20.160]  Mail vitality are liquid formulation of ingredients in this new twice daily pill formulation,
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.160]  Anthroplex.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:26.720]  We also have another sale that is ending today, Silver Bullet, 15% off that ends tonight.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.080]  And again, with both of those, you get an additional 10% off if you choose to get auto
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.200]  ship, which means that you will not run out of supply.

[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.800]  that you'll get that.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.040]  And we will also give you an additional 10%.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:47.440]  We have a new special as well, 15% off Prostagard.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.880]  That is a key supplement for men as you get older.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:57.920]  It has a blend of salt, palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium,
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.880]  copper, and many other key ingredients.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.400]  Again, 15% off Prostagard.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.960]  And that is a new special that's just starting, but the special for Silver Bullet and Anthroplex
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:13.520]  and Supermail Vitality together, 15% off those two sales will end tonight.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.800]  Now, Officer Moran is, we're looking at this, one of the things that, you know, clearly
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.760]  it's not sustainable from an economic situation if we're just going to have open borders and
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.800]  we're going to have amnesty and we're going to let everyone come here and get a free education.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.520]  But the other issue is what's going on with war on drugs.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.720]  And whether it's an intended or an unintended consequence, we've seen the rise of these very
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:40.040]  dangerous gains in Mexico, talk to us about the concerns that the Border Patrol has and
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:47.400]  what you face in terms of MS-13 and some of these very, very vicious and violent gains
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.480]  that have been fostered by the war on drugs in Mexico.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.480]  The drug war obviously is a very profitable enterprise for these cartels.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:02.120]  They are businesses and they are looking to get product to the United States to fuel the
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.120]  demand.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.720]  And so, they're willing to do whatever it takes, including kill Border Patrol agents
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.480]  to get their drugs across.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:15.160]  And one of the trends that we're seeing is a decrease in the amount of marijuana that
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:23.840]  we're encountering, yet the numbers of seizures of coke and heroin, methamphetamine, while
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:30.080]  the numbers aren't going up, the total weight that we're catching per seizure has almost
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:37.520]  doubled, where it was pretty rare to see 20 to 30 pounds of cocaine, methamphetamine
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:44.360]  or heroin, we're now routinely seeing 50, 60, even sometimes 70 pounds in vehicle loads.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:49.640]  I find that interesting because, you know, of course, the reason that marijuana is declining
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.320]  is because I think it's been legalized in several different Western states.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.040]  And so, now there is a legal alternative to this.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.480]  And so, we see the profit center for the, if you want to call them that, the mafia,
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.760]  the drug mafia, is now declining, just as we saw with the alcohol prohibition.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.120]  You had it run by the gangs like Al Capone.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.760]  And then when it became legalized, they had to move to different areas.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.440]  They didn't go away.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:21.440]  They moved into different areas because once you create these monsters, they tend to hang
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.440]  around.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.200]  So, they've got other things, other games that they can get into, like human trafficking,
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.480]  of course, that's one aspect of it that's very dangerous.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.800]  But these gangs are far more dangerous than the old Al Capone gangs.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.960]  I mean, we look at the number of people that have been killed in Mexico with a war on drugs.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.080]  We look at the tactics that they use with beheadings.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:44.000]  I mean, talk to us about the concerns and the things that you face as board patrol agents
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.720]  when you confront these violent gangs because you're out in areas where you really don't,
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.440]  you've got issues in terms of communication.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:57.720]  They're patrolling very remote areas, over large areas, and it's difficult to get back
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.640]  up in some cases, isn't it?
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:01.640]  That's correct.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:07.320]  The hiring announcements when we are recruiting board of patrol agents specifically spell
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:13.920]  out that you will often work at night alone in remote areas far from back up.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:17.840]  There's been times that it's not uncommon for board of patrol agents to be 90 minutes
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.680]  away by vehicle from their nearest backup.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.680]  Wow.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:25.520]  You are always outnumbered when dealing with the cartels.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:32.480]  You're very often outgunned, and you're working areas like outside of Ajo, Arizona, and in
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.920]  the Big Bend National Park, which are very remote, very rough terrain.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.200]  So it's a very difficult job.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.560]  It's a very dangerous job.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:46.640]  We've lost 120 agents in the line of duty since 1924, and most of those have occurred.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.080]  The majority of them have occurred since the implementation of our forward deployed strategy
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:55.680]  under Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold the Line.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.800]  It's the sort of thing too that it seems like it's increasing the violence in Mexico that's
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.200]  based on the drug war.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:07.400]  I know that my son and the church that we were involved in in North Carolina before we
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:14.080]  moved out here to Texas, they would do regular mission trips down to Mexico.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.560]  In Bordertown there, things got so difficult to that orphanage that they stopped the trips
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:24.040]  with the younger people going down there to help them because it got too dangerous on
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.920]  the Mexican side, and yet we're seeing that kind of violence spill over into Texas as
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920]  well.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.640]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.120]  When I'm asked about going to Mexico, they ask where they should go and what's the safest
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120]  place.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.480]  I tell them the safest course of action is not to go.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:48.320]  I know most Border Patrol agents will not go down to Mexico, and I've seen many NGOs
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:54.000]  such as church groups stop some of these service trips because of the violence that takes place.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.240]  But now we're seeing it in America, and it's not just Texas, it's Arizona, it's California.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.560]  If we do not take the threat seriously, we will continue to see things like this, and
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.320]  we need to crack down on the cartels and any type of operations that they're conducting
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320]  north of the border.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:16.880]  Well, let me ask you, because this all plays a very, very big part in the elections that
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:23.120]  we're looking at here, as everybody knows, is what's behind the rise of Donald Trump.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.680]  We look at the things that are driving the violence.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.160]  Again, when we see that marijuana is legalized in several states out west, all of a sudden
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.600]  they stop bringing marijuana across, but then they move to something else that's illegal
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.600]  at that point.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.960]  If they stop the war on drugs, I'm assuming that they will move to human trafficking,
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.960]  something else like that.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:46.080]  But what do you think is the solution to this?
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:50.680]  Do you think that a wall at the border is going to be something as practical, or are
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.560]  there going to be ways to go under it, over it, around it to bribe their way through it?
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:59.520]  Well, I hope it won't be the last one.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:05.240]  I think it would, I'd be very disappointed if Border Patrol agents were to succumb to
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.880]  corruption to allow people through the fence.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:15.360]  Many of the corruption cases we see within CBP occur at ports of entry, but that's not
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.840]  to say that we haven't had corrupt Border Patrol agents.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.800]  I just hope that we can root out those that are going to be corrupt and get them out of
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.640]  the Border Patrol so that the public does have faith in us.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:33.080]  But when it comes to the fence, the fence is one tool that we have in our proverbial
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.080]  toolbox.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.960]  If you build a 20-foot fence, the smugglers are going to build a 21-foot ladder.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.680]  And in fact, they have that someone that we call the ladder man.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:48.520]  When you're working in an urban area or an area that has the double-layer fence, when
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:53.680]  the human smugglers try to bring a group across, they have one man whose sole job is to carry
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.680]  the ladder.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.560]  It's usually made out of rebar, and he hooks it on the secondary fence, and the group goes
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:02.120]  up and over, and he brings the fence back to Mexico.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:11.120]  They know how to counter our operations and try to exploit any seam that they find.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:14.280]  So the fence is just one part of the overall strategy.
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.400]  It has been fantastic at stopping vehicle loads from coming across the border.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.040]  It has almost eliminated that.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:27.720]  But in terms of human smuggling, it is a speed bump that slows it down, allows agents in
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:33.120]  our more urban areas like San Diego, Nogales, anywhere that there's a city and you have
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.560]  infrastructure right near the city, it has helped slow down the human traffic.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.400]  I think the real solution is, and it's one that Washington doesn't want to talk about,
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.880]  and very few legislators actually want us to do, and that's by policy.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:56.080]  And that is to go out and fully enforce our authority and go out and do our job.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.200]  And both parties are to blame, they have their own reasons why they want us to look effective
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.640]  without actually being effective.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:09.800]  And I think it really lies within the policy and taking the leash off of the border patrol
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:15.000]  and immigration officers to go out there and let us enforce the immigration laws of the
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  United States.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  I agree, I agree.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.520]  I think enforcement is part of it.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.880]  But I think the key thing is the way that our government is currently incentivizing
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:28.160]  us, and of course, you pointed that out when you testified in the Senate a year ago.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:32.080]  I mean, when you, people, as you pointed out in your testimony, you said in deciding
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.080]  whether or not to attempt to enter the country illegally, individuals are going to weigh
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.560]  the risks and the potential rewards, and what we have done under the Obama administration
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.320]  is we have really ramped up the potential rewards, and we have reduced the risks down
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.320]  to zero.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.080]  Well, I wouldn't say the risks are zero because it is a very dangerous journey.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:02.040]  So the risks are more physical, crossing a river, drowning in the river, being assaulted,
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.440]  any type of criminal activity that could happen in Mexico as you're transiting through the
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:10.320]  country to get to the United States.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:15.920]  But we need to have tough enforcement here at home, and we need to allow our people to
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.680]  go out and do their jobs, and that's why the 21,000 Border Patrol agents that are out there
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.120]  are frustrated, morale is low, because they're not being allowed to do the job that these
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.240]  very patriotic Americans thought they were going to be able to do.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:36.800]  So it is disheartening for Border Patrol agents, and we continue to hire them, and we question
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.160]  why anyone would want to come into a job like this right now when you're not allowed to
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:49.160]  do it, and our own president and his administration seem to be doing everything to counter Border
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.760]  Patrol agents and to limit our effectiveness.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.880]  They seem to be doing everything they can to counter our ability to earn a living.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.240]  I mean, we've got workers being imported, we've got jobs being exported, we've got borders
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.160]  being taken down left and right, and yeah, you're right.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:12.200]  There are no, it's not a zero risk, I was thinking of it in terms of zero legal risk
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.920]  once they get into the country, he's basically reduced that to nothing, so we're not going
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:20.320]  to have you up here at court anymore, we're not going to track you, you're free to go.
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:25.640]  You made it across the border, and let's talk about that, because we see all this about
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:31.440]  minors who are coming across, but of course, minors can be people who are maybe even MS-13
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:39.280]  gang members who are up to 18 years old, and yet we see this being portrayed as eight-year-olds
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.400]  who are showing up at the border with their teddy bears.
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.960]  Is that really the case, and that they're coming here as totally unaccompanied minors?
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:53.400]  I mean, are parents turning their kids over to human traffic smugglers, or is it not happening
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.720]  in the numbers that we've been told in the press?
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.720]  It really runs the whole spectrum.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.800]  You do see the ones that are truly unaccompanied minors, most times they are with an older
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:11.840]  cousin or an uncle that may be a teenager, so they most are accompanied by someone that
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:18.560]  they know, but there are cases where in some extreme cases, very young children are being
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:24.480]  turned over to smugglers and being put in this very dangerous position, riding the train
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.600]  known as the Beast to get to the northern border of Mexico and try to cross into the
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.960]  United States.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:37.440]  So it is a very dangerous situation, but it's not all three-year-olds with their teddy
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.960]  bears like you mentioned.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:43.120]  It is anywhere from babies all the way up to 18-year-olds.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.800]  Yeah, because it's not really, we're not going to say, a lot of these immigrants are not
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.760]  just coming from Mexico or not just coming across the border from Mexico.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:55.160]  A lot of these that are coming through here are from Central America, so they've got
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.400]  a very long journey.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.400]  They're not going to make that as an unaccompanied minor.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.640]  I mean, they've got to have some family members, but I guess technically they're unaccompanied
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.600]  if they don't have their mother and father with them.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.800]  They could have an extended family member with them, but they would still be considered
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.120]  to be an unaccompanied minor.
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:12.000]  Is that correct?
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  That's correct.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.840]  We're seeing all sorts of situations in terms of family relations and who's bringing them
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:19.840]  here.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.560]  It's not just Central Americans and it's not just Mexicans.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:28.240]  We're seeing an increase in Cubans trying to get to the southern border prior to any
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:33.440]  possible adjustment in their immigration situation.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.760]  We're also seeing people from the Middle East.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:41.840]  There is a definite pathway from the Middle East, a smuggling route that is ending up
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.200]  on our southern border.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:48.760]  We're seeing that from San Diego sector all the way to the Rio Grande Valley sector.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:51.880]  It's a concern for us, so it's not just South Texas.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:57.760]  We're seeing it throughout the border right now, Central Americans, Cubans, and people
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.280]  from Syria, from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:07.040]  You name it, we are seeing it and we're doing our best to go out there and make sure that
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.040]  they're arrested.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.120]  And that's what our reporters have seen when they went to the border.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.320]  We saw a sign that was in multiple languages.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.960]  I think even Chinese was there.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.000]  You've got Chinese people coming through the border as well, don't you?
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.560]  Yeah, we've had Chinese coming for many years, as long as I've been in the Border Patrol.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.680]  About once or twice a year, my station in Southern California, we would catch somebody
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.040]  from China and it happens throughout.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:38.480]  You see it on the northern border as well and our agents will arrest anybody that is
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480]  here illegally.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:41.120]  It doesn't matter what country you're from.
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:44.840]  How does it kind of break down in terms of people coming across the border?
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:49.480]  You know, if somebody's coming from China, a lot of those people might just come with
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:55.640]  an airplane ticket and just overstay their visa or whatever.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:01.080]  But how does that break down in terms of people who are directly crossing the border
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:06.200]  surreptitiously versus people who are coming in with a plane?
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:09.840]  And is most of the traffic that's coming across the border, is there a much higher
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:17.280]  percentage of that that is drug cartel related and how does it break down in terms of people
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.320]  who are just coming here as immigrants who want to live?
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:28.320]  Well, if you can get here on some type of visa and then overstay that visa, you're going
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320]  to do that.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:35.080]  But primarily on the southern border, it is mostly Mexican because of the proximity where
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.040]  we're on the border with Mexico.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.480]  So it makes sense that we're going to see the majority of them from Mexico.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:48.880]  But we will see people from all over the world make their way to Mexico in the hopes of crossing
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.040]  into the United States.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  Stay with us.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.040]  We're going to be right back.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:59.000]  We're talking to Sean Moran, Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.360]  Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high speed
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:08.520]  DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat skills
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.320]  you'll need when it hits the fan.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:14.520]  Go to DrivenDVD.com, DrivenDVD.com.

[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:30.320]  This is Dan Billard.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.880]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.440]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:36.280]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:38.480]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.520]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.520]  case.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:47.160]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:50.960]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:04.200]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:09.640]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.640]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:19.800]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:25.480]  of their own, air raid sirens, but in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:31.120]  quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, and the lining of plastics that destroy
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:36.320]  our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:42.200]  I personally counter this onslaught with InfoWarsLife.com, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:31.160]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:34.320]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:36.640]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:39.640]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.640]  His excuse?
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.800]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.400]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:48.360]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.360]  my father.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.360]  Don't wait.
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.000]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  ones.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  I'm David Knight.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.520]  I'm speaking to the Vice President of the Border Patrol Council, and we're asking him
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.600]  about the frustrations of his job.
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.560]  Of course, the frustrations that we all have with the open borders and the consequences
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:27.600]  of it are what are really driving the forces behind the support of Donald Trump.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.160]  That's what we see happening.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:35.600]  But we've seen the Border Patrol Council complaining that what Obama is doing in terms
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:42.800]  of incentivizing open borders in terms of taking away the penalties involved with this,
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.000]  they said this is essentially just striking down the immigration laws.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.880]  So I want to go back and continue asking him what he thinks the solution is to this.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.920]  But before I do, I just want to quickly want to let you know about a couple of specials
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.040]  that are going to be ending today at infowarslife.com.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:02.880]  Again, our introductory special for Anthroplex, the formulation that synergistically works
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.240]  with supermail vitality.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.240]  That is ending today.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:09.880]  If you get the two of those together, you get 15% off plus free shipping.
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.800]  Also silver bullet, 15% off plus free shipping.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:18.880]  And with either of those, you can also get 10% off if you sign up for auto-ship.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.720]  Those both of those are ending today.
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:26.120]  We have a new special also that is beginning today, and that is 15% off of Prostagard.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:30.840]  Again, you can find all of those at infowarslife.com.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:37.440]  Now, Mr. Moran, as we're looking at this, and we look at the frustration that you feel,
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:44.560]  that we feel, we have, again, this situation, and it's not just Republicans who are concerned
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  about this.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:51.680]  We've got a Democrat congressman who is on the border there from Laredo, Henry Quellar,
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.720]  talking with Governor Abbott concern.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:56:00.200]  They sent a letter to DHS Secretary Jay Johnson, said the cut to the requested 3,850 hours
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:07.400]  of aerial detection monitoring in 2016 amounts to a 50% less coverage than in recent years.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.520]  Here we look at this, and people who are concerned about this, who try to portray this as families
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:21.200]  that are being split, criticize, or policy criticize, or border patrol, and yet Mexico
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.320]  and these other countries are not opening up their border for open immigration.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.480]  They're not offering free college tuition and welfare to the people who come into their
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:30.480]  country.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:36.280]  I don't really understand the resentment from many of the people who think that we shouldn't
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.240]  be patrolling our borders, that we shouldn't have some say so, if we're going to offer
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:42.400]  a welfare state on this side.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:48.040]  Yeah, I think if you stop patrolling your borders, you cease to be a nation, and every
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:55.360]  nation that is a sovereign nation has the right to defend itself and patrol its borders.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:01.080]  Well, it is frustrating to us that we're just being placed out there basically as human
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.680]  scarecrows.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:08.920]  We think we need to be stronger in our enforcement, and it all comes down to policy, and President
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:15.000]  Obama has shown that by his executive actions and by restricting the border patrols effectiveness
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  through policy.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.520]  Yeah, that's a good point to say that you're out there as human scarecrows.
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.760]  I guess you really must feel like that when you say that your backup can be as far away
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:30.680]  as 90 minutes, you don't get any support for the job that you do once you interdict somebody
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.560]  that might be coming across the border.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:36.920]  If you can't prove that they're a known felon, if they don't have a record in the United
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:42.080]  States, even though all indications may look like they're an MS-13 gang member, you have
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:43.080]  to let them go, right?
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.640]  If you don't have a prior conviction, they could have all the MS-13 gang tattoos on,
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:51.240]  and now one of the new rules, you would just have to let them go.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.800]  That's correct, unless we witness them illegally enter the country, and they claim that they're
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:01.920]  here since January 1st of 2014, we have to let them go, and one of the other things that
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:07.640]  is very frustrating, in very few jurisdictions along the border, and in most cases, we've
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.640]  had to go to the local DAs.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:16.040]  If you take a shot, or I shouldn't say take a shot, but if you try to assault a border
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:20.640]  patrol agent, if you try to punch a border patrol agent while he's trying to arrest you,
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.960]  this is one of the few jurisdictions in the United States where you may not be arrested
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:26.960]  for that.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.480]  You may not be charged with that.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.480]  That's amazing.
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:33.480]  It is really, I know it must be a very, very frustrating job for you.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:37.320]  Thank you so much for the work that you do, and thank you for talking to Sean Moran, Vice
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:40.520]  President of the National Council of Border Patrol Agents.
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:49.040]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:53.240]  Being pure drinking water, you can't survive without it, but where do you get it?
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:58.160]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:58:59.160]  like no other.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:04.480]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:09.640]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.360]  a hybrochromatic shell.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:18.440]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride.
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:22.520]  Its infectance, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:29.400]  Stainless fuel construction, easy assembly, low maintenance, replacement filters are simple
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:30.400]  to install.

[01:59:51.360 --> 02:00:10.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:13.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:18.840]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:23.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:27.360]  I'm David Knight, and we've just been talking to the Vice President of the Border Patrol
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.720]  Council about the frustration they have in their job, and of course, it's the frustration
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:31.720]  that the public has.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:34.920]  This is behind the rise of Donald Trump.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:38.960]  We see this article coming out of Europe, because what we have to understand is that
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:44.240]  this is not simply an issue with people coming in from Mexico for economic reasons.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.000]  This is the planned takedown of the Western economy's planned chaos.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  Here's an example.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.200]  We've got an article up on infowarstore.com, as Islamic State Commander, found living as
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.720]  a refugee in a rural German village.
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:58.920]  Now, this is a guy.
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.440]  We've got other articles from WorldNet Daily where they show him on television.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.840]  He's being interviewed as a migrant, saying, yeah, I'm just coming here for economic opportunity,
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.760]  and yet he is actually an ISIS commander, okay?
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:15.080]  And he did more investigation.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:20.000]  They found him living as a refugee in rural German America.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.600]  This is the planned takedown of the West.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.680]  It's got many different aspects to it.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:28.080]  It's got the economic consolidation that we see with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:34.720]  Transatlantic Partnership, creating an economic union, then creating economic crisis so they
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.600]  can move to consolidate the sovereignty of the European Union.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.120]  You see that happening now as well.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:48.760]  But it's also taking down the culture and creating a chaos division, a kind of a balkanization,
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:50.840]  if you will, of all the European states.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.000]  That's what's going on here.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.040]  It is part of the globalist plan.
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.640]  It is something they've been talking about for a very long time.
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:58.160]  We need to understand what's behind that.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.960]  We need to understand what the socialists like Cloward and Piven, the economists, gamed
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.760]  this out and said, this is the way we establish our new state.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.880]  By first destroying what is there.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:11.600]  That's what's behind that.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:14.800]  Our country, of course, is being transformed in a number of different ways.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:19.600]  Of course, we had a recent interview that Kit Daniels did with Lou Rockwell.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:22.040]  They talked in this interview, one of many different aspects.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  It's a very long interview.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.040]  You can see that on infowars.com.
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:30.200]  I want to play a section of this interview where they talk about the cashless society.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:36.240]  Even in Austin, if I go out to say a bar or a coffee shop, they've got these little devices
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:39.960]  saying that you can pay with your smartphone and whatnot.
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:44.400]  I feel like it's conditioning people for a cashless society.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:45.800]  They think it's all trendy and cool.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.000]  It makes it more convenient.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.600]  They don't realize how much control you're handing over to the government without cash.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:56.920]  It's just like with people that say about gold that if you don't hold it, you don't
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.920]  own it.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:02.160]  What do you think the implications of the cashless society would be?
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:04.200]  You're very right about this being a propaganda campaign.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:09.360]  I remember seeing an ad a couple of years ago now about people are getting coffee in
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:12.960]  line and they're all paying with their cell phones.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:16.280]  Then he was paying with cash and he drops the money on the floor and everybody's disgusted
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.280]  with him.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.280]  He looks like a fool.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:21.240]  What an idiot for wanting to pay with cash.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.240]  There's a propaganda campaign.
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:28.080]  In fact, this has a precedent for starting about 1910.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.680]  There was a big propaganda campaign against ever using gold.
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:32.680]  You were an idiot.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:33.680]  You were a hick.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:35.080]  Your gold should always be in the bank.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:40.000]  This is before the establishment of the Fed, of course, and then, of course, eventually
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.520]  making possible Roosevelt's confiscation of everybody's gold.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.520]  You were a boob.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:46.800]  You were a country bumpkin.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:52.520]  You were just uncool if you wanted to have gold coins and use gold coins.
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.960]  It was very important that people use gold coins and they succeeded in propaganda.
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:58.960]  There are a lot of people out of it.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.240]  The same thing is happening now.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:03.240]  They hate cash.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:05.520]  They hate the banks, hate the cash.
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:06.640]  Governments hate the cash.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.520]  They want to keep track of every single thing you do with your money, every purchase you
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:13.120]  make, every dime you have.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.120]  Where's it going?
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  Do they approve?
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.840]  Is there something they should keep an eye on?
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:19.640]  Is this just something they should arrest you for?
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.360]  So they want the total cashless society.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:29.600]  Ron Paul was talking about this in the 1980s as being something they wanted.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.120]  They're making progress towards it.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.560]  Again, you can see the rest of that interview on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and as
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:40.680]  he's talking about the cashless society, remember that it's just the last couple of
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:45.360]  days the Federal Reserve has been talking about, well, we need to change the laws a
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.800]  little bit so we can charge people negative interest.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:52.760]  So they're going to try to stop cash and then they're going to charge you interest if you
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.760]  leave it in the bank.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.760]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:55.760]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:05:06.160]  This is Joe Bays with infowars.com, Anti-Beyonce rally planned for next week at NFL headquarters.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:10.880]  Controversy continues to swirl around Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime show performance.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:16.080]  The pop superstar is being accused of using her performance to attack police officers.
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:20.320]  Beyonce and her dancers were wearing leather and black berets, which was apparently a nod
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:22.280]  to the Black Panther's movement.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.120]  One dance formation seemed to acknowledge Malcolm X and other dancers had fists in the
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:33.480]  air, which was reminiscent of the Black Power salutes of the 1960s and 1970s.
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:37.880]  Representative Peter King of New York told CBS2 that the NFL should have canceled her
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:38.880]  appearance.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.040]  I found the entire show objectionable.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.560]  Despite the criticism, Beyonce has seen her sheriff supporters for her performance.
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:50.360]  Black Lives Matter activist Melina Abdul appraised her for being like artists who are willing
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:55.160]  to raise social consciousness and use her artistry to advance social justice.

[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:20.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:25.440]  I'm David Knight, and you know as serious as the situation in Flint, Michigan is with
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:29.640]  the lead contamination in the water, there is a ticking time bomb.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:31.400]  I've reported on this in the past.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.920]  We're going to be talking to Anthony Gucciardi about what this ticking time bomb is that
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:41.880]  makes this very serious situation in Flint, Michigan look like absolutely nothing.
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.920]  Before we do real quickly, I want to correct a little bit what I had said earlier.
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.280]  There was not an official announcement of Chris Christie's presidential bid ending.
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:56.080]  Actually what we had reported was from the New York Post and other sources saying that
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:01.200]  multiple campaign sources have said today that they believe that he will be ending his
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:04.040]  presidential bid after coming in in sixth place.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:09.000]  Again, it was such a low showing there that he's not going to be included in the upcoming
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.120]  debate on Saturday.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.440]  He did not get any of the delegates because he is below the 10% threshold.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:20.280]  As one campaign source said, we bet the ranch on New Hampshire.
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.480]  No one anticipated the Trump phenomenon.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:29.040]  That's a source that's close to Christie's told ABC News and said Christie is a realist.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:34.360]  As part of that realism, he reportedly called Donald Trump last night as he was considering
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:35.840]  what his options were.
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.440]  That indicates that he is a realist in terms of what is actually happening with Donald
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.440]  Trump.
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:44.880]  The establishment is trying to pretend that it's not real.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.200]  They have been telling themselves and everybody else that it's going to go away.
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:53.280]  But just as we were talking to the Border Patrol Council Vice President in the last
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:10:03.560]  hour, the basis of what Donald Trump's campaign is based on is the concern about the border
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:10.600]  and many other issues that we have tried again and again to get the GOP to do something
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  about it.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.320]  And they have promised when they run for elections that they will do something about
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.320]  it.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:20.360]  And the case in point is Marco Rubio who promised that he was going to do something about that
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:25.600]  issue and many other issues that he subsequently betrayed the voters who put him in office.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:31.640]  That sense of betrayal is really driving the Trump campaign as well as the sense that our
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.080]  economy is melting down.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:39.600]  We're seeing the results of exporting jobs, importing workers and opening our borders.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:44.640]  In other words, as Donald Trump puts it very plainly, it's a bad deal.
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:47.040]  We'll understand what a bad deal it is.
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:52.160]  But I want to talk to Anthony Gucciardi about another issue, another part of our decaying
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.160]  infrastructure.
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:58.560]  And of course, that is the risk that's being presented by these aging nuclear power plants.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.560]  Many of these power plants, Anthony, were put into service.
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:06.960]  They had anticipated useful lives of 25, 30 years.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:10.600]  And what we're seeing happening, I saw this happen in North Carolina.
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:15.200]  As they get to the 25-year lifespan that they had set these things up and approved them
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.880]  for and licensed them for, they just come back in and say, well, you know what, we need
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:23.280]  the electricity, so let's just extend the licensing here.
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:25.320]  We'll extend it for another 25 years.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:29.120]  And what we're seeing is, in North Carolina, the one that I'm familiar with that was not
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.240]  too far from where we lived, they were constantly having minor issues.
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:38.200]  They would have a pipe burst here or another malfunction over here.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:41.880]  They tell us that there wasn't much radiation released, but you don't really have a way
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:45.680]  to measure that because you can't see it, you can't taste it, you can't smell it.
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:49.360]  So unless you've got a Geiger counter, you've just got to take their word for it.
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:53.480]  But there's other issues that we see developing, and one of them is developing in New York.
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:54.480]  Tell us about that.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:57.200]  Yeah, so obviously we have a larger issue.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.440]  It's beyond just North Carolina and New York.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:04.160]  Up to 75% or more of U.S. nukesites have been found to be leaking, and we'll get into that
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:05.160]  in a minute.
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:08.720]  But this reminds us because this is the headline just down a couple days ago, we've got some
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:16.080]  new information on this as well, 65,000% radioactivity spike in New York right now, 20 miles about
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:17.080]  above New York City.
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:20.560]  The New York governor has ordered a probe into the water leak at Indian Point, but we've
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.120]  got some more information on this.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:27.000]  So look, Flint is terrible, what's going on in Flint is absolutely horrible.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.320]  It's really sad.
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.840]  But what we fail to understand is when we follow the media spotlight, think about it
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:38.200]  like a very finely pointed spotlight that only highlights one little thing, and there's
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.480]  the rest is kind of darkness, right?
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:44.320]  The media spotlight goes onto something and we cling onto it and we freak out about it.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:48.760]  We have all this hype about it, and citizens watch the TV and they say, oh my God, Flint,
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.260]  how horrible.
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:54.400]  So unfortunately, this spotlight prevents us from looking around in the shadows about
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.920]  what else is going on.
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:01.760]  And these stories from 2011 is far back warning us over and over again, such as radioactive
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:04.440]  leaks found at 75% of US nuke sites.
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:07.560]  Well, just going back to that Flint thing and of course the spotlight that they put
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  on it, that's the situation where you can see it, you can smell it, you can taste it,
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:16.640]  you can make video of it, and it has immediate effects on these children in many cases.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.840]  The issue though with the nuclear stuff is it's so much more dangerous simply because
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:27.200]  it's so difficult to detect and because of the effects of it can take a while to manifest
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.120]  themselves and they can manifest themselves in a way that you can't precisely pin it on
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:33.120]  that.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.560]  They can always say, well, it was something else in the environment that gave all these
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:36.560]  kids cancer.
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:42.440]  They also can't make it a politically correct slash race slash defensive issue, right?
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:46.280]  The nuclear power plants, they can't say that is specifically targeting a certain percentage
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.400]  of people or certain kind of people or whatever.
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:54.080]  It's also not sensational because as of right now, it will be sensational when these nuke
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:56.600]  sites really start leaking and hopefully it doesn't happen.
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.480]  But if they do, if we don't do something about it and little kids really start getting deformed
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:03.080]  and bad things happen, then it will be sensational.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:07.280]  But I like to fix things before it turns super sensational, right?
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:08.280]  That's my angle.
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.780]  Let's do something before it turns into a mega catastrophe.
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:15.480]  And for me, radiation is one of the scariest things because Flint, yes, you have lead in
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:19.640]  the water and again, it is very sad and it is horrible, but you can actually do something
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:20.640]  about it.
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:21.640]  You can change out the pipes, right?
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:22.760]  You can fix what's going on.
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:25.640]  You can have mega filtration systems going on.
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:30.240]  If you have radiation leaks into the water supply, you can't exactly do that, right?
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.840]  It's much more challenging.
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:35.180]  And think about Flint in comparison to what we're about to read.
[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:37.520]  This is from 2011.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:39.480]  This ties into what's going on now.
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:42.000]  Radioactive leaks found it in 75% of US nuke sites.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.240]  This is from CBS News.
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:50.680]  Radioactive tritium has leaked from three-quarters of US commercial nuclear power sites, often
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:55.320]  into groundwater from corroded, buried piping, as Associated Press investigation shows.
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:00.800]  I also mentioned this is the same type of hydrogen isotope, radioactive hydrogen isotope
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:02.400]  that's been leaking from New York.
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.280]  The number and severity of the leaks has been escalating even as federal regulators extend
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.560]  the licenses of more than more reactors across the nation.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.200]  So they're just saying, oh, you're fine, you're leaking no big deal.
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:17.120]  They've got these old, aging, creaky facilities, OK, which just extended arbitrarily.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:18.120]  Over and over again.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:19.120]  And that's one aspect.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.680]  The other aspect of it, of course, is having to store the nuclear waste.
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.280]  In most case, they will store that nuclear waste on site.
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:29.400]  And that was a big part of the Fukushima issue, was waste that was stored on site.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.000]  So you have two different issues.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.160]  You have a gradual, not, you know, people typically think about something like a Chernobyl
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.160]  or a three-mile island where there is a catastrophic meltdown or something, OK?
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:44.400]  This is the gradual deterioration of these plants and they do nothing about it.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:47.760]  And then the storage of this waste, which has to be done for thousands of years.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:53.400]  I mean, if you look at this from a cost-benefit analysis, how could you possibly justify nuclear
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:58.000]  power in the sense that you've got to store this waste for thousands of years without
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.600]  any leaking into the environment?
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:03.280]  I mean, you know, how do you put a price tag on that when you calculate the cost of energy
[02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:04.280]  from nuclear power?
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.280]  Right.
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:08.600]  And for me, it's beyond just the debate of whether or not we should even have it.
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:12.480]  It's, hey, look, it's here and we're going to extend these licenses and just going to
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.520]  let these people dump into the ground water.
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:15.520]  It's no big deal.
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.520]  Everything's fine.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:17.520]  Right?
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.560]  So to me, it's just so absurd.
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:22.920]  So the Tritium, which is a radioactive form hydrogen, as I just mentioned, has leaked
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:27.960]  from at least 48 of the 65 sites according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:31.240]  records reviewed as part of the AP's year-long examination.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.440]  Great job for the AP to actually do this, by the way.
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:38.360]  Of safety issues, aging nuclear power plants leaks from at least 37 of those facilities
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:42.560]  contained, concentrations exceeding the federal drinking water standard.
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:44.920]  Sometimes it hundreds of times the limit.
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.960]  While most leaks have been found within plant boundaries, some have migrated off-site.
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:51.000]  But none is known to have reached public water supplies.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  No.
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  It's the Tritium.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  Right.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  So this is from 2011, right?
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  Yeah.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  The Nukesites leaking.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  And so as well, it's not a big deal.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.200]  You know, it is pretty bad.
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:07.080]  But then, again, this is a warning from 2011, then this month in 2016, 65,000% radioactive
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:10.480]  spike New York Governor orders probe into Waterleak and Indian Point.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.840]  It's the Tritium, the same kind of radioactive isotope of hydrogen, and this plant had been
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.720]  shut down in 1974 because it had some issues.
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:21.040]  Now we see the same thing happening.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:24.520]  We were warned in 2011, and they knew about it long before that.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:29.680]  Of the three wells in question, according to Cuomo's statement, radioactive, radioactivity
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:33.960]  increased nearly 65,000% while in total the company reported alarming levels of radioactivity.
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:36.160]  The cause of contamination is unknown.
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.880]  So these are plants that have been shut down.
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:38.880]  So this is the same.
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:39.880]  No, no, no.
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:40.880]  This is a new plant.
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:41.880]  Uh-huh.
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:42.880]  The Indian Point plant previously had been shut.
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:46.240]  A plant at that same site had been shut down in 1974 because of cooling issues.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.240]  I see.
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:49.760]  So they just went, oh, I want to rule fix it, and they opened up a new one.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:53.840]  And now it's leaking into the groundwater, and they're saying they don't know what's
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:54.840]  going on.
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:55.840]  They don't know how.
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:57.200]  And they're acting like it's a new phenomenon.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:02.480]  But we know it's been happening, you know, around the United States, and 75% of plants.
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:07.440]  What I find amazing, too, when we look at this, is that, what are they so upset about?
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:09.400]  I mean, they're upset about carbon dioxide.
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:14.160]  They're not upset about nuclear waste moving into our water supply.
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:18.160]  They're totally freaking, trying to freak everybody out about this carbon dioxide, which
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:20.240]  is necessary for plants.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.840]  You know, it makes plants grow with something that's a natural thing that comes out.
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.680]  That's what they're so totally focused on.
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:28.840]  We had one moment of sanity yesterday.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.880]  We had a 5-4 decision with the Supreme Court saying they're going to put a halt on the
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:39.240]  implementation of Obama's regulations, his executive order implemented through the EPA,
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.720]  to essentially shut down and control all electricity generation with coal.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:46.640]  He said he was going to bankrupt the coal industry.
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.120]  He hasn't been able to do that yet.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:52.640]  They've put a stay on this order, and it's not going to – nothing's going to change
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.640]  with it until after the presidential election.
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:57.440]  So the next president, whoever we choose, is going to deal with this.
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:59.680]  He's either going to try to revive that.
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:06.480]  You know, Bernie Sanders says he thinks that climate is the biggest threat to us of anything.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:07.480]  Okay?
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.640]  So we know where he's going to go with this.
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:11.520]  So if we get somebody who's a Republican, they'll probably will shut that down.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:16.280]  But it's amazing to me that they make that the big issue, and they totally ignore what's
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:23.760]  going on with nuclear contamination, with radiation, with these aging, leaking facilities.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:28.080]  And many of these people who are part of this environmental movement will say, no, no, we
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.240]  need to have nuclear because it doesn't have any carbon dioxide.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:32.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:36.160]  And then they act like this is nothing and not a big deal, and under Obama, new plants
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:37.160]  are being made.
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.640]  It's just as we mentioned, the regulations are just – licenses are going over and over
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:41.640]  and over again.
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:44.400]  It's absolutely twilight zone as we hear.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:46.920]  We're going to be right back with Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:59.160]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.920]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:06.800]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:10.080]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:13.880]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:15.520]  head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.160]  How is this even possible?
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:21.600]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:24.560]  fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:28.120]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's
[02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:32.160]  made their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:35.760]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:40.120]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.520]  of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:46.680]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.

[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:26.600]  According to a company spokesman, this is happening because we're worried that the
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:28.840]  people in Washington have an agenda.
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:30.680]  Control the food, control the people.
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:34.160]  You don't want to rely on the government to keep your family fed in a crisis.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:38.680]  The normal price of these kits is $27 plus shipping, but listeners who act now get them

[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:08.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:12.400]  I'm David Knight and I've been talking to Anthony Gucciardi about what's going on in
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:17.680]  Flint and of course the even bigger problem that is on the horizon, the decaying infrastructure
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:25.440]  of our nuclear power plants and the 65,000% increase in radiation and groundwater up in
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:26.760]  New York State.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:30.680]  That's 650 times what it was before.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.400]  The bottom line is this.
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:37.040]  You can't really trust anybody else to protect your life or your liberty.
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:41.640]  The way we try to protect our liberty of course is by talking to other people, educating other
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:44.560]  people, getting them to understand what is at stake.
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:47.280]  And of course that's also the way we try to protect our life.
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:51.160]  We offer you products here at infowarslife.com to protect your life.
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:54.360]  And of course we've got a couple of specials that are expiring today, Anthony.
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:25:00.160]  We've got the new pill formulation, Anthroplex, there's an introductory sale of that together
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:01.160]  with Supermail Vitality.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:02.880]  You get 15% off both of those.
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.880]  Tell us a little bit about Anthroplex.
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:07.360]  It's something that I haven't had the chance to try yet.
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.520]  So Anthroplex is a pill formation that used to be a once daily foundation for men.
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:16.080]  We made it a twice daily at the same low price, the exact same price.
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.120]  Now you take it twice a day and what it is, is it combines really well with Supermail
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:21.120]  Vitality.
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:24.600]  It's made to fight back against all the gender bending chemicals that we're exposed to on
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:25.600]  a daily basis.
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:30.400]  I mean, men in this country are consuming through the food and the water supply an absolute
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:31.960]  attack on their bodies.
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:32.960]  The BPAs.
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:33.960]  Yeah, the BPAs.
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:35.800]  Everything is even cans are lined with plastic.
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:36.800]  Exactly.
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:37.800]  It's on your money.
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:38.800]  It's on this paper that we're touching right now.
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:41.200]  I mean, we're being exposed to BPA through this printer ink.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.200]  It's on everything.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.200]  It's on everything.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:44.440]  It's in prescription drugs.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:45.440]  It's in everything.
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:46.440]  But it's not in our mind.
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:50.080]  We can see this in the fish and we can see this and while as it's going into the water
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:55.720]  supply and running off, you can see that there's a gender changing going on with a fish with
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:57.040]  shrimp various things.
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.040]  People make fun of that.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:02.320]  But there was actually a story in the National Geographic that I gave to Alex about a week
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:07.720]  or two ago and it was about how male fish were having eggs because they were exposed
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:08.720]  to gender bending chemicals.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:09.720]  That's the real deal.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:10.720]  That's real.
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:14.320]  So this is to fight back and also it pairs well with Supermail Vitality.
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.280]  So today though, tonight we are ending this particular special where if you buy Supermail
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:21.760]  Vitality and Anthropyte, you get 15% off but it doesn't end there.
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:25.160]  We also have auto ship on InfowarsLife.com.
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:29.040]  So take 10% off when you do auto ship on all of these.
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.440]  So that 15% off is ending.
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:33.160]  Also we have silver bullet.
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:35.240]  We extended this because it was selling well.
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:37.400]  We're going to run out those soon so we're going to have to end it.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.440]  Get silver bullet for 15% off.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.200]  That's ending tonight.
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.480]  But you can get silver bullet for 15% off and 10% off with auto ship.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:49.120]  So that's 25% off and that ends tonight at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:52.680]  So these are the specials ending and you have prostate guards for 15% off that we're going
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:53.680]  to end in the next few days.
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:57.000]  So go to InfowarsLife.com and take advantage of that because it's all ending tonight.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.560]  And the bottom line is you are ultimately responsible for your health.
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:03.520]  I mean, we're looking at the water situation.
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.920]  You need to make sure that you've got fresh, clean drinking water and again, the free shipping,
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:09.920]  anything that's over $50.
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:13.920]  I mean, if you don't have a good water filter, you need to make sure you've got that.
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:16.600]  Or just trust the government and drink $65,000 increase.
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:17.600]  Exactly.
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:18.600]  There's no problem.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.160]  Yeah, they're just going to take care of it for you.
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:21.160]  Let me ask you this.
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:22.960]  What do you think about the election that we saw last night?
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:24.800]  Well, you know, I have a proposal.
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:26.320]  I watched the debates.
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:29.920]  I've watched every single debate actually, at least most of them.
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.600]  I tuned out some bit after a little while.
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:38.400]  I actually propose that we request all of the Republican candidates and the Democratic
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.840]  candidates to pass the Turing test.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:42.720]  Now for those who aren't familiar with what that is.
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:44.120]  See if there's really any intelligence.
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:48.640]  Yeah, because you know Marco Rubio, he's kind of the example of artificial intelligence.
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:49.640]  Artificial intelligence.
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:51.920]  He can keep repeating these can lines like a robot.
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:57.040]  So Turing test is basically to determine if artificial intelligence can mimic that of
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:01.920]  a human being to see if someone can actually believe that artificial intelligence is essentially
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:02.920]  human.
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:03.920]  And Marco failed that.
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:06.440]  Marco Rubio has failed the Turing test.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.800]  In my view, Ted Cruz has failed the Turing test.
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:14.160]  Hillary Clinton, it should be, you know, just qualify to begin with.
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.680]  There's one of integrity.
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.680]  There's integrity test.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:20.560]  The Turing test, I believe would be a great way to kind of filter out different candidates
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:25.080]  because like, let's be honest, I talked about this on The Sunday Show and many times before,
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:28.680]  people want individuals that are real, okay?
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:34.040]  We're tired of the fake phony way that they train to speak.
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:37.720]  That's offensive to me when I sit down, and I'm not even talking about the policy, okay?
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:38.840]  I'm not even talking about the candidates.
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:40.680]  I get some people like Ted Cruz, whatever.
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:44.640]  I'm just talking about the way he speaks in these debates is offensive to me.
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.640]  It's offensive to me because he speaks like, well, you know, yes, we do need to save this
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:50.640]  country.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:52.160]  And it's like, come on, man.
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:55.880]  And then the way Marco Rubio just spits out the same line five times in a row, we've played
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.720]  the video for you guys, spits out the same line.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:28:59.720]  Yeah.
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:00.720]  I mean, come on.
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:01.720]  It's so robotic and so synthetic.
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:06.360]  And when Donald Trump comes out and he says things that are offensive or rough or whatever,
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:09.320]  at least people say, well, you know, that's what you see is what you get.
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.320]  Okay?
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:12.320]  They're saying the same thing about Bernie Sanders, you know, Bernie Sanders.
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:14.840]  You know, I'm not saying I agree with all of it, but at least it's real.
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:18.480]  And then it's kind of like, they should just come out with like plastic surgery on their
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:23.440]  face too, like huge lips and like, you know, like a specific nose, like just totally insane-looking.
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:24.440]  It's so fake.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:25.440]  I'm just done with it, man.
[02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:26.440]  Okay.
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:28.680]  So that's Anthony Gucciardi's solution for how we elect the president.
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:30.040]  Thank you very much, Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:31.040]  Absolutely.
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.560]  After the break, we're going to be joined by Alex Jones.
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:34.560]  Stay with us.
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:48.320]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:49.600]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:52.040]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:59.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:08.480]  The media is on the run.
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:13.280]  Trump trounced nearest contender John Kasich, taking 34% of the vote with establishment
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:17.000]  favor Marco Rubio lagging behind in fifth place.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.840]  The Huffington Post exploded with resentment.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:25.220]  Running the headline, New Hampshire goes racist, sexist, homophobic and huge red capital letters.
[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:29.480]  A short time later, the headline was changed to WTF GOP.
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:34.000]  This was just the latest salvo in the publication's long-running feud with Trump.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:38.880]  It had previously relegated news stories about him to the entertainment section.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:43.680]  Last month, the Huffington Post took the unprecedented step of adding a note to the bottom of every
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:48.680]  article about Trump, which described him as a liar, a racist and a xenophobe.
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:53.400]  However, not to be outdone, the New York Daily News reacted to Trump's win by portraying
[02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:55.240]  the business mogul as a clown.
[02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:58.400]  You can find more reports at infowars.com.
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:02.280]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:07.400]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:10.680]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:15.960]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:18.480]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:04.160]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:09.600]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:13.600]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:19.320]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:22.400]  drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:26.680]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:31.280]  Pathenogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:36.280]  vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:42.120]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex, the latest product from infowarslife.com.
[02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:46.960]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com

[02:32:56.560 --> 02:33:07.120]  That's a limited time.
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:14.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:16.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:21.200]  I'm David Knight here in the studio, but joining us now is Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:22.200]  Alex?
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:28.200]  Well, David, I've been listening on the iPhone app off and on today and just what an incredible
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:33.160]  broadcast Richard Reeves from New Hampshire in the aftermath of that stunning victory
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:39.800]  for Donald Trump and as you were just talking about with Anthony Uchiarty, the socialist
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:46.120]  slash communist candidate from the United States, Bernie Sanders, and then we expand
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:47.600]  into all the other things that are happening.
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:53.640]  The head of the Border Patrol Union or the deputy head saying, our government, our president
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:58.520]  works directly against the Border Patrol and federal law and sovereignty.
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:02.440]  And that's the triumph of political correctness, whether it's turning off our power plants,
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:06.520]  so our jobs go to China and India or Mexico, or whether it's saying, come after our guns
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:13.040]  outside of law, or whether it is just with executive rule having the IRS, persecute their
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:14.040]  political enemies.
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:16.880]  This is in Fuego.
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:27.960]  This is tyranny on fire, naked, 200 proof, bona fide certified colossal, I mean, just
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:30.120]  dripping wet in the blood of innocents.
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.240]  It is so naked.
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:34.480]  It is nakedly on fire.
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:35.760]  It is in our face.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:42.960]  It is ridiculous, but it's meant to be ridiculous to break our will ahead of just fantastical
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:48.160]  stuff they've got planned if we continue to fail the test and not resist and say no.
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:52.120]  The good news is, as Ron Paul said today, we have the video up on at FullWorks.com, many
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:53.120]  others.
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:56.760]  There is one of the biggest awakenings in history happening and people more and more
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:01.040]  withdraw their support from the system of every race, color, creed, religion, you name
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:02.040]  it.
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:08.280]  It is a neck-and-neck battle and listening to the deputy head of the war patrol union,
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:12.840]  talk about what Jakari Jackson and Don Salazar already went and documented years ago, but
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:16.960]  to see him say it, we complete the smuggling process.
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:21.720]  We're here to commit crimes against America, all of it.
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:30.000]  When flying through TSA, they pull myself, my family out, they search all our bags, they
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.680]  know who I am, they know I have no criminal record, they have me in a database, they know
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.720]  I haven't gotten a speeding ticket, but like one in like a decade, I mean they know that
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:45.360]  and they act like I am Adolf Hitler reborn.
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:51.760]  So that tells you everything you need to know about this political system and how sickening
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:56.160]  it is and I've said this many times and not for lack of material, but remember MSNBC,
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:01.880]  we've played the clubs Maddow and all those other people going, of course we've got the
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:07.080]  IRS coming after conservatives and Christians and veterans and gun owners.
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:12.040]  You're racist and you deserve to be in jail.
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:20.320]  The totalitarianism of that, again the keyword, the nakedness, the wantonness of the clear
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:25.040]  and present threat these people are and I want to go over news here, but before I do
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:30.680]  that, this morning I got up at about 6 a.m. again to look at the news and I get Google
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:35.400]  alerts and so there was like only, it was a light news day on like a hundred and something
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:41.600]  news articles attacking me by name and because I search it under Alex Jones and in force
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:46.160]  I'll just do Alex Jones or there's that British TV star and then it gets confusing, but I
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:47.160]  like to monitor what they're doing.
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:50.200]  So I spend about 10 minutes every morning, we're out when I wake up, as I'm at the coffee
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:55.000]  maker, seeing what the attacks are, not in some narcissistic egomania, I need to know
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:02.760]  which missiles are being fired at info wars and my name is the radar system in which we
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:08.040]  know which the new attacks are and I see these different articles, a whole bunch of them,
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:15.520]  the same Democratic Party, usual suspects with their MO, Alex Jones and then one of the top
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:22.400]  stories on Yahoo, Alex Jones says, break Bernie Sanders supporters jaws and then I
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:29.320]  went and read the article, I mean, I remember what I said yesterday, I said, knowing fascism,
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:33.560]  knowing communism, the hundreds of millions dead, and to see these parasites living off
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:39.080]  all the Americans and others that fought communism and fascism and Nazism and Salterianism,
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:43.440]  you know, it'd be great to see these people, you know, they had broken jaws figuratively
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:46.800]  to realize how pathetic and stupid they are.
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:50.160]  I said they've never been in fights, they've never been in the real world, they live off
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:55.320]  what's left of capitalism and all the wealth and all the diversity and all the choices,
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:58.680]  and they basically pissed on it for life a better term.
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:04.800]  And the full quotes there, they even linked to it, they say, and worse yet, Jones wants
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:10.040]  the supporters of Sanders to burn in camps.
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:16.600]  So I don't apologize overall, but I apologize for the fact that I don't realize what enemies
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:24.400]  these people are, and that I say things literary and in a literary fashion that they take out
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:30.560]  of context, obviously, if you listen to the full interview, I'm not apologizing, I'm not
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:34.200]  scared, it doesn't hurt me, it's not like I'm on the rocks or on the ropes, I'm just
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:37.040]  illustrating how these enemies operate.
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:40.520]  We're about non-violence offensively, we're about winning an info war, we're trying to
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.840]  stop a civil war, everybody knows we're trying to stop violence, I'm looking at the threat
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.960]  to myself and my family of socialism and communism and how it works and how it operates.
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:55.680]  And I say, my gosh, think of the hell that the Russians went through under communism.
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:39:00.520]  Think about Alexander Selsenits, and he said, oh, how we burned in the camps later, wishing,
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:03.680]  you can pull up his quote, we'd have done something earlier.
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:08.920]  I said in that quote, you guys, you live in the real world, you need to be in a fist fight,
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:12.080]  you need to live in reality and have a stand in line for your food, you need to have your
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:17.440]  collective jaws broken before you're burning in the camps.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:23.280]  Like Alexander Selsenitsa, burning with anger that he hadn't taken action when he was outside
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:24.280]  that gulag.
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:30.000]  And I said that, and that shows our enemy, that I quoted Alexander Selsenitsa about,
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.120]  let's not burn in the camps, and they turn that into, I want to burn, Bernie Sanders
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:39.440]  is Jewish in a camp, see how this filth works, it doesn't matter that both my grandfather
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:44.280]  is fought Hitler, it does in the European theater, it doesn't matter, they both almost
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:45.280]  died.
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.480]  When I'm in a plane crash, another bombing raid, it means nothing to these people, they
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.680]  will put a George Soros Nazi collaborator over me and over the First Amendment to literally
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.440]  destroy our country and then sit there and tell us that we're Nazis.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:03.640]  These people are the definition of scum.
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:07.960]  And I've got a big vocabulary folks, but I'm telling you, they are disreputable trash,
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:17.160]  they are scum, they are lying, twisting deceitful self, and I am so sick of them, I am so tired
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:20.760]  of their frauds and their lies, and I'll tell you this, no matter, we know Bernie Sanders
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:24.560]  is bad news, we know Donald Trump says some things that he's trying to act like a tough
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:29.480]  guy at a fifth grade level, you know, all torture the terrorist, all protect you, he's
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:33.440]  trying to be the strong man for what he thinks the American people want, and maybe he's right
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:36.600]  about his rhetoric, but I don't agree with some of the stuff he says, but out of this,
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.840]  the Bilderberg group, Davos, the globalist, the enemies, the CNBCs, the Time magazines,
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:49.520]  the Newsweeks, the Daily Beast, the lying trash scum who I know is a cancer upon free
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:52.360]  speech and culture and everything else.
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:57.680]  They hate Donald Trump, so that's why I'm backing, and it's not a fake attack on him
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.520]  where they act like they're attacking him for reverse psychology, six, eight months ago
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.160]  I thought that might be it, and on air said I'm watching closely, no, no, they are in
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:12.720]  panic mode, folks, and they're even in panic of their own socialist manifestation because
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:18.120]  they want Bernie Sanders down the road to collectivize some of the wealth to make the
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:23.000]  educated masses controlled by government contracts that Eisenhower warned of in the military
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:28.440]  industrial technological complex, he didn't just say military, it was first the technological
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:34.840]  complex of the elite, the technocrats controlling us through the funding that goes out with
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:40.480]  government contracts, creating a intellectual tyranny, the 21 minute speeches online, folks
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:46.040]  go watch it, and now we're in the hands of those people, and they can't compete with
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:52.120]  innovation, they can't compete with free market, so they have to then bring in crony capitalism,
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:59.320]  demonize free market, scapegoat it for their crimes, they're offshore as I've said on record,
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:04.680]  tax exempt above the law, diplomatic immunity, and then they scapegoated it, and Bernie Sanders
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:12.320]  knows this, and he plays up, oh, the Walmart family has 200 billion, oh, General Electric
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:16.880]  doesn't pay taxes, yeah, and your own buddy Obama gave him the waivers not to do it, so
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:25.680]  again, when I get up here and say that Bernie Sanders is a threat, he is a manifestation
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:29.440]  of how Hillary is meant to bring this system in, but he is a manifestation of what they've
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:35.160]  sold and the people they've created, and the dumb masses that actually think socialism
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:41.920]  and communism delivers anything but slavery, anything but not having your own free will,
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:47.960]  and so that's why I get so mad at him, but let me be completely clear, I wish not a hair
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:56.280]  on that sack of crap's head ever be heard to turn that inhuman parasitical maggot into
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:09.200]  a patriot, into a martyr, no, no, no, I wish no harm against Obama or Jeb Bush or Hillary
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:14.880]  or any of these parasites that think because they don't want to manipulate their God and
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:22.800]  have free will, I want to see their lives destroyed, I want to see their lives inflamed
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:30.200]  and burned down, I want to see their new world order system burn as a funeral pyre against
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.000]  everything that they stand for, but that just shows how these people to see, but I'll be
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:44.480]  honest with you, it is the coddled system-based trendies that go to college and get the loans
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:48.920]  that were designed to rip them off that sit there saying, I like Bernie, I want something
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:55.080]  free that are so incredibly dangerous because they grew in the bosom of a free nation, they
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:59.680]  grew in the bosom of a free market, they have more choices than anybody else in the world
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:06.000]  and they sit here arrogantly hating America, hating what's good about freedom, hating what's
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.160]  good about the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, when the whole world wanted to come to the
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:16.280]  United States not because it was perfect, but because it was the greatest expression
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:24.960]  of basic human will and liberty and had the most wiggle room, though it was somewhat of
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:29.840]  a cramped space, though for many of us that really dream of true liberty and can imagine
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:36.800]  what humans could do potentially, the word I would use is claustrophobic, but even the
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:43.920]  claustrophobia and all the problems of America compared to the tombs that are socialism,
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:49.320]  fascism and communism and all command and control systems, it makes me so incredibly
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:56.200]  sick to see these people fall in the sickness in their eyes, imagining dreams not in books
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:03.120]  they write or music they write or songs they play or art they paint or food they cook or
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:10.320]  jaws they set or legs they fix or crops they plant or children they reach or carburetors
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:16.640]  they repair, they dream through a state, they dream through a system, they dream through
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:23.880]  a God like Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton that would deliver them free goodies like
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:29.520]  the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny isn't real folks, Santa Claus isn't
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:35.960]  real and let me tell you the sprites that bring you free goods and their black uniforms
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:41.040]  and their shiny boots and their submachine guns are bringing you into total slavery and
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:46.000]  I can look at that creature Bernie Sanders and that creature Hillary Clinton and I can
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.120]  tell you unequivocally.
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:52.840]  They point at the crimes that their crony system has created and engineered, they point
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.560]  at the very people that have financed them and tell us that going deeper into their system
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:06.720]  will save us, they are total and complete adjunct frauds but if you look at the abject
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:14.120]  lies of these people, remember, Trump represents and so does Sanders, the grassroots rebellion
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:19.400]  against the system that will go on and only get more intense past these candidates when
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:24.520]  losers are drawn and if Trump's a fraud it doesn't matter because we ride that collective
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:29.840]  figurehead to the next figurehead and the next to the next, the minute they betray us
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:35.840]  we turn against them and in the end we're not going to pull up out of the magical sea
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:41.080]  of ideas, a figurehead, we're going to pull up ourselves and find the answers and the
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:46.880]  leadership we need to go to the next level because humanity will not be stopped.
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:53.000]  Donald Trump 35% in New Hampshire when they threw everything they had against him and
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:00.080]  had all their so-called polls with him at 20% and Cruz at 10% and Rubio at 15% it was
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:06.400]  not what they said and it shows you the manipulation we face at the same time, we're aware of
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:10.960]  the rabbit trick, we're aware of the magician, we're aware of the hat trick, we're aware
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:17.800]  of the sleight of hand and so we are living in epic amazing historical magical times
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:22.960]  and that's why I'm so blessed and so honored to be here and be able to talk to all of you
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:30.360]  today because we are on this journey together and this is a big, big deal but yes when you
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:38.720]  look at Bernie Sanders, he is the final plague not he himself but what he represents, they've
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:43.080]  shut down our power, the poor public doesn't know why they're going bankrupt, they've shut
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:47.560]  down our jobs, the regulations, they've done everything they can to hold back the great
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:54.240]  engine, the great bull that was America and now they bring us the trendy smart professor
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:48:00.680]  to prey on the servile dumb-down people with two, three college degrees and no future and
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:05.400]  now they think they're going to get some free goodie, let's take the $218 billion the Walmart
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:11.880]  family has, that won't run the country a munch, let's take that wealth and give it to these
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:17.040]  trendies right now, what does it do at a national park to feed the squirrels, they term in the
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:23.400]  fat, dumb, domesticated idiots, same thing with sheep, it does nothing as if the Walmart
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:29.840]  family with $200 plus billion is going to let a bunch of self-propelled stomachs and
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:37.720]  jobless college kids dominate them, they dominated you, you socialist morons, they set up their
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:42.320]  slave factory run systems and you went in there and you bought their goods as you switched
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:48.840]  your own throat and now you think you're getting another good deal like Walmart with Bernie,
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:54.360]  go buy some lottery tickets jackasses, I'm talking to people that buy into this system,
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:49:00.040]  your fools and the sickest part about watching fools is they're always ready to buy up and
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:06.840]  buy in and get on board the next con game, the next scam, you people make me sick, I
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:11.640]  don't want to break your jaws, you're going to break your own future, the problem is you're
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:16.840]  so invincibly stupid, you're so invincibly ignorant, you'll never even learn from your
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:22.560]  mistakes and admit you're wrong, you won't learn from example, you won't learn from history,
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:27.200]  you won't learn from the nightmare of socialism and collectivism and communism when it puts
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:33.080]  all these nobodies on top of you who revel in black uniforms and checkpoints and making
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:38.280]  your wife have sex with them so you can have a job and controlling the art and the literature
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:45.360]  and the human renaissance, communism and socialism is the dagger in the heart of human freedom
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:51.680]  and true liberalism and you scum have the nerve to take on the mantle of liberalism
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:57.800]  when you are the dumbest, stupidest, most pathetic servile trash the world has ever
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:03.400]  seen, look at yourselves, look at how you grovel the megabags, look at how the megabags
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:08.800]  fund your god, Hillary, look at how you sit there and go, well Bernie's against the big
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:13.560]  bank, oh really he voted against auditing the fed, Bernie will bring you exactly what
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:18.960]  they want in the next phase because they're exempt offshore and the minute you learn how
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.400]  to do arithmetic and the minute you learn about globalism and the minute you pull your heads
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:26.760]  out of the collective sand, I'm talking to our audience, I want to be clear, I'm talking
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:30.520]  to people on the fence, people that think they can sit back and watch us in the arena
[02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:35.760]  and make jokes about it, we're not making jokes, we're serious, we came to fight, we
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:39.480]  want you to have human liberty, we want you to have a future, we want you to be able to
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:44.960]  be who you want to be, listen up, we're not here to then provide for you and we're not
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:48.880]  here to be your beast of burden, we're not here to be your slaves, we're not here to
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:54.200]  bow to you and produce while you sit there and tell us how we're bad all day because
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:58.840]  we innovate and produce freedom and produce inventions and produce ideas.
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:01.400]  Paid for by Bonner & Partners, an independent research firm.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:06.640]  Fed up after years spent fighting big government in Washington DC, a multi-millionaire businessman
[02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:10.960]  has spent the last 30 years tracking an obscure threat to America.
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:14.920]  Today he says it's about to reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion.
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:18.720]  If he's right, your way of life is about to change very suddenly.
[02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:22.760]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, to your retirement and the family you want
[02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:23.760]  to protect.
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:27.600]  Now he's made predictions like this before, and he was right then too.
[02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:30.880]  A few years ago he warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:31.880]  They did.
[02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:34.920]  Before that, he warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:35.920]  They did.
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:38.160]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:40.960]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:42.320]  This will affect us all.
[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:48.200]  A free video he's released online details everything you need to know at dollardownfall.com.
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:52.480]  Now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and
[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:54.480]  see the facts for yourself.
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:58.960]  Let's go to dollardownfall.com, that's dollardownfall.com.

[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:32.280]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:33.280]  the Infowar.
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:43.200]  If you go into a communist run area like North Korea or any other area controlled by
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:46.720]  political activists, there's no food, stuff's worse than the school lunch program.
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:51.560]  You go into a capitalist area, there's thousands of choices, it's just sickening.
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:54.600]  But now we have this parasitic system coming in and taking over.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:55:00.640]  I'd forgotten that I had Rob just sitting there for 30 minutes because I'm via telephone.
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:02.920]  Right now, I'd forgotten I'd asked Rob due to come in.
[02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:07.240]  He doesn't even know why he's in here because right before I went live, I said about 30
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:10.840]  minutes ago, I said, I want to get Rob due in here and he's going to be hosting the fourth
[02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:11.840]  hour.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:13.600]  He's going to be hosting the next hour with him and David died.
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:15.040]  David Knight's got a great point.
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.160]  He was making a meter in the break about an article on Infowars.com about Trump's single
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:21.360]  handedly brought back free speech.
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  Absolutely.
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:23.360]  Absolutely.
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:25.920]  I mean, that's what it's about is not caring what people say about you and just getting
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:30.480]  it out there because they want us to all be obsessed and upset and threatened by info.
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:32.360]  No, let's just get to know each other.
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:34.800]  That's what actually brings us together.
[02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:40.680]  The reason I brought Rob due in here is Rob remembers a lot of this, but I don't know
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:44.920]  if he remembers all three times because he remembers once, twice, or three times because
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:48.680]  he's been here about seven years that I would take him over the years as one of the best
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:53.600]  camera people we have back then, definitely the best we had before he was the news director.
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:56:00.480]  And I would bring in a lot of famous people to be interviewed and I would bring him in
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:06.920]  to also be in films and repeatedly he's been there with very well-known liberals.
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.760]  When they get out to dinner with you and a few glasses of wine, they go, listen, you
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:14.040]  better join us or we're going to bleep.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:18.400]  So when I hear people like Larry Grathwald talk about the weathermen in Obama and these
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:23.320]  closed door meetings about killing 25 million people and putting 50 million in forced labor
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:27.960]  camps, and I make these statements, let me tell you something, Bernie Sanders was connected
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:34.040]  to the SDS and other very hardcore groups that would love to carry out a Stalinistic
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:35.400]  operation in America.
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:37.200]  And the left media makes jokes about this.
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:38.720]  I've been around these people.
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:40.720]  People say, well, why don't you just say their names?
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:46.120]  When you have somebody in confidence to interview, they claim they're a liberal, then they uncluck
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:50.040]  and say, you better join us or, well, I'm going to let you tell the story.
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:51.960]  Do I have it told you what you were coming on about?
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:52.960]  I just hinted at it.
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:54.960]  In your years here, what have you experienced?
[02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:55.960]  Am I correct?
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:56.960]  Am I wrong?
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:00.920]  Having leftist around us at the office, what type of stuff comes out?
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:06.760]  One experience that I remember vividly is we did a round of interviews with this individual
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:12.760]  for probably three hours we interviewed him, then we took him out to dinner and we had
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:18.800]  a few beers and I think by his third beer, he started opening up to how there's going
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:22.880]  to have to be blood spilt to get real change in this country.
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:26.200]  And he just came out and said it like that and we're like, can we put you on camera?
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:29.640]  No, he didn't want to go on camera saying that.
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:32.360]  And it was very interesting, very telling.
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:35.400]  That's the one that I remember vividly, it was probably about four years ago.
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  It wasn't like, oh, too bad, we're going to have a revolution, it's going to be hard.
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:41.960]  It was like, there's going to be blood or a lot of people and we're here, you can take
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:44.800]  part in the filling, you're a libertarian communist, join us.
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:45.800]  I mean, it was very threatening.
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:49.280]  I just wanted to, I wanted to crush this skull in, I mean, I'll be honest, I mean, the guys
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:52.560]  sitting there getting off talking about killing people, I was like, really, how about you
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:53.560]  died then?
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:54.560]  You know what?
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:55.560]  You think you're so damn tough.
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:57.320]  And we never aired that interview at all.
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.880]  There's not one bit of that that ever went out from infotainment.
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:02.800]  Because we were so creeped out and we had run into that before.
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:07.600]  Remember the other times people liked, oh, hey, I'm actually a communist and the point
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:11.040]  is they un-cloak and admit they're communists in front of you and you're like, I'm like,
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:12.040]  I'm not killing everybody.
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:15.160]  And I've had communists threaten me to go, yeah, we're communists, we're going to kill
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:16.160]  you.
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:20.080]  You know, they just, they just, they just, they're sneaky scum and they offer all these
[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:23.480]  young, dumb people and I'm not saying young people are dumb, but it mainly young people
[02:58:23.480 --> 02:58:24.480]  that have no future.
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:27.880]  I'll give you something free, vote for me or support me, they have no idea.
[02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:32.240]  What is it like for you to see America talking about a socialist president, people go, oh,
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:36.040]  well, that'll counter the big banks, they love it.
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:37.040]  It's not going to happen.
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:42.040]  Stay there dude, stay there tonight, we'll be back.

[02:59:51.480 --> 03:00:01.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:08.160]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.160 --> 03:00:15.160]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.160 --> 03:00:16.160]  We are the resistance folks.
[03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:17.160]  We don't want to be the resistance.
[03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:18.160]  We don't want to be the tip of the spear.
[03:00:18.160 --> 03:00:20.520]  We just got to do it because we're it.
[03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:25.200]  We're it and we're going against these people and I just look at my dumbed-down fellow Americans
[03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:26.200]  and others.
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:29.880]  It's so sad that they're in the clutches of these spiders that I was ranting.
[03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:33.440]  They're finishing up Rob Do and then David Knight's got points to make about their return
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:34.440]  of free speech.
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:35.440]  And I can say anything.
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:38.560]  That's what info wars is about is we are the return of free speech.
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:42.160]  We are the return of freedom and we're just here to bring it.
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:43.160]  We're here to fight.
[03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:44.160]  We're not playing games.
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:45.160]  We're not backing down.
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.160]  We're committed.
[03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:47.160]  And the enemy knows that folks.
[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:52.000]  There's an energy and being committed to being good and they try to teach you, oh, that's
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  just your opinion.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  There's no free will.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.280]  No folks, I got an opinion.
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:01.760]  There is free will and communism and socialism and fascism and totalitarianism and oligarchies
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:04.480]  are totally evil.
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:05.480]  But it's coming down.
[03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:07.640]  I'll finish it up before you host the show.
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:08.640]  Yeah.
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:12.600]  Well, in addition to these leaders, these communist leaders, we've encountered their
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:17.720]  ground troops and they act like, oh, we're here for women's rights and freedom.
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:22.040]  And then when the cameras go off, they look at you in that with that look and they love
[03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:24.360]  killing babies.
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:28.200]  That's what they relish in, I think, the most and they look at us and say, we're going to
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:29.200]  get you.
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:33.000]  Folks, until you experience a devil worse for uncloking, go, I love Satan, I'm going to
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.360]  tell you, yeah, family, I mean, they're not, they're not liberals, they're demon creatures.
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:38.360]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:39.360]  It's true.
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:40.360]  Yeah.
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:44.520]  It's, it's disgusting what we're having to go through now and this struggle and other
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:47.160]  countries have gone through it and a lot of them have failed.
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:53.720]  They've gone under these socialist systems and you always see what happens going under
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:54.720]  your thumb.
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.600]  I'm trying to defensively stop this peacefully, but I got news for you, trash.
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:00.720]  It's called the Second Amendment.
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:03.160]  In the end, if you really want to fight, you're going to get one.
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:04.400]  That's the thing about these cowards, man.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:06.960]  Once you bring a fight to them, they roll over and squeal.
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:07.960]  Yeah.
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:08.960]  I've heard stories.
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:10.160]  You guys aren't getting quarter.
[03:02:10.160 --> 03:02:11.800]  I hope they know that.
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:16.560]  The Khmer Rouge, they got all these young people and they went after educated people
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.600]  and they brought people out into the countryside and turned them into slaves.
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:21.600]  That's what happened.
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:22.600]  That happened in the seventies.
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:26.520]  I mean, it's, that's the kind of people you're going to be dealing with and they think they're
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:29.640]  going to have a gun and they're going to be really tough and that they can push people
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:34.600]  around and they're going to find when they come into America and try to bring that here,
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:39.720]  that they're going to meet lots of guns, one behind every blade of grass.
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:41.200]  That's right.
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:42.720]  It's everyone on Mototo Discovery.
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:43.720]  Great job.
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:44.720]  Do you're coming up, get ready.
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:45.720]  Go ahead and get ready.
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:46.720]  Cause you're about to host the rest of the hour.
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:47.720]  God bless you.
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:48.720]  Let's go back to David Knight.
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:49.720]  David, you had a whole point to make on this.
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:50.720]  Yeah.
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:54.720]  You know, we got a story up on info wars.com campaign spokeswoman for Donald Trump said
[03:02:54.720 --> 03:03:00.640]  he single-handedly brought back freedom of speech, essentially pushing back against
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:01.640]  political correctness.
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:05.080]  We understand that political correctness is a tool.
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:10.080]  They try to take the moral high ground, the high ground of an argument and that's how
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:12.720]  they win the argument by dictating the terms.
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:17.480]  A good example of this is an article that was up on WND about how in the city of San
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:23.760]  Francisco, their manual has just banned using the phrase founding fathers.
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:26.000]  They want them to say founders.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.280]  And of course, they've taken other things out as well.
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:33.680]  The common man, mankind, man made, man up, do you see a pattern here?
[03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:35.800]  They don't like men, okay?
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.360]  And as the people who are pushing back against this, the Pacific Justice Institute pointed
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:46.520]  out, they said there are over 1500 separate instances in which the Supreme Court and other
[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:50.360]  lower courts have invoked the term founding fathers.
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:57.280]  And yet ironically, this manual from the city is called bias free language.
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:00.440]  No, their manual is filled with bias.
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:02.120]  And you have to understand too that this is a-
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:03.120]  It's total slave language.
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:04.120]  It's slave language.
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:05.120]  Yes.
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:06.800]  Who are people dictating language?
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:07.800]  Cult leaders.
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:08.800]  Yeah.
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:12.160]  And of course, it's not for the people who work there who are city employees, this isn't
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:15.080]  just, oh, we're going to shame you into submission.
[03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:18.840]  No, I mean, they can have, they could lose their job because they work for the government.
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:20.760]  The government says, don't use those words.
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:22.920]  I mean, this is absolute insane control.
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.760]  No matter how much you submit, they always broaden it to brown paper bags or he or she.
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:30.680]  I mean, this is just total cult brainwashing.
[03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:34.040]  And these fake liberals sit around giggling at us like it's funny.
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:37.400]  Why would you people want to be part of this Jim Jones operation?
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:39.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  And that's one of the things that makes Donald Trump so popular.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:46.160]  He looks at him and is like, I don't care for these, I'm not going to play by your games.
[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:47.320]  This is a control game.
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:48.320]  I understand it.
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:49.320]  I'm just cutting it down.
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:50.320]  Forget it.
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:51.320]  I'm not going to do that.
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:52.320]  That's right.
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:53.320]  David Knight, stay there.
[03:04:53.320 --> 03:04:59.000]  I'm going to come back and say bye to Rob, dude.
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:02.760]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com, campaign aid.
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:08.200]  Trump has single-handedly brought back freedom of speech, article up by Steve Watson appearing
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:15.200]  on CNN Tuesday, Katrina Pearson defended Trump's use of the word vagina, or actually another
[03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:17.320]  word that starts with a P and ends in a Y.
[03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:22.560]  During a rally when he was talking about rival Ted Cruz, now the video of Trump repeating
[03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:27.280]  a supporter's jab at Cruz went viral as the crowd in attendance whooped and hollered in
[03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:28.280]  support.
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:31.760]  CNN asked Pearson whether she wished Trump had not used the language.
[03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:36.000]  If we're looking politically at the conditioning of the voters, maybe yes.
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:39.760]  But with my personal response, absolutely not, she replied.
[03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:42.600]  We have a full-blown assault on the First Amendment.
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:46.040]  Donald Trump has single-handedly brought back freedom of speech.
[03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:49.960]  Look, regardless of how you feel about Donald Trump, guess what, there's not that many people
[03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:51.200]  to choose from at the end of the day.

[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:26.440]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:27.440]  This isn't a game.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:28.440]  Hate speech.
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:30.400]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:34.840]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro gun position.
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:38.640]  1776 will commence again if you try to take off fire arms.
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:40.800]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:42.640]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:45.880]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:48.440]  It's an internet talk show called infowars.
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:50.880]  I heard that on Alex Jones so it's true.
[03:08:50.880 --> 03:08:51.880]  Dave.
[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:53.880]  I heard it on Alex Jones so I know it's true.
[03:08:53.880 --> 03:08:57.480]  You're making some very serious allegations against the US government saying that they
[03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:01.760]  stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against US citizens.
[03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:02.760]  Let's declassify.
[03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:04.160]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[03:09:04.160 --> 03:09:06.360]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:07.880]  That man's threatened this country.
[03:09:07.880 --> 03:09:09.600]  He became a conspiracy theorist.
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:10.600]  Deeply, I think racist.
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:12.600]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:15.000]  I'm considered legit among the crazy.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:19.880]  These Alex Jones do a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:20.880]  and pop them.
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:21.880]  I'd love to see that.
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:22.880]  In uniform.
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:27.880]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[03:09:27.880 --> 03:09:29.880]  I like that, guys.
[03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:45.880]  That is the best.
[03:09:45.880 --> 03:09:48.400]  We have gangsters running this country.
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:49.400]  Criminals, gangsters.
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:53.400]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:58.480]  We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:00.720]  The Globals are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[03:10:00.720 --> 03:10:03.200]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:07.680]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spage.
[03:10:07.680 --> 03:10:09.680]  This is real as it gets.
[03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:14.120]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me, said Matt, it's over
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:15.120]  for you.
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:17.320]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:18.320]  You're out of there.
[03:10:18.320 --> 03:10:20.320]  You want it, baby?
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:28.360]  You're about to get it.
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:34.280]  We just meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant and see how many
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:36.800]  guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:41.920]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:47.240]  Info wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:53.880]  cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom and I'm so proud of that.
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:59.200]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women, no, Bill rapes them physically
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:02.080]  and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[03:11:02.080 --> 03:11:06.520]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when
[03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:12.480]  you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:14.680]  These people are of the devil.
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:17.080]  Let's be very glad about this.
[03:11:17.080 --> 03:11:20.360]  Raise hell and demand accountability.
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:25.520]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate criminal government in American history.
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:33.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:36.280]  We're proud of now moving forward toward the barrier.
[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:41.080]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:46.080]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing war.
[03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:48.360]  That's right, my friends.
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:52.600]  We come to you from the very front lines of the information war and the fact that my little
[03:11:52.600 --> 03:11:58.520]  operation in 21 years has had the devastating effect against the enemy and has the testament
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:00.520]  to God Almighty, not us.
[03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:03.960]  There's a testament to all of you out there.
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:08.160]  That's what makes me so frustrated and so angry is because we're so close to freedom, folks.
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:16.240]  Not some utopia, but a true world based on human liberty, based on true liberalism.
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:20.520]  We have to defeat the counterfeits first, the Republican Democratic parties, the other
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:26.640]  crime syndicates that are threatened by human freedom, that are threatened by success, but
[03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:29.400]  we are so close, my friends.
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:31.800]  They can feel it slipping away from them.
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:37.920]  We are so close to human empowerment that is so amazing, and that's why I get so angry.
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:40.960]  You're not going to be fulfilled.
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:46.200]  There's always a balance with big, wealthy systems, and obviously it's good to have GIs
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:49.920]  and high bills and help folks and some systems.
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:52.880]  That's part of the normal community, but it's not socialism.
[03:12:52.880 --> 03:12:58.200]  When it's socialism itself or communism delivered from on high, and they tell you that wealth
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:05.040]  comes from redistribution, you've entered a very scary prison, and it goes the same way
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:06.040]  every time.
[03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:13.840]  I'm going to hand this over to Rob Duh, who's got a lot of other news today, but I just
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:18.440]  want the listeners to understand that, hey, we're winning.
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:19.760]  You're winning.
[03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:23.520]  World governments openly admitted the fact that the banks are rigged, the interest rates,
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:27.360]  the currency rates, everything is rigged.
[03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:33.520]  The fact that world governments being established, the fact that all this is happening, the admission
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:35.520]  of, yeah, we want to get rid of the family.
[03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:36.520]  It's bad.
[03:13:36.520 --> 03:13:41.320]  They've gone from, no, they want to get rid of your family to, well, of course we do.
[03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:42.320]  They're here.
[03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:43.320]  They're in our face.
[03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:47.240]  They have no power if we stop submitting to them.
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:52.760]  Well, their last major moves they have is, as I've said many times, is to start a civil
[03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:53.760]  war.
[03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:55.520]  They've tried to start a racial war.
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:14:00.720]  It doesn't mean there aren't some real issues from every perspective, but the globalists
[03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:03.320]  want that, so it's not good.
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:04.920]  You can see why it's not good.
[03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:05.920]  Same thing.
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:07.920]  There are a lot of bad police out there.
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:09.320]  There's bad things the cops are doing.
[03:14:09.320 --> 03:14:11.000]  I'm totally against it.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:12.720]  Most of that's globalist training.
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:16.320]  We want to just go out and shoot cops in the back of the head when they're pumping gas.
[03:14:16.320 --> 03:14:17.320]  No.
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:21.000]  That's, again, a globalist-saurus operation to create destabilization.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:24.640]  That's all they've got in the end is to get us fighting with each other.
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:27.440]  We have to stand against the new world order.
[03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:29.400]  We can do it together.
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:31.000]  It's happening now.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:36.640]  We have to realize real choice and real freedom comes from free market, but real free market,
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:46.000]  real politic, not this managed, controlled, engineered system, but we ourselves have to
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:51.880]  be strong and have to be involved and have to be chivalrous, and we'll change the world.
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:54.560]  We can't just blame the system.
[03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:55.680]  We have to be the leaders.
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:14:59.320]  We have to be the quote Obama, the change you want to see in the world.
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:03.320]  I'm going to hand the baton to you, Rob, do a great job, to the crew and everybody else.
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:04.760]  I'm coming back tomorrow.
[03:15:04.760 --> 03:15:08.640]  I'll be live in the studio, Lord willing, Friday.
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:14.160]  I don't take anything for granted, but Info Wars is a very special operation.
[03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:15.160]  We have providence.
[03:15:15.160 --> 03:15:16.360]  We can see it.
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:23.480]  We can feel it every day, but not just Info Wars, the American people have providence.
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:30.400]  America and its destiny affects world destiny, and other nations as well affect world destiny.
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:35.440]  Let's realize the incredible time and place we're in right now and be part of that, and
[03:15:35.440 --> 03:15:39.440]  not just decide that TV and the dominant culture dictates reality.
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:43.920]  They want to make us think they dictate reality because we dictate reality.
[03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:44.920]  All right.
[03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:49.080]  I'm ending with on right now to Rob do at the Central Texas Information Warfare Center
[03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:52.160]  Info Wars.com.
[03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:53.160]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:57.360]  That was Alex Jones reporting the parts unknown.
[03:15:57.360 --> 03:16:00.160]  He's taking a well deserved break, but he's also doing investigations.
[03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:03.400]  If you notice, Alex Jones really never takes a vacation.
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:08.080]  He is always out there working, always trying to show you how you're being manipulated,
[03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:13.680]  how society is trying to pull the wool over your eyes into what's really going on.
[03:16:13.680 --> 03:16:20.200]  One way I see this is an article that Kurt Nemo posted this morning, liberal media, only
[03:16:20.200 --> 03:16:25.520]  the brain dead support Trump, and there they have him depicted as a member of the insane
[03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:31.840]  clown posse, like the third member, the third leg of those guys, because only brain dead
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:33.040]  people would vote for Trump.
[03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:39.880]  I saw this last night from the Huffington Post, racist sexist people voted in mass to put
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:41.880]  Trump ahead in New Hampshire.
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:46.560]  Not looking at, if you voted for Rubio, you're not brain dead.
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:55.480]  If you voted for Kasich, Jeb Bush, it just boggles the mind that if you vote for somebody
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:16:59.280]  who's not establishment, the mainstream media will come after you.
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:05.880]  Now speaking of Jeb Bush, we've got some bombshell video of Jeb Bush making fun of
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:11.480]  9-11 victims' families, and he's not at a 9-11 rally or anything like making fun of
[03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:16.560]  them there, but wait till you see this video, wait till you see this video.
[03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:17.560]  Guys, do we have it yet?
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:22.440]  I know we're working on it in the, Josh Owens was working on editing it.
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:25.720]  Okay, we're going to play it in the next segment because I don't think we have time to get
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:29.680]  to it in this segment, but let me break it down for you.
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:36.160]  There's these 28 pages that are, they were emitted from the 9-11 commission report.
[03:17:36.160 --> 03:17:41.160]  Basically it talks about how we were in with Saudi Arabia and how we knew, they knew, they
[03:17:41.160 --> 03:17:45.280]  had the intelligence that the 9-11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and they were going
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:48.400]  to pull off this event, and that was buried.
[03:17:48.400 --> 03:17:53.480]  It was omitted from the 9-11 commission report, which even people who were on the commission
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:57.200]  said it was set up to fail, it was a boondoggle, it was a dog and pony show.
[03:17:57.200 --> 03:18:01.240]  Well, Richard Reeves, while he was out on the campaign trail, confronted Jeb Bush about
[03:18:01.240 --> 03:18:03.080]  the 28 pages.
[03:18:03.080 --> 03:18:09.340]  And what he says, anybody who voted for Jeb Bush, in my opinion, is brain dead.
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:14.600]  If you support Jeb Bush, you are brain dead because this man does not care about anything
[03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:16.480]  or anyone in our country.
[03:18:16.480 --> 03:18:23.760]  He cares about his legacy, he cares about the Bush family dynasty slash Clinton dynasty.
[03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:24.760]  That is who he's in it for.
[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:26.680]  He's not in it for you.
[03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:28.880]  There is no way in hell this man is in it for you.
[03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:34.320]  And you can see the way he mocks the question that is asked to him about the 28 pages.
[03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:38.800]  The biggest terror attack on our soil, if you really believe that it was an outside terror
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:40.800]  attack.
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:45.160]  Wait till you see this video and we tie it in with a bunch of other videos that people
[03:18:45.160 --> 03:18:49.440]  calling for the release of it, victims, families from 9-11 calling for the release of these
[03:18:49.440 --> 03:18:56.000]  28 pages, senators, congressmen talking about it, everybody wants to see what's on these
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:57.000]  28 pages.
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:00.840]  Yet no one's allowed to talk about it, no one's allowed to see it, we're not allowed
[03:19:00.840 --> 03:19:02.160]  to show it to us.
[03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:06.160]  And when asked about it, Jeb Bush makes it into a joke.
[03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:07.880]  Jeb Bush, you're the joke.
[03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:09.160]  That's the funniest thing.
[03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:10.160]  You're the joke.
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:15.720]  You spent, I think it came out $1,800 per vote that you got, and you're in what, third
[03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:23.600]  or fourth place, fourth place, $1,800 a vote, Trump spent $40 a vote, if you look at it.
[03:19:23.600 --> 03:19:26.920]  I mean, ridiculous what we have going on here.
[03:19:26.920 --> 03:19:29.800]  I'm also going to have John McAfee at the bottom of the hour and we're going to talk
[03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:35.160]  about Obama's new cyber security bill where he wants to put $8, $19 billion now to spend.
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:38.400]  And basically that's the set up of spy grid to spy on you.
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:43.760]  Yeah, they're going to be spying on you through your dishwasher, through your lights.
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:45.120]  Everything's going to be a spy device.
[03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:47.480]  Anything connected to the grid is going to be a spy device, so stay tuned for that and
[03:19:47.480 --> 03:19:48.480]  a whole bunch more.
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:53.400]  It's Rob Do with Fourth Hour of Overdrive, the Alex Jones show, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:19:53.400 --> 03:19:59.360]  Watch us live on TV, infowars.com, forward slash show, stay tuned.
[03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:03.560]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:07.120]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:10.240]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:10.240 --> 03:20:13.840]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of
[03:20:13.840 --> 03:20:14.840]  them.
[03:20:14.840 --> 03:20:16.400]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:16.400 --> 03:20:20.800]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of
[03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:22.200]  heart and body extract.
[03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:26.560]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:31.880]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:31.880 --> 03:20:36.720]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:38.160]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:42.200]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic cells.
[03:20:42.200 --> 03:20:44.040]  The body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:47.240]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:47.240 --> 03:20:49.640]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:04.440]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:21:04.440 --> 03:21:09.880]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors
[03:21:09.880 --> 03:21:13.880]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:20.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.680]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:21:22.680 --> 03:21:27.080]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:31.600]  Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:36.480]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:42.400]  I personally counter this onslaught with InfoWarsLife.com, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:24:06.880 --> 03:24:10.520]  Rob Dew here, quarterbacking the Overdrive Hour at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:16.920]  You can watch us on in-video, infowords.com, forward slash show, or you could go to prisonplanet.tv
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:18.120]  if you're a member.

[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:22.040]  I direct you now to the screen here.
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:28.120]  It shows our video when at four minutes ago, Jeb Bush mocks 9-11 victims' families.
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:29.120]  There it is right there.
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:30.120]  We just put this up.
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:31.960]  We're going to have an article coming out.
[03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:34.440]  And I want to play this video now.
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:37.480]  And this is Richard Reeves talking to Jeb Bush, asking about the 28 pages.
[03:24:37.480 --> 03:24:39.680]  We need to declassify him if you're president.
[03:24:39.680 --> 03:24:41.840]  And just watch his response.
[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:43.560]  This is what he thinks about you out there.
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:44.560]  So let's roll the video.
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:49.900]  You're doing well, excellent, good to see you.
[03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:50.960]  Governor Bush, how we doing?
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:51.960]  All right, good, how you doing?
[03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:54.860]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted
[03:24:54.860 --> 03:24:56.340]  from the 9-11 commissioner report?
[03:24:56.340 --> 03:24:57.680]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[03:24:57.680 --> 03:24:58.760]  Yes, yes, I would.
[03:24:58.760 --> 03:24:59.760]  Yeah.
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:00.760]  I'd like to see them.
[03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:01.760]  Got them?
[03:25:01.760 --> 03:25:02.760]  Well, we hope we can get them.
[03:25:02.760 --> 03:25:03.760]  Okay.
[03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:04.760]  Go ahead.
[03:25:04.760 --> 03:25:05.760]  Thank you.
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:06.920]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commissioner
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:08.720]  report, would you be willing to see those released?
[03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:09.720]  Yes, yes, sir.
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:10.720]  Yeah.
[03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:11.720]  I'd like to see them.
[03:25:11.720 --> 03:25:12.720]  Got them?
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:13.720]  Well, we hope.
[03:25:13.720 --> 03:25:17.560]  few who have seen them, they're known as the 28 pages.
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:20.280]  In those pages, our names of people
[03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:22.480]  would allegedly help the al-Qaeda killers,
[03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:24.200]  but who have never been held accountable.
[03:25:24.200 --> 03:25:26.760]  Potential sources of foreign support
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:29.280]  for the September 11 hijackers,
[03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:31.440]  classified by the Bush administration.
[03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:35.000]  Why the 28 pages remain hidden from the public
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  remains a mystery.
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:38.040]  We know the 28 pages from Senator Graham
[03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:39.920]  and Senator Jones that have seen it
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:41.620]  and military we've had on that have seen it.
[03:25:41.620 --> 03:25:43.540]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks
[03:25:43.540 --> 03:25:46.000]  to blame Iraq, that was always the plan.
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  And then our own government bare minimum stood down.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:49.560]  And of course it was more than that,
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:51.480]  but we have the fact that it now
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:53.680]  to a great extent was an inside job.
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:56.620]  I have read the 28 pages and the 28 pages
[03:25:56.620 --> 03:25:58.520]  have nothing to do with national security.
[03:25:58.520 --> 03:26:00.560]  Nothing, I wouldn't be standing here.
[03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:03.960]  It's all about relationships and involvement in 9-11.
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:06.400]  I want those documents declassified.
[03:26:06.400 --> 03:26:10.280]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product
[03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:12.120]  that is secret.
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:15.480]  I am convinced that there was a direct line
[03:26:15.480 --> 03:26:18.040]  between at least some of the terrorists
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:20.640]  who carried out the September 11 attacks
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:23.360]  and the government of Saudi Arabia.
[03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:25.560]  He called it a smoking gun.
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:29.480]  And he went on to say the reason for this coverup
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:32.240]  goes right up to the White House.
[03:26:32.240 --> 03:26:33.920]  This sort of shocking when you read it,
[03:26:33.920 --> 03:26:36.600]  as I read it, we all had our own experience.
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:38.600]  I had to stop every couple of pages
[03:26:38.600 --> 03:26:42.240]  and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:46.320]  my understanding of history for the past 13 years
[03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:48.120]  and the years leading up to that.
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:51.440]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:54.560]  What do we know is in the 28 censored pages
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:26:56.840]  of the 9-11 report, people that have seen it
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:26:58.520]  said it would bring down the whole system.
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:00.640]  I've been at that list and talked to multiple members
[03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:02.120]  of Congress who read it.
[03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:04.200]  They're convinced the American people need to see it.
[03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:05.360]  It has to do with information
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:08.280]  which is not convenient to the White House,
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:09.680]  either White House, the Clinton White House,
[03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:10.840]  or the Bush White House.
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:12.960]  And it has to do with an ally, but such a look
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.880]  the other way and allowed a lot of support
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:17.280]  for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:21.400]  We're here today to call for a release of those 28 pages.
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:25.040]  The survivors, civilian heroes, and families
[03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:27.720]  of the victims of September 11 terrorist attacks,
[03:27:27.720 --> 03:27:30.680]  some of whom are here today, deserve the full truth.
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:34.760]  We cannot let page after page of blanked out documents
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:37.400]  be obscured behind a veil, leaving these families
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:40.240]  to wonder if there is additional information
[03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:41.920]  surrounding these horrible acts.
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:49.520]  My son, Matthew C. Salido, was murdered September 11, 2001.
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:53.360]  On September 11, I lost my husband, Tom Strada.
[03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:55.240]  My husband, Victor, was the captain of the United
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:58.480]  Flight 175 that struck the South Tower of the World Trade
[03:27:58.480 --> 03:28:01.240]  Center on September 11 at 9.03 AM.
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:04.240]  My father never got to see me compete on my horse,
[03:28:04.240 --> 03:28:05.960]  cheer me on at a lacrosse scheme,
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:08.800]  or hear me speak at my middle school graduation.
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:13.840]  When you tell me there's a security risk
[03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:20.600]  and that's the reason you're not making these public,
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:25.960]  Mr. President, I call you a liar.
[03:28:25.960 --> 03:28:28.440]  He would be laughing and saying, you go get him, Terry.
[03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:29.680]  You go get him.
[03:28:29.680 --> 03:28:31.760]  Don't let them get away with this.
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:33.480]  Don't let them hide the truth.
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:35.940]  And don't let the people that were behind it
[03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:36.920]  not poll.
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:42.960]  Every nation in every region now has a decision to make.
[03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:48.960]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:28:48.960 --> 03:28:50.160]  Governor Bush, how are we doing?
[03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:51.600]  All right, good, how are you doing?
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:54.080]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages
[03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:56.360]  that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[03:28:56.360 --> 03:28:58.360]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[03:28:58.360 --> 03:28:59.200]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:28:59.880]  Got them?
[03:28:59.880 --> 03:29:02.840]  When I dream of my wedding day, I will carry his picture
[03:29:02.840 --> 03:29:04.400]  and wish he were there with me.
[03:29:04.400 --> 03:29:05.240]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[03:29:05.240 --> 03:29:05.880]  Got them?
[03:29:05.880 --> 03:29:09.320]  My son's dead.
[03:29:09.320 --> 03:29:11.880]  And I don't know all the facts.
[03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:12.720]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[03:29:12.720 --> 03:29:13.360]  Got them?
[03:29:13.360 --> 03:29:16.480]  Keeping it a secret about those who facilitated it
[03:29:16.480 --> 03:29:18.760]  must end now.
[03:29:18.760 --> 03:29:19.680]  Well, Andrea may have.
[03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:20.720]  Hopefully we can get them.
[03:29:20.720 --> 03:29:22.800]  Thank you.
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:25.600]  That's sad sack of pus, Jeb Bush.
[03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:27.200]  We have the article right here exclusive.
[03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:31.120]  Jeb Scurries when confronted on missing pages of 9-11 report.
[03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:33.200]  This man is a disgrace to humanity.
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:35.600]  Get this video out to everybody you know.
[03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:37.600]  We'll be right back with John McAfee here.
[03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:39.720]  He won't be here in studio, but he'll be on the line.
[03:29:39.720 --> 03:29:40.200]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:40.200 --> 03:29:49.520]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:51.960]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:54.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:58.920 --> 03:30:02.480]  This is Joe Vicks with infowars.com, campaign aid.
[03:30:02.480 --> 03:30:05.840]  Trump has single-handedly brought back freedom of speech.
[03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:07.600]  Article up by Steve Watson.
[03:30:07.600 --> 03:30:10.920]  Appearing on CNN Tuesday, Katrina Pearson
[03:30:10.920 --> 03:30:14.280]  defended Trump's use of the word vagina,
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:17.240]  or actually another word that starts with a P&Ns and a Y,
[03:30:17.240 --> 03:30:21.240]  during a rally when he was talking about rival Ted Cruz.
[03:30:21.240 --> 03:30:23.960]  Now, the video of Trump repeating a supporter's jab at Cruz
[03:30:23.960 --> 03:30:26.240]  went viral as the crowd in attendance
[03:30:26.240 --> 03:30:27.920]  whooped and hollered in support.
[03:30:27.920 --> 03:30:30.320]  CNN asked Pearson whether she wished Trump
[03:30:30.320 --> 03:30:32.000]  had not used the language.
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:34.480]  If we're looking politically at the conditioning
[03:30:34.480 --> 03:30:36.120]  of the voters, maybe yes.
[03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:39.640]  But with my personal response, absolutely not, she replied.
[03:30:39.640 --> 03:30:42.520]  We have a full-blown assault on the First Amendment.
[03:30:42.520 --> 03:30:46.240]  Donald Trump has single-handedly brought back freedom of speech.
[03:30:46.240 --> 03:30:48.240]  Look, regardless of how you feel about Donald Trump,
[03:30:48.240 --> 03:30:48.680]  guess what?
[03:30:48.680 --> 03:30:51.160]  There's not that many people to choose from at the end of the day.
[03:30:51.160 --> 03:30:54.120]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.

[03:31:17.280 --> 03:31:20.800]  known to energize the body's natural processes.
[03:31:20.800 --> 03:31:24.360]  That are blocked by estrogen mimicers and other toxic elements
[03:31:24.360 --> 03:31:25.360]  in the food chain.
[03:31:25.360 --> 03:31:28.120]  Supermail vitality from infowarslife.com

[03:31:51.040 --> 03:31:55.120]  and infowarslife.com, and I salute you, our supporters.
[03:31:55.120 --> 03:31:56.120]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:31:56.120 --> 03:31:57.120]  Good, brother.
[03:31:57.120 --> 03:31:58.680]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:31:58.680 --> 03:32:00.280]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:00.280 --> 03:32:02.480]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[03:32:02.480 --> 03:32:04.480]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:04.480 --> 03:32:06.960]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:09.320]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:09.320 --> 03:32:13.240]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's
[03:32:13.240 --> 03:32:15.240]  own natural processes.
[03:32:15.240 --> 03:32:18.240]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:18.240 --> 03:32:21.240]  We do the supermail and the super-female vitality.
[03:32:21.240 --> 03:32:23.240]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:23.240 --> 03:32:26.240]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots,
[03:32:26.240 --> 03:32:28.240]  a statement, a ton of money there.
[03:32:28.240 --> 03:32:30.240]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[03:32:30.240 --> 03:32:32.240]  harvested around the planet,
[03:32:32.240 --> 03:32:35.240]  and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[03:32:35.240 --> 03:32:38.240]  They want to stun and dumb down,
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:40.240]  and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[03:32:40.240 --> 03:32:42.240]  but then burn you out, in my experience,
[03:32:42.240 --> 03:32:45.240]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[03:32:45.240 --> 03:32:46.240]  goes right to the source.
[03:32:46.240 --> 03:32:48.240]  So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[03:32:48.240 --> 03:32:50.240]  Visit infowarslife.com today

[03:33:26.240 --> 03:33:29.240]  I walk along the avenue
[03:33:29.240 --> 03:33:31.240]  Welcome back to the Fourth Hour of Overdrive.
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:33.240]  I'm your host Rob Do.
[03:33:33.240 --> 03:33:34.240]  Did you get there during the break?
[03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:35.240]  We had a three-minute break there.
[03:33:35.240 --> 03:33:36.240]  Did you get out the video?
[03:33:36.240 --> 03:33:38.240]  Jeb Bush mocks 9-11 victims' families?
[03:33:38.240 --> 03:33:40.240]  Did you send that out to everybody you know?
[03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:42.240]  We also have the article, exclusive Jeb Bush scurries
[03:33:42.240 --> 03:33:45.240]  when confronted on missing pages of 9-11 report.
[03:33:45.240 --> 03:33:46.240]  Yeah, he's a little parasite
[03:33:46.240 --> 03:33:48.240]  that doesn't want to tell you what's happening.
[03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:51.240]  You can see here, I tweeted it out.
[03:33:51.240 --> 03:33:53.240]  If you can get a shot of that on the overhead cam.
[03:33:53.240 --> 03:33:55.240]  Get this video out to everyone you know.
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:33:59.240]  Right there, Jeb Bush mocks 9-11 victims' families
[03:33:59.240 --> 03:34:00.240]  with the YouTube link.
[03:34:00.240 --> 03:34:02.240]  Also underneath that, I want to show you this, too.
[03:34:02.240 --> 03:34:04.240]  Everybody's talking about Bernie Sanders' big win.
[03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:06.240]  Got 60% of the votes.
[03:34:06.240 --> 03:34:08.240]  Look at the delegate numbers over here.
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:09.240]  He's got 13.
[03:34:09.240 --> 03:34:12.240]  Hillary got 15, with not even 40%.
[03:34:12.240 --> 03:34:14.240]  That's common core math, people.
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:15.240]  Right there.
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:17.240]  That's what the socialists are going to bring you.
[03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:19.240]  And we have Leah McAdoo.
[03:34:19.240 --> 03:34:21.240]  She's going to be reporting on that tonight
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:24.240]  on the Infowars Nightly News hosted by Jakari Jackson.
[03:34:24.240 --> 03:34:25.240]  We're going to have that.
[03:34:25.240 --> 03:34:26.240]  And coming up, we're going to have John McAfee,
[03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:28.240]  who's on the line right now.
[03:34:28.240 --> 03:34:30.240]  But first, you got one day left.
[03:34:30.240 --> 03:34:32.240]  Get Silver Bullet for 15% off,
[03:34:32.240 --> 03:34:35.240]  plus another 10% off if you're using auto-ship.
[03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:36.240]  You've heard me talk about Silver Bullet.
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:39.240]  I mean, this is powerful stuff.
[03:34:39.240 --> 03:34:40.240]  Very, very power.
[03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:42.240]  I use it all the time.
[03:34:42.240 --> 03:34:43.240]  Stuffed up nose.
[03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:44.240]  Shooted up my nose.
[03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:46.240]  Lungs are congested.
[03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:47.240]  Breathe in, mist.
[03:34:47.240 --> 03:34:50.240]  I forget what those things are called.
[03:34:50.240 --> 03:34:51.240]  Nebulizer.
[03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:52.240]  Nebulizer.
[03:34:52.240 --> 03:34:53.240]  I have a sonic nebulizer.
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:54.240]  Man, let me tell you.
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:56.240]  Silver Bullet is awesome.
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:02.240]  30 parts per million of silver based in a deionized water source for years.
[03:35:02.240 --> 03:35:04.240]  I use it all the time.
[03:35:04.240 --> 03:35:08.240]  And you got one more day to get 15% off, plus 10% off if you use auto-ship.
[03:35:08.240 --> 03:35:11.240]  And auto-ship is great because you don't have to remember to reorder it.
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:13.240]  It just, boom, it's automatically there.
[03:35:13.240 --> 03:35:14.240]  Boom, boom.
[03:35:14.240 --> 03:35:17.240]  You can set it up for, they have different, yeah, look at that.
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:20.240]  30 days, 14 days, 42 days, 60 days.
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:23.240]  So there you can set it up with auto-ship and you get an extra 10% off.
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:29.240]  Also, we have another special that ends tomorrow and that is the Anthroplex Super Male Vitality 2-Pack.
[03:35:29.240 --> 03:35:32.240]  All right, I guess it's, you get them both together, one each.
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:35.240]  You get 15% off and free shipping and that special ends tomorrow.
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:40.240]  Anthroplex is synergistically works with Super Male Vitality by using key ingredients that
[03:35:40.240 --> 03:35:48.240]  you've been asking for like horny goatweed, zinc orate, and a new balanced blend of other organic herbs.
[03:35:48.240 --> 03:35:55.240]  Anthroplex was created to help restore your masculine foundation and stimulate your vitality with its own blend of unique ingredients.
[03:35:55.240 --> 03:36:00.240]  Now, my guest coming up, who is definitely, he's a gun enthusiast.
[03:36:00.240 --> 03:36:05.240]  He's an entrepreneur, inventor of McPhee antivirus software, it's John McAfee.
[03:36:05.240 --> 03:36:08.240]  And we're going to talk about Obama's cybersecurity plan.
[03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:12.240]  He wants $19 billion now to basically spy on you.
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:14.240]  Mac, we just have an article come out by Kit Daniels.
[03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:18.240]  John McAfee, Obama administration too incompetent to implement cybersecurity.
[03:36:18.240 --> 03:36:20.240]  Totally agree with him on that.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:22.240]  I don't think it's there to implement cybersecurity.
[03:36:22.240 --> 03:36:25.240]  I think it's there to bolster the spy grid.
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:27.240]  So I want to get his opinions on that as well.
[03:36:27.240 --> 03:36:32.240]  And he says it will end in failure if implemented according to cybersecurity expert John McAfee.
[03:36:32.240 --> 03:36:36.240]  He's been a long time guest on this show, big time gun enthusiast.
[03:36:36.240 --> 03:36:37.240]  I've gone out shooting with him a couple of times.
[03:36:37.240 --> 03:36:39.240]  John, how are you doing?
[03:36:39.240 --> 03:36:40.240]  I'm doing great sir.
[03:36:40.240 --> 03:36:41.240]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:42.240]  Well, thank you.
[03:36:42.240 --> 03:36:49.240]  Being a gun enthusiast, I think Alex put out a video last year of he and I shooting a
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:50.240]  50 caliber handheld.
[03:36:50.240 --> 03:36:51.240]  That's right.
[03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:52.240]  Sidearm.
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:53.240]  I had, I had, yeah.
[03:36:53.240 --> 03:36:58.240]  And you're not going to find a photo of me anywhere online where I'm not either packing
[03:36:58.240 --> 03:37:03.240]  with a shoulder holster or carrying a shotgun or an AR-15 or something.
[03:37:03.240 --> 03:37:09.240]  I am indeed a gun enthusiast, a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
[03:37:09.240 --> 03:37:13.240]  And I oppose any and all regulations.
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:14.240]  I like it.
[03:37:14.240 --> 03:37:15.240]  I like it.
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:17.240]  You're also running for Libertarian nomination too.
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:23.240]  I'm running for Libertarian nomination for the presidential election in November.
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:27.240]  If I feel certain, I will get that nomination.
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:31.240]  I joined the Libertarian party for a couple of reasons.
[03:37:31.240 --> 03:37:34.240]  Number one, I started my own party, the cyber party.
[03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:42.240]  As we got into it, by the way, I'm $9 million in debt now attempting to get on state ballots.
[03:37:42.240 --> 03:37:48.240]  Ross Perot with all of his billions only managed to get on 37 state ballots.
[03:37:48.240 --> 03:37:53.240]  We estimated a cost of between 50 and 70 million dollars.
[03:37:53.240 --> 03:37:55.240]  Now there's something wrong with this system.
[03:37:55.240 --> 03:38:00.240]  I mean, it is screwed up where you cannot be an average American.
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:07.240]  No matter how talented, intelligent, dedicated or how much you want to serve this country.
[03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:13.240]  And win against the two giant machines that rule this country.
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:14.240]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:20.240]  That's so they could parade people out like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich.
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:22.240]  Just people with no real substance.
[03:38:22.240 --> 03:38:26.240]  I'm kind of iffy on Ted Cruz as well.
[03:38:26.240 --> 03:38:32.240]  And so far, I like the fact that Trump's an outsider, but he's also he's kind of an insider as well.
[03:38:32.240 --> 03:38:34.240]  But at least he's using his own money.
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:36.240]  He's not taking money from the taxpayers.
[03:38:36.240 --> 03:38:37.240]  He's not getting money from today.
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:38.240]  He's putting up his own money.
[03:38:38.240 --> 03:38:41.240]  And so you've had to put up your own money as well to get on these ballots.
[03:38:41.240 --> 03:38:46.240]  How hard is it as a third party candidate to get on a state ballot?
[03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:50.240]  Well, it's virtually impossible in states like California and Florida.
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:54.240]  I mean, the expense is enormous.
[03:38:54.240 --> 03:38:57.240]  You have to have 500,000 signatures.
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:39:00.240]  Do you guys want to cost per signature?
[03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:04.240]  We're talking about 10 to $15 per signature.
[03:39:04.240 --> 03:39:06.240]  It's an insane system.
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:11.240]  So the Libertarian Party has ballot access in all 50 states.
[03:39:11.240 --> 03:39:12.240]  That's what they bring.
[03:39:12.240 --> 03:39:17.240]  What I bring is technology and cybersecurity into the Libertarian Party,
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:22.240]  which has been lacking in the Libertarian Party up until this point.
[03:39:22.240 --> 03:39:24.240]  So I think it's a perfect mix.
[03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:29.240]  And in terms of my own heart, I have lived the life of a Libertarian.
[03:39:29.240 --> 03:39:33.240]  I believe in personal freedom, small government.
[03:39:33.240 --> 03:39:36.240]  I mean, some days I would wake up and say no government.
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:37.240]  It's that bad.
[03:39:37.240 --> 03:39:38.240]  I hear you there.
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:47.240]  We have our government that sucks up $3.8 trillion a year in nonsense programs.
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:56.240]  Our Department of Housing and Urban Development is $1.2 trillion a year for doing what?
[03:39:56.240 --> 03:40:02.240]  And the Department of Agriculture, $300 billion to pay farmers not to grow food.
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:04.240]  I mean, it's insane.
[03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:05.240]  It has to change.
[03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:10.240]  And as far as cybersecurity is concerned, we have none.
[03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:16.240]  Two days ago, it was announced that the FBI was hacked.
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:19.240]  And also the Department of Homeland Security.
[03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:20.240]  How convenient.
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:21.240]  How convenient, right?
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:23.240]  How convenient.
[03:40:23.240 --> 03:40:28.240]  And Obama's plan, which is basically education, will do nothing.
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:34.240]  I mean, we are on the verge of a cyber war with China and Russia.
[03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:38.240]  There's no difference between those two countries as far as relationship to the U.S. is concerned.
[03:40:38.240 --> 03:40:41.240]  They both would like to see us disappear.
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:43.240]  And they have a technology.
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:50.240]  Push a button today and shut down our entire power grid, our emergency services, our communications,
[03:40:50.240 --> 03:40:53.240]  our food distribution systems.
[03:40:53.240 --> 03:40:56.240]  We would collapse as a nation.
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:41:00.240]  And we have no alternative because we have no way to fight it.
[03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:07.240]  Proof, last year, the Department of Personnel Management, 21 million records of every employee
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:12.240]  of the U.S. government for the past 50 years, was sucked up by the Chinese.
[03:41:12.240 --> 03:41:14.240]  It was like taking candy from a baby.
[03:41:14.240 --> 03:41:16.240]  This cannot stand.
[03:41:16.240 --> 03:41:19.240]  We have to have strong cybersecurity.
[03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:25.240]  And there is simply no one in the government today capable of designing and implementing.
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:27.240]  Well, and no one trusts the government either.
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:32.240]  I mean, here we have, this is wired back in, I think, 2013, no, 2012.
[03:41:32.240 --> 03:41:35.240]  CAA chief will spy on you through your dishwasher.
[03:41:35.240 --> 03:41:36.240]  That's what they're concerned about.
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:38.240]  They're not concerned about cybersecurity.
[03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:43.240]  They're concerned about spying on the American people to find out who doesn't agree with their agenda.
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:45.240]  And here's another one just came out in November.
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:47.240]  Lifi has just been tested in the real world.
[03:41:47.240 --> 03:41:49.240]  It's 100 times faster than Wi-Fi.
[03:41:49.240 --> 03:41:51.240]  All that stuff is going to be connected to the grid.
[03:41:51.240 --> 03:41:54.240]  And that's basically Wi-Fi through light pulses.
[03:41:54.240 --> 03:41:56.240]  It's going to be reading stuff through light pulses.
[03:41:56.240 --> 03:41:58.240]  Tell us how that technology works, John.
[03:41:58.240 --> 03:42:00.240]  Well, you know, it doesn't work very well.
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:03.240]  I mean, it works extremely well, but not for our benefits.
[03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:04.240]  Exactly.
[03:42:04.240 --> 03:42:07.240]  Most of the Internet of Things uses off-the-shelf software.
[03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:13.240]  I mean, for example, a refrigerator manufacturer,
[03:42:13.240 --> 03:42:18.240]  they know everything about making things cold efficiently and keeping it cold.
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:23.240]  Most know nothing about cybersecurity, so they buy off-the-shelf components,
[03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:28.240]  which can be easily hacked into, not just by hackers, but by our government.
[03:42:28.240 --> 03:42:35.240]  Now, our government is basically a criminal organization operating behind a black curtain
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:37.240]  that we cannot see through.
[03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:41.240]  We don't have a clue where our tax dollars go, what's actually happening.
[03:42:41.240 --> 03:42:45.240]  I mean, we're talking about Hillary Clinton's emails.
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:49.240]  They are so confidential that even members of Congress cannot read them.
[03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:51.240]  Nobody knows what is really happening.
[03:42:51.240 --> 03:42:53.240]  That also has to change.
[03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:56.240]  The government was created to serve the people.
[03:42:56.240 --> 03:43:00.240]  That is the government of the people, by the people, for the people.
[03:43:00.240 --> 03:43:07.240]  But now it's become a government of the powerful, by the powerful, and for the powerful.
[03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:09.240]  That has to stop.
[03:43:09.240 --> 03:43:10.240]  I totally agree.
[03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:11.240]  Go back to China.
[03:43:11.240 --> 03:43:12.240]  What you said about China.
[03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:13.240]  Here's an article.
[03:43:13.240 --> 03:43:16.240]  Security backdoor found in China made US military chip.
[03:43:16.240 --> 03:43:19.240]  So we're designing these chips, but they're getting made in China,
[03:43:19.240 --> 03:43:21.240]  and they have secret backdoors in them.
[03:43:21.240 --> 03:43:24.240]  Everything is coming out of China, and it all can be hacked,
[03:43:24.240 --> 03:43:29.240]  because either A, we're not designing our stuff right, so that means we're incompetent,
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:33.240]  or two, we're designing stuff with those backdoors so we can use them,
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:35.240]  but also the Chinese are piggybacking on that.
[03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:42.240]  What's worse than the military stuff is the fact that every single router used in America today
[03:43:42.240 --> 03:43:47.240]  uses chips designed and created by China,
[03:43:47.240 --> 03:43:52.240]  and we have already discovered that China has placed backdoors into those chips.
[03:43:52.240 --> 03:43:54.240]  Now think about this.
[03:43:54.240 --> 03:44:00.240]  That means that our entire communication system could be shut down if we piss off the Chinese,
[03:44:00.240 --> 03:44:02.240]  and you know that will happen.
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:04.240]  We don't even have to make them angry.
[03:44:04.240 --> 03:44:05.240]  They don't like us.
[03:44:05.240 --> 03:44:07.240]  This is a fact of life.
[03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:08.240]  They really do not.
[03:44:08.240 --> 03:44:10.240]  I'm sorry to say it.
[03:44:10.240 --> 03:44:12.240]  And for good cause.
[03:44:12.240 --> 03:44:19.240]  I mean, we have been the world's policemen for 50 years interfering in the affairs of our nation.
[03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:25.240]  You know, we bomb countries right and left, and then we wonder why people are angry at us.
[03:44:25.240 --> 03:44:28.240]  Good God, we need to look in the mirror.
[03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:32.240]  We have problems here at home that are not being solved.
[03:44:32.240 --> 03:44:34.240]  Instead, why should they?
[03:44:34.240 --> 03:44:38.240]  Because we are the enemy to our government.
[03:44:38.240 --> 03:44:40.240]  They treat us like the enemy.
[03:44:40.240 --> 03:44:42.240]  Going through the TSA, what do you do?
[03:44:42.240 --> 03:44:46.240]  You take off your shoes, you take off your belt, hands in the air, being frisked.
[03:44:46.240 --> 03:44:47.240]  They scrutinize you.
[03:44:47.240 --> 03:44:48.240]  Prisoner training it.
[03:44:48.240 --> 03:44:49.240]  Prisoner training.
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:51.240]  It feels like going into prison.
[03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:55.240]  They even say hands up when you go into the body scanner.
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:57.240]  They go hands up, hands up.
[03:44:57.240 --> 03:44:59.240]  I don't feel protected.
[03:44:59.240 --> 03:45:00.240]  I feel like the enemy.
[03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:03.240]  And if I feel like the enemy, I am the enemy.
[03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:09.240]  We have a heart for a reason so that we can sense the insanity around us.
[03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:17.240]  And it is insane to say, look, the NSA says we want to investigate every aspect of your life.
[03:45:17.240 --> 03:45:19.240]  Because we want to protect you.
[03:45:19.240 --> 03:45:26.240]  And we can't do that unless we can assure you that you are not the enemy we're protecting you from.
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:27.240]  Think about it.
[03:45:27.240 --> 03:45:29.240]  That's the reality.
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:30.240]  It's crazy.
[03:45:30.240 --> 03:45:36.240]  And you're trusting the government with this power to keep you safe when they can't even build a healthcare website
[03:45:36.240 --> 03:45:40.240]  with billions of dollars thrown into it, hundreds of millions thrown into it.
[03:45:40.240 --> 03:45:44.240]  And they can't even make a damn website work that's supposed to give you their free healthcare that they talk about.
[03:45:44.240 --> 03:45:46.240]  No, no. And actually the healthcare costs more now.
[03:45:46.240 --> 03:45:47.240]  Yeah.
[03:45:47.240 --> 03:45:49.240]  So we spent $200 million.
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:54.240]  We have a first hundred billion building it, another hundred million fixing it, and it's still not fixed.
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:56.240]  And now everybody has to pay more.
[03:45:56.240 --> 03:45:58.240]  It is a monstrosity.
[03:45:58.240 --> 03:46:00.240]  Everything about it.
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:05.240]  And now they want $19 billion to update the cybersecurity grid across this nation.
[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:06.240]  You think that's going to keep you safe?
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:09.240]  You think that's going to keep your credit card records safe?
[03:46:09.240 --> 03:46:11.240]  No, private companies do that.
[03:46:11.240 --> 03:46:17.240]  Yes, how are they going to do it? Because there obviously is no one inside the government today capable of doing it.
[03:46:17.240 --> 03:46:23.240]  Every single agency within the United States government has been hacked for the past two years.
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:30.240]  So Christ, if there is someone in the government that is capable, they need to be fired because they haven't done their job.
[03:46:30.240 --> 03:46:34.240]  No, the fact is no one within the government is capable.
[03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:36.240]  It is too bureaucratic.
[03:46:36.240 --> 03:46:38.240]  It is too old.
[03:46:38.240 --> 03:46:44.240]  It is managed by sick, tired, old directors that need to go home.
[03:46:44.240 --> 03:46:46.240]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[03:46:46.240 --> 03:46:50.240]  And in fact, you actually, didn't you go testify in front of Congress at one point?
[03:46:50.240 --> 03:46:52.240]  No, I refused. I refused.
[03:46:52.240 --> 03:46:54.240]  Because it wouldn't have done any good.
[03:46:54.240 --> 03:46:57.240]  For Obamacare, yes, the Republicans asked me to come and testify.
[03:46:57.240 --> 03:46:59.240]  I said, what good is it going to do?
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:01.240]  No, I refused.
[03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:04.240]  Well, because seriously, do you think it would have mattered?
[03:47:04.240 --> 03:47:11.240]  No, we have a machine that has its own direction, its own power, and its own purpose.
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:17.240]  And me, even as a cybersecurity specialist, I can't change that.
[03:47:17.240 --> 03:47:22.240]  We need to invoke Article 5, and so every sentence that gets out of there,
[03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:28.240]  or we need someone as a president with the strength and the conviction to serve this country
[03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:32.240]  and to change what he can change, or she can change.
[03:47:32.240 --> 03:47:34.240]  And we haven't had that since Dwight Eisenhower.
[03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:37.240]  I'm not saying Dwight was a great president,
[03:47:37.240 --> 03:47:40.240]  but he was the last president who didn't want to be the president.
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:41.240]  The gut.
[03:47:41.240 --> 03:47:45.240]  He had nuclear arsenals at his command during the war.
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:46.240]  He was the general.
[03:47:46.240 --> 03:47:48.240]  He had battleships and planes.
[03:47:48.240 --> 03:47:52.240]  Do you think it was a promotion to be the president?
[03:47:52.240 --> 03:47:54.240]  No, he did not want to do it,
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:48:01.240]  but he had the need to serve the country that he had protected, and he did so.
[03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:02.240]  And that was in the 50s.
[03:48:02.240 --> 03:48:03.240]  I lived in the 50s.
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:04.240]  I'm 70 years old.
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:07.240]  I know what dreams are made of now.
[03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:10.240]  In the 50s, anything was possible.
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:11.240]  Anything.
[03:48:11.240 --> 03:48:12.240]  Now what's possible?
[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:15.240]  Well, a lot of government regulations in the red state,
[03:48:15.240 --> 03:48:21.240]  the absolute certainty of the worst coming.
[03:48:21.240 --> 03:48:24.240]  The government picking winners and losers in business,
[03:48:24.240 --> 03:48:28.240]  they get to decide who's going to move on into the next round.
[03:48:28.240 --> 03:48:29.240]  And it's sick.
[03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:31.240]  And they want to kill innovation.
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:36.240]  If you want to start a business, you've got thousands of pages of documents.
[03:48:36.240 --> 03:48:38.240]  You've got to prove your work shape is placed.
[03:48:38.240 --> 03:48:40.240]  You've got to prove all kinds of nonsense,
[03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:43.240]  which have nothing to do with entrepreneurism,
[03:48:43.240 --> 03:48:48.240]  taking an idea which can help all of us and implementing it.
[03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:50.240]  It's almost impossible today.
[03:48:50.240 --> 03:48:55.240]  It is because the government wants control over everything.
[03:48:55.240 --> 03:48:57.240]  I don't need a mother and father.
[03:48:57.240 --> 03:49:01.240]  We did not create the government to be our mom and pop,
[03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:03.240]  to tell us what to do.
[03:49:03.240 --> 03:49:04.240]  Hell no.
[03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:08.240]  We created the government so that we could tell it what to do.
[03:49:08.240 --> 03:49:11.240]  It should be our service, not our boss.
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:15.240]  It has become our boss, our manager, our mom and pop.
[03:49:15.240 --> 03:49:18.240]  It tells us what we can put into our bodies,
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:20.240]  what life-saving drugs we cannot have
[03:49:20.240 --> 03:49:23.240]  because they may be dangerous to the terminally ill patients.
[03:49:23.240 --> 03:49:28.240]  They tell us that we cannot openly carry guns even though
[03:49:28.240 --> 03:49:32.240]  the Second Amendment doesn't say you have the right to own guns.
[03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:38.240]  It says you have the right to bear arms, carry them on your person.
[03:49:38.240 --> 03:49:41.240]  I mean, this has been traditional since the beginning of time.
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:43.240]  In the Renaissance, everybody had a sword.
[03:49:43.240 --> 03:49:45.240]  Why? We didn't have guns back then.
[03:49:45.240 --> 03:49:48.240]  We have the right to bear arms.
[03:49:48.240 --> 03:49:51.240]  But no, the government wants to take that even away from us.
[03:49:51.240 --> 03:49:55.240]  Why? Because if we are all bearing arms,
[03:49:55.240 --> 03:49:57.240]  it is much more difficult to control our ass.
[03:49:57.240 --> 03:49:58.240]  I agree.
[03:49:58.240 --> 03:50:01.240]  And I showed last week a video that a lady shot on a cell phone.
[03:50:01.240 --> 03:50:03.240]  This is in Mexico.
[03:50:03.240 --> 03:50:06.240]  Six well-armed Mexican police officers high-tailing it
[03:50:06.240 --> 03:50:09.240]  when the cartel showed up to come put a hit on a guy.
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:10.240]  They high-tailed it out of there.
[03:50:10.240 --> 03:50:12.240]  They come in and grab the guy from his family,
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:14.240]  take him outside and shoot him and take off,
[03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:15.240]  and the cops are running.
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:17.240]  Because the cops aren't there to protect you.
[03:50:17.240 --> 03:50:19.240]  They're there to do things like,
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:21.240]  we have another article that's going to come out today.
[03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:23.240]  I got an email from a listener.
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:25.240]  His mom woke up to all these sounds.
[03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:28.240]  SWAT team is outside a chicken farm.
[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:30.240]  Going to conduct a raid on a chicken farm.
[03:50:30.240 --> 03:50:32.240]  Are they looking for somebody? No.
[03:50:32.240 --> 03:50:34.240]  The Humane Society is there to look at the cages.
[03:50:34.240 --> 03:50:36.240]  So we got to have a SWAT team go in there
[03:50:36.240 --> 03:50:37.240]  and escort these people.
[03:50:37.240 --> 03:50:39.240]  That's the lunacy of government.
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:41.240]  John, we're about to go to break.
[03:50:41.240 --> 03:50:44.240]  We'll have you on the next segment here, about five minutes.
[03:50:44.240 --> 03:50:46.240]  John McAfee running for libertarian party
[03:50:46.240 --> 03:50:48.240]  for president of the United States.
[03:50:48.240 --> 03:50:49.240]  You're watching Rob Do.
[03:50:49.240 --> 03:50:51.240]  This is theInfoWorst.com Alex Jones show.
[03:50:51.240 --> 03:51:20.240]  Fourth hour of overdrive. Thanks for watching.
[03:51:21.240 --> 03:51:22.240]  Thanks for watching.
[03:51:22.240 --> 03:51:51.240]  You can get a four month supply of Extendivite.
[03:51:53.240 --> 03:52:00.240]  Extend your life with Extendivite.
[03:52:00.240 --> 03:52:03.240]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:06.240]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:09.240]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[03:52:09.240 --> 03:52:11.240]  and prepare a defense.
[03:52:11.240 --> 03:52:15.240]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching
[03:52:15.240 --> 03:52:18.240]  filled with bombs, they had drums of their own,
[03:52:18.240 --> 03:52:20.240]  air raid sirens.
[03:52:20.240 --> 03:52:23.240]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:24.240]  for quiet war.
[03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:26.240]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[03:52:26.240 --> 03:52:30.240]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[03:52:30.240 --> 03:52:34.240]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:37.240]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[03:52:37.240 --> 03:52:43.240]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[03:52:43.240 --> 03:52:47.240]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[03:52:47.240 --> 03:52:49.240]  inside the human body.
[03:52:49.240 --> 03:52:52.240]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[03:52:52.240 --> 03:52:55.240]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[03:52:55.240 --> 03:53:20.240]  and start at InfoWarsLife.com with Anthroplex.

[03:53:55.240 --> 03:53:58.240]  Easy, affordable, effective.
[03:54:18.240 --> 03:54:21.240]  Alright, final segment of the InfoWars.com.
[03:54:21.240 --> 03:54:24.240]  This is Jones' show, fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:26.240]  It's a long title there.
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:28.240]  My guest for this last segment is John McAfee.
[03:54:28.240 --> 03:54:33.240]  You can go check out his platform at McAfee2016.com.
[03:54:33.240 --> 03:54:36.240]  There he's got a nice little statement there.
[03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:38.240]  The President's job is to find common ground
[03:54:38.240 --> 03:54:40.240]  in which all Americans, excluding none, can stand.
[03:54:40.240 --> 03:54:43.240]  I'm told that is impossible, yet I can give you one clear example.
[03:54:43.240 --> 03:54:46.240]  We are all humans and share the commonalities
[03:54:46.240 --> 03:54:49.240]  of fear, love, anger, jealousy, hope, and compassion.
[03:54:49.240 --> 03:54:51.240]  If we start there, we can begin the conversation
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:54.240]  and perhaps grow that commonality into a substantive base
[03:54:54.240 --> 03:54:58.240]  to affect real positive change in our nation, John McAfee.
[03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:01.240]  And you can also, there's a donate box there as well.
[03:55:01.240 --> 03:55:02.240]  Join the movement.
[03:55:02.240 --> 03:55:03.240]  There's plenty of ways you can help out.
[03:55:03.240 --> 03:55:05.240]  John, what are some ways people can help you out
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:07.240]  to become the Libertarian nominee?
[03:55:07.240 --> 03:55:10.240]  Well, first of all, if you believe in the audience
[03:55:10.240 --> 03:55:14.240]  that in any way that I can bring sanity back into this country,
[03:55:14.240 --> 03:55:16.240]  then we need your help.
[03:55:16.240 --> 03:55:19.240]  Go to McAfee2016.com, press the donate button,
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:23.240]  even if it's 50 cents, whatever you can spare.
[03:55:23.240 --> 03:55:27.240]  We need your help in order to change America.
[03:55:27.240 --> 03:55:29.240]  Read the platform.
[03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:31.240]  See if you do or do not agree with me.
[03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:35.240]  I think that you will find in your heart that you do agree.
[03:55:35.240 --> 03:55:37.240]  I stand for small government.
[03:55:37.240 --> 03:55:40.240]  I stand for individual rights, which we've lost.
[03:55:40.240 --> 03:55:43.240]  I stand for privacy, which we have none of today.
[03:55:43.240 --> 03:55:48.240]  None. We are being spied on in every respect by our government.
[03:55:48.240 --> 03:55:51.240]  The worst spymaster of all.
[03:55:51.240 --> 03:55:54.240]  I believe that we have the right to bear arms
[03:55:54.240 --> 03:55:58.240]  and to do with our lives as we please,
[03:55:58.240 --> 03:56:01.240]  as long as we don't get people and take their stuff.
[03:56:01.240 --> 03:56:06.240]  So please go to McAfee2016.com, press the donate button.
[03:56:06.240 --> 03:56:08.240]  We seriously need your help.
[03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:10.240]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:56:10.240 --> 03:56:13.240]  And I tell you what, the Libertarian Party is exactly opposite
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:15.240]  of what you see in the two establishment parties.
[03:56:15.240 --> 03:56:19.240]  I've been voting Libertarian, I think since the second Clinton election.
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:22.240]  I believe it was Harry Brown who I voted for,
[03:56:22.240 --> 03:56:25.240]  because I'm reading about the Republicans and Democrats,
[03:56:25.240 --> 03:56:27.240]  and I'm like, I don't agree with either one of these guys.
[03:56:27.240 --> 03:56:29.240]  And then I go, what else is out there?
[03:56:29.240 --> 03:56:31.240]  And somebody said, check out the Libertarian Party,
[03:56:31.240 --> 03:56:35.240]  and I went and read about them, and I'm like, Libertarian, that's what I am.
[03:56:35.240 --> 03:56:38.240]  Fiscal, conservative, socially liberal.
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:42.240]  Yes, and I think this year is the first year that the Libertarian
[03:56:42.240 --> 03:56:44.240]  have a chance of winning.
[03:56:44.240 --> 03:56:46.240]  I really believe I can win this election.
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:48.240]  I do.
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:51.240]  I have the credentials, certainly not in government.
[03:56:51.240 --> 03:56:54.240]  I don't want government credentials, I don't think.
[03:56:54.240 --> 03:56:56.240]  In business, I run a business.
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:57:00.240]  I know that you can't just print money when you want to spend something.
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:07.240]  I know that the government has become so bureaucratically overburdened
[03:57:07.240 --> 03:57:09.240]  that it no longer serves us.
[03:57:09.240 --> 03:57:10.240]  It no longer serves us.
[03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:13.240]  It was created to serve the people.
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:14.240]  What's happening?
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:16.240]  We have to serve the government.
[03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:18.240]  We have to do what the government says.
[03:57:18.240 --> 03:57:19.240]  Bullshit.
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:21.240]  The government should do what we say.
[03:57:21.240 --> 03:57:25.240]  And as president, I will ensure the best of my ability,
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:31.240]  that that's what happens to bring sanity back to this crazy establishment
[03:57:31.240 --> 03:57:36.240]  that has become a machine that grinds the soul of whoever
[03:57:36.240 --> 03:57:38.240]  becomes part of it.
[03:57:38.240 --> 03:57:41.240]  And if you stand up to it, they will do everything in their power
[03:57:41.240 --> 03:57:43.240]  to totally crush you.
[03:57:43.240 --> 03:57:46.240]  They'll take your life, your liberty, your pursuit of happiness.
[03:57:46.240 --> 03:57:48.240]  They'll take it all from you.
[03:57:48.240 --> 03:57:50.240]  They've already tried that with me, man.
[03:57:50.240 --> 03:57:56.240]  I am the biggest target of the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI now.
[03:57:56.240 --> 03:57:57.240]  I really am.
[03:57:57.240 --> 03:57:58.240]  I'm followed everywhere I go.
[03:57:58.240 --> 03:58:00.240]  Because you know they're a fraud.
[03:58:00.240 --> 03:58:01.240]  They are a fraud.
[03:58:01.240 --> 03:58:05.240]  The entire government is a criminal organization.
[03:58:05.240 --> 03:58:09.240]  That's the best way to describe them, operating in complete secrecy
[03:58:09.240 --> 03:58:13.240]  from the people that they are designed to serve.
[03:58:13.240 --> 03:58:14.240]  Yep.
[03:58:14.240 --> 03:58:16.240]  Well, the dogs are barking.
[03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:18.240]  They must be voting for John McAfee.
[03:58:18.240 --> 03:58:19.240]  They obviously support you.
[03:58:19.240 --> 03:58:20.240]  John, thanks for joining us today.
[03:58:20.240 --> 03:58:25.240]  McAfee 2016.com is where you can find out all the information on his run
[03:58:25.240 --> 03:58:27.240]  for Libertarian for President.
[03:58:27.240 --> 03:58:30.240]  It's going to be a crazy election season, but we'll be here covering it all
[03:58:30.240 --> 03:58:31.240]  at infowars.com.
[03:58:31.240 --> 03:58:32.240]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[03:58:32.240 --> 03:58:34.240]  Thanks for joining me on the fourth hour tonight.
[03:58:34.240 --> 03:58:35.240]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[03:58:35.240 --> 03:58:36.760]  the Infowars Nightly News.
