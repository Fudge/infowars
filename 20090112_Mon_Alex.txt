[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:35.240]  Texas Alex Jones all right I am Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones and I'll
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.280]  be here all week we got a jam-packed week plenty of guests plenty of news
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.200]  actually plenty of things that Alex hasn't covered I came down here
[00:45.200 --> 00:52.320]  Thursday and pretty much by Friday I was helping out on the Obama film and I
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.360]  gotta tell you I'm excited about this film because so many people are fooled
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.960]  by this guy and I know that Alex has been harping on it but this is what's
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.120]  coming for the future and I think it really really needs to be discussed I
[01:04.120 --> 01:08.680]  mean when people like I ignored it when Joe Biden said there was gonna be some
[01:08.680 --> 01:14.320]  huge crisis and mark my words Obama will be tested I ignored it I thought you
[01:14.320 --> 01:19.800]  know he's just rhetoric an election trying to get elected but when I saw the
[01:19.800 --> 01:24.400]  Colin Powell clip and I've been kind of out of the loop where Colin Powell gives
[01:24.400 --> 01:32.160]  a date of January 20th or 21st or I'm sorry it's 21st or 22nd that a crisis
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.040]  that the people just don't even know about yet that perked my ears up
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.520]  because what you have here first of all Biden is a total establishment candidate
[01:40.520 --> 01:46.480]  and to prove that I mean so that some of Biden's ideas are simply just
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.320]  unbelievable in the 90s he wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal I
[01:51.320 --> 01:56.360]  believe was in 1992 grabbing it right now and it was called how I learned to
[01:56.360 --> 02:05.200]  love the New World Order now basically he tries to pose the pose the position
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.520]  that if you're if you're pro-liberty pro-constitution you're an isolationist
[02:10.520 --> 02:14.280]  and that's not how things are gonna get done basically he's a total globalist
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.200]  he's CFR Council on Foreign Relations and there's this Mao quote I want to find
[02:19.200 --> 02:26.840]  here I printed out it's it's unbelievable basically says that we
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.080]  have to be slicker than Mao ever was in order to do this he's basically saying
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.640]  we can't go down the barrel of a gun all the way talks about Dick Cheney he's
[02:36.640 --> 02:42.120]  very very very very critical of Papua cannons positions in the early 90s so
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.280]  this is an establishment guy he knows damn well what's going on I mean he
[02:46.280 --> 02:53.520]  asked Judge Roberts about about how he was going to rule when he had to decide
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.720]  whether human beings should be taking a chip or not that's right a chip a track
[02:57.720 --> 03:02.680]  and trace government chip and then it got even more minority report and we're
[03:02.680 --> 03:07.000]  gonna play that one second I got it pulled up right here and he said we're
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.640]  also gonna you're also gonna be ruling mark my words on whether we can scan
[03:10.640 --> 03:13.840]  people's brains to see if they're going to commit a crime so let's let's play
[03:13.840 --> 03:17.080]  that clip really quick it's a quick clip
[03:19.360 --> 03:25.680]  we don't have any audio his body to track his own there can a microscopic tag
[03:25.680 --> 03:29.600]  being planted in a person's body to track is every movement there's actual
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.560]  discussion about that you will rule on that mark my words before your tenure
[03:34.560 --> 03:39.480]  is over can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined
[03:39.480 --> 03:45.640]  toward criminality or violent behavior you will rule on that and really that
[03:45.640 --> 03:50.040]  was not that long ago I think that's about three or four years ago when
[03:50.040 --> 03:54.640]  when Roberts was confirmed for for the Supreme Court and why don't why do I
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.720]  harp on Biden in the beginning well Biden's over in Pakistan amid the
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.800]  India tensions the Mumbai attacks you know the fact that that we're now
[04:02.800 --> 04:05.720]  demonizing Pakistan a little bit but I want to read you this article out of
[04:05.720 --> 04:10.080]  yahoo news Pakistan said Friday that it sent feedback and information to India
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.120]  about the Mumbai attacks and Joe Biden came here to underscore how seriously
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.720]  the incoming US administration takes the terror threat from South Asia yeah
[04:18.720 --> 04:22.320]  that's why you're meeting with the head of the ISI you know the ISI again had
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.280]  their hands all over 9-11 New Delhi recently said it gave Islam about a
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.040]  dossier of evidence linking the Mumbai attacks to Pakistan but it was unclear
[04:30.040 --> 04:34.920]  of Pakistan's feedback related directly to that dossier so basically he went
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.760]  there to you know reestablish CI connection so they can cover this whole
[04:38.760 --> 04:44.440]  thing up it's the Alex Jones show I am Jason Burma sitting in info wars.com
[04:44.440 --> 04:59.800]  prisonplanet.tv
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.440]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.440 --> 05:07.680]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:07.680 --> 05:11.240]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:11.240 --> 05:14.520]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.360]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:18.360 --> 05:21.360]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.240]  bailout for special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[05:25.240 --> 05:29.600]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.880]  least out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.640]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.720]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[05:41.720 --> 05:45.920]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[05:45.920 --> 05:50.180]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[05:50.180 --> 05:53.920]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:53.920 --> 05:57.640]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:57.640 --> 06:01.240]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.240 --> 06:05.400]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.400 --> 06:08.920]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing and on food one third of
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.720]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[06:12.720 --> 06:16.920]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[06:16.920 --> 06:19.880]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[06:19.880 --> 06:23.080]  having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot
[06:23.080 --> 06:26.640]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:26.640 --> 06:30.360]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[06:30.360 --> 06:33.760]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[07:20.240 --> 07:27.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[07:27.760 --> 07:36.720]  Alex Jones all right we are back and Joe Biden is in Pakistan now basically
[07:36.720 --> 07:43.880]  trying to cover up the ISI and CIA role in the biotech let me just show you how
[07:43.880 --> 07:47.320]  closely associated they are in the next few paragraphs of this article out of
[07:47.320 --> 07:54.720]  yahoo news Biden visits Pakistan amid India tensions Jelani told reporters
[07:54.720 --> 07:58.520]  that the CIA had planned played an intermediary role and that Pakistan's
[07:58.520 --> 08:02.480]  premier spy agency the inner services intelligence had reviewed the information
[08:02.480 --> 08:07.200]  from India he gave a few other details and eat intermediary role now they set
[08:07.200 --> 08:13.040]  them up they've controlled them heavily since the late 70s I mean British
[08:13.040 --> 08:16.080]  intelligence set them up in the late 40s so really they've been heavily
[08:16.080 --> 08:20.600]  controlled the entire time India gave 52 pages of information to the CIA that was
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.800]  passed the ISI and the Pakistani agency gave feedback and information that was
[08:25.800 --> 08:32.760]  handed to India in return Jelani said the America CIA and Pakistani ISI have an
[08:32.760 --> 08:37.560]  old working relationship if any information is required we are ready to
[08:37.560 --> 08:45.280]  cooperate all right now Pakistani ISI and the CIA have their hands all over the
[08:45.280 --> 08:52.920]  moon biotechs you send a guy like Joe Biden in there who really he's known
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.240]  about the Pakistan role in this intelligence forever he gets on the
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.240]  floor in fact yeah he brought up the clip already great job Jaren see this
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.560]  guy reads my mind on what I want to play next and basically Joe Biden is well
[09:05.560 --> 09:09.840]  aware that the Pakistani ISI carries out black ops false flag terrorism see it's
[09:09.840 --> 09:13.920]  called plausible deniability so what they do and say a 9-11 case is they fund
[09:13.920 --> 09:18.560]  the hijackers through the ISI you know Muhammad Allah was caught taking a
[09:18.560 --> 09:21.680]  hundred thousand white dollar wire transfer from the ISI the head of the
[09:21.680 --> 09:27.040]  ISI through Omar Omar side shake who had his hands all over the Daniel Pearl
[09:27.040 --> 09:32.520]  murder supposedly according to Benazir Budo before she was murdered somehow
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.160]  assassinated Osama bin Laden that was on the BBC never to be played again so
[09:37.160 --> 09:42.000]  again this is a cloak and dagger network in the Middle East and Joe Biden is well
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.480]  aware of it in fact on on 912 he got on the floor of the Senate and he threatened
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.760]  Pakistan saying that they were pretending to be our friends he met with the
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.720]  head of the Pakistani ISI while he was in Washington DC the week of 9-11 and
[09:56.720 --> 10:02.280]  that same gentleman general Mamoud Ahmed was also meeting with the likes of
[10:02.280 --> 10:06.320]  George Tennant the then head of the CIA and on the morning of 9-11 of course
[10:06.320 --> 10:10.040]  he's having breakfast with the two co-chairs of the initial congressional
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.520]  investigation Porter Gross and Bob Graham so let's play that the teaser for
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.520]  my film fabled enemies you can get it right now at info wars dot com where
[10:19.520 --> 10:23.480]  you can really see Joe Biden and his knowledge of the Pakistani ISI
[10:23.480 --> 10:29.000]  senator Joe Biden who had also met with the head of the Pakistani ISI would have
[10:29.000 --> 10:37.720]  harsh words on the Senate floor and the word should go out to those who
[10:37.720 --> 10:43.600]  pretend that they wish to be our friends that they're going to have to make
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.360]  some very difficult choices Pakistan in particular is going to have to make a
[10:49.360 --> 10:57.200]  very difficult choice very soon words will not be sufficient actions will be
[10:57.200 --> 11:03.040]  demanded when Biden was confronted he confirmed his meeting with Ahmed saying
[11:03.040 --> 11:10.080]  Pakistani intelligence was indeed funding the Taliban in the days in the
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.960]  days following 9-11 you met with the head of Pakistani ISI general Muhammad
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.720]  Ahmed it has since come to light that he ordered Saeed Sheikh to wire 100,000
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.600]  miles to Muhammad Adam why was he allowed to go back to Pakistan and why
[11:21.600 --> 11:24.960]  was he questioned and why were you meeting with him I met with him to
[11:24.960 --> 11:32.360]  deliver a message that if he didn't if he didn't stop supporting the Taliban we
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.200]  would take him and why do we let him go we let him fly freely we never
[11:35.200 --> 11:38.480]  investigated him we never even looked into him look there's thing called
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.560]  diplomatic passports we did not arrest Khrushchev when he came but he
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.760]  financed the hijackers and you let him go and he's free hijacked by hijackers
[11:46.760 --> 11:54.080]  he hijacked it's wired he would later state that the information was indeed
[11:54.080 --> 12:10.560]  classified so there you have it and I want to read this quote from his his
[12:10.560 --> 12:14.320]  article back in the 90s in the Wall Street Journal how I learned to love the
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.520]  new world order most Americans myself included reject the 1930s style
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.360]  isolationism they expect to see the strong hand of American leadership in
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.320]  world affairs and they know that economic retreat would yield nothing
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.080]  other than a lower standard of living you hear that they understand further
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.840]  that many security threats here the security threats the spread of high
[12:35.840 --> 12:41.040]  tech weapons environmental degradation okay it's all about global warming getting
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.240]  you ready for a carbon tax even in the early 90s and tell you I mean that's
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.640]  their plan overpopulation okay so who are we gonna kill what what do you mean
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.800]  overpopulation I mean it's not just about birth control when you were when
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.960]  you run eugenics programs in Africa and you allow these third-world nations to
[13:01.960 --> 13:09.520]  have you know high job mortality rates the spread of disease improper care you
[13:09.520 --> 13:15.120]  send you send in people to immunize them for quote-unquote malaria and then you
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.120]  sterilize a hundred thousand people in fact I'm gonna have to get that article
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.120]  that's an old-school article I mean you know oh we accidentally sterilized all
[13:23.120 --> 13:28.280]  these people sure you did so again high-tech weapons in that environmental
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.440]  degradation overpopulation the next one's narcotics trafficking well who
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.000]  ships in all the drugs we do we do and that's another thing you know Barry
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.320]  seal and all those guys get caught some of them come clean say that they're
[13:42.320 --> 13:45.960]  they're running drugs from South America in exchange for weapons that they're
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.880]  bringing down there and then seal goes public and they try to make them out
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.840]  like a hero that he was working to entrap noriega noriega is a 26 year CIA
[13:54.840 --> 14:01.720]  asset and then seal gets gunned down later assassinated on narcotics
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.040]  trafficking migration require global solutions see everything's about
[14:06.040 --> 14:12.320]  globalization here's the here's the part I really like what about America as
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.000]  global cop first our 21st century strategy has to be a shade more clever
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.120]  than Mao Zaiism and that power became from at the barrel of a gun it just has
[14:22.120 --> 14:28.200]  to be a little more clever than Mao's philosophy because again the CIA funded
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.400]  and backed Mao unbelievable power also emanates from a solid bank of balance
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.480]  the ability to dominate and penetrate markets and the economic leverage to
[14:37.480 --> 14:43.120]  wield diplomatic clout so also have to have control the economy
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.040]  Biden is bad news brown and he's a likable guy it's really it's really
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.080]  unfortunate folks and I you know what I want to give a shout out before I forget
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.080]  to BL I don't know if he's listening but folks the only reason that we're able
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.920]  to get some of these news clips a lot of them aren't on the internet is because
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.800]  you know some of you listeners out there tape c-span for us tape CNN headline
[15:05.800 --> 15:10.800]  news tape O'Reilly for us and you send us DVDs and that's what we're really in
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.600]  the middle of doing is going through all these DVDs and I've been capturing so
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.520]  much Obama stuff I mean it's pretty amazing I don't want to spoil too much
[15:19.520 --> 15:24.360]  of the Obama stuff that we've captured but folks if you're not listening he
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.240]  says he's going to send more troops into Afghanistan you see when they say that
[15:28.240 --> 15:31.040]  they're going to get rid of all the troops in Iraq that's not true what
[15:31.040 --> 15:34.040]  they're gonna do is they're gonna redeploy most of them to Afghanistan
[15:34.040 --> 15:37.520]  they're gonna keep a certain number of them in there and they'll probably
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.200]  bring in some kind of a NATO or Blackwater force to regulate further
[15:42.200 --> 15:48.160]  and really that's been one of the plans all along is to create a Eurasian union
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.040]  out of this you know people like Brzezinski have wrote about it for years
[15:52.040 --> 15:58.480]  I mean people like Brzezinski were on the Obama advisory team for his election
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.080]  and they're the same guys that literally brought you al-Qaeda trained the
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.920]  Mujahideen radicalized them you know the same guys that were involved in you
[16:07.920 --> 16:13.520]  know turning Osama bin Laden into an asset for the CIA and the list goes on
[16:13.520 --> 16:21.360]  so you know the Obama thing it's just totally amazing to me before he was on
[16:21.360 --> 16:25.520]  Letterman he went on Letterman on September 10th of this year and he gave
[16:25.520 --> 16:29.600]  a pretty you know it's a lighthearted back and forth you could tell Letterman
[16:29.600 --> 16:34.680]  was a supporter Letterman even brings up 9-11 and you know from what I
[16:34.680 --> 16:39.280]  understand there was a breakdown of many of the systems and really oh Obama
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.800]  really whitewashes the whole thing he's he like half agrees with Dave but says
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.640]  you know any president under that stress and we could have never foreseen it you
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.640]  know the standard liberal I'm not really gonna look at any of the hard
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.920]  questions answer but when he was a senator he went on there and he talked
[16:59.920 --> 17:05.800]  about building a world order and of course he went to Berlin Germany and
[17:05.800 --> 17:09.880]  gave a speech this year where he talked about global citizenship and we're all
[17:09.880 --> 17:17.120]  going to have to come together and do our part and you know even in his acceptance
[17:17.120 --> 17:24.400]  speech he said you know I am going to call on you you and you're going to have
[17:24.400 --> 17:29.720]  to help me and give service to this country and sacrifice so you know get
[17:29.720 --> 17:34.480]  get ready for this movie let's let's play the clip of unfortunately at the
[17:34.480 --> 17:38.040]  ending the guy repeats world order a couple of times we can't find the clip
[17:38.040 --> 17:41.760]  clean in fact there you go listeners I could really use some help if you can
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.280]  give me Obama's first appearance on Letterman I'd really appreciate it
[17:46.280 --> 17:51.320]  Obama calls for a world order the way we're gonna win over the long term is
[17:51.320 --> 17:55.880]  not just militarily we got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.040]  order world order world order world order that I think all of us would like
[18:00.040 --> 18:06.240]  yeah unfortunately why do people do that you kill me with that but but again you
[18:06.240 --> 18:09.560]  know he's he's basically telling the people of the Middle East that we're
[18:09.560 --> 18:13.800]  gonna have to give them a stake in this new world order you know in in fact in
[18:13.800 --> 18:17.000]  this how I learned to love the new world order speech Dick Cheney is quoted
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.040]  about the new world order in it as well but he was a huge new world order
[18:21.040 --> 18:25.720]  proponent you know for my new film I'm working on Invisible Empire I have this
[18:25.720 --> 18:30.720]  clip where Dick Cheney basically goes before the UN and signs a document on
[18:30.720 --> 18:36.120]  the new world order and what's her name I think it's Connie Chung yeah what's it
[18:36.120 --> 18:39.280]  Maury's wife there she's the one reporting it but the new world order
[18:39.280 --> 18:43.120]  doesn't exist you know it's just a figment of my imagination apparently Joe
[18:43.120 --> 18:46.680]  Biden can write articles about it Dick Cheney can be quoted on it and sign
[18:46.680 --> 18:50.600]  documents about it but on the coop coming up after this Colin Powell warns us

[23:22.520 --> 23:27.240]  Alex Jones taking a much-deserved vacation with his family I wish him the best
[23:27.240 --> 23:32.640]  and it's the new year we got a new president coming in he'll be sworn in I
[23:32.640 --> 23:37.240]  think it's just over a week now I think what's today the 11th am I am I
[23:37.240 --> 23:43.720]  totally missing the day ah it's gonna be soon enough and people like Colin Powell
[23:43.720 --> 23:51.440]  oh it is a 13th am I that far off 12th oh it's the 12th so yeah what do we got
[23:51.440 --> 23:58.520]  we got eight days we got one one day over a week that is correct and first of
[23:58.520 --> 24:04.280]  all when I'm watching him actually get into office I mean again we're going
[24:04.280 --> 24:07.440]  through the tapes people are talking about how his transition team was ready
[24:07.440 --> 24:11.840]  since May they knew somehow they were gonna be president since May all right
[24:11.840 --> 24:15.960]  and then of course we know that Obama and goes to the Bilderberg meeting right
[24:15.960 --> 24:20.520]  after he's chosen as the Democratic nominee he goes there with Hillary I
[24:20.520 --> 24:25.040]  mean come on folks if you're naive enough to believe that Obama ditched his
[24:25.040 --> 24:32.680]  entire press corps okay had his his aid basically sweating bullets trying to
[24:32.680 --> 24:35.880]  make up some kind of a lie of where they were they put out dis info that they're
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.560]  at Hillary's house they have to admit that's lie and then later the story is
[24:39.560 --> 24:43.880]  oh we were at Diane Feinstein's house no they were at the Bilderberg meeting with
[24:43.880 --> 24:47.920]  144 of the world's elites and a few that are off the record people like Henry
[24:47.920 --> 24:51.680]  Kissinger people like David Rockefeller people like Greenspan Connelly's a
[24:51.680 --> 24:58.120]  rice I could go on and David Gergen kind of called it during that secret meeting
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.000]  as I was going over the footage he says well you know we whether or not it's
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.960]  over the vice presidency there's a very good chance she could be a secretary
[25:06.960 --> 25:13.720]  estate and of course that's exactly what she's going to be so it really does
[25:13.720 --> 25:17.040]  worry me and they also said that Obama was gonna come out with some executive
[25:17.040 --> 25:20.920]  orders out of the gates well that's pretty crazy I mean and it's all over the
[25:20.920 --> 25:24.880]  news now people are being prepped finally finally the news is telling you
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.240]  this is the worst economic situation since the Great Depression I'm seeing
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.840]  that everywhere you know Alex Jones called it years and years and years ago
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.320]  he warned you as they you know inflated the dollar to nothing gave you a fiat
[25:37.320 --> 25:41.600]  currency basically took away all the values invested in foreign assets robbed
[25:41.600 --> 25:46.320]  your pensions took away the entire industrial market here we don't make
[25:46.320 --> 25:49.560]  anything anymore and really the last thing we did make his cars and it looks
[25:49.560 --> 25:53.760]  like ultimately that's going to go under as well I believe Toyota actually
[25:53.760 --> 26:01.040]  Toyota the Japanese car company posted its first loss since the 50s all right
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.520]  when Japan is hurting on their on their deal in fact what's I got an article
[26:06.520 --> 26:13.280]  right here how bad it is where's that article right here manufacturing slumps
[26:13.280 --> 26:18.480]  at fastest pace since 1981 you know I know a lot of you guys are living in the
[26:18.480 --> 26:28.240]  past but 1981 was now 28 years ago okay just I mean it's it's almost 30 years
[26:28.240 --> 26:31.720]  ago this out of Reuters by the way factory output slumped in November at
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.840]  its fastest annual pace since 1981 increasing the likelihood that the
[26:35.840 --> 26:40.920]  economy shrank sharply at the end of 2008 and faces a deep recession in 2009
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.920]  the office for national statistics said on Friday manufacturing output was 7.4
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.800]  percent lower than a year earlier it's biggest fall since June of 1981 when
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.200]  Britain was in the throes of the industrial meltdown that disseminated
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.720]  its car industry that deaths I'm sorry decimated its car industry and coal mines
[26:59.720 --> 27:06.720]  yeah I see our car industries over with it's done production was down 2.9% in
[27:06.720 --> 27:10.800]  November alone the biggest monthly fall since one off-plant closure for the
[27:10.800 --> 27:14.320]  Queen's Jubilee of the summer of 2002 and more than four times the drop
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.960]  forecast by economics pulled by routers yeah see these guys these economicist
[27:19.960 --> 27:28.400]  these economic these economists these economists need a job they need to be
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.560]  able to comment for Reuters for CNN so of course they're not gonna play it up as
[27:32.560 --> 27:37.160]  bad as this you know at least Kramer goes off a little bit for his bad as is
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.440]  but he's telling people to reinvest in the market market's dead it's about
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.080]  gold and silver I mean gold's taken a little bit of a hit right now but you
[27:45.080 --> 27:48.880]  get it while it's cheap because it's always going to have a value you know
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.240]  silver's taken a little bit of a hit over the last few years guess what get it
[27:52.240 --> 27:57.160]  well it's cheap because it's gonna still have value I mean quite frankly and I
[27:57.160 --> 28:01.400]  hope I'm wrong about this when Cohen Powell talks about a crisis that the
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.400]  American people don't know about on the 21st or 22nd imagine if it was a total
[28:06.400 --> 28:10.520]  and complete collapse of the dollar and it was a restructuring of our economic
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.960]  system there might be some serious serious riots going on in the streets
[28:15.960 --> 28:20.600]  but Obama might bring us together I mean after all I can get a t-shirt at the
[28:20.600 --> 28:24.040]  mall with his face on it and not a yes we can t-shirt like I said it's not a
[28:24.040 --> 28:28.440]  vote for me t-shirt it's the new hip wear when I flew in the guys wearing the
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.440]  Obama Ruby hat so on the other side we're gonna play this Colin Powell clip

[33:00.040 --> 33:04.840]  the Colin Powell giving a date not you know two months down the line or three
[33:04.840 --> 33:11.960]  months down the line something's gonna happen but an actual date an actual date
[33:11.960 --> 33:20.800]  of when when this thing is gonna go down the 21st or 22nd apparently there's a
[33:20.800 --> 33:26.760]  crisis that nobody even knows about yet well the only thing that I can you know
[33:26.760 --> 33:31.080]  who knows me maybe I'm way off here but seeing where we're actually hearing
[33:31.080 --> 33:35.440]  people talk about economic crisis Bush went on the news last night and look
[33:35.440 --> 33:41.720]  like he was gonna cry basically and I made some mistakes I can't believe this
[33:41.720 --> 33:48.520]  happened under my watch forgive me forgive me whatever he's just gonna be
[33:48.520 --> 33:52.960]  golfing in Dubai in the next few months I'm sure so so let's play the clip let's
[33:52.960 --> 33:55.760]  play Powell telling us that there's going to be some kind of a crisis it
[33:55.760 --> 34:01.160]  only be economic in my mind I would start with talking to the American people
[34:01.160 --> 34:06.840]  and talking to the world and conveying a new image of American leadership a new
[34:06.840 --> 34:11.120]  image of America's role in the world the problems will always be there and
[34:11.120 --> 34:14.960]  there's going to be a crisis come along on the 21st or 22nd of January that we
[34:14.960 --> 34:24.840]  don't even know about right now all right now that's spooky to me so I'm not
[34:24.840 --> 34:28.760]  saying I'm not calling for Armageddon I'm not saying everything in the world is
[34:28.760 --> 34:31.960]  going to collapse but I really think that there is going to be something I
[34:31.960 --> 34:36.120]  mean if it's not on the 21st or 22nd possibly the end of January the beginning
[34:36.120 --> 34:40.840]  of February and you know in the economic turmoil where maybe they're just gonna
[34:40.840 --> 34:46.040]  say you know what social security is gone we're keeping it all that wouldn't
[34:46.040 --> 34:51.460]  shock me either all right I want to shift gears a little bit I've harped on
[34:51.460 --> 34:56.120]  Obama we've got a movie coming out it's gonna be awesome you really you're
[34:56.120 --> 35:01.320]  really gonna see behind the scenes I mean you know what we should play one
[35:01.320 --> 35:04.760]  more Obama clip before before we get off the subject because I mentioned that
[35:04.760 --> 35:07.840]  you know Obama and Hillary met in Bilderberg that's probably where it was
[35:07.840 --> 35:10.640]  decided whether she was gonna be Secretary of State or not where where her
[35:10.640 --> 35:14.720]  role was going to be in the administration and one of the big
[35:14.720 --> 35:17.920]  Bilderbergers out there is a guy named Henry Kissinger you may have heard of
[35:17.920 --> 35:28.320]  him okay mr. Kissinger was on CNBC last week and actually you know I just play
[35:28.320 --> 35:31.280]  the clip let's let's hear what mr. Kissinger has to say about Obama and
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.720]  what he should be doing remember this is a bit of a person and detectives coming
[35:34.720 --> 35:38.680]  to office at a moment when they are upheavals in many parts of the world
[35:38.680 --> 35:47.800]  simultaneously you have India Pakistan you have the she-hearted movement so he
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.120]  can't really say that it's one problem that it's the most important one but he
[35:52.120 --> 35:59.000]  can give a new impetus to American foreign policy partly because the
[35:59.000 --> 36:05.200]  reception of him is so extraordinary around the world I think his task will be
[36:05.200 --> 36:10.640]  to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new
[36:10.640 --> 36:19.800]  world order can be created it's a great opportunity it isn't a crisis all right
[36:19.800 --> 36:24.720]  there you go so again I mean Kissinger has been pulling for a new world order
[36:24.720 --> 36:28.960]  since the 70s he's saying that this is yet another great opportunity
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.400]  for a new world order you notice that it has a nexus point with the India and
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.160]  Pakistan situation and of course the jihadist movement that they created
[36:38.160 --> 36:43.560]  that they can say it again that they created by radicalizing the freedom
[36:43.560 --> 36:49.720]  fighters into the Mujahideen into quote-unquote al-Qaeda all right which is
[36:49.720 --> 36:55.080]  really just a CIA database file named for the base okay that's just a database
[36:55.080 --> 37:00.040]  on all the Mujahideen fighters you didn't know that I mean it's pretty common
[37:00.040 --> 37:05.080]  knowledge I know I know people like to stay on their childlike state of
[37:05.080 --> 37:10.760]  ignorance and really just worry about their new iPhone app you know yeah you
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.520]  can drink a beer on the iPhone you ever seen it who cares it's absolutely
[37:15.520 --> 37:21.400]  ridiculous but you tell them something like this that you know Barack Obama is
[37:21.400 --> 37:25.560]  not good for America that he's an internationalist that he's somebody
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.040]  who's meant to bring us together and bring us into a North American Union a
[37:30.040 --> 37:35.840]  new a new global currency possibly it'll probably be a North American currency
[37:35.840 --> 37:41.480]  but possibly a global currency who knows who knows what these people will do
[37:41.480 --> 37:48.240]  all right I want to shift gears when I saw this today you know I was just good
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.280]  for some reason I wanted to bring up you know the genetic modifications what
[37:52.280 --> 37:55.480]  they're doing because this is a new scientific society I mean when Joe
[37:55.480 --> 38:00.760]  Biden talks about microchips and brain scans that's not the only thing around
[38:00.760 --> 38:06.160]  and we'll play the video probably well when we actually get on the air cuz I
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.880]  want you to actually see this but I'm gonna I'm gonna read the article now
[38:08.880 --> 38:12.840]  this one is out of National Geographic but there's there's also an MSNBC
[38:12.840 --> 38:18.320]  article we'll talk about that later glowing pig passes genes to piglets now
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.760]  I think it was about three years back I remember watching a countdown with
[38:22.760 --> 38:27.360]  Olbermann and all of a sudden I saw these pigs that were glowing in the dark
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.040]  and what they had done is they injected them with a jellyfish DNA and it made
[38:32.040 --> 38:38.920]  them glow you know these these things were chimeras and a chimera is the
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.480]  genetic splicing of more than one organ organism and I was just like whoa and
[38:44.480 --> 38:47.720]  this is the public stuff this is the stuff they're showing you this is the
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.240]  stuff that's fun and out in the open well turns out that these clone pigs have
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.560]  reproduced and you bet they pass those genes on and now we have a species of
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.400]  glow-in-the-dark piglets a clone pig whose genes were altered to make it
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.360]  glow fluorescent green has passed on the trait to its young a development that
[39:06.360 --> 39:09.920]  could lead to future breeding of pigs for human transplant organs a Chinese
[39:09.920 --> 39:13.600]  University reported see back in oh two and oh three they were saying that they
[39:13.600 --> 39:19.720]  were going to use pig organs that were slightly mutated you know for for organ
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.840]  transplants to human beings and I'm not against that but when you make a pig
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.040]  glow in the dark just for the sake of it glowing in the dark something might be
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.640]  wrong there two of the 11 play pig piglets glow fluorescent green from
[39:31.640 --> 39:34.960]  their snouts trotters and tongues under ultraviolet light according to the
[39:34.960 --> 39:39.160]  Northeast Agricultural University located in the city of Harbin okay so
[39:39.160 --> 39:43.280]  so only two of 11 that's interesting their mother was one of the three pigs
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.600]  born with a tree in December 2006 after pig embryos were injected with
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.040]  fluorescent green protein continued development of this technology can be
[39:52.040 --> 39:55.480]  applied to the production of special pigs for the production of human organs
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.040]  for transplant see I would imagine that they've probably gone out got a long way
[40:00.040 --> 40:07.600]  from going public five or six years ago but that technology see it's just like
[40:07.600 --> 40:13.080]  cancer research they've got plenty of cancer treatments out there that
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.000]  actually do work but they're suppressed I mean when a guy in Erie
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.440]  Pennsylvania John Kansas can come up with a way to make you know if that's
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.720]  we got to pull that clip up too because no one's gonna believe me I think I've
[40:27.720 --> 40:31.440]  discussed it before we're gonna talk about John Kansas this guy was a former
[40:31.440 --> 40:36.600]  radio broadcast there he was an engineer and he got cancer and in the middle of
[40:36.600 --> 40:40.680]  the night he came up with an idea to make a frequency machine to kill his
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.720]  cancer out of his wife's pipe hands okay just type in a saltwater burns and
[40:45.720 --> 40:52.600]  it'll come up in YouTube and basically he injected himself with metal particle
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.960]  and he put himself through the machine and it killed the cancer cells leaving
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.600]  the other cells fine now why aren't we talking about this research why isn't
[41:02.600 --> 41:07.880]  this all over the place well Joe Biden told you in his little little article
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.160]  how I learned to love the New World Order when he talked about overpopulation
[41:12.160 --> 41:18.600]  even with all their little eugenics programs and all their depopulation
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.360]  programs and their mercury in the vaccine and their sv40 that's simian
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.360]  virus 40 it causes cancer and apes and other hominids basically human beings
[41:26.360 --> 41:33.640]  and they put this stuff in there and they soft kill us it's not even funny it's
[41:33.640 --> 41:38.760]  sick you know that's why autism's up that's why the population so dumb they
[41:38.760 --> 41:42.160]  floored at the water I mean these are real eugenics programs being carried
[41:42.160 --> 41:46.240]  out on the population at home not just you and me but really even worse in
[41:46.240 --> 41:53.440]  other areas and they suppress all this technology you know this clean energy
[41:53.440 --> 41:56.560]  free energy do you really think they want people that free energy no it's
[41:56.560 --> 42:01.040]  another tool of control they want to control your consumption of how much
[42:01.040 --> 42:03.800]  heat you can have in your home that's what carbon credits are about it's the
[42:03.800 --> 42:07.280]  next level of this all right let's play this clip right now
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.720]  salt this is it right here I believe go for it instead of paying almost four
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.120]  bucks for gas how would you like to run your car on saltwater now it may sound
[42:18.120 --> 42:22.440]  crazy but wait until you see what a local inventor has come up with that could
[42:22.440 --> 42:26.720]  change the world and his channel threes michael mera shows us that's not all
[42:26.720 --> 42:29.920]  he's trying to do
[42:30.560 --> 42:35.640]  retired TV station owner and broadcast engineer john kansas was not looking for
[42:35.640 --> 42:40.160]  an answer to the energy crisis he was looking for a way to cure cancer four
[42:40.160 --> 42:44.080]  years ago inspiration struck in the middle of the night why not use radio
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.040]  waves to kill the cancer cells the best thing that would work as antennas was my
[42:48.040 --> 42:52.760]  I could find in three o'clock in the morning was my wife's pie pants his wife
[42:52.760 --> 42:56.320]  Marianne heard the noise and found her husband inventing a radio frequency
[42:56.320 --> 43:01.480]  generator using her pie pans I got up immediately and thought he'd lost it
[43:01.480 --> 43:05.840]  here are the basics of john's idea radio waves will heat certain metals like
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.000]  gold tiny bits of that metal are injected into a cancer patient those
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.960]  nanoparticles are attracted to the abnormalities of the cancer cell and
[43:13.960 --> 43:18.760]  ignore the healthy cells the patient is then exposed to radio waves and only the
[43:18.760 --> 43:23.680]  bad cells heat up and die killing cancer cells is amazing but john had also
[43:23.680 --> 43:27.480]  stumbled on yet another amazing all right was it right there was it right
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.880]  there machine could all right killing cancer cells is amazing you think it's
[43:31.880 --> 43:37.400]  amazing should this not be all over the new should this be front page of course
[43:37.400 --> 43:40.880]  it's not going to be front page because they need depopulation programs cancer
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.600]  is a huge industry g edward griffin exposed that in a world without cancer
[43:45.600 --> 43:50.600]  you know I mean this is literally a multi-billion maybe even a trillion
[43:50.600 --> 43:54.760]  dollar industry worldwide so guess what they're not going to cure cancer anytime
[43:54.760 --> 43:59.680]  soon this guy did it in his garage let's see what else he can do because that is
[43:59.680 --> 44:07.360]  amazing saltwater John Kansas discovered that his radio frequency generator
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.880]  could release the oxygen and hydrogen from saltwater and create an incredibly
[44:11.880 --> 44:16.120]  intense flame just like that that was inside a car cylinder you could see the
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.920]  amount of fire that would be in the cylinder I can put my hand in here put
[44:19.920 --> 44:24.360]  your hand into the beam nothing happens put in a fluorescent bulb and it lights
[44:24.360 --> 44:30.160]  up immediately at the APV company laboratory in Akron top engineers have
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.980]  checked out John's amazing invention and they were amazed and we saw it go up to
[44:34.980 --> 44:42.840]  1500 degrees centigrade the temperature in it it's it's incredible this simple
[44:42.840 --> 44:46.200]  sterling engine is running with the heat generated by the flames coming off that
[44:46.200 --> 44:51.080]  test tube the fuel nothing more than saltwater that could be a steam engine
[44:51.080 --> 44:55.720]  a steam turbine could be a car engine if you wanted it to be that's the true
[44:55.720 --> 45:01.080]  American innovator someone that is not looking for something you just find
[45:01.080 --> 45:07.720]  something this is the most abundant element in the world water and salt
[45:07.720 --> 45:13.880]  water is everywhere and to see it burn actually gives me chills so imagine the
[45:13.880 --> 45:19.320]  possibilities saltwater as the ultimate clean fuel a happy byproduct of one man
[45:19.320 --> 45:24.280]  searching for a cure for cancer in erie pennsylvania michael mera channel 3
[45:24.280 --> 45:29.680]  news the happy byproduct of a man searching for the cure for cancer I
[45:29.680 --> 45:34.120]  mean all right now and now again this makes the local news you haven't seen it
[45:34.120 --> 45:41.280]  on any national news have you I wonder why I mean Ford made an entire car out
[45:41.280 --> 45:46.960]  of hemp and they get in the in the 30s and can you imagine that I couldn't
[45:46.960 --> 45:50.760]  imagine it's on YouTube you can look at it you know God bless the internet and
[45:50.760 --> 45:54.600]  that's why the elites are moving so quickly to try to bring an internet to
[45:54.600 --> 45:59.320]  an internet regulation and the sensor you know Alex Jones's videos I've caught
[45:59.320 --> 46:03.440]  them censoring my videos time and time again no I failed enemies was number
[46:03.440 --> 46:07.520]  one on 9-11 and then just disappeared from the charts if you ever go look it up
[46:07.520 --> 46:10.920]  you know in the top 100 or whatever it's usually in the most shared or most
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.840]  viewed in the cash aid section but it gets pulled down all the time why are
[46:15.840 --> 46:18.760]  they doing this well they don't want this information to get out there they
[46:18.760 --> 46:23.520]  don't want a revelation of the mind really they don't want people to figure
[46:23.520 --> 46:28.120]  it out that you know this system of republican democrat is false liberal
[46:28.120 --> 46:33.360]  conservative is false and there's really in my mind anyway there's only good
[46:33.360 --> 46:37.960]  and evil I everybody's oh there's shades of gray Jason well of course there's
[46:37.960 --> 46:43.960]  shades of gray this is the real world but unfortunately I I I don't think
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.040]  there's shades of gray when it comes to our Constitution and Bill of Rights I
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.280]  think that they're there for a reason if there is something that really needs to
[46:51.280 --> 46:54.680]  be changed in our society it's supposed to be through a constitutional
[46:54.680 --> 46:58.880]  amendment instead we have these executive orders and these national security
[46:58.880 --> 47:05.200]  policies that nobody gets to see except for the upper echelon of you know the
[47:05.200 --> 47:10.840]  elite who really determine what these policies are in secret meetings you know
[47:10.840 --> 47:17.640]  Bilderberg being one of them really the way I look at it is that Bilderberg is a
[47:17.640 --> 47:23.200]  precursor to what they actually distribute to the larger the outer ring
[47:23.200 --> 47:29.120]  the one of the inner rings would be the Bilderberg group about 144 members and
[47:29.120 --> 47:33.720]  they bring a couple guests they have Obama come in they have Hillary come in
[47:33.720 --> 47:37.840]  they discuss you know what's gonna go on and domestic and foreign politics really
[47:37.840 --> 47:42.400]  global politics on the whole and what each person's role in that is going to
[47:42.400 --> 47:49.720]  be then a few months down the line many of these people attend the Bohemian
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.520]  Club the Bohemian Grove two-week get-together now this gives them a little
[47:53.520 --> 47:59.360]  more time to make relationships and disperse the agenda to an outer rung
[47:59.360 --> 48:03.880]  of 3,000 members and of course compartmentalize the information they'll
[48:03.880 --> 48:07.000]  keep some of their information to themselves and tell them what they can
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.600]  tell other people and then from that 3,000 after that two-week you know boys
[48:11.600 --> 48:19.320]  camp what a sick word for that they go and they disperse the agenda to their
[48:19.320 --> 48:24.040]  underlings and that's how this works you know that's how this Leviathan stays
[48:24.040 --> 48:29.200]  active you know that's how the media is all reporting the same thing I'm
[48:29.200 --> 48:37.000]  watching the election night and the MSNBC commercial with all the top anchors
[48:37.000 --> 48:46.360]  it's a MSNBC change is here like they're they're glomming on to the buzzwords
[48:46.360 --> 48:53.720]  that they made popular in fact Colbert is spot-on when he had Colbert had a John
[48:53.720 --> 49:00.400]  King on on the show last week I think it was like on the 5th and John King's a
[49:00.400 --> 49:06.120]  long time seeing an anchor and well you know what just play the clip let's
[49:06.120 --> 49:10.720]  let's let's play it up Colbert makes a great satirical point of what's going on
[49:10.720 --> 49:18.600]  I congratulate you and the rest of the media on getting Obama elected you must

[53:55.800 --> 53:58.560]  Again, Metallica, tough. Something erupts.
[54:01.520 --> 54:04.800]  Some 9-Eleven news I wanted to bring up before the end of the hour.
[54:05.800 --> 54:07.800]  I'm getting a lot of gamuts today.
[54:08.200 --> 54:10.800]  The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,
[54:11.480 --> 54:15.360]  Pentagon-Shanxial 9-Eleven records exempt from disclosure.
[54:16.920 --> 54:22.400]  Now, Aiden over at 9-Eleven Blogger really does a lot of FOIAs and should be
[54:22.400 --> 54:27.720]  commended for his work as a 9-Eleven Truth Researcher among many others over
[54:27.720 --> 54:32.880]  there that do great stuff. But he puts in an FOIA, I think, every day, you know, he
[54:32.880 --> 54:39.000]  gets responses sometimes twice a week. And it's because of people like him, you
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.120]  know, eventually things will be disqualified or declassified and a
[54:43.120 --> 54:46.960]  little bit more light will be shed on the subject. In fact, you know, we've talked
[54:46.960 --> 54:51.920]  about Biden a lot here. Biden, when talking to the student scholars for 9-Eleven
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.560]  Truth, he was asked about able danger. Of course, Biden is very well aware of
[54:57.560 --> 55:00.760]  able danger. He was one of the few people that attended the able danger
[55:00.760 --> 55:07.000]  hearings. I think one of less than five people, those hearings were, I believe,
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.440]  chaired by Arlen Specter. He headed them. And he knows all about this, this
[55:14.440 --> 55:20.400]  international spiring. He's probably a part of it. And he acts like the dumb guy.
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.560]  I believe there's one point where he's like, oh, I can't for the life of me
[55:24.560 --> 55:29.080]  figure out why we're gagging these guys. Why aren't we letting these guys talk?
[55:29.080 --> 55:38.040]  Oh, it's wild. I can't believe we would do this. Well, it's pretty evident why.
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.160]  I mean, he actually says to the student scholars that a lot will be coming out
[55:42.160 --> 55:45.760]  about 9-Eleven. He thinks, oh, well, don't worry, a lot's going to be disclosed.
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.400]  So, you know, I think it'll be more lie-hop stuff, more limited hangout stuff,
[55:51.400 --> 55:56.640]  you know, more international connection stuff. You're going to see Pakistan
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.120]  probably demonized eventually. It's kind of the plan. They love, they love to play
[56:01.120 --> 56:07.560]  buddies with the Middle East when it suits them. When it doesn't suit them,
[56:07.560 --> 56:15.240]  obviously, it's not the same deal. So, these armed forces, Institute of
[56:15.240 --> 56:19.200]  Pathology, Pentagon and Shanksville 9-Eleven records exempt from disclosure,
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.960]  and they give a number of reasons why, oh, it's part of a criminal investigation.
[56:22.960 --> 56:28.080]  Really? A criminal investigation. So, the latest guys they're blaming over at
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.520]  Gitmo with their military tribunal that nobody gets to see, people are crying
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.600]  foul. Where are these acts? Where's the trials and the evidence that the people
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.960]  get to see? It obviously wasn't the 9-Eleven commission. In fact, I believe
[56:40.960 --> 56:44.400]  that Zellikow admitted that he had an outline for the entire report before
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.520]  the commission even started. Not that he didn't have time to write that cover up
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.680]  since the commission didn't start until 400-plus days after the attacks, and then
[56:53.680 --> 56:59.240]  it was severely restricted. A ton of insiders put in there. So, you know, again,
[56:59.240 --> 57:05.560]  I commend people like Aiden. Without them there, you know, there would not be as
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.760]  much light shed on the subject. Armed forces, Institute of Pathology, Pentagon
[57:09.760 --> 57:16.800]  and Shanksville 9-Eleven records exempt from disclosure. You know, didn't they
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.520]  actually say that the Shanksville remains are over in Iron Mountain in an
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.960]  underground facility, along with all these other supposed treasures? I thought
[57:25.960 --> 57:28.600]  they were supposed to do an actual report on what happened there. That's what
[57:28.600 --> 57:33.520]  they do with every other plane crash. Weird. It's the Alex Jones show. I want to
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.480]  encourage people to go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv right now and check
[57:37.480 --> 57:40.280]  out Fabled Enemies.

[57:57.760 --> 58:03.840]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to
[58:03.840 --> 58:08.920]  Ground Zero and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.640]  breakthrough 9-Eleven film that finally gives first responders a platform to
[58:13.640 --> 58:21.680]  tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18, made a statement that the air
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.320]  was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven
[58:26.320 --> 58:30.280]  truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global
[58:30.280 --> 58:34.360]  masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He
[58:34.360 --> 58:39.360]  takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[59:27.480 --> 59:31.160]  Alex Jones.
[59:32.280 --> 59:36.960]  Alright folks, it is the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Burma sitting in. Thank you
[59:36.960 --> 59:43.040]  for joining us. Monday, the 12th of January, 2009. And I haven't wished
[59:43.040 --> 59:46.160]  everybody a happy new year yet, but I don't know if there's gonna be much to be
[59:46.160 --> 59:52.080]  happy about. You know, we're a little over a week away from a inauguration of a
[59:52.080 --> 59:55.480]  new president, somebody who knew he was going to be president since May, by the
[59:55.480 --> 1:00:01.160]  way, somebody who had his transition team ready. And really, I mean, if you thought
[1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:07.600]  that John McCain was running a presidential race to win, come on, come
[1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:14.600]  on. It was stage worse than WWE wrestling. And I watched his, you know, his
[1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:19.240]  eye-loss speech. And it was just, it was ridiculous. I mean, literally, the night
[1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:24.520]  as the election was going on, you know, MSNBC had commercials with Obama's
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:28.640]  slogan in them. Everybody had gr- I mean, the graphics they have of this guy,
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:34.680]  Obama is in the latest Spider-Man comic book as a superhero, really. He bumped,
[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.200]  you know, it's not, he doesn't high-five Spider-Man, you know, he doesn't hug
[1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:45.920]  Spider-Man, you know, he bumps Spider-Man. He gives him a little, oh, the pound. When
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:49.320]  was the last time an incoming president was on the cover of the amazing
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:54.040]  Spider-Man? He's on the cover of Rolling Stone all over the place. They made a
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:58.120]  Rolling Stone commemorative issue. He's a rock star. The way that this guy has
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:04.920]  been pushed is it's more than worrisome, in my opinion. You know, I don't, I didn't
[1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:09.320]  want to go Tarpley levels. You know, I still disagree with Tarpley on a few
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:13.200]  things here and there. But maybe he's right. I mean, this guy really does have a
[1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:20.440]  movement behind him. And again, a state senator, folks, is not, I mean, it's, it's
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:23.720]  nothing to scoff at. There's a lot of state senators that do a lot of great
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:26.520]  work out there, but it's not like being a member of the House, in other words, a
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:31.760]  member of Congress. And it's not like being a U.S. senator. And in 2004, when he
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:34.520]  was just trying to get elected to an actual Senate seat, remember, there's
[1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:41.240]  only two senators per state. He gave the keynote speech at the Democratic
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:44.960]  National Convention. Now, obviously they're hyping him up for something else
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:48.760]  if he's nothing more than a state senator with a possible shot at a Senate
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:57.240]  seat. And he's giving the keynote address in 2004. And the cult-like way that
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:06.280]  people are going, yes, we can. Yes, we can. I think to myself, we're in for some
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:13.120]  trouble. You know, I, yes, we can. I mean, South Park got it dead on. I was glad
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:17.440]  when Alex played those clips. But that's really how it is, this mentality that
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.040]  Obama is going to fix and save everything. I'm gonna take your calls in the next
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:25.640]  segment. We're gonna go to Sam, Gail, Matt, and more. And well, you know, it's
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:29.400]  across the board, whatever you want to talk about. But really, I think people
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:33.640]  need to get prepped for this. I would say now is probably one of the best times
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:37.600]  to buy gold and silver, because if one of these, you know, this crisis is an
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:42.080]  economic one, you might want some hard currency if it's really that disastrous.
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:47.120]  I don't, perhaps it'll just be the announcement a bunch of banks going
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.240]  under. That could happen. I mean, they could take away your social security
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:54.360]  altogether. They could say banks are going under. They could say it's gonna be a
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.400]  restructuring of the economy. You know, they're talking a lot about this quote
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:07.160]  unquote stimulus pack that Obama has. But when you give bankers a multi-trillion
[1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.840]  dollar bailout in the guise of $700 billion, and you know, people like
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:14.800]  Barney Frank, who's a total, he's a piece of work, Barney Frank. I don't even want
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:21.600]  to get into why I really don't like Mr. Frank from Massachusetts. Maybe some
[1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:25.800]  other time. But Barney Frank is out there acting like all they've given out is
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:31.920]  $350 billion. That's such a lie. I mean, we all know that that $350 billion is then
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:38.320]  made into an exponential amount of money. Trillions, trillions for them to buy up
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:44.640]  infrastructure, hide in foreign accounts, and further decorate the economy by
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:49.040]  creating a fiat currency. And we're gonna be the ones left with the bag to hold.
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:52.600]  You know, without a home, without a job, without any food. It's really
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:56.600]  unfortunate it's gotten to this. It's the Alex Jones Show, infowars.com,
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:00.160]  truthnews.us.
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:12.280]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:15.560]  to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:19.120]  independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:22.400]  bread line if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Super
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:26.240]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:29.760]  simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail out
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:33.560]  for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:38.200]  the telephones and email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:42.280]  thin air. This money now owns the America and European banks. The exploding
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:46.000]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.160]  blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:54.040]  reach. In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:58.600]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks. Food prices are
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:02.800]  skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:06.440]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:10.200]  money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food, but jack of prices
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:14.120]  to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:17.760]  ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose
[1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:21.600]  between buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever it
[1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:25.560]  takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there
[1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:28.480]  listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of
[1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:32.080]  storable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:36.360]  and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one
[1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:39.720]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you. You know E-

[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:24.560]  command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex
[1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:29.320]  Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:33.720]  Alright folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show and we're gonna go to your
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:38.120]  calls in one moment. But before we go to your calls, I want to take this time to
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:43.880]  thank some of our great sponsors. And you know, I'm in the new office. The new
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:48.840]  office looks great by the way. I had been here when it was pretty empty and now
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:52.160]  it's starting to fill up and it's just great. One of the nice things is it has
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:56.320]  its own little kitchen and that's where they put the Acola Blue unit. And what
[1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:59.520]  is Acola Blue? Well, it's probably the most delicious purified water I've ever
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:04.320]  drank and the cool thing about it is that I don't have to put water into it
[1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:08.520]  for it to purify. It actually pulls water from the air. It makes, I mean, more
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:12.000]  water than you can drink. Sometimes you have to dump some of it out. We use it in
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.720]  the coffee pot. It makes great tasting coffee.
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:23.000]  Acola Blue's website is www.ecoloblue.com. That's acolablue.com and the
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:28.520]  phone number is 866-585-4044. It's an atmospheric water generator for your
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:31.320]  home. It pays for itself really within one year when you buy your water from the
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:35.040]  store and I know that I bought my water from the store. I don't have one of these
[1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:38.960]  units yet but I do have to get one. You know, I don't know why. I kind of wish
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:42.400]  Alex had it right in the office because there are a couple in here and I could
[1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:45.880]  just pull it off from the side. It's delicious. Pure clean water without
[1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:49.240]  fluoride. That's a big plus for me personally. I don't know about you. I don't
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:53.320]  like getting poisoned with my water. I know exactly what you're drinking. It's
[1:07:53.320 --> 1:07:58.920]  acolablue.com. The number again is 866-585-4044. I'm actually drinking a
[1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:03.320]  coffee right now with acola blue water and it is delicious. Alright, let's take
[1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:07.480]  our first caller of the day on the Alex Jones show. Let's go to Vic in Michigan.
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:12.000]  Vic, what's on your mind? Hey, how are you? Good.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.600]  I just want to say thank you very much to you and Alex for doing such a great
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:22.000]  job out there. I've been listening for maybe about six months and I live here
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.320]  in Michigan and I'm a automation engineer. I've been watching things
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:33.640]  circle the drain out here for quite a while. I was doing some research
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:39.360]  on some of the 9-11 on the towers and World Trade Center 1 and 2. I was
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:44.040]  wondering, did you guys ever get Dr. Judy Wood on your show or talk to her at
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.720]  all about her? Judy Wood just flew off the deep end with her
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:53.640]  no-planes theories. There's some substantial stuff about the
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:56.840]  control demolition in the beginning, but when you start making analogies like
[1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:01.400]  the Kebler-Elves analogy and the billiard ball analogy, and if you've ever
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:06.600]  seen her speak, it's very pseudo-science. She says the
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:11.040]  planes can't hit the towers. A lot of disinfo in there. She came across as
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:15.360]  very valid in the beginning. A lot of these researchers do and then they
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:19.520]  just kind of like fly off the handle. I think that Stephen Jones's research is
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:23.760]  really the most solid research out there. I know that she's discussed mini-nukes.
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:27.560]  I really don't know if I see any evidence of that. I don't think that we
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:32.720]  have the proper samples of the air, really, off the bat to decide that. Obviously,
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:35.920]  some of the cars that were burnt down the road, that's very suspicious. They
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:40.680]  probably used other incendiary devices other than Thermate to actually
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:44.440]  cut the towers, but you got to remember Thermate does have
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:48.040]  some explosive properties. You know, they used to make Thermite bombs and
[1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:52.880]  carpet bomb countries with that substance. So, you know, Judy won't
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:58.280]  be a salute too much. I agree with you there. I watched a couple
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:02.000]  of couple hours of her interviews and stuff and yeah, she does have some
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.920]  pretty hysterical things to say, but yeah, some of the important things that
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:11.880]  I just noted being an engineer is especially the two pitchers of the
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:16.680]  fire engines with the missing engines and melted on the front. Yeah, no. Listen,
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:20.200]  the intense heat that probably went down when the base of that building,
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:24.000]  basically, you know, that top-down demolition, the building literally
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.520]  disintegrating, and then with that cloud of smoke, you know, in a lot of the videos
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.680]  you can see kind of like a flash, if you will, at the end of it all. And again,
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:37.160]  you had molten metal underneath the towers, not only one and two, but seven
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:41.680]  and six and five. So, it does look like some other explosive agent was used
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:46.080]  there. I do thank you for the call Vic. We're gonna move to Sam in Missouri. Sam,
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:51.800]  what's on your mind? Howdy. Hey, Jason, I just want to call and say that I love
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:55.520]  everybody seeing this big health record deal with Obama when he digitized all
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.840]  the health record. It looks like that's pretty much new older skull crap. And I
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:03.520]  also want to say that I hope that the economic crisis is gonna be, or the
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:07.360]  big crisis is gonna be economic because he says it's gonna be
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:12.680]  international. But don't you think, hold on before you make your
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:15.840]  next point, don't you think that an economic crisis in the United States
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:22.560]  and admitted one with the dollar still being basically, you know, the same
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:26.840]  currency, or not the same currency, the world currency, mostly the
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:30.880]  world reserve currency, that is gonna affect the rest of the world. So, an
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:35.160]  economic crisis here at home is going to affect, I mean, it's gonna affect, you
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:39.000]  know, not only just North America, but it's gonna affect Europe big time. And I
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.320]  can't imagine what's gonna happen to third world nations. Go ahead. Well, that's
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:46.440]  actually true. I don't know. It's just I keep thinking it's gonna come something
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.000]  out of like Gaza, like American troops being used against the the help of
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:56.600]  Palestinians. I don't know. You know, the Middle East, right now, I believe
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:02.520]  there's a proposal out there for a bridge across the Jordan from Egypt into
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:06.920]  Iraq. Now, Egypt has been a long time ally of the United States, but the
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:12.000]  condition is that Iraq must now support Israel. And since we're a military
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.840]  presence there, I don't think that Iraq is gonna have much of a choice, and this
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:18.240]  is just going to be the next step in building the Eurasian Union that they've
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:21.960]  tried to build. You know, I mean, Saudi Arabia has been on board with the United
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:26.480]  States interest for quite some time. Afghanistan has now been taken completely
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:31.640]  over, and Obama says that he is going to deploy more troops into Afghanistan. So,
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:35.680]  you'll probably see a redistribution of troops from Iraq into Afghanistan. We're
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:39.280]  currently demonizing Pakistan. I'm not sure what's gonna happen there. You know,
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:43.440]  Biden is obviously on some kind of a cover-up diplomatic mission there, but
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:48.320]  it's all part of this game to centralize power in the Middle East. I thank you for
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.840]  the call, Sam. Let's go to Gail in Pennsylvania. Gail, what's on your
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:13:07.840]  mind? Hi Gail, how are you? I just wanted to ask about the 9-11 thing. I
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:16.400]  watched all the movies and everything, and I just, my dad, he's like 50, and I
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.960]  tried to tell him that they blew up and everything, and he still thinks they
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:26.720]  pancaked, and he hasn't seen, like, the footage, like, in, in, like, since it
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:30.760]  happened that day. Where are you from, Gail? I'm from PA. You're, you're, okay, so
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:34.680]  you're close enough to New York, where it's kind of a traumatic event. Yeah. I
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:38.600]  would say this, you know, it's different strokes for different folks. I would say
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:42.480]  try to get them to sit down and watch something like, you know, a 9-11 press
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:46.760]  for truth or fabled enemies before you bring them into control. Yeah. And what
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:51.160]  might have happened at the Pentagon, and if he can see corruption in the
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:57.000]  intelligence agencies, you know, like the FBI, the CIA, the ISI, the Israeli
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.160]  Mossad, and their involvement in 9-11, then maybe you can give him the next step
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.240]  and give him, you know, Alex Jones' road to tyranny or a loose change final cut.
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:09.600]  They're all good. Yeah, yeah, exactly, but get him, get him with something that
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:14.520]  may, may not be a total, it might have been, you know, a little light for you,
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:17.280]  but it'll be a slap in the face for him, and then he can look at this other
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:21.040]  information. I always say that you got to kind of read somebody's personality with
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:24.000]  the first information that you give them. You know, I always try to relate to
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.400]  somebody first, and then give them something that is tailored to them so
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:31.040]  that you can get them to look at other information, because you might just turn
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:34.840]  them off with the wrong thing. I mean, I remember screenings of a loose change
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:38.880]  second edition, where we'd have a few hundred people in the audience, and five
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:42.600]  or six of them would walk out by the time that the Pentagon segment had started,
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:46.560]  because it was just too much for them. So, you know, you might have to be
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:49.360]  reserved in the start, but keep it up, and you can really make a change. Thanks
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:53.920]  for the call, Gail. Let's go to Matt in Canada. Matt, what's on your mind?
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:58.920]  Hi there, Jason. How are you this morning? Good, man. I was just wondering,
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:02.720]  did you have any specific suggestions or resources on how to quickly and
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:07.400]  effectively set up civilian intelligence gathering and spreading networks? I've
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:10.800]  got like a lot of the basic ideas down, like putting up posters, handing out
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:15.240]  movies and flyers, but I was looking more on suggestions around the gathering
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:19.200]  side. Well, you know, first of all, you got to have a place where you can gather,
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:23.000]  and you do want, you know, churches are usually pretty good, because they're empty
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  most of the week, you know, and somebody in your group might go to a church, so it
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.160]  doesn't necessarily have to be a religious event. Schools are another
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:33.640]  great place if you know somebody associated with a school, somebody who's
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:37.800]  a teacher in your community, that's another, you know, great resource they
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:42.040]  can usually get open rooms there. Other than that, I mean, if you're trying to
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:46.680]  hold a screening and bring people in that way, I would say, you know, local
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:50.200]  theaters, the ones that usually show, you know, one or two movies and not, you
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:53.360]  know, like your mall type theaters, you can usually work something out with them
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:57.480]  on a weekday night. So, you know, you kind of have to be ingenuitive, because you
[1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:00.840]  have to find a place that you can gather with all these people, and then
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:04.440]  you have to present the information so that people next time want to come
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:10.200]  back to that kind of a gathering. Does that help you with that one? Yeah,
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:14.000]  definitely. But do you have any specific targets, like for people who you might
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:17.680]  look towards in your community, for information that you can gather from?
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.040]  Well, for me, it's like this. I try to relate to people that, you know, I know
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:24.920]  that I'm gonna be able to start a conversation with, you know, it's kind
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:29.280]  of like, you know, maybe a concert crowd, you know, when I was a kid, I like to go
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.000]  to rock shows, you know, I often, when I do go to a rock show still today, I carry
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.480]  50 DVDs with me, and inside them there'll be a card with like infowars.com
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.080]  and whatever on there, and I'll just talk to people. And usually, people are
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:44.680]  coming from a wider area, so they didn't come for this, but they'll take that
[1:16:44.680 --> 1:16:47.560]  information, and hopefully, maybe they'll give me an email and we can set
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:51.720]  something up in the future. You know, I've seen that it's only usually small
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:54.840]  groups that are going to remain active. A lot of people want to be part of
[1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:58.960]  something, but they don't want to put any work in. And that's why I think that the
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:04.080]  most effective so far has been WeAreChanged.org. And I think we're having
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:08.880]  somebody from WeAreChanged.org on today, I believe, from, I think, Matthew Medina.
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:13.440]  Yeah, he's San Antonio, and that's only an hour away. And what's, what you're able
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:17.400]  to do is find five to ten core group members with an outer ring of 20 or 30,
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:22.400]  and from these five to ten, like Luke Radowski, you're able to go confront, you
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.440]  know, a politician or somebody in the media about an important issue, and you
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:29.240]  don't have to worry about getting all the camera work yourself. You can get two
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:33.480]  different angles with somebody else. You can get a couple questions in. So it's
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:37.720]  almost like guerrilla info warfare, in my opinion. You know, you got to understand
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:42.720]  that it's not going to, it's very hard to gather a lot of people at once and make

[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:22.080]  over its triumph of reducing government debt, but the truth be told public and
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:27.200]  private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:33.600]  trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years. The US
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:37.200]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:41.000]  institution called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:46.520]  collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:50.160]  order to have commerce. However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this
[1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:54.840]  magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio. Before you make

[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:46.400]  It's the Alex Jones show and we are back. I am Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones
[1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:52.360]  taking a much-deserved vacation but the news doesn't take a vacation and every
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:57.600]  day the world gets a little more complex and a little more compartmentalized.
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:02.520]  A little bit more under the grips of these tyrannical overlords and if you
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:07.680]  don't see it you're really just you're just blind to it all. I mean you're too
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:12.280]  hooked in to the fact that the Giants lost this weekend. I'm sure a ton of my
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:18.280]  friends are irate about that. I can only imagine the fit they threw. You're too
[1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:23.960]  concerned about the bowl games that just happened. You're too concerned with your
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:28.320]  bobbles and that's why the news is now telling you and it's your fault by the
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:34.040]  way the news is telling you. The economy's done. We're in the worst economic
[1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:39.120]  state since the Great Depression. We've had record layoffs in the last month and
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:44.520]  that's just going to continue. I watched Paulson say things like even after
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:47.280]  the bailout banks are going to go under. Maybe that's the next announcement. A
[1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:50.840]  bunch of banks are going to go under. They're going to have to consolidate to
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:57.480]  get a new form of banking or a new super bank but don't worry you'll still be
[1:23:57.480 --> 1:24:00.480]  responsible for all your student loans and all your car loans and all your
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.680]  housing loans and even if the economy does go under you'll go to a debtor's
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:09.360]  prison and they'll give you some kind of a credit system much like the carbon
[1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:12.760]  credit system they're working on for the environment to punish you for how many
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:18.000]  cars you have and how much heat you use and how long you have your lights on.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.320]  Just another way to tax and control you and that's what I think we're going to
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:27.960]  see down the line. That's what's coming up. Awesome. All right let's keep taking
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.400]  your calls. Let's go to Ronnie in Texas. Ronnie what's on your mind? Thank you
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:36.760]  Jason. I wanted to speak about Arlen quote miracle bullet close quote
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:43.080]  specter and as you probably remember hopefully as a lonely as a lonely mere
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:50.200]  district attorney in November 1963 Arlen miracle bullet specter dreamt up the key
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:56.600]  nugget of hogwash crucial to the ongoing cover-up of the JFK assassination. The
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:00.040]  term miracle bullet was referring to that miraculous bullet that supposedly
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:04.840]  blew through President Kennedy mid-air change direction then entered the body
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:08.280]  of then governor John Connolly and shattered a rib lodged in his leg and
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:14.320]  then somehow was found on a Parkland Hospital gurney in perfect condition that
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:19.600]  was so miraculous about it and thereby supposedly being one of Oswald's only
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:24.240]  three bullets that killed JFK and wounded Connolly supposedly. Problem of
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.440]  course is that that bullet could not have done all that damage I mean it's not
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.680]  physically physiologically possible for that to occur and then somehow turned up
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:38.320]  in perfect condition on that gurney I mean it's totally nonsensical and and
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:42.960]  briefly years later Arlen miracle bullet specter was the one Republican
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:48.600]  senator who single-handedly with his vote to acquit prevented slick truly evil
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.320]  Clint Raider from being convicted for treason in his impeachment trial so by
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:58.400]  the way specter sister still lives in Israel but for decades Arlen miracle
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:03.800]  bullet specter has been a key stooge in various crucial cover-ups of treason
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:08.680]  against the United States of America and he is also the epitome of a rhino
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:13.880]  a Republican in name only and now gosh they're all the Republican senators
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:18.920]  they're all rhinos pretty much as the Republican parties milled together into
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:22.400]  one tree in this cabal he's been a pretty good frontman for them though I
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:25.800]  mean a lot of people think that that guy commands respect and you know he's
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:30.000]  actually on a personal level can be somewhat likable I've seen him on
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:35.040]  Howard Stern he was funny there I even think that he he said that there was a
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:40.040]  cover-up regarding some aspects of 9-11 when he did a no no it was the and he
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:43.120]  wouldn't really talk about 9-11 but he said that he alluded to the fact that
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:48.000]  the anthrax attacks were an inside job you know he is he is the epitome of one
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.320]  of those guys that gives you limited hangout gives you a little bit to like
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:55.480]  but in in reality is the king of the cover-up you know again he chaired those
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:59.560]  able danger hearings you know he was instrumental in shutting those guys up
[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:03.920]  exactly and he's a key criminal and of course like you said he squeezes in a
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:08.520]  little bit of truth every now and then to get by but yeah he's so crucial to the
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:13.960]  JFK cover-up which is not unrelated to the Clintonian cover-up and like I said
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:18.720]  let him off you know he was a traitor and we almost had him but there's that one
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:22.040]  Republican senator who prevented it all from happening and of course it was
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:26.800]  Arlen miracle bullet specter so I couldn't help but try to squeeze in a
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:30.760]  word or two about him when I heard him I think I thank you for the call because
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:35.080]  you know they still are working on that JFK film and you know now that you bring
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:40.520]  up a JFK there was some news last week that documents had been revealed that
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:44.840]  of course this mob boss is the one that has killed JFK they try to spin it but
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:48.240]  of course the mob boss couldn't have called off the Secret Service probably
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:51.960]  had a compartmentalized role in it that's what the documents show it's the
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:56.960]  Alex Jones show info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv

[1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:28.920]  mob had a role had a role in the assassination you know compartmentalization
[1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:33.520]  you know it's that's how Jack Ruby was involved but to say that this guy this
[1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:37.120]  is the guy that that killed Kennedy give me a break this is the guy that killed
[1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:42.000]  Kennedy and he was anything less than the CIS at the entire time it would have
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:46.040]  been brought to light he was involved but really come on he is not the upper
[1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:49.880]  echelon he can't get newspapers to print that Kennedy has been assassinated
[1:32:49.880 --> 1:32:54.000]  by Oswald before it happens that's not in this man's power all right let's play
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:59.200]  the clip you see and after all these years an author says he found a
[1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:04.320]  declassified document that shows Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone when he
[1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:12.520]  assassinated John F. Kennedy in 1963 you have to conclude that there was a fourth shot and a
[1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:18.360]  second life directors like Oliver Stone have produced movies about it I never
[1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:22.840]  met anybody named Oswald authors have written hundreds of books on it now
[1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:27.720]  another new book claiming government documents say a mafia crime boss
[1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:34.400]  confessed yes confessed to ordering the assassination of president John F. Kennedy
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:38.400]  these are not just casual remarks made by an aging godfather when he was in
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:43.680]  prison Lamar Waldron is co-author of legacy of secrecy Waldron says Carlos
[1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:48.680]  Marcello ordered the assassination in retaliation for Kennedy cracking down on
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:54.200]  organized crime and Waldron says a national archive record proves his
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:34:00.280]  claim buried within millions of pages of files declassified by the FBI 10 years
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:05.880]  ago he says our details of Marcello's alleged confession to an undercover
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:11.320]  informant in 1985 it was one time when he just went off on a high room against
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:16.580]  the Kennedys that he let slip to the FBI informant that yeah I had the SOB
[1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:21.720]  killed I'm glad I did it you know I'm sorry I couldn't have done it myself the
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:26.560]  official report on Kennedy's assassination released in 1964 by the
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:32.160]  Warren Commission found Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone three other government
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:37.240]  investigations have since concluded the same Vincent Buleosie has studied the
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:41.960]  Kennedy assassination his book reclaiming history also backs the
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:46.800]  commission's findings as for Waldron's findings if I could categorize it in a
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:51.480]  couple words sublime silliness there's no merit to this Carlos Marcello
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:56.400]  was investigated in the 1970s by the House Select Committee on assassinations
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:01.320]  which found he did have quote the motive means and opportunity to have
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:06.000]  President John F. Kennedy assassinated but concluded they could not establish
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.800]  direct evidence of his involvement hundreds upon hundreds of people had
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:15.120]  motive means and opportunity the seminal question is did he do it and that's
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:18.560]  where you have to come up with evidence but Waldron says the now
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:24.800]  declassified documents speak for themselves well as for Carlos Marcello
[1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:29.440]  he died all right let's uh let's pull it obviously the guys dad you probably had a
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:34.600]  limited role in the assassination but to say that this is the mastermind no this
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:39.480]  is a black government op I encourage people to check out JFK to the Bush
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:45.360]  connection which is also available at prismplanet.tv and really really see
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.720]  some of that in work all right let's keep taking your calls let's go to Leo
[1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:54.000]  in Massachusetts Leo what's on your mind hi I was the bearded guy who walked up
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:36:00.160]  to you and helped you out with your new studio and reminded me you to tell us
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:05.040]  Alex something that I really feel did you get to hear that message I'm not
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:12.480]  quite sure if we're the if the New York at the 9-11 that we are change movie
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.760]  and I don't remember man I need so many people I'm sorry if I didn't get the
[1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:21.360]  message there but I mean Rob was with me I probably told him you know he's he's
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:27.240]  the editor on the films anyway is your studio finished
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:32.320]  um we're at home or here at your home studio yeah um I still don't have a
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:35.760]  mixer yet but I do have a board and I do have a big television so we'll see what
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:40.040]  happens with that I spoke to Catherine Albrecht and she said her her operation
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:45.880]  takes about $5,000 worth of electronics is that true oh yeah I mean my the board
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:50.560]  alone cost me over $2,200 and with the television set that was another 1,100
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:54.200]  so there's 3,000 and I don't even have a microphone and a mixer so yeah I'd say
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:57.400]  about five grand so was your trip down there were two for you getting a little
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:01.960]  dental work too while you're at it I guess so Leo is there something you want
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:07.880]  to talk about on you know I think we really need to be hammering really hard
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:13.000]  on internet too because that's the thing they're gonna try and kill us with
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.600]  this hate speech garbage you know truth is gonna be called hate speech and I
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:21.600]  think internet too is a big problem you know I was actually discussing internet
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:26.160]  too with Aaron and Rob and some of the guys in the office and although I really
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:29.160]  think that internet too obviously they're pushing for it they really want to
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:33.200]  regulate the internet but all this open-source technology I can only see the
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:37.080]  hackers going underground with their own hubs and with satellite technology I
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:41.080]  really don't believe they're gonna be able to shut down an open-source internet
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:45.000]  all together they could criminalize it which is something I think that there's
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:49.320]  is definitely in the cards but for instance I you know when cables you can
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:52.920]  cut C cables and mess things up and well then you can cut cables but if you do
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:56.280]  it through through satellite technology or you do it through antenna
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:38:00.160]  technology it's gonna be a lot harder and we're at the point now where you know
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:05.760]  hackers can do that and number two you know Windows just put out a Windows 7
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:08.640]  beta it leaked on the internet like two weeks before they were gonna put out the
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:12.560]  beta version but the reason they do that is because the open-source hackers go
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:15.920]  through they find the bugs they fix the bugs in their program and they end up
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:21.000]  really writing a lot of the software so internet too for 95% of the
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.960]  population yeah that there is not going to be an open-source internet if they if
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:28.640]  they get it right but there'll still be people who are tech savvy able to put
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.000]  information up there so hopefully we'll be able to tap into that and hopefully
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.320]  we'll be able to warn people not to let them regulate the internet in the manner
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:39.960]  they that they're doing so you know I was listening to a talk show yesterday
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:43.600]  and they were talking about max hardcore and I know we don't usually talk about
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:47.360]  porn on this show but you know he's an internet pornographer and he just got
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:50.960]  charged with obscenity and apparently he's gonna do four years in prison and
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:56.360]  I'm not defending his stuff but when you're gonna put somebody for in prison
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:39:00.840]  for four years for you know stuff that really is legal I mean it's not child
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:04.600]  pornography everybody's 18 everybody's of consent and you're gonna call it
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:07.600]  obscene what's the next thing they're gonna call obscene you know what I mean
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:13.080]  it's not just gonna be porn it's gonna be the excuse yes absolutely I
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:19.040]  agree but the thing is that I think the population at large the the I don't
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:25.240]  know I call them the iPod people I guess and and the I you know as they seem
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:28.360]  when you still haven't quite figured it out that they're gonna get hammered
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:32.040]  with this and a lot of people have this hope I mean they've been you know what
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:35.700]  it is there's been a lot of programming and I thank you for the call out there
[1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:40.520]  on television and in the radio you know you know change we can vote for new hope
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:45.800]  in America change we hope change we hope change we hope change we hope I mean
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:51.800]  thousands of times in people's brains so you know obviously if they're they're
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:55.600]  punching into their iPhone and they're like yeah it's change we could vote for
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:39:59.640]  we voted for it now there's hope for America we're gonna be number one again
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:04.840]  and they're not in touch with any of the real crisis you know a lot of these you
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:08.840]  know younger kids never had a job they've been living off their parents you
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:14.280]  know their parents have unknown to the kids just taken into a huge amount of
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.320]  debt to buy their homes and their cars and they've lived this you know haughty
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.320]  taughty lifestyle where they've never you know wanted or needed anything and
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:25.440]  that's about to change and they have no idea it's gonna be such a shock to the
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:28.960]  reality all right let's go to our next caller let's go to Michael in
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:33.960]  Massachusetts Michael what's on your mind hey what's up dude how's it going good
[1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:38.280]  man how you doing hey I want to give a couple examples for the listeners on you
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:42.120]  know how to affect changing your community but first I just want to you
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:44.960]  know kind of tell everybody to kind of suck it up look at that kid
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:49.120]  Weineck or whatever his name is who has been you know changing his whole high
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:52.440]  school you know he's a youngster if he can do it I think a lot of other people
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:57.680]  can do it right I had a couple examples I work downtown I work at the trade
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:02.640]  center so I come in via the commuter rail and you know lately they've been
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:07.480]  having police officers and it looks what looks like a football outfit you know
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:13.080]  battle armor machine gun shotguns and so you know I've just kind of sucked it up
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:16.200]  instead of walking up to these guys inside of you know talking about the
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:19.400]  facts and believe it or not a lot of these people will listen to you as long
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:23.840]  as you speak you know intelligently you can't be saying dude and swear or no
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:28.000]  it not but you know you walk up and you say look you know you guys are wearing
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.440]  black uniforms you carry machine guns you know what do you think and most of
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:35.480]  them would be like well you know a lot of people want to be safe and so what I
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:39.800]  do is I try to create kind of like a psychological connection with the person
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:43.920]  I'm speaking to here a good example is this you you want to get these guys
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:47.600]  concerned so you walk up to the guy and you say oh you know my family is kind of
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:50.520]  worried about this and then they'll go okay well what's the problem and then you
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:54.320]  say it also has to do with your jurisdiction now you create this sort
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:57.800]  of like psychological connection like whoa you know what's this do talking
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:01.560]  about you know nobody's you know going to be impeding on my jurisdiction so you
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.160]  create that kind of like you know regimentation thing and that's when you
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:09.200]  lay it on him you go look dude the president on October 1st brought back
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:12.360]  you know the third infantry brigade and now they want to put them under North
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:16.200]  Comm North comms not even you know an American military institution it's a
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:20.560]  globalist you know North American Union type thing and then they're like well you
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:23.640]  know most cops will say well you know the governor has to declare martial law
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:27.720]  and that's when you laid this down on him you go no dude presidential directive
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:32.000]  51 along with the defense authorization acts as that the president can declare
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.400]  martial law independent of the other two branches of government you know what I
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:39.680]  mean and what on the cover sheet of PDD 51 there are three examples given
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:46.040]  environmental you know terrorism and then the last one economic collapse now
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:50.920]  I'm telling you I've done this a bunch of times each time I say that you will see
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:55.600]  a jack-booted thug turn into a puddle of nothingness these people hear that
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:00.520]  and they're like oh my freaking god I can't believe my ears we got to realize
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:03.640]  that most of these guys are still human beings they're still just collecting a
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:07.400]  paycheck and you know there's not everybody is a juiced up maniac that's
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:10.480]  ready to shoot somebody in the subway after he's pinned on the ground begging
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:14.540]  for his life although that did happen last week and again they said oh the
[1:43:14.540 --> 1:43:17.600]  camera's malfunction don't worry nothing happened will people caught up with
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  their cell phone cameras and that's the one the one thing I love is like we we
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:25.880]  do have a shot I keep telling people carry cameras everywhere you go because
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:30.500]  you're you're never prepared for what's about to go down you never know when
[1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:33.680]  something could be terribly amiss especially in New York City I mean
[1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:37.160]  anything could happen at any moment absolutely just listen to this dude I
[1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:42.200]  work at the trade center right and the mayor of Boston Thomas Menino was walking
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:45.320]  out because you know he was given some sort of talk downstairs or whatever and
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:51.040]  you know I was like oh there's Menino what do I do snap out of it I ran up to
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:54.320]  him and said hey mumbles why the police officers were in black uniforms carry
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:58.040]  machine guns a cell station when you're gonna speak up about that the New World
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:00.640]  Order you know this that and the other thing and you should have seen the look
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:04.800]  on his face you know here's a guy who's a you know basically a gangster running
[1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:09.440]  one of the biggest cities in the country and you know I'm a 24 year old dude you
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:14.520]  know bottomless guys you know what you know in like his whole crowd like
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:18.320]  gathered around them like a bunch of sheep and they look these guys are
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:21.920]  pathetic they're bunch of as soon as they all met as soon as they're confronted
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:25.800]  with somebody who can quote unquote see and you can from with that information
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:30.240]  they they turn into a puddle of mud they start stammering we got one who can see
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:36.000]  like that yeah well not only that but I mean if you if you look at when Radowski
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:40.800]  and you know in fabled enemies gets Biden on Pakistan he is shocked that
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:44.000]  he's even being asked this question then he stumbles on it it happens all the
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.360]  time it's like when I confronted the guys from popular mechanics of my debate
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:51.880]  if you watch James Megs he can't get a sentence out without stammering and
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:56.800]  stuttering yes go ahead real quick Amy Goodman yes you matter I'm sure you've
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:01.880]  talked to her I used to like democracy now what is with this woman like it
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:06.640]  all right all right thank you for the call I'll get into Amy Goodman and I
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:10.360]  won't even get into like Michael Moore I've never met Michael Moore but I'll
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:15.360]  give you my perspective on it first of all Amy Goodman she was a very queen
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:20.160]  she was nice she didn't really talk to me that much but her people did and her
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:23.320]  people very much supported the 9-11 truth movement a lot of people were fans
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:28.480]  of loose change you know they worked hard to set up this debate Amy Goodman I
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:32.040]  think knows something's wrong but she still wants to take the stance that
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:37.000]  will get her invited to events such as the ones that Michael Moore speaks at
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:44.720]  such as the ones that know Chomsky speaks at really leftist type events now I
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:50.120]  think to some extent she's hip to globalization but she's probably one of
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:53.600]  these people that firmly believes in global warming and doesn't see the
[1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:56.720]  bigger picture I think Michael Moore is again one of those guys you know he's
[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:02.000]  trying to hold Obama's you know foot to the fire you know he he didn't campaign
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.920]  much for Obama but now he's trying to say all right you said you were gonna do
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:08.880]  these things let's see you actually do them but one of those things you know
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:12.400]  is about global climate change and all this nonsense he still believes in
[1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:17.240]  false paradigms and it's hard to shatter a lot of these false bear paradigms
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:20.320]  especially when they've been ingrained in your brain for 15 or 20 years so you
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:23.960]  know I think that she's a good well-meaning person I don't think who
[1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:28.760]  she's who you want to go to for 9-11 truth or really a global perspective on
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:32.120]  things she's good at exposing corruption I hope that she exposes
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:36.000]  democratic corruption as much as she does as she did Republican I mean if
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.240]  she went after Pelosi a few times we'll see where it goes I mean we'll only find
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:44.720]  out in the next month when Barack Obama's in office by his actions and by the
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:49.480]  media reporting on him all right let's go to turbo in California turbo what's on
[1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:57.840]  your mind hey Jason Burma's yeah may I preface my call by first saying that a
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:04.280]  reflection upon a Russell means appeared on Alex Jones show there a couple of
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:08.200]  days ago about three or four days ago sure the Lakota tribe and they were
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:12.960]  talking about setting up their own back all that you're not now if all the all
[1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:19.680]  the people within the voice of my listening all the people listening
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:24.600]  Russell means wrote a book he's it is called the where white men fear to
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:28.760]  tread and I was never mentioned on the Alex Jones show but it's one of the
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:34.320]  best books I ever read I was actually in prison in California when I read it
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:39.280]  why do you why don't you give just a brief synopsis of this book well it's
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:46.880]  autobiography and it's like it's a it's really it'll it'll make you laugh it'll
[1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:53.200]  make you laugh and it cried tears because it's man a real American but
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:58.440]  that's not the main reason why I called you okay I just why just I I thought
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:04.640]  Alex gave a Russell means a short shift there you know he like I had him on for
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:12.560]  about 27 minutes but that but actually that's not why I called it because I'm
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:19.080]  a hundred percent man dude I back you a hundred percent okay I did you and I
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:27.200]  back Alex Jones and I back info wars dot com prison plan dot com and I I I back
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:33.040]  the info wars but the main reason why I called is to tell you this man it's like
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:39.000]  not everything is lost here in America mm-hmm because we are living in the
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.200]  moment right can you concur that with me no I don't think everything is lost I
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:47.880]  said I think that we still have better qualities than 90% of the nations out
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:50.680]  there and I think that change can occur but it's gonna take you know from the
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:55.040]  bottom up it's gonna take us waking up to the fact that Democrats and
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:57.920]  Republicans don't have our best interests at heart I thank for the call

[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:40.560]  Madeleine Albright we should play that clip too we'll play that when we go to prismplanet.tv we'll play some of these other clips we're going to play the glowing pigs clips because you know we're manufacturing glowing pigs now for some reason

[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:20.560]  there for it's an insurance policy alright let's go to our next caller let's go to Kurt in Pennsylvania Kurt what's on your mind
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:39.560]  Hey Jason how are you doing? Very good I'm calling to share two concepts with yourself and your listeners one is we need to become alternative force commanders which instead of waiting for a hierarchy to arrive to help us get things done we all take the responsibility
[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:52.560]  and make a new year's resolution to paint some signs you know it could be 9-11 truth it could be about many different issues and go down to their courthouse square or wherever which is a specific free speech zone
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:55:04.560]  and stand there and talk to people learn to defend your ideas and get some street activism you know flex your citizenship muscle and I also wanted to share our website I'm with the common sense revival
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:23.560]  which is trying to get a renaissance of citizenship our website is http commonsenserevival.tripod.com what we're using is two ideas critical thinking which you know we're being stampeded with propaganda we need to be able to weed through that
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:39.560]  school systems are like brainwash factories so critical thinking the first part which usually makes you depressed so then you go to positive psychology which helps you you know keep going as an activist because intellectually absorbing so much sadness and disturbing information
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:54.560]  well you know when exactly when you do take in this information I thank you for the call you can get a little bit down I remember when I first discovered you know that there was something terribly wrong with 9-11 I lost a lot of sleep woke up in cold sweats at night and
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:56:09.560]  yeah it was disturbing but at the same time we're adults we're not children we don't need to be protected from the truth in fact we need to confront the truth no matter how disturbing so that we can change it into a more positive you know way of living
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  if you don't confront the truth if you call up in a ball you just basically allow it to get worse and worse and worse and we've seen it get out of control in so many other countries and cultures to a point that it's really never gotten out of control within this one
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:42.560]  but that could be coming and that is a scary scary scary thing and I hope it doesn't come we're gonna go to Christina and David Moore we're gonna be on prisonplanet.tv on the other side so we encourage you to tune in now infowars.com truthnews.us
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:57:06.560]  Jason Burma subbing for Alex Jones will be back after the break you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:12.560]  unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:16.560]  the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy?
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.560]  bin Laden this is his M.O.
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:21.560]  we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to his home of bin Laden
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:52.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:58:08.560]  infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:28.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:38.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:50.560]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are now in the third hour of this global transmission January 12th 2009 I am Jason Burma subbing in for you here at prisonplanet.tv
[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:56.560]  infowars.com and on all of our AM and FM affiliates
[1:58:56.560 --> 1:59:04.560]  I want to play this clip we haven't played this when we discussed the Colin Powell warning but I also want to show that not only Joe Biden, Colin Powell
[1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:18.560]  but Madeline Albright also said that Obama would be under a crisis in the first couple of months of his presidency so what is this crisis let's go to the video let's go to Albright
[1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:34.560]  I want to ask you what you thought of what Joe Biden said yesterday in terms of this idea that now Senator Obama if he becomes president will be tested by an international crisis within the first six months John McCain certainly picked up on that let's listen to what he said yesterday
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:54.560]  but if Senator Obama is elected Senator Biden said we will have an international crisis to test America's new president we don't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy was in crisis and Americans are already fighting in two wars
[1:59:54.560 --> 2:00:10.560]  I think it is a statement of fact frankly and in my book I talk about the fact that there are a lot of big issues out there but that also something unexpected you always have to be prepared for that
[2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:24.560]  statement of fact what what do these people know that we don't know these are insiders folks let's bring up the the power clip as well you know I want to play that power clip one more time I mean the way that Powell actually says this and let's cut it off before it goes all blue or whatever
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:40.560]  the way that Powell actually says this it is extremely frightening I mean I just I don't know why we're not more alarmed about this I don't know why it hasn't been talked about a few people have really picked up on it but now we're a little over a week away from the
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:54.560]  inauguration we're really only a little over a week from this information if it's true if there's really going to be a crisis so let's play power plant saying it up start with talking to the American people and talking to the world
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:01:08.560]  and conveying a new image of American leadership a new image of America's role in the world the problems will always be there and there's going to be a crisis come along on the 21st or 22nd of January that we don't even know about right now
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:18.560]  how do we not know about it how does he know about it and we don't all right let's keep taking your calls let's go to Christina in Maryland Christina what's on your mind
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:38.560]  Christina you there and I just wanted to make a comment about yesterday's recording you said that minister Lewis very calm in a comment that he believed that Obama was a messiah and that statement is not true
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:57.560]  you did call yesterday and I believe his exact words is the youth listen when the messiah speaks and the messiah is speaking and I am almost 100% sure that he is referring to Obama we're going to play the clip we're going to put the controversy to
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:11.560]  Christina it'll come up in the next segment I thank you for the call let's move on to David California got understand folks that you know he's not the only one calling Obama the messiah just type in Obama messiah and there's plenty of mainstream articles out there
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:27.560]  in places like the huffington post left wing publications where where again they're saying he's the one he's the one that's going to lead us out he's on the cover every magazine he's on the cover of the amazing spider man we're going to pull that picture up in a moment to
[2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:42.560]  all right play play Farrakhan saying and then we'll take Dave in California
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:03:08.560]  and that is why Barak has captured the youth and he has involved young people in a political process that they didn't care anything about that's a sign when the messiah speaks the youth will hear
[2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:15.560]  when the messiah speaks it's info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:51.560]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:04:05.560]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:15.560]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:28.560]  the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:43.560]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:53.560]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports
[2:04:53.560 --> 2:05:01.560]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:08.560]  visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the final list of high quality freeze dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:19.560]  watch the free videos look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633 again 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[2:05:19.560 --> 2:05:24.560]  take action today the first step is getting storeable food
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:27.560]  he's the t-rex of political talk
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:32.560]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:38.560]  all right folks we're back and we're gonna put that lewis ferrican calling obama the messiah clip one more time
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:48.560]  and let's say let's say he's not referring to obama as the messiah he's saying that the messiah is ordaining obama which is I would say just as bad if not worse
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:54.560]  so you decide here it is ferrican obama messiah let's play the clip
[2:05:54.560 --> 2:06:12.560]  instruments that god is going to use to bring about universal change and that is why barack has captured the youth
[2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:21.560]  and he has involved young people in a political process that they didn't care anything about
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:33.560]  that's a sign when the messiah speaks the youth will hear
[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:38.560]  and the messiah is absolutely speaking
[2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:46.560]  so I don't know maybe we're gonna have to disagree there's a couple other clips on there we'll see if he said it on numerous occasions
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:52.560]  if you guys could pull up the barack obama amazing spider man cover I'm gonna want to show that in a moment
[2:06:52.560 --> 2:06:58.560]  but first let's go to more phone calls let's take dave in California dave what's on your mind
[2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:03.560]  I don't see how you can really interpret that any other way frankly
[2:07:03.560 --> 2:07:13.560]  you know what she I gotta tell you I talked around the show yesterday I am a fan of how first of all nation Islam Muslims know about government corruption
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:21.560]  a lot of them are in the know they know that there's something wrong with both political parties however and ferrican is able to mobilize a lot of people
[2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:31.560]  man behind the million man march the millions more march which is a positive thing but when he gets up there and he backs a candidate who is a globalist candidate
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:40.560]  who is promoting this one world order you know global citizenship and the like he's not gonna get us out of the war he's just a slick package
[2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:47.560]  I think that's a huge problem I think it's a bigger problem when this religious figure refers to him as the messiah go ahead dave
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:56.560]  I agree with you and he talks about universal change that bothers me a little bit that sounds like code for new world order stuff to me
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:08:07.560]  it's upsetting you know you know ferrican again he's he's done some some decent things he's not that he's not in the top list of my demons but again he has a lot of people under his wing
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:17.560]  you know there are a lot of you know nation Islam Muslims are bow tie Muslims I like to call him and he has a huge sway over them so you know this is
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:28.560]  religion in so many cases is used to really block people's vision and coordinate them on agendas that really have nothing to do with the religion at all and that's what worries me
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:33.560]  okay well I got two fast things for you first table enemies rocks man
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:43.560]  oh thank you big time props for that anybody can watch Barry Jennings talking about the giant explosions going off in number seven while the towers are still standing how the lobby was annihilated
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:51.560]  and claim that the official story anything but garbage is just wasting your time and you know it's a good way to sort out the morons out there
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:09:00.560]  secondly I have a suggestion for those folks you know who are who like me and probably you and everybody else in this in the truth movement have just get are just getting fed up
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:12.560]  who want to viciously attack the evil leaders without with truth but without violence and I suggest that we consider attacking their symbols of power and their fake honor
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:23.560]  because they set great stock in the adulation of the public and their magical fake power attack that's that's that's interesting because you know this didn't get reported on
[2:09:23.560 --> 2:09:33.560]  most of the alternative news networks but the Georgia guide stones were pretty defaced and somebody had went to the Georgia guide stones they had spray painted 911 was an inside job
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:47.560]  after your new world order I think infowars dot com was spray painted on there look I'm not saying yet you haven't seen this yet it's I know but it's pretty wild I didn't see something about a guy standing out in front of it with some signs
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:53.560]  no no no no this guy just type in Georgia guide stones defaced and this happened one or two weeks ago
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:10:06.560]  yeah yeah and you know it's funny that you call that hey I'm not telling people to break the law but you know there's an all seeing I right under the world trade center anybody who's visited the New York subway station in the
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:15.560]  subway station you know we're going to pull a picture that up to I'll pull them up during the break and we'll have for the next segment but first of all when you get off at the world trade center
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:25.560]  stop there's a bunch of just eyes all over the place these little mosaic I tiles right so then when you go to go up the stairs and come out of the the port right there by the world trade center
[2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:38.560]  there's just this little it's like a lower fenced off area and there's another mosaic in its own mosaic mosaic of the entire world and in the middle of the world is a pulsating all seeing I that pulsates through the entire world
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:49.560]  and it is just sick to me that they do throw up their gang low logos at the scenes of their crimes all the time so again I'm not encouraging people to break the law but big ups to the guy who did that at the Georgia
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:56.560]  guide stones thanks for the call Dave let's take another call let's go to Rick in Texas Rick what's on your mind
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:16.560]  Jason thanks for taking my call you got it I'll be real quick just a couple things I've been a listener and I was my eyes are open and the early 90s during the Clinton administration of course Oklahoma City happened and I knew that everything that I felt instinctively was accurate
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:34.560]  but I'm originally from Houston I moved out here to Alpine Texas I don't know if you know Alpine is I know I don't it's about 90 miles from the Presidio border it's Fort Stockton about 75 miles south of the middle of Odessa
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:48.560]  if you look on the map I'm down there in the corner from the panhandle the very most southern part of the state for most part but a couple things just looking at Google map and pulling up the FEMA concentration camps around the United States
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  there's a plethora of them but there's none in my area and it is kind of confusing because we actually have the highest law enforcement per capita than anybody in the United States we have US Marshals the Border Patrol is huge
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:25.560]  Sheriff's Department and Homeland Security office here as well and I'm watching a huge influx daily I have an office here right off the highway and I see more and more and more Border Patrol trucks vehicles and agents traveling to work every day every day that I see is growing
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:38.560]  so I was wondering if you had an insight on why this particular area it's obviously also the entrance port called Law and Trotter to the trans-Texas corridor
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:43.560]  they just said that they killed the trans-Texas corridor and all they're going to do is rename it you know it's not going anywhere
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:13:07.560]  that's exactly what Alex had said is that it makes it more difficult to challenge it if it's against multiple entities versus one and there's a video online called The Truth Be Told being spelled T-O-L-L-E-D which is a great video for people who have no idea what the ultimate purpose of the trans-Texas corridor is
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:14.560]  but I moved out here because it's the last slice of America truly
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  well I don't know if it's the last slice of America
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:22.560]  I can ride my bicycle to the movie theater and leave it unlocked go inside and watch a movie and come back and it's still there
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:31.560]  you know what though that's in a lot of places like where I am in upstate New York you know crime isn't that bad there's places in Vermont there's places in Pennsylvania there's places in Connecticut
[2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:39.560]  and you know but one of the scary things is that not so far away from where I grew up which is only about an hour from where I live
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:47.560]  there's a huge FEMA camp outside of Fonda and I mean it's crazy they have the little portable coffins and it is more than unnerving
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:55.560]  but you know we just got to keep exposing that we got to keep exposing when they run anti-terror drills we have to keep exposing when they try to pass anti-gun legislation
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:03.560]  we have to keep exposing everything you know that that's why there's great organizations out there you know I love 9-11 blogger
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:09.560]  we can't do it all here at info wars dot com you know I like some of the stuff that GNN does a guerrilla news network
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:17.560]  you know even some of the stuff that Huffington Post and Raw Story put out there at least they're getting people to think and get them to be somewhat aware
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:23.560]  alright let's go to our next caller let's go to Tony in Illinois Tony what's on your mind
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:29.560]  hey what's going on Jason not much just trying to fight the new world order my man
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:39.560]  I hear you same thing I'm hearing the big beautiful Chicago prison grid wonderful here I don't know how much time you spend here in Chicago
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:47.560]  but I know if you spend any time you know it's fairly multicultural and predominantly it's predominantly black
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:55.560]  since the election of Barack Obama now the import for thought the workplace I gotta tell you about this this is insanity
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:03.560]  the workplace I work in is 80% it's the 80% black environment I don't care about any of that that doesn't bother me at all
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:13.560]  what bothers me though is that political you know people want to talk about the world situation and heaven forbid the look of horror on their faces
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:23.560]  not just from you know supporters but from people who you know are not for this guy and are looking at you like oh my god you're dare talking about him in public
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:29.560]  it's it's frightening it really is I'm starting to really feel like Winston Smith out here
[2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:33.560]  you know I don't know about you well you know it's really orwellian for me
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:39.560]  you know besides the comic book thing and let's throw the comic book there there's a good picture of a smile up there
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:46.560]  just a little bit but you know he's on the cover the amazing spider man he's hip he's going to bump him but when I go into the malls
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:57.560]  and usually go to Albany for my mall it's you know the capital New York I mean it is just littered with Obama where you know I mean literally like it's hip now he's like a symbol like Martin Luther King Jr.
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:05.560]  I got news for you folks he's got a long way to go before he can even be considered to be in the same room as Martin Luther King Jr.
[2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:14.560]  oh yeah it's amazing let me tell you about something I saw today just on the news today with Pepsi I don't know if you guys have seen this yet
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:25.560]  but Pepsi's got a new ad campaign going on where they have replaced the Pepsi logo the red white and blue with the or the red and blue with the white ribbon across
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:42.560]  and shifted it to where it looks almost exactly like the Obama you know another all seeing eye symbol and it's all about it's about basically Obama worship being linked to product choice
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:54.560]  and it's in that's what I was describing earlier oh wow look at that it's exactly again change hope we change hope we
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:17:00.560]  that's what the predictive programming has been that's the new commercials everywhere that's I mean there it is right there bring it up
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:10.560]  there it is it is almost exactly like the new Obama logo how about that weird it's a coincidence right it's all just a dream

[2:21:36.560 --> 2:21:45.560]  and before we keep taking your calls remember we're going to have Matthew Medina from Rear Change San Antonio on at the top of the hour
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:52.560]  I want to shift gears a little bit you know wide open phones whatever you want to talk about we've been talking a lot about Obama and Biden today
[2:21:52.560 --> 2:22:04.560]  we've been talking about Pakistan but we also touched upon these genetically modified pigs and why this is important is because it's now growing outside of just lab stuff
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:14.560]  what do I mean by lab stuff well they create this stuff it's fancy but we're not going to breed them or anything are we well yeah we just created a new type of pig
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:26.560]  two of the nine piglets glow in the dark folks and we're now creating species on this earth that that is incredible it's it's it's almost godlike and I'm sure that the scientists that are doing this are
[2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:36.560]  are not only thinking that but it's I guess it's one thing to do this in a back lab or to show something on display it's another thing to start creating genetic organisms
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:53.560]  you know I even more so than you know just plant life I guess and creating these animals I mean what what is next so let's let's go to the glowing pig the glowing piglets that's what we want to see
[2:22:53.560 --> 2:23:08.560]  beings were altered to make it glow fluorescent green has given birth to a pair of fluorescent piglets thank goodness we finally reached that scientific milestone mama pig gave birth to a litter of 11 in China over the weekend and two of its babies came out glowing
[2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:24.560]  scientists say the piglets birth proves that genetically modified pigs can pass on their engineered traits to their young researchers now want to see if they can grow human organs and pigs to use in transplants for MSNBC dot com I'm Willie Geist
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:38.560]  and you notice how he threw in that they now want to see whether or not they can grow human organs inside of them know they were doing that in 2002 okay and of the 11 pigs two of them came out with the genes well the other nine still carry the
[2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:55.560]  traits so when they have piglets some of their piglets will more than likely also glow in the dark we've we've we've changed the structure of pigs for ever eventually these will interbreed into the rest of the population I mean man it is it is
[2:23:55.560 --> 2:24:09.560]  wild what man has really done unbelievable alright let's go to mark in Oregon mark what's on your mind
[2:24:09.560 --> 2:24:25.560]  hey Jason how you doing good Jason you know I've spoken with you about six months ago by the way it's great to hear you on the airways again and to see Alex get up such a well overdeserved vacation there oh thank you and I brought up the film by
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:43.560]  Eric Schmidt you know how to spell that it's H U F F C H M I D T I believe are you talking about painful deceptions right and I think it's painful questions okay the deceptions is the book sure yeah painful questions is the video excuse me
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:57.560]  that's what I'm referring to here you get up in that video somewhere in the body of it more or less halfway through it or so and a frame comes up that shows a still photograph of a global hog nestle parked on a runway
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:13.560]  very next frame is one of it's the only one I've ever seen and there may be others I haven't seen a whole lot of videos but it's been very next frame that follows the photograph of the global hog nestle which of course is you're aware of looks like a small airplane
[2:25:13.560 --> 2:25:29.560]  and it shows the inside of the hole that was made in the Pentagon by whatever hit it and of course it's widely speculated that a global hog nestle was involved there and it actually put some lights inside the hole
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:45.560]  there's someone shining some lights into the hole so that you can actually see pretty well what's inside of that hole and when you look off to the right hand side and inside the hole here you see a an inflated tire with the wheel still
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  it's still of course you know has the wheel within it and you compare that tire about wheel actually because it's a very specialized aerodynamically designed wheel it looks like you compare that with the actual picture of the wheel of the global hog nestle and the frame immediately
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:21.560]  preceding that and they are identical and it's a very small tire it would not even be used on a 727 you know take a screenshot send us the info I may have seen the thing before but send it over to Aaroninfowars.com
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:35.560]  if you look it up because I'm not on the internet okay are some of the listeners but anyway if you can spell it out for people and give the right name of the video for people don't send it to you sure you got it it's painful deceptions I thank for the call let's go to
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:58.560]  Kyle in Alabama Kyle what's on your mind oh no Kyle hung up I'm sorry let's go Mr. X in Texas I love these fake names I what I have yesterday at Captain Cook Mr. X we had turbo today really is it so hard to say hey my name's Mark all right we're gonna take that call we're gonna take Mr. X and others on the other side it's the Alex Jones show

[2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:58.560]  we're taking your calls we're gonna have a matthew medina from we are changing san antonio up
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:14.560]  in a little under half an hour this is the long segment we just played played you glowing pig clips that's right we've changed the genetic structure of pigs to make them glow and it'll probably infiltrate the entire species and will have all sorts of nice little goodies
[2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:21.560]  and then they say oh but it's for research so that we can grow human organs in them and will have organ transplants for everybody
[2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:30.560]  be nice if it was true but they've been doing that since 2002 you don't think that they've somewhat i mean they may not have perfected it but made it good enough so that they could actually do that listen
[2:31:30.560 --> 2:31:38.560]  if it ever does come along it's gonna cost so much money and really only be for probably upper to middle class to lower level elites
[2:31:38.560 --> 2:31:48.560]  it's not for you and i i'm sorry i hate to tell you we are the surf class you know what's for you and i diet pepsi with obama logos on apparently
[2:31:48.560 --> 2:31:54.560]  and we showed that earlier i can't believe it but they did just change their little logo to something that looks a lot
[2:31:54.560 --> 2:32:00.560]  not exactly like the little obama oh but for some reason they did put in a circle it looks a lot similar
[2:32:00.560 --> 2:32:05.560]  god knows all right let's keep taking your calls let's go to mister x in texas
[2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:18.560]  hello jason how you doing man hello um the reason why i'm not giving my real name is because i am a uh or i've been used by the cia as an operative
[2:32:18.560 --> 2:32:28.560]  uh i want to first talk about oh i first want to say that i would not discuss this if i was not giving the clearance to discuss it
[2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:41.560]  uh make of that what you will um as you might recall being a journalist in august of oh six uh we started hearing about uh liquid explosives being smuggled onto airplanes
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:48.560]  okay and that's a couple years back the liquid explosives plot which was led back to really ties to the isi
[2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:58.560]  yes um the mr bush our president got on the air and said a terrorist plot was foiled by a cia operative codename mastermind
[2:32:58.560 --> 2:33:10.560]  this was me i went to spain in uh august of oh eight and at the time i was not um i was being watched by the central intelligence agency
[2:33:10.560 --> 2:33:18.560]  or the intelligence community instead to stick a label on the cia literally limited you really need to say it's the intelligence community
[2:33:18.560 --> 2:33:32.560]  okay and uh while while there i was uh in a cafe and uh the computer activated a screen popped up it was from the cia and i began to be asked all these questions
[2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:43.560]  i answered all the questions and at the end i was given the designation mastermind um and then on the trip back there was an attempt to put the liquid explosives
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:54.560]  by the cia into my bags to have me be a patsy or fallout guy for uh this terrorist agenda that they were trying to push
[2:33:54.560 --> 2:34:04.560]  well listen man i gotta tell you i mean we're live radio uh your story sounds interesting obviously i can't confirm it over the air please send us some information
[2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:12.560]  that doesn't mean you have to send us a name set up a bogus email account send it from a coffee shop if this is legitimate give us something that we can confirm any of this
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:17.560]  and i'm sure alex will have you on for a full hour to discuss it i thank you for the call
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:26.560]  um let's go to derrick in texas folks when you get calls like that you know it's like first of all this isn't the uh coast to coast and i like george norian everything like that
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:34.560]  but you know there are plenty of people that like to just call up and say whatever that guy sounded awfully young to be a cia agent he sounded younger than i am
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:42.560]  and that now does that mean it's not possible no but i'm not gonna throw my weight behind it someone just called in with some information
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:48.560]  so i gotta move on like i said i hope you send us some information if it turns out to be true i'm sure alex will have you on as a guest
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:51.560]  alright let's go to derrick in texas derrick what's on your mind
[2:34:51.560 --> 2:35:02.560]  jason i was an undergrad in mechanical engineering when 9-11 happened and i was being taught by a structural engineer who was teaching us the finite element method
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:12.560]  at uta and he was the first person to wake me up although it didn't fully wake me up his comment to us was those buildings fell way too fast they fell wrong
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:22.560]  everything's wrong with this but we assumed our government would never ever do something like this even though i thought stuff that you know probably shouldn't go on in the military while i served
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:32.560]  and i'm sure other veterans can relate to that anyway years later i'm still asking where are the contract plans that is the building construction design
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:42.560]  architectural drawings mechanical drawings otherwise known as the contract documents i've got a new face i've got them okay now are these the south power ones that south
[2:35:42.560 --> 2:35:54.560]  and north yes yes yes yes okay where's the public place because what needs to happen here is both undergraduate and graduate engineers and lay people and whoever that know how to run finite element software
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:36:05.560]  can recreate this entire building using 3d cad software and then simulation well i hope that you do that you do i think you can get them off of you just type in you go to jones
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:15.560]  is a website and you look for like the pdf archives i know that's the format they're in is pdf and they're pretty high res so you should probably be able to input them into a cad program rather easily
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:29.560]  with the right labels like you said construct a 3d model i'm all for it i mean i don't know if they reported on this show but supposedly and this is a big supposedly myth busters is finally going to do there was a press release a few months
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:41.560]  ago a show on nine eleven truth and that they're going to actually build the world trade center to one third scale they got twenty million dollar budget for the show it costs seven point two million dollars to build these things
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:54.560]  and they're going to fly remote controlled bowings at one third the size into the buildings and see what happens i'm anxious to see it they're also from the press release they're anticipating it that it will be the largest watch
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:37:07.560]  television program in the history of the united states outside of sporting events a k the super bowl of the world series so of course i encourage all you independent researchers out there all you engineers to check it out
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:16.560]  i'm pretty sure that they're widely available in pdf pdf format if you know who to ask of steven jones will get back to you architects and engineers for nine eleven truth will get back for you
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:28.560]  get back to you with the files i i thank you for the caldera you can never have enough independent research folks you know there's nothing wrong with testing some of the scientists scientific theories
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:40.560]  that the government has put out there since on none of them actually live up to scrutiny and they constantly change well you know what i think that they pancaked what happened was the sagging started to occur there was fifteen hundred degree
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:53.560]  temperatures one that we know there were fifteen hundred temperatures in there and uh... it started to sag and then just one after another pancake a roux but then there were no pancakes and then they said well what really happened is
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:38:13.560]  uh... you know it just couldn't stand the stress and they didn't actually have to melter they just collapsed on top of themselves global collapse well i you know i'm nowhere near the expert someone like kevin ryan underwriters laboratory is who's done numerous papers on it so i encourage people to go check that out you know
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:24.560]  engineers for nine eleven truth have really been on the front lines the past few years and uh... i commend richard gauge and others for what they've done all right let's go to mark in canada mark what's on your mind
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:48.560]  today uh... i'm calling from ottawa i just want to let people know that we were out in force yesterday for eleven to every month uh... truth action for nine eleven truth truth action dot org another great organization yeah i just actually donated a hundred dollars truth action dot org today i didn't have it but i did it you know because uh... this was our twenty first truth action we've been doing it for twenty twenty one month
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:59.560]  and uh... we actually walked around downtown ottawa today yesterday hit our four main spot that we've uh... done over the last year and did like a little recap so there's going to be a video coming out pretty soon
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:16.560]  um... amazing time beautiful weather uh... we gave up four hundred dvd with five movies on each dvd and uh... that's what we're doing we're still i also want to mention that here in canada we were able to the nine eleven truth is not a lot we were able to actually form an electoral district
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:24.560]  for the canadian action party here so i'd like to we have our own we have an actual political party that supports nine eleven truth
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:30.560]  so i'd like to encourage the other canadian nine eleven truth groups to form electoral districts in their area
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:39.560]  and that's great man that's how we can get involved see there's an organization that's been around now for just a little bit under two years and they keep expanding and they keep
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:46.560]  re-investing in that organization they realize that things aren't going to just come overnight i thank you for the call i mean again
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:56.560]  i see nine eleven truth in the public eye again limited hangout uh... more documents will be exposed over the next two years but really it won't come into
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:07.560]  you know the level that it did in the fifth anniversary until the tenth anniversary and that's just because of our subliminal programming where we are accustomed to fives tens twenty twenty fives
[2:40:07.560 --> 2:40:14.560]  fiftieth anniversary the tenth anniversary is going to be the biggest moment for nine eleven truth yet if we still have a country left
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:22.560]  internationally it is sure to be the biggest moment for nine eleven truth no matter what but in this country i guarantee it'll be the largest it's ever been
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:30.560]  if we still have a country left in two thousand eleven i'm hoping we have a country left i don't know what do you think jaren we can have a country left
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:38.560]  maybe maybe not maybe we'll just all have pepsi with obama symbols alright let's jump to another caller let's actually bring it up bring it up
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:46.560]  there's the full screen cover of uh... the whole shot of the amazing spider-man with obama on it so you don't get to see you got to see
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:54.560]  spidey and a smiling obama but not only do you get to see that he's got the thumbs up obama's tops yeah i'm number one president
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:41:01.560]  i'm on the cover of rolling stone and spider-man everybody loves me opera loves me look at me i'm gonna save the world
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:10.560]  the first global president i think is another term that they've used for really so a uh... you know state senator with one term in the senate
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  and then automatically boosted the president he's the global leader guys not even fifty i mean i don't i don't claim to have all the knowledge in the
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:26.560]  world i'm not the wisest guy around but uh... i think i'm hip enough to know that this guy inauguration day the amazing spider-man
[2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:32.560]  number five hundred eighty three maybe they'll have like a number six hundred issue uh... seventeen months down the line and another
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  obama commemorative well i'd like the foil and the rubies on and you know i can wear like a diamond hat
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:46.560]  alright i'm getting ridiculous alright let's let's go another caller let's go to joe in illinois joe what's on your mind
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:53.560]  hey how's it going jason good i got a quick question to fight it up sure yeah just got a quick question for you
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:59.560]  um... i know you probably have mentioned this on shirts out there but i really haven't heard anything about it lately
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:06.560]  very jennings um... sure was it ever brought out like what the nature of his death was alright yes i'm glad you i'm glad you asked
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:13.560]  that question uh... no i'm glad because i really want to know alright alright just to review review what happened there
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:19.560]  um... at the end of august there were some emails circulating around we're getting emails that berry jennings had died
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:26.560]  now i went to try to confirm this um... you know i talked to dylan i then uh... he got in touch with mike rudeen of the bbc
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:32.560]  uh... who filmed him for that hit piece mike rudeen said oh i'm gonna find out don't worry there's nothing going on
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:38.560]  then on september eleventh we got out there rudeen still said that you know everything was fine with berry he had been able to get in
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:45.560]  contact with him but he wasn't able to confirm his death well we were able to confirm his death we were able to get that same
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  source to give us the information and later on the original source did contact us i think a few months ago and uh...
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:58.560]  i don't want to give away who the original sources but he says that berry died of leukemia which is very possible
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:05.560]  and uh... you know whether or not this is something that he was given maybe this is something he got sick with from being on
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:12.560]  the trade center we all know you know excessive leverage uh... levels of chromium barium all these other toxic heavy metals
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:19.560]  may have done it but the official cause of death as far as anybody knows is he he died from leukemia you know he didn't
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:25.560]  hang himself it wasn't a suicide and i you know i want to put that out there because the person who did tell us that
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:30.560]  you know they talked about the truth movement being you know about the truth and to me it is about the truth
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:35.560]  i can tell you what happened to that man i can tell you he died under suspicious circumstances and to the best of my knowledge
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:37.560]  it was from leukemia
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:45.560]  yeah that's really interesting i didn't know it was leukemia i mean i actually come from the medical field and usually leukemia
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:53.560]  is a very long drawn out process before death now that they find that kind of interesting depending on what kind of leukemia
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:44:03.560]  it is but you know compared to like the one that does uh... russian uh... kb kb agent that uh... just got uh...
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:05.560]  he got sick suddenly and died
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:11.560]  right yeah and then i understand that's that's pretty much how he went there was not a lot of uh... warning it wasn't
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:17.560]  something that he had battled with from a long time i mean i had really only done that interview with him a little over a year
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:23.560]  earlier you know it wasn't it wasn't that uh... that he then he died of leukemia i think it was under eighteen months
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:29.560]  and he didn't seem sick when i was there i mean he's a large man as you know uh... cancer patients usually get skinny
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:35.560]  you know the sicker they are so again i don't want to speculate any further but that you know from the best of my knowledge
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  it was a leukemia death
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:43.560]  okay very good i just had one other thing to say other than this is uh... in regards to the caller
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:50.560]  from chicago i'm also in chicago and i gotta tell you brother you know what you're in the lion's den as far as uh...
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:55.560]  you know people you know being so pro obama i mean you know he talks about eighty percent of the people
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:45:01.560]  in his office being african-american and you know being like the true minority well of course i mean
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:08.560]  we all are i mean i voted for chuck Baldwin you know and and and uh... you know even where i i work at
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  uh... we're an extremely liberal uh... organization you know i'm obviously you know true conservative
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:21.560]  and i mean these people around here are completely snow just like everybody else i mean it's you got really got a tiptoe
[2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:26.560]  around and it's and it's very frustrating because of the fact that you want to be able to voice your opinion but you
[2:45:26.560 --> 2:45:28.560]  cannot
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:33.560]  yeah no it is and you know there is a lot of social pressure i mean i've been in an office workplace before where
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:38.560]  i read with me and uh... in fact you know i'm sitting there listening to alex jones in my office and people are
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:43.560]  coming in going was that rush limbaugh and then they listen for a minute and they know immediately it's not rush limbaugh
[2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:48.560]  so you kind of have to explain your views and you know sometimes you're considered the cook out there but
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:53.560]  look the proof is in the pudding i can guarantee you that people are not gonna be happy happier than they are
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:59.560]  a year from now it's only gonna get worse so hopefully people will wake up through that i think for the call
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:04.560]  alright let's uh... let's jump to lindsay in ohio lindsay what's on your mind
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:06.560]  hello jason yes
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:08.560]  yeah good to hear from you
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:12.560]  first time i'll talk to you i'll talk to alex a couple of times just a quick thing
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:17.560]  uh... about these two i guess mainstream would call them incidences
[2:46:17.560 --> 2:46:19.560]  of these uh...
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:26.560]  two people that were shot by the police recently uh... the one by bart and uh... then the undercover cops in the new orleans
[2:46:26.560 --> 2:46:27.560]  mm-hmm
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:32.560]  okay now seen a lot of it on uh... alternative sources
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:38.560]  i've asked a few friends this weekend during the big games and all that there was people there if they saw anything on
[2:46:38.560 --> 2:46:42.560]  mainstream news regarding this all of them said no
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:47.560]  has there been anything on mainstream about this that you know of
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:52.560]  yeah um... let me see the the guy who was pinned down and shot in the chest
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:46:59.560]  police station yeah there was a little bit of coverage on cnn's web page in fact uh... the day after that happened a bunch of
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:04.560]  people were actually wearing signs on their back that said don't shoot me they were just white pieces of paper they take
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:10.560]  a lot of people in protest actually if you type that into google you can easily bring that up so cnn to do do a couple
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.560]  of news reports about that but what happens with those is alright
[2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:20.560]  you'll see those on two of cnn stations in the twenty four hour news block usually the stations that don't play a lot of

[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:50.560]  we fired our guns and the British kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[2:51:50.560 --> 2:51:55.560]  we fired once more and they began to run it down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:16.560]  so if you hold on we'll get back to your calls in the last half an hour it's really been a hodgepodge of
[2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:24.560]  Pakistan Biden Obama glowing pigs what a day what a day for the Alex Jones show but none of this is really
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:30.560]  possible without our sponsors and the good listeners of prisonplanet.tv and the people that buy our videos
[2:52:30.560 --> 2:52:35.560]  so you know we hope that you go out there you get a copy of fabled enemies which I have right over here

[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:56.560]  in case there's a power outage you have power you know Jesse Ventura he lives off the grid out on Mexico most of it
[2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:04.560]  is solar energy it's time to get solar energy if you don't have it I mean my my friends parents have had it for years
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:09.560]  and it works great heats their pool heats their you know their garage the cool house I mean they don't spend
[2:53:09.560 --> 2:53:14.560]  any electricity on that at all that's where you know me and my friends used to spend our days when we were in high
[2:53:14.560 --> 2:53:26.560]  school the number is 1-877-327-0365 that's 1-877-327-0365 and it's mysolarbackup.com if you want to get some
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:31.560]  solar panels and you know help us out help our sponsors it's something we believe in it's something that works

[2:53:37.560 --> 2:53:42.560]  what it is out here where I am it's national grid it's NYSIG it's all the good people that want to charge you
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:48.560]  variable rates for your energy that they can jack up at any moment just the facts all right let's try to squeeze
[2:53:48.560 --> 2:53:55.560]  in another caller before we go to the top of the hour let's go to Peter in California Peter what's on your mind
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:54:05.560]  hey Jason how you doing I'm doing well I'm just calling to say you're doing a great job and I think the truth is
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:12.560]  out there and a lot of people know but there's still a lot of people that don't know and I came up with an idea
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:21.560]  how to spread the word among people that don't really go on internet and I was thinking and I started doing that here
[2:54:21.560 --> 2:54:30.560]  but I would probably want more support and that's just putting using their system against them which is
[2:54:30.560 --> 2:54:39.560]  writing the information on the bank notes and somebody thinks a good idea they should probably yeah and
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:45.560]  you know you throw info wars dot com on a five dollar bill in big letters people notice that you throw
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:52.560]  prism planet dot com on there you throw you know loose change 901 dot com you know all this stuff is is positive
[2:54:52.560 --> 2:54:56.560]  because people take a look at it and if even if they don't realize that it's in their subliminal you know they'll
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:01.560]  remember it for a moment and then if someone else introduces it to them they're more apt to take a look continue
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:07.560]  if you still have to use the cash and then I mean if you still have to use your money use it and use cash
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:15.560]  and use the smallest notes and try to write or print as many as you can and people usually don't notice that but
[2:55:15.560 --> 2:55:21.560]  after sometime like some people do so they'll be good the other thing that interested me was like the cancer you were
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:30.560]  talking about yes and I think there is a lot of truth in it especially when you hear about people that died of
[2:55:30.560 --> 2:55:37.560]  cancer recently like also Aaron Russo and three rounds of ill maybe even jacket Kennedy I'm not sure about that
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:42.560]  but you know I don't know whether they're injecting these guys with little like you know pellet guns of ice
[2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:46.560]  like they had in the church committee where they showed that the CIA had these little ice guns where they could
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:51.560]  just inject somebody with poison or a disease but I do know that cancer has run rampant mainly because
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:56.560]  we put cancer viruses in our vaccines they're delicious all right we'll be back at the top of the hour with
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:56:01.560]  Matthew Medina from We Are Changed San Antonio it's the Alex Jones show I am Jason Burmese

[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:22.560]  what's on your mind today
[2:58:22.560 --> 2:58:24.560]  Hey great to speak with you Barman
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:28.560]  No it's great to have you on man and why don't you tell people how you got involved
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:32.560]  I mean from your awakening to 9-11 truth or the patriot movement in general
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:35.560]  and then how you got involved what was the process
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:39.560]  Yeah sir I started with watching the actual events 9-11
[2:58:39.560 --> 2:58:43.560]  and what would grab my attention was the footage of the dance of Palestinians
[2:58:43.560 --> 2:58:47.560]  and the commentary saying that they were actually celebrating us being attacked
[2:58:47.560 --> 2:58:51.560]  almost within 10 minutes of the attack happening I was like what
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:55.560]  we did a little web search and found info wars, wrote a tyranny
[2:58:55.560 --> 2:59:02.560]  and I would basically tell all my friends all the b-boys all the breakdancers I wouldn't know at the time
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:05.560]  I would tell everybody about it and it was just kind of conspiracy-ish
[2:59:05.560 --> 2:59:11.560]  and I kind of let it go I'd check in for wars and it comes to Ron Paul Revolution in San Antonio
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:15.560]  and I joined the meetup I started campaigning going door to door in all my neighborhoods
[2:59:15.560 --> 2:59:20.560]  basically doing the whole campaign and grassroots activities
[2:59:20.560 --> 2:59:25.560]  and then as the campaign started to die down I mean I was just getting warmed up and still am to this day
[2:59:25.560 --> 2:59:29.560]  and so I started we changed San Antonio at the end of the summer it's been about 6 months
[2:59:29.560 --> 2:59:33.560]  and pretty much we've been busy 2-3 activities a month
[2:59:33.560 --> 2:59:37.560]  handing out about 500 DVDs a month and with the help of Harlan and Brave New Books
[2:59:37.560 --> 2:59:42.560]  and a lot of fellow activists actually all pitch in and keep this group running
[2:59:42.560 --> 2:59:46.560]  we've been able to reach out to a thousand people already we're always
[2:59:46.560 --> 2:59:48.560]  mean with people on the street.
[2:59:48.560 --> 2:59:52.560]  Exactly and you're not just armchair quarterbacks and you're not just sitting on a forum on the internet
[2:59:52.560 --> 2:59:56.560]  you're actually organizing probably through the internet and you know through phone calls
[2:59:56.560 --> 3:00:00.560]  but then you're actually grouping up you're taking movies that are on the internet
[3:00:00.560 --> 3:00:03.560]  you're burning them to DVD you know again a lot of people don't understand
[3:00:03.560 --> 3:00:07.560]  yeah we do fund this operation in part by our film but we give them away for free
[3:00:07.560 --> 3:00:11.560]  not only on the net but we say hey if you're making copies to make other people aware
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:15.560]  we want you to do that we want you to hold screenings in libraries in churches
[3:00:15.560 --> 3:00:20.560]  in other places where you can hold events so that people can get this information
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:23.560]  so that you can turn that light on and at least get them thinking
[3:00:23.560 --> 3:00:28.560]  you know outside of the box outside of this you know paradigm of Obama or McCain
[3:00:28.560 --> 3:00:32.560]  Obama or McCain we were never even given a choice they pushed Obama on us since
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:37.560]  really you know I mean they started in 2004 and they made their decision in the
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:40.560]  primaries that he was going to be the one instead of Hillary Clinton and you know
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:44.560]  his whole team talks about how they expected to be president since May
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:49.560]  so you know this is obviously a front for a larger organization who did you vote for actually
[3:00:49.560 --> 3:00:54.560]  I voted for Chuck Baldwin I mean I want to vote for McKinney I know you're big on McKinney
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:59.560]  so am I not McKinney's a hero to me but you know the Ron Paul backing
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:03.560]  that doesn't hurt does it and you know what I was saying on the show yesterday
[3:01:03.560 --> 3:01:07.560]  I was saying you know it would have been great to see a Ron Paul McKinney ticket
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:12.560]  you know Ron Paul at the head or even vice versa either way I think that they could really
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:16.560]  learn from each other and work well together it's just like Dennis Kasinich
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:20.560]  jumping on a ticket like that really Kasinich has become some somewhat of a
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:26.560]  superhero in the House of Representatives. A Ron Paul McKinney ticket would have been
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:31.560]  like Superman and Batman and then and I think that Kasinich's thing of the Federal
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:36.560]  Reserve is the Federal Federal Express I mean I mean a lot of people are stepping up
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:40.560]  and that is stepping up but again the mainstream media does not even cover
[3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:43.560]  Mr. Kasinich's comments and unfortunately the only time that you can actually see
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:48.560]  those comments is if you catch him live on C-SPAN you know and that's
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:52.560]  what you do well yeah YouTube but I I mean on the television you know and
[3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:57.560]  that's why we need people out there to get that to us you know I need people to
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:03.560]  record that on Tivo transfer to DVD send it to what is it sweet 100 3000
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:07.560]  South Lamar everybody knows the address send it to us we need these tapes
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:10.560]  we're gonna be back after this with Matthew Medina it's the Alex Jones show
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:13.560]  we are chained San Antonio
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:28.560]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to
[3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:31.560]  be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:34.560]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to scan in a
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:38.560]  bread line you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Super
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:42.560]  Joe and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:46.560]  prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:49.560]  special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:54.560]  telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:58.560]  thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:02.560]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:06.560]  blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many Americans
[3:03:06.560 --> 3:03:10.560]  in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:15.560]  two days until it reached over 4 billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:19.560]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:22.560]  with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock
[3:03:22.560 --> 3:03:26.560]  their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:30.560]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is

[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:52.560]  hours of the show is that Alex Jones is really giving away a piece of history on
[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:56.560]  eBay and it's going to be used to help fund the info or much like the money bomb
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:05:01.560]  has I mean just what you're seeing in the new office you know the television
[3:05:01.560 --> 3:05:06.560]  it's getting a little slicker you know our guests look better I mean that this
[3:05:06.560 --> 3:05:10.560]  studio is just I'm loving it I mean it's awesome it's a dream come true to be
[3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:14.560]  able to sub in for Alex Jones and such a quality studio I mean when I used to go
[3:05:14.560 --> 3:05:18.560]  down to KLBJ in fact I was down there yesterday I was like wow this is a
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:22.560]  really nice studio well guess what Alex Jones' new studio blows KLBJ out of
[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:27.560]  the water and I love it it's awesome so how do we help fund this thing well he
[3:05:27.560 --> 3:05:33.560]  is auctioning off tyranny crusher one that's tyranny crusher one and it is the
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:38.560]  infamous bullhorn that he used in scanner darkly he's used to confront the
[3:05:38.560 --> 3:05:43.560]  builder group and many other you know puppets of the elite and the elite of
[3:05:43.560 --> 3:05:48.560]  themselves so I hope you go to eBay it's up to quite a bit right now serious
[3:05:48.560 --> 3:05:52.560]  bitters only but you know whatever this goes for he is there is tyranny
[3:05:52.560 --> 3:05:56.560]  crusher one oh man that's that's so awesome I tried to scam it last summer
[3:05:56.560 --> 3:06:01.560]  when he was here and it wasn't working I'm like I'll take it but seriously it
[3:06:01.560 --> 3:06:05.560]  would be great just to put that in a in a big plaque you know put it in a piece
[3:06:05.560 --> 3:06:10.560]  of glass next to maybe a picture of Alex or a cover of one of his movies it
[3:06:10.560 --> 3:06:14.560]  really makes a nice centerpiece for your den or your hockey room or trophy
[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:18.560]  collection or whatever I mean this is a real piece of history and after we win
[3:06:18.560 --> 3:06:22.560]  I really think that you know this this might end up in a museum someday so
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:26.560]  you know laughing me if you will but Alex Jones is really on the forefront of
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:31.560]  this and he's really an inspiration for me and really got me involved at the
[3:06:31.560 --> 3:06:35.560]  level that I'm involved now all right we have Matthew Medina of we are
[3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:39.560]  change San Antonio on the line and why don't you tell people Matthew some of
[3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:43.560]  the some of the actions that you're going to take in the future what you have
[3:06:43.560 --> 3:06:48.560]  planned and then how you can join the organization okay this last Saturday
[3:06:48.560 --> 3:06:53.560]  actually we had a 9-11 truth booth in Houston Texas at a really big b-boy jam
[3:06:53.560 --> 3:06:58.560]  that's a breakdance jam or contest if you will and it was put together by a
[3:06:58.560 --> 3:07:03.560]  vicious germs crew there's a group of b-boys and they support 9-11 truth and
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:07.560]  getting information on it they allowed us to have a booth there we got out over a
[3:07:07.560 --> 3:07:15.560]  DVD flyers and as far as future actions on January 24th in Austin Texas and if
[3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:19.560]  you're still around Burma's we like for you and anybody from that forward crew to
[3:07:19.560 --> 3:07:23.560]  come join us on the streets of 6th Street downtown Austin and that's a place
[3:07:23.560 --> 3:07:27.560]  to go because 6th Street is a you know it is it's not only legendary but you go
[3:07:27.560 --> 3:07:31.560]  down there on a weeknight and it's packed house a weekend we're talking
[3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:35.560]  extremely packed house unfortunately I do leave on the 17th but I think it's very
[3:07:35.560 --> 3:07:38.560]  important that we're reaching out to the youth I think a b-boy jam is somewhere
[3:07:38.560 --> 3:07:42.560]  where you normally wouldn't see 9-11 truth and we're bringing it there you
[3:07:42.560 --> 3:07:46.560]  know I'm pleased to say that it has leaked into some pop culture that I
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:50.560]  appreciate you know a head PE comes out with an album tomorrow I believe called
[3:07:50.560 --> 3:07:54.560]  called New World Orphans and you know that reaches out to the punk rock crowd
[3:07:54.560 --> 3:07:58.560]  you know that's a that's a crowd that I can relate to so so many people are
[3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:02.560]  working so hard to get this patriot movement message out there and when
[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:05.560]  you're going to a concert or a b-boy thing you're not expecting this but
[3:08:05.560 --> 3:08:09.560]  you're more prone to take a look at it you know what I'm saying yeah and and
[3:08:09.560 --> 3:08:14.560]  the reason we chose January 24th on that tip Jason is chaos one will be
[3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:20.560]  performing in Austin at 8 p.m. Saturday and as you know in a lot of 9-11 truth
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:23.560]  or so he's actually come out for 9-11 truth and he's always been a big
[3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:28.560]  supporter of free thinking information flowing ever since the 80s
[3:08:28.560 --> 3:08:33.560]  well you know I'm not only from the 80s but he did a track back in the 90s
[3:08:33.560 --> 3:08:38.560]  with Zach De La Roca of Rage Against the Machine yeah yeah yeah called CIA or
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:43.560]  Criminals Action and it's you clean my cell track but you be doing it
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:48.560]  yeah yeah exactly yeah it's a jam it's something carrot one is an icon to me
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:53.560]  and hopefully we can meet him yeah and you know he gave a pretty good
[3:08:53.560 --> 3:08:58.560]  interview out in New York City on the weekend of 9-11 truth that we are
[3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:02.560]  change New York put together with Luke Radowski another you know just great
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:05.560]  great activist and that that's another thing you know you're not waiting from
[3:09:05.560 --> 3:09:09.560]  orders from Luke Radowski or the New York chapter of we are change and
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:12.560]  neither is that you know we are change chapter in Colorado or the we are
[3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:16.560]  change chapters in California everybody's doing their own thing it's very
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:20.560]  decentralized and what it does is it reaches out to people on the street
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:23.560]  people that normally wouldn't even be political and that's why this is very
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:28.560]  encouraging to me Matthew hey and we also put together I organized the
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:33.560]  San Antonio in the Fed event sorry we put that together we worked with a
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:37.560]  lot of local activists we work with Campaign for Liberty Austin Campaign
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:42.560]  for Liberty John Birch Society the local Lieber magazine we are change Austin
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:46.560]  and all this working together with a common goal we put together a fantastic
[3:09:46.560 --> 3:09:50.560]  event local news showed up we got it in the newspaper it was really a big
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:54.560]  first-time thing for the San Antonio truth movement exactly and you just
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  realizing that you can have an effect and then having the will to actually do
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:01.560]  something to create that effect in other words there has to be a cause for the
[3:10:01.560 --> 3:10:03.560]  effect you have to go out and do something you can't just really think
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:07.560]  real hard and all of a sudden 9-11 truth is gonna is gonna come out worldwide
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:11.560]  now you have to take to the streets you know and movements that have been
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:14.560]  successful like you know the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King
[3:10:14.560 --> 3:10:17.560]  Jr. one of the key aspects of that and of course this was long before the
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:22.560]  internet but it was people out in the streets and unfortunately I have not
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:27.560]  seen that many people in the streets other than for anti-war protests which
[3:10:27.560 --> 3:10:32.560]  really just don't get to the heart of the issue here we are in a war on terror
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:36.560]  that is endless we are now seven plus years into that war on terror we've
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:42.560]  been in Iraq for almost six years now no end in sight there so obviously
[3:10:42.560 --> 3:10:46.560]  there's something wrong with the approach that we're taking saying and the war
[3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:49.560]  and the war why should we end the war well because it's been based on false
[3:10:49.560 --> 3:10:54.560]  pretenses and on a false flag terror event so in order to end the war I think
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:59.560]  it's imperative that we expose that fact and then hold real trials and hold
[3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:03.560]  people accountable for their roles in 9-11 not only people but organizations
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:07.560]  in general you know it has to be exposed that the Israeli Mossad had a hand in
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:11.560]  9-11 it has to be exposed that the Pakistani ISI had a role in 9-11 it has
[3:11:11.560 --> 3:11:16.560]  to be exposed that insiders in this country had a role in 9-11 and they have
[3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:19.560]  to be brought to trial and I think that's the only way that you're going to
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:23.560]  see this change in society and you know again it really wasn't brought up that
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:27.560]  much but there was an initiative on you know the change website you know the
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.560]  official Barack Obama website and people were able to put their number one
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:37.560]  ideas set forth and the number one idea for like two or three days was set up
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:41.560]  in an independent investigation into 9-11 reinvestigate it and it was just
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:45.560]  completely pulled anything 9-11 related was completely pulled at first they
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:49.560]  tried to they figured oh it's early on we'll just change the page instead of the
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:52.560]  front page saying 9-11 truth will make him go to another page and we'll just put
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:56.560]  on the new ideas but then it was still dominating all the other popular ideas
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:00.560]  so what do they do they just don't even they don't even acknowledge it exists
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:04.560]  they just erase it
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:08.560]  I mean I mean how do we get past that I mean obviously we got to keep pushing
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:11.560]  forward but I think that it's important that we expose that to people that you
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:15.560]  know this Obama campaign wants nothing to do with 9-11 truth that the internet
[3:12:15.560 --> 3:12:19.560]  is being censored that Google video will pull your video they will freeze your
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  comments they will freeze your hit count you two will do the same thing so I
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:26.560]  think that we have to make people aware of this subject and then circumvent them
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:30.560]  by taking a personal approach much like the one you're doing
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:34.560]  yeah and you would be surprised Jason there's something called First Friday
[3:12:34.560 --> 3:12:38.560]  here in San Antonio every first Friday of the month and it's kind of like a an
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:42.560]  art scene that shows up there's art galleries and you know you got your
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:46.560]  trendsters you got your older folks it's really a mixed crowd of people and we're
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:50.560]  always out there and we get a lot of the responses like oh yeah we already know
[3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:54.560]  about that and they keep walking but we're like well there's more to it than that
[3:12:54.560 --> 3:12:58.560]  like everything you just mentioned all the way to the Obama presidency and that's
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:03.560]  what we're also trying to break ground on we've actually a lot of the events
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:07.560]  we won't just hand on 9-11 info before the election we're handing out flyers
[3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:11.560]  to compare McCain and Obama we've had our flyers on the Federal Reserve this
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:14.560]  past First Friday we're out there handing out info about Codex
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:19.560]  elementarius and GMO food so really I mean we have to hit all the all the
[3:13:19.560 --> 3:13:23.560]  fronts in the info war yeah you're running the gamut you know and that's a
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:26.560]  that's an important thing to do you know America the freedom to fascism is one of
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:30.560]  the most effective tools out there and it still has not been watched by the
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:34.560]  majority of Americans so that's a great video to hand out yeah we kind of under
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:38.560]  the copy of the Washington you're fired another great flick as well yeah you know
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.560]  we carry that over info wars dot com and Washington you're fired is a great
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:46.560]  great flick it really you know when we had William Lewis on there he said you know
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:50.560]  we really took the conspiracy out and just went with all these things that were
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:54.560]  just publicly in your face and some of the people are telling me oh we think
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:57.560]  that Obama's executive orders are going to be to exonerate the Bush
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:01.560]  administration well I think the Bush administration exonerated themselves
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:04.560]  with the military commissions act when they said that nobody in the
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:09.560]  administration could be prosecuted on any war crimes from September 11 2001 on
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:13.560]  so I don't think that that Obama even needs to do that
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:17.560]  you know I I think that what we're going to see is a massive
[3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:22.560]  re-regulation of the economy you know whether that be an Amaro or some other
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:26.560]  type of system I think we're going to see banks go under and you know
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.560]  Tarpley has really talked about the new new deal and in my town you know the
[3:14:31.560 --> 3:14:35.560]  little high school town I grew up in you could see the works progress
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:38.560]  administration signs and people who don't know with work progress
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.560]  administration it's what Roosevelt set up to give state jobs and federal jobs
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:47.560]  to people that had nothing and they built some infrastructure and I mean that
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:51.560]  infrastructure lasted a long time I mean my sidewalks still have that so I think
[3:14:51.560 --> 3:14:55.560]  that you're going to see those type of programs brought back where people will
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.560]  be you know working on roads and railways because they'll be nothing else
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:04.560]  or building all buildings all road like we told you it'll probably be
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:07.560]  you're right you're it'll probably be more infrastructure for the securities
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:12.560]  and prosperity's partnership which and sent a fox said isn't going as fast as
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  he would like that's actually another front on the info war we need to get out
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:22.560]  on the streets and a lot of people see it here in Texas but we want to show them
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:27.560]  how they can take action and we can have a local victory in this fight
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:30.560]  what's the website
[3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:36.560]  here this Matthew what what's the way people go to our meetup is on the

[3:21:00.560 --> 3:21:05.560]  I don't know any whiskey drinking Indians but then again I don't know many Indians
[3:21:05.560 --> 3:21:10.560]  at all because we wipe most of them out and that's why we had Russell Means on
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:14.560]  last week from Lakota tribe pretty interesting how they're trying to set up
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:18.560]  their own bank where they only accept silver and gold as currency that's
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:23.560]  genius to me I mean with this economy you know hard assets seem to be the only
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:26.560]  thing that we're going to have and like I said I don't know how they're going to
[3:21:26.560 --> 3:21:30.560]  restructure it I do know that that's going to retain value and that fiat
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:34.560]  currency is eventually going to fall and you know Matthew Medina of we are
[3:21:34.560 --> 3:21:38.560]  changed San Antonio that that's one of the big issues and that's why you did
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:44.560]  the end the Fed rally correct I mean there's so many ways to get involved
[3:21:44.560 --> 3:21:48.560]  and this is such a multifaceted issue I find you know again you're going to a
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:53.560]  b-boy concert so you go there with five or ten members of we are changed I think
[3:21:53.560 --> 3:21:56.560]  that those people need to relate to you know people that they think that they
[3:21:56.560 --> 3:22:00.560]  can you know talk to someone they start a conversation up with on something
[3:22:00.560 --> 3:22:04.560]  totally and completely unrelated and then work your way into nine eleven truth
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:08.560]  or work your way into the truth about the Federal Reserve or work your way into
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:13.560]  the truth about the bailout which is easy to do because it actually does affect
[3:22:13.560 --> 3:22:18.560]  our everyday life absolutely let's take some calls on hopefully we still have
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:25.560]  Rudger in Idaho Rudger what's on your mind hello how are you sir hi there is
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:30.560]  this Albert Schweitzer I presume no it's Jason that's right I've been
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:35.560]  surprised my telephone number is not blocked I'm blocked from making both
[3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:47.560]  on info wars dot com I myself voted for Jesus Christ I wrote that and I think
[3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:54.560]  I'm going to go where white men fear to tread here we have Michael Collins
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:23:00.560]  Piper on to discuss the JFK assassination author of the book final judgment
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:05.560]  when oh what are we gonna have I don't know why I don't book the gas but you
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:09.560]  seem pretty adversarial let's uh... let's cut them off I mean first of all he
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:12.560]  started out with the uh... on you started out with the comment that we
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:16.560]  don't let you post on info wars that's correct and uh... that's just not
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:20.560]  hold on the only reason that you wouldn't be able to post for info wars is if
[3:23:20.560 --> 3:23:24.560]  you were putting racist comments continuously and they had to block your
[3:23:24.560 --> 3:23:28.560]  IP or if you were you know threatening people with violence and they had to
[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:32.560]  block your IP it's an open forum no one screens your phone call here they asked
[3:23:32.560 --> 3:23:35.560]  you what your name is and where you're from I know John Harmon I know how it
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:39.560]  works here I know jaren they don't go okay we want to talk about all you can
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:42.560]  talk about that you talk about anything you want on here I've met Michael
[3:23:42.560 --> 3:23:46.560]  Collins Piper on several occasions uh... I've spoken at events with him
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:51.560]  we had a we actually had a pretty good conversation after I previewed
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:23:55.560]  this was before long before fabled enemies was even you know anything other
[3:23:55.560 --> 3:23:59.560]  than an idea of mine but about probably eight twelve months before I put it
[3:23:59.560 --> 3:24:04.560]  out I had basically done a lecture on uh... the international spiring the
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:07.560]  pakistanis the israeli connection nine eleven and we had a long talk after
[3:24:07.560 --> 3:24:11.560]  that he apologized for the way that you know uh... american free press
[3:24:11.560 --> 3:24:15.560]  had slandered you know myself and others in the nine eleven truth movement is
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:19.560]  some kind of operatives you know that's why it gets so ridiculous man I have to

[3:24:23.560 --> 3:24:27.560]  bermus is a shape-shifting person jason bermus is under vatican control and
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:32.560]  that really just diverts attention away from real real solutions and you know

[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:39.560]  yeah and we see a lot of a lot of this going on in the movement people

[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:45.560]  provocative hearing and they they turn their behavior and act innocent like

[3:24:49.560 --> 3:24:53.560]  that he made a video about and it's a little bit when people show their
[3:24:53.560 --> 3:24:57.560]  fruit and reveal himself to be in this kind of
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:01.560]  behavior we just need to stay away from them keep on the positive and you know

[3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:44.560]  but you wouldn't understand that because you know you've been fed with all these
[3:30:44.560 --> 3:30:48.560]  crazy ideas that anybody outside of the white
[3:30:48.560 --> 3:30:52.560]  little american lifestyle or race is out to get you and is inferior
[3:30:52.560 --> 3:30:56.560]  for some reason i never get the racist man
[3:30:56.560 --> 3:31:00.560]  i feel like martin luther king jr was correct you
[3:31:00.560 --> 3:31:04.560]  judge a person not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
[3:31:04.560 --> 3:31:08.560]  imagine that the content of their character you judge somebody
[3:31:08.560 --> 3:31:12.560]  based on what they do in life how they treat people wow
[3:31:12.560 --> 3:31:16.560]  not what they look like really we're gonna get past that whole superficial i know
[3:31:16.560 --> 3:31:20.560]  they might be wearing some cool hipster clothes or a nice shiny uniform that you're
[3:31:20.560 --> 3:31:24.560]  supposed to you know bow down and obey to but uh...
[3:31:24.560 --> 3:31:28.560]  i don't think it should really matter what color they are you know maybe that's a lie that people fell for
[3:31:28.560 --> 3:31:32.560]  back in the thirties when uh... the nazis came to
[3:31:32.560 --> 3:31:36.560]  power and it was kill everybody you know because they killed white people too just like the
[3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:40.560]  communist you know they killed a bunch of gypsies uh... homosexuals
[3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:44.560]  they killed uh... people that they they felt were
[3:31:44.560 --> 3:31:48.560]  not up to par in other words uh... you know the mentally ill
[3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:52.560]  people with down syndrome they they killed white people too you know
[3:31:52.560 --> 3:31:56.560]  basically when they start killing people in mass like that it's not just killing other races
[3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:00.560]  they get you to hate those races and then you die too because it's a really all about
[3:32:00.560 --> 3:32:04.560]  them killing everybody but themselves but again you don't get that because
[3:32:04.560 --> 3:32:08.560]  you're a racist moron but that's live radio and you know
[3:32:08.560 --> 3:32:12.560]  alex isn't here so i'm sure you can call in right now and savagely attack me if you'd like
[3:32:12.560 --> 3:32:18.560]  alright let's uh... let's go to frank in boston frank what's on your mind
[3:32:18.560 --> 3:32:22.560]  yes uh... thank you jason how are you good man how you doing
[3:32:22.560 --> 3:32:26.560]  pretty good well first of all i'm i'm a pride uh... prideful
[3:32:26.560 --> 3:32:30.560]  truther and i i don't know any other way that i can't prove that to you
[3:32:30.560 --> 3:32:34.560]  i've been accused of being a provocateur i'll be honest with you and i hate that
[3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:38.560]  i'm a graduate university of Notre Dame i discovered the truth movement through
[3:32:38.560 --> 3:32:42.560]  Eric Humpschmidt of videos and also then
[3:32:42.560 --> 3:32:46.560]  got turned on to the whole building seven-thing and then found alex jones and
[3:32:46.560 --> 3:32:50.560]  then the rest is history so for three or four years i've been involved in the movement
[3:32:50.560 --> 3:32:54.560]  um... you know i i'm in rhodiola and so i'm aware of our we are changed chapter
[3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:58.560]  in rhodiola and i've talked to luke several times whatever blah blah blah i am not
[3:32:58.560 --> 3:33:02.560]  a uh... provocateur but i do have very critical
[3:33:02.560 --> 3:33:06.560]  opinions about where this movement has come from and where it
[3:33:06.560 --> 3:33:10.560]  has gone and where it seems to be not going
[3:33:10.560 --> 3:33:14.560]  at this point and you asked a question earlier and i can't
[3:33:14.560 --> 3:33:18.560]  remember every word specifically said but your question was how do we get past this
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:22.560]  i think you were referencing the idea that we can educate
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:26.560]  as many people as we can but how do we get that message
[3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:30.560]  into a place of motivation and how do we get it so that people are mobilized in the streets
[3:33:30.560 --> 3:33:34.560]  so that we have numbers in the street okay continue
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:38.560]  that is a very good question and i do think it goes to the point
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:42.560]  of where my critique is we can't
[3:33:42.560 --> 3:33:46.560]  i hate to even use the term mainstream media because
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:50.560]  i don't really i think it turns it too much into this big monster that
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:54.560]  is unidentifiable and unrecognizable
[3:33:54.560 --> 3:33:58.560]  it's not the case i mean the mainstream media is made up of specific institutions
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:02.560]  and it's made up of specific people and specific roles
[3:34:02.560 --> 3:34:06.560]  and i think that to just kind of throw our hands up in the air
[3:34:06.560 --> 3:34:10.560]  and again i'm not saying this is what everybody's doing but to come to some
[3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:14.560]  convenient cop out that oh you know the way for this movement
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:18.560]  forward is really just this organic process of
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:22.560]  one by one everyone waking up you know i understand the value of that
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:26.560]  hey that's how i got on board but like that's how i got on board
[3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:30.560]  it just happened i looked at someone's website and they showed building seven going
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:34.560]  down and then i did a little more research blah blah blah so i came on board
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:38.560]  through that uh through that organic process but
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:42.560]  why are we restricted by that i mean every everything that happens
[3:34:42.560 --> 3:34:46.560]  in in in our culture whether we like it or not
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:50.560]  operates through some some pre-existing paradigm
[3:34:50.560 --> 3:34:54.560]  which we can either deal with or or or we can make
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:34:58.560]  believe it's not there and so what i'm just wondering what paradigm you think
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:02.560]  that we can reach the most people because you know like i was telling uh
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:06.560]  me and robber having a discussion the other day of you know the power and influence of
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:10.560]  tv and how tv has really been their tool to dumb us down but i said well you know
[3:35:10.560 --> 3:35:14.560]  that's just it is just another tool just like a hammer you know i can use a hammer to go
[3:35:14.560 --> 3:35:18.560]  and fix my house uh you know build a shed or i can go and use it to bash
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:22.560]  my neighbor's head in you know that's a tool that's a great that's a great
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.560]  uh that's a great symbolism there but what i would say is look i don't think the
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:30.560]  paradigm or the way to address the paradigm is wrapped up in apps and
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:34.560]  and and having to articulate every nuance of it of it okay
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:38.560]  here's the reality is that when you claim that 3 000 people were murdered
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:42.560]  on 9 11 which i buy into that i buy into that and they were
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:46.560]  murdered by not the 19 terrorist by but it by
[3:35:46.560 --> 3:35:50.560]  elements that are unseen within our government or whatever corporate structure
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:54.560]  domestically i believe that there is a conspiracy there when you believe
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:58.560]  that you either act like that that you believe that or you don't act
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:02.560]  like you believe that and i would say the one thing that the average american is
[3:36:02.560 --> 3:36:06.560]  smart enough to know is whether someone's being consistent with what they say
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:10.560]  and what they do and in this movement right now with all due respect
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:14.560]  to all of my fellow truthers i do not believe and i'll and i'll
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:18.560]  plead guilty to this as well see that we act the way
[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:22.560]  that we believe if we really believe what we say are we
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:26.560]  acting consistently with that and i'm not pointing fingers
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:30.560]  but i do not think we are
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:34.560]  and you might say to me what should we do then
[3:36:34.560 --> 3:36:38.560]  i think that people have to get over themselves you know you know we just had matthew on
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:42.560]  and you know here's a guy that's taking action not everybody's matthew you know what i mean
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:46.560]  not everybody's out in the streets i mean he he acknowledged the fact that we're not going to reach everybody on the internet
[3:36:46.560 --> 3:36:50.560]  and that's why he went to a b-boy dance off you know what i mean
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:54.560]  i mentioned uh... you know that punk rock band had p i mean they're putting out albums trying to
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:58.560]  reach the youth that are just there usually to you know mosh and have a good time they're not
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:02.560]  really into the politics so people are slipping it into the other aspects of life but i don't
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:06.560]  think enough people are doing that
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:10.560]  i mean if you think that you have a solution we're all yours here
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:14.560]  okay i think it makes a lot of sense to cater your invitation to awakening to the people you're talking to
[3:37:14.560 --> 3:37:18.560]  i agree with that but i think that this is underlying current in this movement
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:22.560]  and again i'm not i'm not a provocateur calling for
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:26.560]  for violence against people or anything like that but there is this
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:30.560]  undercurrent of passivity or pacifist nature to this movement
[3:37:30.560 --> 3:37:34.560]  which if someone could it could make a cohesive argument how that
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:38.560]  actually serves the justice in in the
[3:37:38.560 --> 3:37:42.560]  accounting for what we believe has been done i'm all ears
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:46.560]  but jesus again i'm not i don't want to turn this into religion
[3:37:46.560 --> 3:37:50.560]  i'm saying jesus is a person he he ended up being
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:54.560]  murdered by the system that he spoke pass passively
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:58.560]  about okay we either are going to be modders or we're going to go out there and we're going to
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:02.560]  actually how can i put this i'm how can i put this jason
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:06.560]  what i'm saying is this this movement has to be open to leadership i was going to open
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:10.560]  with you and say are you a anarchist i was going to ask you that not because i'm
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:14.560]  accusing you of it but to get a sense of perspective on what you think about
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:18.560]  human beings organizing themselves into some meaningful
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:22.560]  front i mean i because i am not like the anarchist movement to me
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:26.560]  is is a way to try to take you know
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:30.560]  people that you know are disinterested with the system they've given up on the establishment
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:34.560]  and then it doesn't really give them anywhere to go other than to try to be quote-unquote
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:38.560]  anti-establishment i thank for the call frank i mean i don't have
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:42.560]  all the answers i will say this though i don't think that you know you
[3:38:42.560 --> 3:38:46.560]  talked about either we're going to be martyrs or you're not sure and
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:50.560]  yeah i mean unfortunately i do think that's it i don't think that we can win an armed
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:54.560]  battle i'm pro second amendment but you do there's no way we're going to go out in the streets these guys
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:39:00.560]  have sound weapons they've got tasers that are shot wirelessly 30 feet from a shotgun
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:04.560]  you know i mean they can hit you with a satellite at the drones they use
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:08.560]  you know what i just watched eagle eye a couple weeks ago it really speaks to the big brother
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:12.560]  in state uh... you know it's probably an extension of uh... enemy of the uh... state
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:16.560]  that was out in the nineties and i i talk in films because that's what the
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:20.560]  general populace can relate to all i saw the movie in the theater over getting
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:24.560]  on dvd but that technology is there so i don't know how
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:28.560]  you know maybe in rural areas that but even rural areas if they send in troops
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:32.560]  you know you've got a shotgun they've gotten automatic rifle
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:36.560]  you've got no armor they're wearing dragon skin so i i don't know how any kind of an
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:40.560]  armed revolution is going to help this movement in any way shape or form
[3:39:40.560 --> 3:39:44.560]  other than to demonize as much like they demonize the militia movement
[3:39:44.560 --> 3:39:48.560]  of you know that the early eighties into the early nineties when they blame
[3:39:48.560 --> 3:39:52.560]  timothy mcvay for oklahoma city it's very easy to sway
[3:39:52.560 --> 3:39:56.560]  the public opinion of the sheeple out there when they have a tool like television
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:00.560]  and you know they they control ninety five percent of that
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:04.560]  television it's very hard to combat that i mean it it's not impossible that's why i'm here
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:08.560]  that's why you're here and we do have to figure ways out around i don't think
[3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:12.560]  you're a provocateur i think that you're just you know strongly believe
[3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:16.560]  that we do need to change and try to reach more people alright let's go to
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:20.560]  ronnie in los angeles and then we're going to go to scott in pennsylvania the first time
[3:40:20.560 --> 3:40:24.560]  caller ronnie what's on your mind hey what's going on jason uh... first off i want to
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:28.560]  thank you for your uh... for your work uh... and all and and everyone
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:32.560]  out there you know actually doing something
[3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:36.560]  uh... i'm calling uh... mainly about uh... the israel uh...
[3:40:36.560 --> 3:40:40.560]  palestine conflict sure uh... there's this uh... one
[3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:44.560]  scholar he's he's the most prominent uh... scholar i've seen
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:48.560]  so far uh... that's that's you know well over informed about
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:52.560]  the situation and uh... his name is uh... norman finkelstein
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:56.560]  okay you heard of him uh... um... i was wondering
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:41:00.560]  if i could suggest that you guys get him on the show he's he's uh...
[3:41:00.560 --> 3:41:04.560]  he's written books uh... like the holocaust industry
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:08.560]  uh... israel palestine conflict uh... and he's been banned from israel
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:12.560]  uh... you know through through pressure from apac and uh...
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:16.560]  and uh... and other other powerful uh... jewish entities he's actually jewish and
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:20.560]  he's uh... he's the son of uh... two uh... holocaust survivors
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:24.560]  and you know i'm palestinian and uh... you know i'm a muslim
[3:41:24.560 --> 3:41:28.560]  and and you know i don't buy into this whole you know it's it's all about
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:32.560]  religion it's not about about religion you know there's wrong and right
[3:41:32.560 --> 3:41:36.560]  and there's legal and illegal
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:40.560]  if you just look at uh... you know ron paul and i think for the call on the uh... house floor
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:44.560]  describing how you know israel israelis are the ones that created
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:48.560]  hamas in the first place created their enemy radicalized their enemy so that
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:52.560]  they could continue to fight them expand other presence in gaza you know
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:56.560]  when uh... synthia mckinney goes there last week on a piece mission
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:00.560]  to try to give aid to the palestinians her boat is rammed by
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:04.560]  israeli ship so yeah there's a lot going on there outside of
[3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:08.560]  religion this isn't really about religion is the cover religion is the front
[3:42:08.560 --> 3:42:12.560]  you know we all know what the elites religion is it's paganism it's occultism
[3:42:12.560 --> 3:42:16.560]  it's luciferianism it's different sex of that yeah yeah your christian
[3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:20.560]  conservative leaders like to meet in the woods and do mock human sacrifices
[3:42:20.560 --> 3:42:24.560]  to a big owl god
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:28.560]  most you know that if you're listening if you don't know it challenge me on it
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:32.560]  hey i mean you can watch the ritual on google it's the real deal you can see the pictures from their own
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:36.560]  internal annals you can find out that it is the elite that the bush family
[3:42:36.560 --> 3:42:40.560]  has been involved for years uh... you know that the first families been there
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:44.560]  that Kissinger is there oh did by the way they uh... hatched the Manhattan
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:48.560]  project you know that uh... nuclear program at the bohemian growth
[3:42:48.560 --> 3:42:52.560]  oppenheimer all those guys the bohemian club and they discussed it and they're like yeah you know
[3:42:52.560 --> 3:42:56.560]  let's build a nuclear technology and it wasn't in some kind of a uh...
[3:42:56.560 --> 3:43:00.560]  public forum you know it was at the bohemian growth these
[3:43:00.560 --> 3:43:04.560]  secret societies it's really you know the first step in intelligence
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:08.560]  organizations that's what they are all right let's go to our first
[3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:12.560]  time caller scott in pennsylvania scott what's on your mind
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:16.560]  i just in the great job i think i had
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:20.560]  a four quick point that i just wanted to talk about one was
[3:43:20.560 --> 3:43:24.560]  does anybody thought that pal's talking about live like it did about
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:28.560]  wmd's uh... the second point is this past
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:32.560]  sunday there was a bill passed by the senate to give
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:36.560]  two million acres to the agenda twenty one program and uh...
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:40.560]  the third point is everybody should sign up for a campaign for liberty
[3:43:40.560 --> 3:43:44.560]  dot com if they want to have some change in their
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:48.560]  local politics and the fourth
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:52.560]  item was the local to bank isn't endorsed by
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:56.560]  russel means that i've heard a couple people talk about it on your show
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:00.560]  but um... as far as i know it it has been endorsed by him
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:04.560]  so we'll all get on the agenda go over the agenda twenty one thing for me
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:08.560]  because i'm not quite sure what that means i'm not familiar with it
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:12.560]  one is a program by the u n two
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:16.560]  steel land and to make it is how they got all the national
[3:44:16.560 --> 3:44:20.560]  parks right right back in the early nineties this is covered in uh... alex
[3:44:20.560 --> 3:44:24.560]  jones is america destroyed by design but continue right um...
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:28.560]  this past sunday they had a special session in the senate
[3:44:28.560 --> 3:44:32.560]  to give over two million acres in california
[3:44:32.560 --> 3:44:36.560]  and a few other states to uh... while they say it's to
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.560]  america but it's actually going to be seated to the united nations
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:44.560]  well if you listen i i'd really appreciate it if you uh... email that information
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:48.560]  to erin info wars dot com that is a story that we need to do i thank you for the call
[3:44:48.560 --> 3:44:52.560]  we gotta move on uh... i mean folks it's been going on for years and years
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:56.560]  and years and more land they give up the more suspect it becomes i mean are they going to put in nato troops
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:45:00.560]  is this where they're going to make the makeshift fema camps uh... are they just going to restrict
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:04.560]  our movement even further i mean that's part of the plan is to restrict us into this
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:08.560]  grid where we all live in compact cities uh... you know it's in their own plans and
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:12.560]  uh... that's after they kill about eighty percent of us remember
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:16.560]  joe biden talking about overpopulation in his little uh... lovely article
[3:45:16.560 --> 3:45:20.560]  how i learned to love the new world order remember now wasn't slick enough we need
[3:45:20.560 --> 3:45:24.560]  to be a little slicker than now
[3:45:24.560 --> 3:45:28.560]  that's his quote we need to be a little bit slicker than now to pull off this whole
[3:45:28.560 --> 3:45:32.560]  globalist effort uh... you know we don't need to do it by the barrel of the gun let's brainwash
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:36.560]  the people and then soft kill them that's the essence of it
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:40.560]  alright let's go to steve in florida steve what's on your mind
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:44.560]  i was just uh... um...
[3:45:44.560 --> 3:45:48.560]  about trying to get the word out about the federal reserve i thought then it could
[3:45:48.560 --> 3:45:52.560]  finish on the floor blaming them for the mess that we're in
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:56.560]  and i was wondering if uh... alex you get a hold of them

[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:28.560]  um... you know it's tough and uh... we want to get this image on that because that federal as federal
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:32.560]  express uh... you know line is something we've been talking about on this program
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:36.560]  for years and years and years and to see it on the house floor um... you know
[3:46:36.560 --> 3:46:40.560]  is it not the house floor i'm sorry the uh... on the floor congress
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:44.560]  is amazing yeah i mean we i never even knew
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:48.560]  any about anything about this i mean my dad is a uh... he was a
[3:46:48.560 --> 3:46:52.560]  CEO of a big company on the east coast and he thought that the treasury made
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:56.560]  the money no absolutely not let me explain it yeah we got
[3:46:56.560 --> 3:47:00.560]  stuck in the mortgage crisis and once someone kind of told me that
[3:47:00.560 --> 3:47:04.560]  you know because i always thought that it was a government that raised the rate of 17 times
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:08.560]  well what happens is the federal reserve banking system has a board
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:12.560]  of uh... i want to believe i believe 13 members and they serve 8 year terms
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:16.560]  and you and i don't even vote on that the people that we vote for for office vote on that
[3:47:16.560 --> 3:47:20.560]  and then they're given cart blanche you know that's why they hired greenspan at that time
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:24.560]  because greenspan spoke out against them and they made join the league

[3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:28.560]  was working with Alex Jones I supported infowars.com I was a member and now

[3:51:40.560 --> 3:51:44.560]  I can't tell you how hard it is to do four hours of radio a day
[3:51:44.560 --> 3:51:48.560]  but somehow I managed to do it so without further ado let's go to
[3:51:48.560 --> 3:51:52.560]  William in Alabama William what's on your mind
[3:51:52.560 --> 3:51:56.560]  I need to check your mind as soon as you get off the air I sent you some information
[3:51:56.560 --> 3:52:00.560]  today about a sheriff that's here in Pickett County Alabama
[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:04.560]  who ended up in El Paso Texas this past weekend
[3:52:04.560 --> 3:52:08.560]  and stopped by the sheriff's department
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:12.560]  I can't think of a name I've got a news article right here in front of me
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:16.560]  but it was conflicting stories about why he was there the news is
[3:52:16.560 --> 3:52:20.560]  saying that he was there to scope out jails because they're
[3:52:20.560 --> 3:52:24.560]  making an expansion to the Pickett County Jail but
[3:52:24.560 --> 3:52:28.560]  everything that I found it don't make sense and what do you think it is
[3:52:28.560 --> 3:52:32.560]  I don't know
[3:52:32.560 --> 3:52:36.560]  and we'll take a look at it we'll see if there's anything suspicious I thank you for the call
[3:52:36.560 --> 3:52:40.560]  we thank you for the info let's jump to John in Ohio John what's on your mind
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:44.560]  yes I've asked people
[3:52:44.560 --> 3:52:48.560]  to check on the google just google up lies
[3:52:48.560 --> 3:52:52.560]  concerning the Soviet Union lies concerning the Soviet Union
[3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:56.560]  because I believe that one of the greatest cancers on this
[3:52:56.560 --> 3:53:00.560]  wonderful movement is accepting the global elites
[3:53:00.560 --> 3:53:04.560]  secular religion which is anti-communist propaganda the bigger the lie
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:08.560]  the more people have moved ahead in this society we know about Operation Mockingbird
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:12.560]  you can google that up as well where the CIA recruited all of the
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:16.560]  media to concoct false propaganda about communism
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:20.560]  the Soviet Union the rest of it I don't know where the truth begins and leaves off
[3:53:20.560 --> 3:53:24.560]  but I know we've been told a massive amount of lies and I think it is one of the greatest
[3:53:24.560 --> 3:53:28.560]  problems with some of the people on this
[3:53:28.560 --> 3:53:32.560]  network that we're going to in effect be opposing
[3:53:32.560 --> 3:53:36.560]  most of what the elite is doing but if we accept
[3:53:36.560 --> 3:53:40.560]  the Nazi propaganda and much of the stuff that we've come to believe
[3:53:40.560 --> 3:53:44.560]  that was imported by the CIA after the Second World War bringing
[3:53:44.560 --> 3:53:48.560]  thousands of Nazis much of the things we think we know about the Soviet
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:52.560]  Union was concocted by Joseph Goebbels if it was a
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:56.560]  referring to a project paperclip by the way when they shipped in a lot of the top
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:00.560]  Nazis to work in our not only our scientific facilities but
[3:54:00.560 --> 3:54:04.560]  our NASA really came out of there so a lot of programs were built out of
[3:54:04.560 --> 3:54:08.560]  Nazis and the Nazis really never lost they just relocated that is the truth
[3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:12.560]  I thank you for the call let's go to John in New York
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:16.560]  John what's on your mind?
[3:54:16.560 --> 3:54:20.560]  John in New York? Hey what's your name man? You mentioned global warming swindle yesterday
[3:54:20.560 --> 3:54:24.560]  Yes I did. Great movie I've got it
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:28.560]  and it goes from start to finish as far as what
[3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:32.560]  why global warming isn't happening
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:36.560]  Give us a 30 second synopsis before we go
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:40.560]  Well if you've got that you can go but
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:44.560]  it's called solar variations in clouds
[3:54:44.560 --> 3:54:48.560]  and that tells you how the weather
[3:54:48.560 --> 3:54:52.560]  is influenced by the sun and cosmic rays
[3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:56.560]  Great global warming swindle is a great great tool to wake people up
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:00.560]  to the propaganda that is global warming I thank you so much
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:04.560]  for joining me today it's the Alex Jones show I'll be with you tomorrow I'm Jason Bermas
