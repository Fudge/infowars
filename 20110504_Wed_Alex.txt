[01:04.280 --> 01:09.360]  to continue to break down the huge bombshells that he was dropping on us
[01:09.360 --> 01:16.160]  he is the co-author and advisor to most of the best-selling Tom Clancy books the
[01:16.160 --> 01:23.440]  producer at IMDB of films like net force and many other big huge Hollywood
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.360]  productions he worked under five presidents under three Secretary of

[01:41.600 --> 01:47.800]  chance of the Italian Prime Minister being released by the Communist I've
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.800]  been doing more research on him I mean he's more than what he was even saying
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.920]  here on the air and a very interesting individual obviously who told us nine
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.880]  years ago that bin Laden was on ice had died of renal failure I looked up people
[02:01.880 --> 02:05.560]  who have the type of renal failure and the disease that bin Laden has online and
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.080]  generally after you have it you don't live more than five years well he had
[02:09.080 --> 02:13.640]  this back in the mid-1990s reportedly we're to believe now all these years
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.720]  later 15 16 years later he survived renal failure complete renal failure and
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.280]  of course Dr. Pachennick is a board examiner psychiatrist which is a
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.800]  medical doctor he has another medical degree as well he of course was the
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.320]  director under several presidents of the development of psychological warfare
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.200]  operations and it's gonna be very informative to have him back on today
[02:41.200 --> 02:46.720]  to analyze I mean he said look at this staged event look at the stink of it and
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.080]  then he went over how it was staged and anybody who studies this can look at the
[02:51.080 --> 02:56.480]  rollout the packaging the scripting the disinfo and you know it's fake so when
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.400]  you're watching a sitcom you know it's acting you know it's not real so just at
[03:00.400 --> 03:03.760]  a gut level you know it's a fraud then you have a whole history of lies and
[03:03.760 --> 03:10.880]  dissembling and deception and spinning and you have all the political payoffs
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.600]  that are supposedly coming out of this the selling of torture wars secret
[03:15.600 --> 03:21.760]  arrest the 9-11 fable that is the catalyzing event that was designed to
[03:21.760 --> 03:27.000]  shift our society into a high-tech police state so we're gonna be breaking
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.160]  that down as well Lord Moncton who's standing for a member of the Parliament

[07:00.480 --> 07:05.360]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.920]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[07:13.520 --> 07:18.360]  I've turned members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[07:18.360 --> 07:23.160]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.520]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[07:27.520 --> 07:32.760]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[07:32.760 --> 07:37.080]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[07:37.080 --> 07:40.560]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[07:40.560 --> 07:45.800]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[07:45.800 --> 07:51.480]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[07:51.480 --> 07:56.880]  at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[07:56.880 --> 08:05.480]  prisonplanet.tv. From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[08:05.480 --> 08:13.400]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:16.320 --> 08:22.360]  yesterday was probably one of the most important broadcast in 16 plus years on
[08:22.360 --> 08:29.560]  air I have ever done and today it looks like maybe even more important we are
[08:29.560 --> 08:35.160]  seeing a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of the world we are
[08:35.160 --> 08:42.160]  witnessing a complete turnaround a complete blow-up in the face of the
[08:42.160 --> 08:48.200]  globalist psi-op disinformation operatives as I monitored radio and
[08:48.200 --> 08:57.080]  TV especially talk radio as I monitored foreign news last night and this morning
[08:57.080 --> 09:05.840]  I got up at 5 a.m. almost 70% or so of the callers in fact it may have been more
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.000]  I was going through all the different channels are calling in liberal
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.600]  conservative doesn't matter saying they don't believe this story they want to
[09:15.600 --> 09:19.640]  see the body they don't believe photos but they think it's even more
[09:19.640 --> 09:24.680]  suspicious they won't release photos and the White House is having to come out
[09:24.680 --> 09:31.440]  Boehner the second of the Speaker of the House is having to come out and say
[09:31.440 --> 09:36.800]  that he doesn't need to see a photo and he believes the president and they're
[09:36.800 --> 09:40.640]  trying to fall back on the Navy Seals and saying why they even had a German
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.720]  shepherd with them spot the German shepherd and you don't like German shepherds
[09:45.720 --> 09:52.240]  if you don't believe us and you hate the military well let's and I was on
[09:52.240 --> 09:56.080]  inside edition this morning that they did a satellite taping for 15 minutes
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.080]  probably try to edit it down to one minute of discrediting information they
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.400]  were very frustrated because they couldn't get me to trip up with their
[10:04.400 --> 10:09.480]  sophomoric questions and they were saying oh you don't believe the story
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.240]  that the you don't like our Navy Seals it was just so sophomoric well they're
[10:14.240 --> 10:19.520]  saying it's the Red Cell or SEAL Team 6 that's kept secret from the rest of the
[10:19.520 --> 10:25.200]  SEAL teams and itself is a sheep dipping arm to create groups outside of SEALs
[10:25.200 --> 10:32.640]  outside of Delta Force that are basically quasi governmental CIA black op
[10:32.640 --> 10:39.120]  teams it goes way above SEAL Team 6 way above Delta Force Delta Force itself is
[10:39.120 --> 10:44.820]  another sheep dipping operation from SEALs Marine Force recon Army green
[10:44.820 --> 10:51.920]  berets and this is all on record it's just the details are classified and so
[10:51.920 --> 10:57.800]  most the people in SEAL Team 6 are of course I'm sure being fed that oh
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.240]  someone in another unit in a subgroup of six did this and and they're telling
[11:03.240 --> 11:05.800]  you know the SEALs aren't gonna talk and no one can ever know who the SEALs
[11:05.800 --> 11:09.880]  are because folks will try to target them on and on and on so we're going to
[11:09.880 --> 11:20.840]  talk to one of the most senior directors of black operations someone who
[11:20.840 --> 11:26.320]  developed many of the modern techniques of psychological warfare assassination
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.680]  raids government overthrows dr. Steve Pacenek you'll notice when he's on with
[11:30.680 --> 11:34.180]  us streaming at presentplanet.tv not from the radio you won't be seeing his
[11:34.180 --> 11:38.560]  his photograph because obviously no one has his photograph that's why up at
[11:38.560 --> 11:45.840]  infowars.com in the guest description we have Jack Ryan Harrison Ford from
[11:45.840 --> 11:53.960]  Patriot Games because mr. Pacenek is the co-author of many of the books with
[11:53.960 --> 11:57.640]  Tom Clancy on record and Clancy's on record that Pacenek is the character
[11:57.640 --> 12:05.080]  Jack Ryan and others that are composites in the films and so he's Jack Ryan I
[12:05.080 --> 12:13.600]  mean how how surreal is this the real-life Jack Ryan I mean the guy that
[12:13.600 --> 12:20.760]  makes the CIA operative bear look like a schoolboy with all the
[12:20.760 --> 12:27.840]  things he's been in they make movies about you know Bear Seriana is on the
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.760]  air telling us that Cheney Bush and the rest of them carried out 9-11 on record
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.840]  he was on record nine years ago in a month telling us he was on ice to be
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.640]  rolled out later and now it's coming out in the news that the entire official
[12:43.640 --> 12:47.720]  story is filled with lies because they can't get their story straight and that
[12:47.720 --> 12:52.000]  itself is a classic scyop where if they know there's big doubt they start
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.200]  admitting problems with the official story because people subconsciously then
[12:56.200 --> 13:00.640]  tend to accept the larger narrative and then debate the inconsistencies that are
[13:00.640 --> 13:05.720]  put out on purpose and I believe that's what's happening but regardless it is a
[13:05.720 --> 13:11.320]  huge impossible lie and we're gonna talk to Dr. Pacenek of course he's a
[13:11.320 --> 13:14.960]  psychiatrist who you think runs psychological warfare I mean he wrote
[13:14.960 --> 13:18.880]  many of the modern books on it and I've done research on him nine years ago when
[13:18.880 --> 13:22.280]  he first came on it and more research did about an hour last night and I mean
[13:22.280 --> 13:25.880]  it was just chop-full of stuff like this London Telegraph US envoy admits
[13:25.880 --> 13:32.080]  role in Aldo Moro killing that was the Italian Prime Minister and at the end of
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.360]  the article they go well the Italian government's now admitted it's true
[13:35.360 --> 13:42.080]  Steve Pacenek the role in killing the Italian Prime Minister I mean I mean it
[13:42.080 --> 13:48.720]  just goes on and on and on how high-powered this guy is behind the
[13:48.720 --> 13:54.320]  scenes under these secretaries of state you know at a level above your normal
[13:54.320 --> 14:01.000]  black ops and you know I nine years ago I said why are you doing this yes I
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.240]  said why are you doing it and I said let me guess because you understand
[14:04.240 --> 14:09.000]  America's going down the tubes collapsing being robbed blind and that it's all
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.440]  being done on the foundation of the fraud of 9-11 he said absolutely because
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.720]  everything when I was on Inside Edition this morning and I knew the questions
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.160]  before I got him because it's all just a formulaic system to target the public
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.040]  no one believes what you're saying you're a kook you're alone you're a minority
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.320]  thinking that weak-minded people listening to that will think well I want
[14:30.320 --> 14:33.880]  to be with the majority and with what's safe and what is accepted that the world
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.240]  is flat the moon is made of cheese the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus are real
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.920]  then they went on and said you are insulting the Navy Seals because they
[14:42.920 --> 14:46.560]  create that obsession with the military that psychological fetish to worship
[14:46.560 --> 14:49.560]  the military but then you're actually not even supporting the military you
[14:49.560 --> 14:54.240]  support whatever the globalist say is the policy and then they wrap the
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.520]  military in the flag around it so it's like a donkey falling a carrot tied at
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.400]  the front of its you know head and so they hit me with that and they said oh
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.200]  you think everything's a conspiracy 9-11 and now this well this is part of the
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.520]  9-11 narrative this is part of the overall hoax I mean it's not just
[15:11.520 --> 15:14.960]  Madeleine Albright Pakistani former president Benazir Buddha will kill at
[15:14.960 --> 15:18.240]  the time she was president coming out saying they killed in a lot in years
[15:18.240 --> 15:24.320]  before he was dead it's not just Sybil Evans the FBI translator saying the CIA
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.760]  was running al-Qaeda it's not just of the four new al-Qaeda leaders three of
[15:28.760 --> 15:32.880]  them born in the US trained in the US caught at US military bases caught
[15:32.880 --> 15:37.120]  being funded caught being protected as Dr. Pachanic told you but they're caught
[15:37.120 --> 15:43.760]  they hide it in plain view Fox News AP that a locky and good on our admitted
[15:43.760 --> 15:50.280]  US government agents and they go out and they find mentally ill people like the
[15:50.280 --> 15:56.640]  psychiatrist from hood Hassan and the and the and the underwear bomber who we
[15:56.640 --> 15:59.360]  had the eyewitnesses a month and half before it was we forced the State
[15:59.360 --> 16:02.400]  Department to come out and admit yes an undaunted agency help us get him on the
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.560]  plane we were ordered to we were ordered to give him a visa and then get him on
[16:06.560 --> 16:10.680]  the plane and the witnesses I've talked to on air breaking it here said the guy
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.920]  looked like he was drugged out of his mind it drugged out little black kid I
[16:14.920 --> 16:19.320]  mean they could drug me up give me some electroshock therapy for a month or two
[16:19.320 --> 16:24.520]  and roll me onto a plane just out of my gourd not even knowing who I am with a
[16:24.520 --> 16:28.200]  firecracker going off in my pants and then the whole country has to have the
[16:28.200 --> 16:31.040]  government stick their hands down our pants because of it I mean it's just
[16:31.040 --> 16:36.800]  sophomoric psyopsin a two-year-old should be able to figure out I'm gonna say
[16:36.800 --> 16:39.800]  it again before I run through the whole cornucopia of news here because the
[16:39.800 --> 16:46.080]  whole myth is imploding I'm gonna say it right here okay and I've got Watson and
[16:46.080 --> 16:50.440]  Steve Watson and and and Nemo and Aaron Dykes all doing their own reports on
[16:50.440 --> 16:54.000]  this but I want to remind you for those of you out there saying they wouldn't
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.520]  lie to us how many times government been caught lying fake photos fake documents
[16:58.520 --> 17:04.120]  WMDs Gulf of Tonkin on and on and on how many times but but but let's take
[17:04.120 --> 17:10.640]  military examples Pat Tillman NFL stars brothers in this in the army he wants to
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.600]  go join at the Rangers he gets in he's in Afghanistan you know six months he
[17:16.600 --> 17:19.800]  starts writing letters home to family saying this whole war is a fraud we're
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.080]  not after anybody it's all about OPM when I come home I'm gonna be against this
[17:24.080 --> 17:28.400]  war you think they're gonna let their billion-dollar boy I mean I mean that guy
[17:28.400 --> 17:34.520]  gave him total entree to recruit young you know well meaning people into this
[17:34.520 --> 17:42.280]  meat grinder to this globalist army and they said oh he charged a hill taking
[17:42.280 --> 17:47.000]  heavy fire he jumped the rocks took out Al Qaeda troops was shot grabbed his
[17:47.000 --> 17:53.360]  knife he was stabbing them what a great warrior he's Rambo kids join walk and
[17:53.360 --> 17:57.360]  just parades and sadness and I mean they said you're gonna try to have a
[17:57.360 --> 18:03.160]  propaganda coup against us leaving because you're honorable we're going to
[18:03.160 --> 18:07.280]  kill you and squeeze even more out of you whether it was a problem the army
[18:07.280 --> 18:11.240]  doctors would not lie on their reports and they said it they said he was
[18:11.240 --> 18:17.560]  clearly murdered he was shot at a distance the first rounds you can read
[18:17.560 --> 18:21.400]  the report it's public now for years they denied it and called you conspiracy
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.920]  theories even when the family came out and said he was murdered remember remember
[18:24.920 --> 18:30.880]  oh it's ridiculous putting down our Rangers you anti-military trash how dare
[18:30.880 --> 18:38.960]  you when Pat went up that hill to find Al Qaeda how dare you say we're lying and
[18:38.960 --> 18:43.720]  the army doctors later we learned who did the autopsy said he was shot it
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.720]  looked like from about 60 70 yards they can tell by how the bullets went in how
[18:48.720 --> 18:52.800]  much damage the two two threes caused then later it came out for people that
[18:52.800 --> 18:58.320]  were in the unit he's that they shooting they start shooting he's waving hey I'm
[18:58.320 --> 19:03.680]  us your forces they shooting knock him down behind a boulder they walk right up
[19:03.680 --> 19:09.200]  and at about a yard and a half triple place three bullets right across the
[19:09.200 --> 19:15.040]  eye line right into the cerebral cortex and there and now we learn there were
[19:15.040 --> 19:21.040]  special units assigned to them that day special units didn't have their patches
[19:21.040 --> 19:25.800]  on didn't identify they were there helping probably a SEAL team or Delta
[19:25.800 --> 19:30.120]  team or some of these private contractors that have been sheep dipped out
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.720]  of those groups into the even larger private Merck armies who are made up of
[19:34.720 --> 19:41.120]  Delta Marine Force recon Navy SEALs and vast pools of these people okay those
[19:41.120 --> 19:45.560]  are the black armies see in black ops in darkness there's wheels within wheels
[19:45.560 --> 19:50.360]  so you think Delta and SEAL team six of the are the creme dollar creme tip of
[19:50.360 --> 19:57.120]  the spear they're just one group that hasn't been brought fully over to total

[24:55.400 --> 25:00.240]  overdrive today we're here live finishing up with just two examples of how cold
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.720]  blooded the disinformation of the military industrial complex is they
[25:04.720 --> 25:08.760]  murdered Pat Tillman and it's on record and they lied and said he was killed by
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.080]  Al Qaeda then it was oh it was friendly fire and no then it was foul play and
[25:14.080 --> 25:21.400]  you remember private Jessica Lynch and the resupply convoy attacked by
[25:21.400 --> 25:27.560]  Republican Guard and a bunch of the unit got killed and some of them survived
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.680]  and got taken to an Iraqi hospital and then when the Iraqis pulled out because
[25:31.680 --> 25:35.920]  of US forces that overtook the area the doctors went to the checkpoint and said
[25:35.920 --> 25:41.200]  hey they're here we like America as many Iraqis do please come and so they
[25:41.200 --> 25:44.600]  waited three days they called Jerry Bruckheimer this is BBC news a minute
[25:44.600 --> 25:48.400]  this year later this is on record and Bruckheimer advised the Pentagon via
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.600]  sat connections how to script it they already had folks at the hospital they
[25:53.600 --> 25:57.840]  pulled back out and then they came in kicked down the doors beat people up
[25:57.840 --> 26:01.080]  claimed they were defeating you know basically Al Qaeda still saying Saddam
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.200]  was with Al Qaeda the opposite group and they went in and she was hiding under
[26:06.200 --> 26:09.960]  the bed and they took her and put her on the news and said that she was on top
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.600]  like Audie Murphy on top the trucks with the machine gun just single-handedly and
[26:14.600 --> 26:17.760]  then when they attacked her physically you've got to her after they already
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.760]  wounded her she was stabbing them with a with a with a k-barred knife I mean she
[26:22.760 --> 26:28.480]  was just G.I. Jane Rambo Arnold Schwarzenegger Audie Murphy all rolled into
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.000]  one and it was see women can fight in combat we eat them frontline and it was
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.560]  just absolute PR stunt and the book came out and that made for TV movies and
[26:38.560 --> 26:41.840]  then some of the other unit survivors were getting mad and they said listen
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.320]  our buddies died in there she hid under the truck which is you know what she did
[26:46.320 --> 26:50.600]  we sat there fighting them off and then you sat there and gave her the credit
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.200]  and then five of them within a two-week period died in car wrecks or were found
[26:55.200 --> 26:58.880]  with their car pulled over in one inch of water dead or were double tapped in the
[26:58.880 --> 27:02.960]  head having a barbecue in what Phoenix it was in the news was like oh one of the
[27:02.960 --> 27:06.720]  people that was with Lynch who by the way been speaking out they had mentioned
[27:06.720 --> 27:11.880]  that part that had been another news previous he was at a barbecue a party
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.480]  and someone popped up over the back fence in a black uniform and mask and
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.680]  double tapped him in the head just pop pop total precision killed him and so
[27:21.680 --> 27:26.680]  that's how America works and because they did not want that big PR bonus that
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.000]  was a valuable little item there coming out and and I went on there and I said
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.720]  Lynch you better get on air now and you better tell folks this is all fake or
[27:35.720 --> 27:39.840]  they're gonna kill you and say our dear little hero committed suicide and she
[27:39.840 --> 27:43.320]  went public I don't know of people listening here got a hold of her but
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.760]  three days later she was at press conference saying none of its true they
[27:48.760 --> 27:53.360]  were gonna murder her next you better believe it they'd had a big Arlington
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.320]  Cemetery deal the president would have been there so in our battle-hardened
[27:57.320 --> 28:02.720]  goddesses of the Amazon rainforest Wonder Woman you know we need a pure
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.280]  army of women we've already got the women all working paying his taxes now so
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.840]  we can run your kids and take control of them in the public brainwashing camps
[28:10.840 --> 28:15.400]  the big reeducation centers but we're at all the women in the military because
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.760]  they want that universal draft that wrangle and others have been pushing for
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.840]  so you can be their Hessian mercs and our women can be the camp women hookers
[28:23.840 --> 28:29.800]  girls from the Civil War I guess back again and and oh I could go on for
[28:29.800 --> 28:35.800]  hours but see it in soundbite TV inside edition can make little jokes and not
[28:35.800 --> 28:39.040]  let me talk about that and just go it's so ridiculous you don't believe the

[33:39.280 --> 33:47.440]  Aladdin was on ice 2001 that died right before 9-11 along with that key
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.960]  report he also has gone public saying that he knows a top general who told
[33:52.960 --> 33:56.880]  him shortly after 9-11 that yes it was indeed a false flag inside job then he
[33:56.880 --> 34:02.200]  had knowledge and dr. Pochenick is ready to go public to a federal grand jury
[34:02.200 --> 34:08.920]  right now and he of course worked under five presidents under three of the
[34:08.920 --> 34:14.000]  secretary of states he was the head of developing black ops psychological
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.080]  warfare programs you can just search his name you're doubting me Steve Pochenick
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.760]  and you will see articles in the Associated Press London Telegraph you
[34:23.760 --> 34:32.080]  name it about his exploits like this headline US envoy admits role in killing
[34:32.080 --> 34:40.280]  the Italian prime minister but they did it by tricking the red brigades that had
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.840]  kidnapped him into getting rid of him and and now we'll see if that's accurate
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.560]  from what the London Telegraph says the point is this is the type of stuff you
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.800]  pull up when you start searching Pochenick and boy the media is really
[34:53.800 --> 34:57.440]  upset about this this is some dangerous stuff we're doing here on air I hope
[34:57.440 --> 35:01.880]  folks understand the magnitude of this frontal assault on the globalist
[35:01.880 --> 35:07.440]  disinformation I mean we're going right up the hill against these people and
[35:07.440 --> 35:12.080]  this is blowing up in their face it is a desperation move with the birth
[35:12.080 --> 35:16.680]  certificate last week on the heels of that Obama showing us how tough he is
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.640]  and this fable about bin Laden that now has more holes in it than a block of
[35:21.640 --> 35:26.840]  Swiss cheese and I just want to go over some of these headlines and I'll go into
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.440]  more detail on it but he's going to be joining us the more Moncton pops in for
[35:30.440 --> 35:33.920]  30 minutes then we go into overdrive into the fourth hour with doctor of
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.320]  history Webster Griffin Tarpley who concurred with our analysis yesterday we
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.440]  had my major general or lieutenant general Hamed Ghoul on former head of
[35:42.440 --> 35:49.920]  Pakistani intelligence confirming and basically giving the same analysis as
[35:49.920 --> 35:55.320]  our guest Steve Pochenick Dr. Pochenick and Dr. Tarpley so we're going to be
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.560]  going over all of that today obviously that was an amazing amazing interview
[36:01.560 --> 36:06.880]  yesterday and he graciously is going to be joining us again I can't wait till
[36:06.880 --> 36:09.680]  this latest hoax is blown over and hopefully they won't stage some false
[36:09.680 --> 36:13.520]  flags out of it they're clearly trying to test balloon that right now to launch
[36:13.520 --> 36:19.480]  new wars and new domestic crackdowns but after this is all blown over if it does
[36:19.480 --> 36:21.800]  indeed you notice things are just getting more and more hectic more and more
[36:21.800 --> 36:26.480]  crazy I have a feeling that's not going to happen but I wish it would but I want
[36:26.480 --> 36:30.520]  to get Dr. Pochenick on for two hours some day to talk to the real Jack Ryan
[36:30.520 --> 36:35.440]  Paul Watson has an article that is an absolute red alert and I do want to make
[36:35.440 --> 36:42.400]  this a red link if it is not on info wars.com I noticed earlier it was not a
[36:42.400 --> 36:50.080]  red link and it is not a red link now I want to make top government insider
[36:50.080 --> 36:58.920]  bin Laden died in 2001 Marley or Matt will you guys do that for me thank you I
[36:58.920 --> 37:03.320]  asked Paul to but I think you forgot he's so busy so top government insider
[37:03.320 --> 37:10.880]  bin Laden died in 2001 911 a false flag that article is an absolute maximum
[37:10.880 --> 37:17.240]  alert report to get out to everyone and has the full two-hour interview with
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.760]  Dr. Pochenick posted under it it is a maximum alert to get this information
[37:22.760 --> 37:29.680]  out to everyone okay let me just do this and I always say I'm going to do it and
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.880]  I've never succeeded I'm gonna attempt to just read the headlines of the news I
[37:33.880 --> 37:37.840]  have here and then start going back into more detail on them experts security
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.120]  checkpoints near soft targets maybe become the norm CBS News New York
[37:42.120 --> 37:46.720]  announcing checkpoints on highways roads randomly schools grocery stores just
[37:46.720 --> 37:53.560]  total lockdown East German society just that's always been TSA's plan they've
[37:53.560 --> 37:58.080]  been training police nationwide under federal auxiliary control the 10 FEMA
[37:58.080 --> 38:02.080]  governors this is martial law in fact I know dr. Pochenick has warned of that and
[38:02.080 --> 38:05.000]  some of his writings I was unaware of reading last night I'm we're gonna bring
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.200]  that up to him martial law is a point I want to bring up to him because we're
[38:10.200 --> 38:14.360]  being eased into it they're not gonna call it martial law but when you've got
[38:14.360 --> 38:18.200]  federally trained goons everywhere sticking their hands down your pants
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.160]  you think you're not gonna fly and get away with it from this you think you're
[38:22.160 --> 38:29.080]  gonna know this is going in everywhere okay we've got that here it is US on
[38:29.080 --> 38:36.040]  alert for hastened plots Zawa Hari who is again has a huge pedigree of being a
[38:36.040 --> 38:44.120]  British double agent a SWAT with a 7-7 London Telegraph MI6 all these guys I
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.760]  mean they're publicly known to hang out at US and British bases 24-7 Moss
[38:48.760 --> 38:54.600]  founded by Israel works for them you heard Pochenick talk about that yesterday
[38:54.600 --> 38:58.280]  I mean folks people don't get this they're like I don't understand have you
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.320]  heard about England where they got two grocery store chains that ever 90% of
[39:02.320 --> 39:08.480]  the business and one color is orange the others green you know and it's owned by
[39:08.480 --> 39:11.440]  the same company and they'll be across the street from each other and one has
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.200]  better deals on this other on that they give you full spectrum dominance they
[39:15.200 --> 39:21.680]  give you a false choice they create the terrorist who then go out and they stage
[39:21.680 --> 39:25.160]  their deaths like to do special forces troops all the time long history of our
[39:25.160 --> 39:34.760]  government sheep dipping people bring up sheep dipping with the chenic so many
[39:34.760 --> 39:40.320]  points I'm writing notes on these and then it actually makes him a martyr and
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.200]  causes more attacks and they say see now we got to be on the streets of America
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.480]  because bin Laden was killed the war on terror never ends and we get the internal
[39:48.480 --> 39:51.960]  training manuals it's all for the American people so they're really hyping
[39:51.960 --> 39:56.120]  the false flag and the nuke attacks and the rest of it here in the US and other
[39:56.120 --> 40:02.200]  propaganda about hero dog helps narrow Obama so now if you're not for the fable
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.720]  you hate the troops and you hate the dogs and if you don't believe that Pat
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.800]  Tillman died charging al-Qaeda you hate Pat Tillman even though it's on record
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.440]  they murdered him doesn't matter just feels good to buy the lie doesn't it
[40:14.440 --> 40:19.200]  and Jerry Bruckheimer did the saving a private lunch thing for you so
[40:19.200 --> 40:27.680]  continuing with that information it is in Fox News it is also in the
[40:27.680 --> 40:33.920]  Associated Press Pakistan is saying it warned about compound in 2009 and
[40:33.920 --> 40:38.400]  specifically pointed it out that they thought some chicanery was going on
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.000]  there and that's on record they're saying well it's like Hamid ghoul said
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.280]  general ghoul said here yesterday if you believe that Pakistan knew about this
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.320]  and the US had to know they got spies everywhere spies in the Pakistani
[40:52.320 --> 40:58.120]  military and ISI double agents CIA operative caught three weeks ago trying
[40:58.120 --> 41:02.160]  to give uranium reportedly to Taliban I mean this is all happening but then
[41:02.160 --> 41:04.920]  blaming on the Pakistani government they're gearing up for an attack on
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.120]  Pakistan as dr. Tarpley said months ago on the show people know what they're
[41:09.120 --> 41:13.000]  talking about they study this stuff they live this stuff I study it I live it I
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.560]  live it I went to bed in one in the morning I got up at 5 a.m. I live it I
[41:18.560 --> 41:24.400]  pick up my laptop when I wake up when I go and sit on the toilet when I wake up
[41:24.400 --> 41:31.960]  folks I'm reading when I go to bed I mean it's it's I even sometimes it's
[41:31.960 --> 41:36.360]  embarrassing I sit there with a laptop out the door of the shower I mean it's
[41:36.360 --> 41:41.560]  just out of control I plugged into this stuff constantly and I know what I'm
[41:41.560 --> 41:47.360]  talking about and I just see people who just buy the surface of whatever they're
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.720]  told I mean I get out of bed boom turn the computer on boom start researching
[41:52.720 --> 41:57.680]  reading the legislation reading the documents studying the history and it
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.600]  just means nothing to the invincibly ignorant they're invincible with their
[42:01.600 --> 42:05.760]  love of of being fools
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.960]  and they're giving us all this background fables and soap operas to follow
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.920]  Obama took 16 hours and slept on it if he was gonna attack him Obama nine
[42:17.920 --> 42:20.920]  months ago knew he was there in the compound but didn't want to drop bombs
[42:20.920 --> 42:24.360]  on it even if you believe that then it means they waited till closer to the
[42:24.360 --> 42:33.000]  election oh he he used his wife as a shield oh that dastardly rat oh he fought
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.600]  back with a AK-47 oh now he didn't oh now his daughter grabbed by Pakistani
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.520]  forces there's no video ever no one even knows who his daughter is he's had
[42:42.520 --> 42:48.240]  dozens of different concubines and wives at least five known wives it's just all
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.280]  complete oh oh but it's all over the news total proof like we'd hear over the
[42:52.280 --> 42:56.760]  last nine years new bin Laden tape new bin Laden text and it'd be at the bottom
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.480]  of the AP article well it's unconfirmed it was on a message board and then the
[43:00.480 --> 43:04.040]  CIA admits fake videos but I'm getting emails saying who you've been proving
[43:04.040 --> 43:11.440]  wrong his daughter his daughters come out what you gonna do about that are you
[43:11.440 --> 43:17.520]  saying still team six is lying huh still team six people in still team six
[43:17.520 --> 43:25.400]  don't even know who's in seal team six it's just a made-up pool of black ops I
[43:25.400 --> 43:30.400]  tell you what next you're gonna tell me Pat Tillman didn't charge an al-Qaeda
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.600]  bunker you're still idiots that believe WMDs were in Iraq and I think they might
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.680]  pull those out of a hat now it's about saying it's nonpartisan no one would have
[43:39.680 --> 43:43.880]  believed Bush finding WMDs no one would have believed Bush bringing out the
[43:43.880 --> 43:47.960]  bin Laden especially when Madeline Albright Teresa Heinz carry the Sloan
[43:47.960 --> 43:55.840]  record and many others Walter Cronkite came out after Pachennik Dr. Pachennik
[43:55.840 --> 43:58.840]  and said they got him on ice they're gonna roll him out they had to back off
[43:58.840 --> 44:04.080]  but see oh now there's partisan differences we can believe this now
[44:04.080 --> 44:08.880]  because Obama is different than Bush same Defense Secretary same policy same
[44:08.880 --> 44:13.840]  program funded by the same Wall Street interest voting together to get rid of
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.000]  the Glass-Steagall voting together for the bailout takeover and I sit there
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.120]  with on idiot radio programs and an idiot TV shows with him laughing at me
[44:23.120 --> 44:28.600]  oh yeah Madeline Albright said so on Fox yeah Morton Kondracky do you want
[44:28.600 --> 44:36.000]  the date no you're lying huh I was on a National British Radio last night this
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.520]  clear Psyop guy called in they were begging for disagreeing calls and they
[44:39.520 --> 44:43.360]  couldn't find him and he calls in about 50 minutes into the interview they finally
[44:43.360 --> 44:47.520]  got one and he goes no one believes you no one is with you no you're just a
[44:47.520 --> 44:53.360]  conspiracy cook and you're a radical you know you you need to be arrested and
[44:53.360 --> 45:01.120]  what's your proof and I said the CIA May 25th 2010 spy talk admitted that they
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.920]  create created fake bin Laden videos oh yeah cuz you say so on YouTube see you
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.680]  give them facts they come back and laugh I was on Tom Hartman show last night on
[45:10.680 --> 45:16.360]  RT and I've never seen in fact guys try to dig dig it up off Hartman's YouTube
[45:16.360 --> 45:20.760]  channel or off RT if it's up there oh they sent it to you I want to play that
[45:20.760 --> 45:25.520]  with Tarpley later because I've got to say that that Tom Hartman is totally
[45:25.520 --> 45:28.560]  different than when he was on the radio I mean this guy's desperate to be
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.960]  noticed at RT to get an MSNBC job I mean you can tell he would say so you
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.040]  huh you know look at the Cooke's that think there's 30 let's cut to Alex and
[45:39.040 --> 45:42.280]  he was making all these jokes and I was giving him facts and he'd go what about
[45:42.280 --> 45:46.200]  Ayn Rand worshipping someone that chopped up children I said what's up with
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.400]  Ayn Rand and chopping up children then you go I bet you just love Glenn Beck
[45:50.400 --> 45:54.560]  don't you you 9-11 truth or since he's a 9-11 truth or of course he's the big
[45:54.560 --> 45:59.680]  arrest 9-11 truthers 9-12 remember our anger go go back to believing the lies
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.720]  and I said Tom you're actually he was just desperately trying to follow the
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.160]  playbook he was taught and clearly trained I mean this Tom Hartman very
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.240]  suspicious now because I was hearing playbooks man I mean I was hearing maybe
[46:13.240 --> 46:16.360]  he was trained by somebody doesn't know what he was trained to do but it was it
[46:16.360 --> 46:21.440]  was actual creating mental images of something completely different I ran
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.960]  chopping up kids throwing babies out of cars and I'm he was just melting down
[46:26.960 --> 46:30.960]  and I kept hitting him with total targeted factual info people could check
[46:30.960 --> 46:35.240]  and he got more desperate and he said you like Glenn Beck you 9-11 truthers
[46:35.240 --> 46:38.280]  love him and he got more and more desperate and was just bleeding out I
[46:38.280 --> 46:44.960]  mean I was a singing he was it was like I was a I was a Merlin Rolls Royce
[46:44.960 --> 46:54.360]  engine powered fighter plane in the Battle of Britain right behind his
[46:54.360 --> 47:01.000]  Messerschmitt firing into his gas tanks whoa man I'm telling you and then then
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.840]  I was on Inside Edition it was the same Psyop Psyop Psyop Psyop Psyop and if
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.920]  these guys aren't actual Pentagon trained Psyop they were trained by people that
[47:10.920 --> 47:17.160]  are but it's so ridiculously obvious once you know it and when I mean imagine
[47:17.160 --> 47:21.040]  you're on the show talking about the history government lies about the
[47:21.040 --> 47:24.880]  Democrats believing they were gonna roll out bin Laden about real issues and he
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.960]  goes I'm just out of the blue I'm Rand worshiped a man that cut up babies and
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.920]  threw him out of a car what do you say to that just trying to erase everything I
[47:33.920 --> 47:38.440]  just said to get his audience to shift to that image of a chopped up baby going
[47:38.440 --> 47:44.240]  to a bestial low-level image which automatically triggers the brain to go
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.240]  into its lower brain defense functions hearing about the baby dying kind of
[47:49.240 --> 47:57.400]  like when the former well at the time it was the current drug czar what was that
[47:57.400 --> 48:02.160]  general's name guys pull up Alex Jones confronts drugs are he'll say the
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.160]  general's name and having one of those moments of overload and I said what
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.120]  about this Reuters article from last week of the head of US operations US army
[48:09.120 --> 48:13.000]  shipping masses of cocaine and heroin in and he started laughing I said don't
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.960]  laugh I read the headline and the date everybody went who and he paused for
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.800]  about 10 seconds everybody was going what and he goes he goes the baby the
[48:22.800 --> 48:28.000]  baby I care about the baby it's the same thing I'm hitting him hard and what's
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.520]  he do he shifts and he says the baby chopping I mean these people are so
[48:34.520 --> 48:39.400]  predictable Barry McCaffrey we've got the clip we can play it right now Alex
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.080]  Jones confronts drugs are I mean I am just watching them with these cartoon
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.840]  level moves they throw at me it's like I'm a boxer and they're in slow motion
[48:47.840 --> 48:55.000]  and I'm the flash is bam bam bam bam I mean it's just it's they're a joke but
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.320]  see they're not swinging at me they're swinging at unconscious people in a
[49:00.320 --> 49:05.120]  rim state dream state that the TV and the culture is actually lowered IQs
[49:05.120 --> 49:08.920]  lowered brain waves of the brain waves you can see the studies on average of
[49:08.920 --> 49:14.080]  Westerners are now lower because we're people are in a spectating dream state
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.080]  and so it was all for people in a dream state people in a dream state oh they
[49:18.080 --> 49:27.360]  were completely buying the entire thing and then look at the headline Tom
[49:27.360 --> 49:34.040]  Hartman what is Alex Jones smoking been lied mission of fake I'm gonna play
[49:34.040 --> 49:39.600]  this in the fourth hour I mean I have never seen anything like it until this
[49:39.600 --> 49:45.120]  morning when I went on Inside Edition okay I haven't even gotten into the news
[49:45.120 --> 49:53.320]  yet I mean it is getting crazy it is getting absolutely crazy yeah in fact
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.320]  going to break here this is so important I'm skipping the break this is so
[49:56.320 --> 49:59.520]  important I'm skipping the break we're gonna skip this network break it's it's
[49:59.520 --> 50:03.720]  a historic thing biggest thing that's happened in decades this psi-op the fact
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.520]  that it's blowing up in the globalist phase I haven't gotten to all that news
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.800]  yet the fact that it signifies that they're gonna try to launch new wars and
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.840]  false flags the fact that they're on CBS news ABC news CNN saying they'll soon be
[50:15.840 --> 50:19.720]  feds on the streets taking their hands down your pants everywhere shopping
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.760]  centers churches malls they're rolling out the full martial law system right
[50:23.760 --> 50:28.040]  now and we're dying not with a bang but with a whimper but but but here I am
[50:28.040 --> 50:31.600]  with Barry McCaffrey listen to the psi-op and then later when I play Tom
[50:31.600 --> 50:37.000]  Hartman it's the same playbook and and folks I mean when you hit him hard in
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.240]  fact it happened once when Reno got asked a question by somebody else she's
[50:40.240 --> 50:47.240]  just shifted to babies babies are being hurt here it is do we have that
[50:47.240 --> 50:52.600]  John McCaffrey Alex Jones from KJFK radio in Austin Texas I fully agree with
[50:52.600 --> 50:56.360]  you on the scourge of narcotics and their destructive consequences on the
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.760]  human brain but something I find interesting is the massive evidence
[51:01.760 --> 51:05.920]  coming out in the past of our own government and other international
[51:05.920 --> 51:10.600]  organizations involved in drug smuggling fact two days ago you you called

[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.280]  psychological warfare programs that are currently used today and he's clearly
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.640]  looked at this latest bin laden killing and and said you can see all the
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.000]  scripting was shy off but he can confirm that he was dead pre 2002 as he did on

[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:40.960]  they've done this but but even more important why they stage 9 11 and here

[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.040]  an hour of airtime because when we come back I'm going to go over some of his
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.880]  bio and this article just so people know exactly who they're listening to and
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.320]  then also try he's been in so many missions involved in so many things he
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:23.640]  is the character that jack ryan in the patrick games series is based on he
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.080]  have and that's on record he's co-authored many of the books with
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:33.280]  tom clancy's also you go to imdb the producer on films like net force and
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.280]  others I mean just incredible and nobody knows what he looks like and he's here
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.960]  with us today because he wants you to know the truth I hope people realize
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:48.200]  the magnitude of this and obviously we'll let things settle out and he can
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:55.520]  do it come back on with us again next week as things continue to unfold so
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.560]  we're gonna be breaking all of that down today he of course is a board
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:08.240]  examiner level psychiatrist ran many large mental institutions also were
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.680]  under five presidents three state departments and just involved in
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.920]  innumerable secret and clandestine operations maybe I should get him out
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.360]  of the gauge to tell us about some other stuff that he can now talk about just
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.880]  so people know how how important this information is and the fact that he's
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.560]  risking a lot coming on air and saying that he talked to a top u.s. general who
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.680]  could confirm 9-11 was an inside job and he's ready to testify before a
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:42.240]  federal or state grand jury right now this is big news he's not playing games
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.000]  and this is the real deal but as he pointed out yesterday he's not really
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.120]  risking anything because if we don't turn this around folks there is no
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.280]  society there is no future I mean every time I look at my dear little children
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.680]  how sweet and innocent and good they are and there's always corruption there's
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.520]  always problems but when you stop resisting it when you just give into it
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.240]  when you let total delusion rule the day it infects all of society then total
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:15.600]  confidence is lost and you become a banana Republic and we are on our way to
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  that right now and the controllers try to sell us on how much they want to
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:28.120]  protect us I heard the the the meme they're pushing right now is that the
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.360]  government's job is to protect you and that's the most important I heard him on
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.400]  the radio and TV is saying don't worry about gas prices don't worry about the
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:41.240]  dollar plunging it's national security keep us safe well what's most important
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.680]  is the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence the free
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.340]  market private property the family that's the engine that the limited
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:54.120]  government is supposed to protect not protect me by having checkpoints on the

[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.280]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.480]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.240]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.760]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.240]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.280]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.480]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.440]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.040]  they're not being political but I think this was staged and I don't believe it

[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.480]  conservative and he's trying to get political points with this where's the

[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.520]  first of them pulling the trigger on JFK top US government insider bin Laden
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.000]  died in 2001 911 a false flag top US government insider dr. Steve
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.320]  Pachinic a man who held numerous different influential post under five
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.720]  different presidents but under the Secretary of State under three still
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.880]  works for the Defense Department shockingly told Alex Jones show yesterday

[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.120]  job I mean this is the kind of stuff can get us killed folks Pachinic cannot be
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.240]  dismissed as a conspiracy theorist he served as the Deputy Assistant
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.280]  Secretary of State under the three administrations Nixon Ford Carter while
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.240]  working under Reagan and Bush senior and still works as a consultant for the
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.960]  Department of Defense a former US Navy captain when his highest colonel I believe
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.480]  before he got out Pachinic achieved two prestigious Harry C Solomon awards at the
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.000]  Harvard School as he simultaneously completed his PhD at MIT recruited by
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.320]  Lawrence Eagleburger as Deputy Assistant Secretary from state management Pachinic
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.000]  went on to develop the basic tenets of psychological warfare this is from the
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.040]  Pentagon the basic modern tenets of psychological warfare counterterrorism
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.400]  strategy and tactics for transcultural negotiations that's the
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.800]  anthropology sociology for the US Department of State military and
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.240]  intelligence communities other agencies the US government while also developing
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.840]  a foundational strategies for hostage rescue that were later employed around
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.480]  the world Pachinic also served a senior policy planner under Secretaries Henry
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.440]  Kissinger senior policy planner Cyrus Vance George Shultz these are the top
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.400]  kingmakers James Baker and worked for George W. Bush's reelection campaign
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.320]  against Al Gore is his record underscores the fact that he is one of the most
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.200]  deeply connected men in intelligence circles over the past three decades he's
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:11.520]  Jack Ryan folks it just goes on and on this is insane and everything he says
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.680]  fits into my research and all the other experts I'm talking to Hamid Ghouls
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.880]  agreeing former head of Pakistani intelligence general Google Webster
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:27.360]  Tarpley Wayne Madsen NSA but it I know I'm ranting sir I apologize just just I
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.040]  want to get into some of the other issues you wanted to cover today but since
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.880]  we talked 24 hours ago or 22 hours ago to be technical this is clearly blowing
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.600]  up in their face do you agree and how dangerous are these cornered rats now
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.080]  well I think you know when you tell a lie you're going to unwind that lie by
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.320]  the very fact that you've created a lie but the nature of creating a lie in
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.920]  psychological warfare is that you have to be consistent make sure that all the
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.680]  details are intertwined and are credible it's almost like a movie so you got to
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.720]  think of the president of the United States the chairman of Joint Chiefs of
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.680]  State Admiral Mullen who by the way his father was a publicist for the William
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.760]  Morris agency and in the intelligence community it's not an accident that you
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:18.400]  have this entirely contrived story it's not credible it's just like you had
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.880]  Disneyland with a key character who was already dead and in order to reaffirm the
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.160]  storyline that is to make sure that the president of the United States looked
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.320]  good a man like Axel Ryder all his advisors including Obama's mouth was
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.480]  particularly suited to the lie distortions and deception because that's
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.520]  how he came to power that's how a George Bush junior comes to power he sits
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.520]  down with a bunch of his own cronies they sit down in group faith which you
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.960]  talked about before on your radio every one of the national security advisors
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.840]  who have their roles there because they're between in their sickle fins to
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.680]  the president they're all toutowing down come together and create this
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.880]  fictional story in psychological warfare that makes no sense and many of the
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.240]  present people in psychological warfare were never trained 20 30 years ago
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.640]  because they didn't understand the psychology they don't understand the
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.280]  anthropology they don't understand that the American public you do not sigh ups
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.760]  the American public that was a rule of thumb that we had under four to five
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.360]  presidents that if you tried to sigh ups the American public and it broke when
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.920]  you had George Bush junior when he created the psychological warfare and then
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.920]  created the 9-11 through deception distortion false flag stand down and
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.080]  then we had before him we had Lyndon Bain Johnson it goes on both sides when
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.040]  he created distortion of a false flag in the Gulf of Tonking we went into the
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:50.040]  war in Vietnam and we had FDR as Donald Rundsfeld stupidly accused and said
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.600]  that if anybody like the kennec is accusing the Republicans of creating
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:59.800]  9-11 Rundsfeld said it's on public September 12th 9 on 2011 he said at
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:05.000]  2001 he said steep the kennec if he accuses us the Republicans of 9-11 then
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.040]  we have to accuse Franklin Roosevelt of doing a standout well of course I accuse
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.960]  them of doing a standout because Paul Wolfer with the neocon xiaomi holla
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:21.920]  zot Brian Fukuyama you had Dennis Ross you had Richard Pearl and you had
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.640]  Scooter Libby all trained at the University of Chicago under Wolstetter
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.080]  and what was the topic stand down in the false flag and Pearl Harbor the
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.520]  University of Chicago when I was at MIT so what happens now what happens now
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.520]  when you've distorted the story and you can't get a consistency just as we saw
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.440]  in George Bush Junior which was well we have weapons of mass destruction
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.280]  suddenly there's a reality testing there isn't weapons mass destruction suddenly
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:52.440]  the military are formidable military are generals and our military generals in
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.440]  particular are forced to change the intelligence in order to go be consistent
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.520]  with the White House but thank God for a lot of our CIA operatives who were not
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:06.520]  on contract who would be career and refused to listen to Bush Junior and
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.360]  do the bullying of Cheney but today unfortunately 80% of our CIA now are
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:17.640]  mercenaries they do not have analysis intel they really detailed off from
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.360]  special forces and well sir that's what I want to stop you doctor and continue
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.480]  but that's what Ray McGovern I don't know if you knew him but he was you know
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:31.360]  the morning briefer for Reagan and and and Bush senior did you know him you
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.400]  know I knew all of them yeah well well Ray says the same thing he says they
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.240]  can't even do real national security assessments anymore because it's all
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:44.080]  lawland and once you put a scythe out into the public the way the human
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.440]  brain works and all individuals being limited in their perception it then is
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:53.480]  taken back and received by your own system and it basically for lack of a
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.280]  better word makes the military industrial complex drink their own
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.640]  Kool-Aid well it's not only the military industrial by the way it's very
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.680]  important for the public to understand this I am not a hero I'm not this great
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.880]  individual I'm just a simple American who was grateful for the benefits I was
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.920]  given and earned in terms the ability to serve my country and at the same time
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.760]  being the only country where I could criticize my own president and still
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:22.360]  work for them and be so loyal to my country because I was willing to go
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:26.600]  online and particularly serve my military our army generals in particular
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.320]  the army colonels and be teaching at the war college every year that's a
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.800]  privilege for me I don't understand dr. Pachanis Alex but I have to understand
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.240]  the public this is I'm not some superhero I'm the same guy that your father is
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:45.600]  who's a dentist or a mechanic out there or an army lieutenant or or or a junior
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.680]  officer because they stood for something they believed in I am tired of the
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.200]  American public being told these lies I thought it would stop with my 11th now
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.360]  we have Obama now let's get back to the issue what happens when the psyops which
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.280]  was poorly constructed you were talking about where they get their CIA people and
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.480]  that most the intelligence is run by private mercs correct they get the
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.520]  intelligence people from all the military industrial complex out three
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:17.760]  communication north of Grumman any of these companies around the Washington
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.280]  Beltway will provide intelligence to you right away because they want those
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.480]  contracts now remember America and particularly the Alex Jones audience
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.120]  supporting our national security does not mean supporting our military
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.160]  industrial complex it is not the same thing they are out of control they have
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.600]  been hogs that need to be slaughtered I will quote one of my most favorite
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.760]  presidents were unfortunately I was too young to serve but I did always admire
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.400]  him and that was general Eisenhower who warned us when he left beware of the
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.680]  military industrial complex he repeatedly said that this is a great man who was
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:00.200]  exceedingly modest who was exceedingly careful of the American national
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.720]  security and every week he literally Alex would call up the Pentagon to make
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.880]  sure that generals didn't blow out their staff or promote things and I think
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:14.720]  to create as units that didn't exist that's the type of generals we had and
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.920]  and people who cared about a country we don't have that now what we have is
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:24.200]  Disneyland on steroids and what's worth is that Disneyland is killing our
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:30.120]  American our heroes our American women and men and young people who are going
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.800]  out to die for civilian orders that are being used and manipulated by a
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:39.480]  president who's never served our country as a questionable background in many
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:44.080]  many places to get the birthing issue and have civilians around them have an
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.200]  open questionable in their capability and we're all recruited from a
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.760]  questionable predecessor either Carter or Clinton who himself was also a
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:59.280]  sociopath so we have three sociopaths in line and I use it not in a diagnostic
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.920]  term but in a very simple term you have Clinton who lied and pervericated you
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:09.240]  have Bush Jr. who lied and pervericated and now you have Obama now if we have
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.560]  three in the lower we got a problem here America this problem isn't just with the
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.440]  individual of the Republican and Democrat this problem is with the American
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.560]  people we have to decide this is enough whether you're a public and Democrat
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.120]  liberal or conservative it's irrelevant sir let me stop you because Alex don't
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.600]  absolutely because we have limited time and obviously you're gonna be back with
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:37.720]  us a lot the issue now what happened is if I didn't know which unit of the
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.000]  special forces and I've worked with special forces over 30 years and part of
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.440]  it I was involved in in development of Delta Force because in the beginning of
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.560]  hostage negotiation we didn't have a comparable unit to the FAS one of the
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.520]  concerns that I had and I said if I think any unit's gonna be send in there
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.120]  on but on the basis of publicity and believe me I have a lot of respect for
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.440]  men and women who serve in the Navy and in all special forces but particularly
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.520]  I work with the military army and the special forces which by the way you have
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.680]  never heard anything about you have never heard about any of the army men who I
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.320]  know and the units that I specifically you know no will I tell you of the men
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.880]  and women who are in the army and they're serving this country and they've
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.680]  never had a movie about them they've never had a story about them yet today I
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:28.820]  would have sworn and I said to Alex Jones beforehand if I had a predict which
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.760]  unit was going to get the biggest publicity and if I were Admiral Mullen
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.920]  who's in concerned about his publicity and the publicity of the Navy because
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:41.400]  they have no goal whatsoever right now strategically I would have said they were
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.040]  to use the SEAL Navy team now think about it you use the SEAL Navy team on the
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:52.000]  ground from Pakistan to Pakistan it makes no sense and then to go on the news
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.480]  and to say that we are so great but we are so secret it is an inherent
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.920]  contradiction when you're secret you are secret there's a reason why I don't
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.800]  have a picture because I'm not that good-looking there's a reason I really
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.280]  don't care about what people think about it because I want to do my everyday
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.480]  life in America I don't need to promote my narcissism I don't need to promote
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.560]  who I am or what I am it's already difficult to pronounce my last name
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.040]  Pachanik and by the way that's been my secret to success overseas because
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.520]  nobody could spell Pachanik including Noriega but let's go back to the Navy
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.040]  SEALs they really have to question what they did and what happened well let me
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.200]  stop you doctor a doctor there's been some major breaking news Dr. Pachanik
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.000]  are you there okay okay great obviously this morning they came out and said his
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.760]  daughter they have at a military base in Pakistan who was left there and he has
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.080]  all these wives all these concubines all this made up cut out just like they
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.480]  told us that you know Pat Tillman was killed fighting Al Qaeda and turned out
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.160]  they just murdered him or the same thing with Private Lynch with Bruckheimer on
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.840]  record producing it if folks don't know about that BBC admits it they're now
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.120]  announcing that oh not only did bin Laden not use his wife as a shield not
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:12.520]  only did he not shoot at them now they grabbed him took him out and then shot
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.600]  him somewhere else and they just keep changing it changing it changing and
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.480]  then the SEAL team six as you know is the most secret of the teams and has
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:26.840]  other teams associated with it that's why they use that team so that other
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:33.960]  SEALs are are ignorant and and and can never you know discover that it didn't
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:39.440]  happen and and you you're breaking down what teams you think are involved what
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.440]  happened obviously it's theater he's been dead for nine plus years ten years
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  but and they're creating this whole story then let me just show you your
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.320]  audience understand this I worked with special forces for over 30 years not
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.200]  particularly with SEALs but I did have an episode with the SEALs I'm not
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.240]  degrading the SEALs I think there are very good men and women who are on the
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.000]  SEALs but let me tell you the history of the SEALs is I know it under the Reagan
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.560]  administration I was involved in the invasion of Grenada the only men we
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:15.720]  lost on a on a raft were SEAL member teams heading into Grenada now you tell
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:22.760]  me how four to six SEAL members drowned on a raft heading into Grenada the only
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.160]  members of any special forces I have ever seen in the movies on television so
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.040]  promoting themselves like the FBI loves to promote itself and it had a history
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.600]  where it was totally dysfunctional in international crisis management and in
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.280]  terrorism because I've worked with the FBI they never shared their intelligence
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.560]  they never shared their information remember they were the ones who flew out
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:50.400]  Osama bin Laden but didn't say a word is again whenever you see self promotion of
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.200]  a particular unit in the US government you have to question it as an American
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:00.280]  citizen now not degrading those people who go through the SEAL unit and are on
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.120]  the teams these are brave men and women I'm questioning how they're being
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.080]  manipulated and used I'm questioning an Admiral Mullen who's chairman of the
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:12.760]  Joint Chiefs of Staff who's already made judgment mistakes by giving us the
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:17.160]  Billion Medal of Honor to another sociopath named Greg Mortensen who
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.480]  claimed he was in Pakistan and then I reprimanded them for doing that and
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.720]  immediately he was seen in terms of a statesman like attitude and I say he
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:31.160]  should resign now he should resign the SEAL team should resign and every member
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:40.040]  who has been involved in this contrived disgusting degrading Psyops operation
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.640]  should resign stay there doctor we got a break we come back as a Psyops expert
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.960]  decipher why it's a fraud for us and we'll get into some other important
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:57.240]  issues we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.880]  network
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:06.200]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:11.840]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.480]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've termed members
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.920]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.080]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.600]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:34.280]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.320]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.000]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.080]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.280]  Pakistan US new bin Laden's location all along if you believe the official
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.720]  story the Pakistanis are now saying nine months ago they said something was
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.120]  going on in that compound but again that's all just adding credence to the
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.640]  official story and and all these debates about did he have a gun did he use his
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.000]  wife was he shot at the compound did they execute him later that's all to
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.680]  create inconsistencies in the fake narrative because somehow it lends
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.520]  credibility to it because then people say well they did kill him but we're
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.320]  being lied to about exactly how and the burial at sea which they say is the
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.360]  sharia law and then it's the opposite of opposite of sharia law then it makes
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.760]  it about did they follow sharia law instead of why did they throw him in
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:39.440]  the ocean to get rid of him all of it completely manufactured so sir as a you
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.960]  know one of the top know psi op experts out there on record doctor break down
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.560]  not just the fact that you know it's alive as you're inside sources and being
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.320]  on record but looking at the official fable I mean I think you said it best
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.960]  the seals are the politicized special forces group then there's delta that you
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.600]  helped found and during the break you said yes you're correct but I can't
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.840]  talk about it but obviously through my contacts there are a whole bunch of other
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:11.080]  squadrons with other jobs not just anti-terror the surveillance groups the
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.120]  plainclothes groups I mean there's all sorts of groups way above that but you
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.400]  can't get into that but obviously they use the politicized group with this
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.400]  phantom seal team six so the other seals can't even find out it's a fraud
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.200]  please continue well the real issue again in the narrative that you want to
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.480]  create in psi ops when you create a war like 9-11 which deception denial false
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.600]  flag and stand out at all your people know about you need to have a bad guy so
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.640]  the bad guy was suddenly said I'm Osama bin Laden but in this narrative because
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.400]  Bush, Cheney, Wolfe with and the other neocons were not very bright and
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.800]  understanding even psi-ups for war they created two bad guys Saddam Hussein and
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.240]  Osama bin Laden and a lot of us got confused because Osama bin Laden Saddam
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:04.520]  Hussein has never been a Muslim he was basically a Baptist he hated Osama bin
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:11.760]  Laden and basically we had two wars going on with two on specified targets we
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.720]  went into two countries without any clear exposition of what the reasons were so
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.760]  we had this incredible psi-ups with no sense no internal consistency when
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.040]  people in the intelligence community came back to Bush and said this is not
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.160]  true we don't have weapons of mass destruction the still the only fable
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.840]  that was out there to sustain this myth of the war of why we were fighting
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.480]  terrorists that didn't exist and we had created under the Carter administration
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.000]  the subsequent the Bush's administration we had to have this Phantom
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.560]  Polo Osama bin Laden who was somehow scurrying about in the accident
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:54.200]  Torah Bora with a with a real dialysis machine and I said 10 years ago on Alex
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:59.200]  Jones's show this is nonsense this psi-ups is so pathetic because he has
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:05.120]  Marfan syndrome he died already six months after the 9-11 attack he was
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.320]  has thought this is why here he is number two man is headed to Taliban is a
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:13.720]  provision and by the way from a tactical point of view and a strategic point of
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.040]  view his death means absolutely nothing in the real world of intelligence
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:22.880]  stop you think is that Obama is trying to resurrect his career and try to get
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.320]  reelected and it means that Panetta wants to have credibility that he did
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.160]  something in the CIA when in fact he had was a disaster to see I he killed more
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.120]  civilians in Pakistan than any terrorist had he created more drone attacks
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:40.800]  than a terrorist we had more CIA operatives die because of his faulty
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.480]  understanding and we converted an entire CIA which is an intelligent or
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:51.840]  human oriented into special forces and into a killing unit now this does not
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:55.840]  involve the generals betray us and our military men who've done a formidable
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:01.120]  job but they are also at the behest of civilians who've never been to war so
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.200]  when the president of the United States Obama said without any experience after
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.600]  picking up the Nobel Peace Prize which was absurd and then went to war the next
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.160]  day in Afghanistan after giving this peace talk to the Muslims saying we're
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.000]  all brothers you could see the inconsistency in the lies and now this
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.080]  politicized drama which makes no sense all the inconsistencies are unwinding but
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.600]  we needed Osama bin Laden or the story was needed in order to get the bad man
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.960]  the reason he's now discovered and ostensibly this attack on a mortuary
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.000]  which I've never you know this is the most absurd story I've ever heard the
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.960]  legitimize is number one the fact that this entire system of intelligence which
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.120]  by the way Americans have to understand there are over 850,000
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  contractors contractors with top secret clearances now that is the most absurd
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.440]  thing I have ever have a stake in the fairy tale let me add something because
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:01.960]  you are a a medical doctor right let's break this down now from from my own
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:07.280]  layman research total renal failure kidney failure for for layman out there
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.360]  the disease he had I went online I went online to a whole bunch of mainline
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.880]  medical sites last night and on the outside they were saying maybe you can
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.480]  live five six years once you're in this position but if you have this disease
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.960]  even less so then I went and pulled up old articles from even the mid 90s
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.280]  saying he had it then and then it was on record you've seen a CIA file so how
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.760]  can a guy that has something that kills you in six years correct me if I'm wrong
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:43.760]  how can he be alive 16 years later that's why I said on your show even two
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.000]  and nine years ago that dr. Julie one of the physicians at CIA went to the
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.800]  American hospital in Dubai he was already dying under the Clinton administration
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.520]  so you have Clinton implicated who's another provericator and disorder I mean
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.880]  and that was used subsequently in 9-11 because they knew his life was limited
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.800]  that was it he was he was to die so how do you best use a man's imminent death
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:13.480]  in a psychological warfare routine well you make him the bad guy so you make him
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.120]  the bad guy and then you don't find him for ten years now that is so absurd in
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:21.920]  terms of credibility and by the way sir by the way you didn't even know that
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.520]  CBS News had reported that the CIA did go to the American hospital LeFigaro the
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:31.120]  French that's been confirmed no I knew this way before no no no I understand
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.920]  I understand and well no you said it on the show years ago it didn't come out
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.920]  to laughter but they probably got it from you and then went and did research but
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.920]  the issue here is that they know full well now his family builds most the
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.960]  military bases in the Middle East they did the air conditioning for Mecca
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:54.360]  they're one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia working yeah no no I mean
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.880]  exactly his kids his kids you know are all going to Oxford and the rest of it
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.440]  now he is now his daughter but we're not seeing her pops up and says it's all
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.780]  true this family from my study correct me if I'm wrong goes back to British
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:12.000]  intelligence they didn't just send bin Laden in to be the money man for the
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.320]  Mujahideen that you met while you were there running some of the military
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.120]  operations because he fell off an apple truck now my intel is they made the deal
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.640]  with him and his family at the time to let him play the part of the bad guy and
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.120]  since then they've been given even bigger US and British contracts as the
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:33.920]  payoff right then let me tell you one principle of counterterrorism of
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.120]  psychological warfare any terrorist that has been apprehended for the most part
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:45.880]  as a rule of thumb for example Carlos not only serve intelligence of Soviet he
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.800]  served intelligence for the Mossad for the French who caused the question of
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.800]  the quality and BND so within this game of counterterrorism which is really a
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.480]  game a very sick game we create what is called on the Kissinger strategic
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.880]  tension we create strategic tension so we have a legitimate use to go reason to
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:11.000]  go into a country to either invade suppress or extract whatever mineral
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.520]  rights now let me give you an understanding and let me say it very
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.560]  clearly Osama bin Laden was on more than one payroll he was not only the CIA
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.480]  program British payroll but guess who's other payroll he was on Alex Jones the
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:29.160]  Israelis a wild guess you got it and he had relationships with Jews in the
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:33.360]  Middle East and the diamond business and Israel ago absolutely nuts but the
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:38.040]  New York Times article years ago even reported how a lot of his own money
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:43.400]  came out of the Jewish diamond dealers and Tel Aviv and his mother Yemeni
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:47.080]  usually would probably be Jewish but I don't want to get into this entire
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.040]  issue other than the fact that people have to understand when I went after
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.800]  Noriega which also cost my life because he hunted me down accused me of being
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.400]  an assassin whether it's right or wrong that's not worry about that but he
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:05.200]  served our intelligence he served Latin American intelligence he served Cuban
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.080]  intelligence he served many intelligence for the same reason when we went after
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.080]  Saddam Hussein by the way I do have to correct you Saddam Hussein was not
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:17.480]  executed with all due respect Alex Jones we never execute a leader of a
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:21.960]  country and particularly with Bush Jr. who's a liar and a coward by the way
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:27.360]  you're saying that's all fake too he was not executed what you saw in effect
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:33.520]  was a picture of how so-called execution through a camera of somebody's
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.640]  little camera but he is probably somewhere in the Central Asia and it
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.200]  Bush Jr. can go in front of the federal court and if he can swear that
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:44.800]  without holding Chinese hands the same way he did the commission I will be
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.920]  surprised sir that's like the old Kings rule where Kings don't kill Kings that's
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.480]  why twice that's exactly that's why twice with Napoleon they put him on
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.960]  islands exactly Edie I mean I worked against Edie I mean he killed 187
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:01.240]  thousand people we didn't kill him we put him in Saudi Arabia he was playing
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.160]  poetry he was writing poetry he was playing peck golf
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.760]  Noriega was never killed he was sent off to France he has a shadow in France
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:15.960]  who goes on and on and on Osama bin Laden was already dead we used him all of
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.880]  these so-called villains are used for national security purposes and the
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.080]  vehicle is always a psychological operation to mobilize the American
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:30.200]  public through the most cynical of all statements national security freedom of
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.160]  speech and in fact what happens is there's suppression so the inherent
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.480]  paradox of what our country does to ourselves will come back to fight
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.000]  government repeatedly because the American government will not tolerate
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.840]  American people not this is this is too incredible and the time we've got
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.160]  only about 35 minutes with you I don't want to bump Lord Monkton who's popping
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:54.000]  in but I'm getting really tempted to do it here in a minute okay but no no no
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.440]  stay there sir because because I'm here but I mean let's go back let's go back
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:03.200]  here because every time you mentioned something it opens a whole data mine in
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:10.880]  my own brain up yes the the the the four al-qaeda leaders at school you must
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.800]  spend restless at school I was restless but but every time you mentioned a
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.040]  point then I can see all the data that's public not to mention all the data
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.640]  inside data you have but it's just all confirmed when I was on RT
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.840]  international TV a few days ago they showed the four top al-qaeda people and
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:34.920]  three of them good dawn a locky and one other they admit all born in the US and
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.520]  then I know they're ledgers and we're all a locky Fox News admits secretly at
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.960]  the Pentagon two months after 9-11 dining with the Secretary of the Army he
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.560]  runs the Fort Hood Patsy attacks the underwear bomber of the Times Square
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.520]  the shoe bomber they get the drug to the toilet on the plane and this is all
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.200]  admitted and the State Department did correct I mean what's crazy is it like
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.640]  you but we just have this final point to get to the central premise my my idea
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.760]  but here's my point Adam Goddan is the grandson of the former head of the ADL
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.200]  who was arrested for beating up Arabs outside mosque he hated him so much and
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:13.600]  the way he gets some is by dressing up in that clown suit with the beard here
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:20.640]  is this ADL grandson uploading with the Intel Center in the same al-qaeda logo
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.080]  their logo and Wired magazine confirmed they'd made the video I mean my
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:28.800]  point you're bringing up bin Laden working for Israel I don't think people
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.720]  get what you're saying here they have not think he's working I'm saying that
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:38.000]  basically had been funded by you know diamond dealers that was in the New York
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.280]  Times and I'm sure he worked for many other intelligence services including
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:46.680]  the Brits and others you know because in that game and this is speculation on
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.320]  that part in that game of counted terrorism which unfortunately is a game
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:56.440]  it is always service of multiple masters in order to justify what we have
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:01.000]  what they do with national governments do but bin Laden was always feeling in
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.800]  the diamond business I believe his mother was Jewish he's Yemeni and you know
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:09.640]  the bin Laden family still part of the car law group take a look if they haven't
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:12.720]  been on it or they're still part of it you can look it up no sir London
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:21.200]  Guardian headline September 11th 2001 in arty September 12th that he that that
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.560]  that all these top brass and bush people were meeting at the car law group
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.960]  meeting with the bin Laden's there that day that's what I mean there's all
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:34.160]  there's all these insane connections that's correct it's all connection so
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.560]  basically the question is how do you break these connections and how does the
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:44.560]  American public stop this nonsensical dangerous cynical disruption as you call
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.760]  it it's destroying the fibers of our country and the answer is you have to
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:54.080]  get out on the streets and start insisting on freedom of speech insisting
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.480]  that you have to organize yet the American public is not stupid they
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:02.240]  don't need to have their homework to protect the country and they have to
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.080]  have command the truth and they have to force the legislators most of whom are
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:11.720]  powered because whether you're public in a Democrat remember the dynamics of a
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:17.080]  legislator is the pandera he first says to you very nicely oh please vote for me
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:21.000]  please vote for me this is what I can do well it's like saying a physician like
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.960]  me if I weren't a medical student I go up to you Alex and I said listen I want
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.960]  you to pay for my the fact that I'm gonna be a doctor but I'm not a doctor
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.680]  right now but I promise you I'm gonna be a doctor and you can say what are you
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:34.960]  crazy you haven't shown anything that you can do to be a doctor well that's
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.400]  what Obama did he said look I can run this country but I've never run any
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.240]  doctor but I think we've got a break we've got a break and and again I hate
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.320]  to interrupt because everything you're saying is so important but then I've
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:50.560]  got you all of these other questions I want to bring up to you and I want to
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.960]  get into the solutions I want to spend a lot of time on that there's also a lot
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:58.280]  of breaking news CBS news is confirming the president has now given an
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:03.760]  interview that will be played later this week that they are not going to
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:09.120]  release the photos and they say Obama said the risk of releasing outweighed
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.640]  the benefits conspiracy theorist around the world will just claim the photos are
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:18.000]  doctored anyway and there is a real risk that releasing the photos will only
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.840]  serve to inflame public opinion in the Middle East and he went on to attack
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.720]  conspiracy theorists this has been released by CBS news that Obama is
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.400]  responding to conspiracy theorist that is people that don't buy his propaganda
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.000]  I want to talk about this when we come back but also more importantly something
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.440]  I've learned that you've written and talked about the move towards a police
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:45.800]  state martial law situation because there is a full court press ABC CBS CNN
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.640]  saying contrary to the war on terror being over we are going to set up
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:55.400]  federally trained police in grocery stores everywhere and that everyone is
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.240]  going to have hands stuck down their fans they're doing this to break our

[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:20.080]  informative and I've done all this research when I'm here I'm talking I
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:23.920]  want to say yes yes you're right folks it's true in fact here's all this public
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.000]  evidence I mean he'll say one line of information and then another another
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.320]  and other and each one when I've just immersed myself in this it makes my head
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:38.040]  burn not in a bad way it makes me want to jump out of my chair and just see
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.560]  people come out of their trance the people perish for lack of knowledge
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:48.480]  sir what do you make of Obama they've now released the transcript of a 60
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:53.720]  minutes interview he just did today responding to conspiracy theorists now
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.280]  he's responding to the birth certificate I mean this shows how weak they are and
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:02.400]  now they're not going to release a photo because any photoshop expert can put it
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:07.840]  in a computer and scan it they put out a whether you believe is born in Hawaii
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:11.920]  or not the experts have now spoken the birth certificate has been altered did
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:17.240]  they do it on purpose to make the debate continue I don't think so let's
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.120]  get it straight what happens when you attack the government whether it's
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.560]  under Bush Jr. or Obama and you seeing Obama use it but he's not as effective
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.440]  as Bush Jr. was because Bush Jr. was I had more CIA operatives there who had a
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.120]  better history of psyops the truth is when you don't know what to say you
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.080]  immediately denigrate people like me in particular is what he's talking about
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.040]  people like you Alex and all of your audience by saying we're conspiracy
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:48.880]  theorist well you know the beauty of life is that there are people who are
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:53.640]  trying to do nasty things and whether we call it conspiracy theorist or not or he
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.600]  says it's silliness that doesn't mitigate the fact that there's truth and a man
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:03.480]  who is not able to tell the truth or come to terms with the truth then uses
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:08.480]  these very flippant words like conspiracy theorist a silly people
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:13.680]  burfist or true is these are code words in order to make sure that you're put
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:18.440]  into a corner where you can't say anything and you categorize that's a
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:22.520]  very easy way to delegitimize you in psychological warfare but unfortunately
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:27.160]  the president really is not very smart contrary to his own self-esteem and
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:30.440]  they can listen to this to the White House it's not very bright and I'm
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.680]  saying that because he never really had an education in psychology never really
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.560]  had an education the real world how it works other than the political world of
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.960]  corruption deception denial and lie but he doesn't really know how to effectively
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.320]  use it more importantly needed to anybody around him that's why the story
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.760]  line and this atrocity and ridiculous if you want to talk about president's
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:57.160]  own word silliness of the body of Osama bin Laden that's been dead for nine
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:02.640]  years but he can't show you a picture of it is it's so absurd it flashes back
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.720]  and it's what we call a blowback the president now is death well that's what
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:10.600]  I'm saying sir doctor I got to stop you again I got to stop you because this is
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.480]  I'm having an epiphany here exactly I think this proves what you're saying
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.440]  they've got the power but they're they've been immersed in their lives so long
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.400]  that they're the ones that are delusional didn't they know claiming they
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:25.640]  threw them in the ocean would make people not believe them don't they know
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:30.920]  not releasing a photo is is the prima facie evidence I mean they look so
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.680]  guilty my dear friend Alex let me tell you something about you and the American
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.400]  public we're a lot smarter than our politician this is not being grandiose
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.680]  I'm just telling you the American public has to understand that we the
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:49.400]  American public a lot smarter than our politicians because number one we
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.200]  understand real life number two we used to television shows number three we
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:59.760]  have silly movies we used to reality shows this is a reality show that makes
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:04.280]  no sense and his own is very pathetic because unfortunately it's costing us
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:08.960]  millions and hundreds of millions of dollars and the actor is not a very good
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:11.880]  actor because number one he's not good at acting you look at him in the
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:15.560]  teleprompter he's pathetic he looks like a zombie without any emotion
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:21.200]  secondly he really has no intellectual capacity to analyze a question what
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:25.080]  really is happening despite the fact he said he's from Harvard Law you know
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:29.600]  very Harvard Law well that doesn't make for a very effective president or not
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:34.160]  a good person another BS filled lawyer stay there dr. Pachinic back in 60

[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:26.840]  Alex Jones. Dr. Pachennick is our guest Webster Tarbley coming up or
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:31.920]  Moncton coming up. There's so many stories so much intel this guy could
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.600]  give us so many questions I don't even know where to begin we're gonna have him
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.360]  back just for calls soon and for your Twitter questions. Dr. Pachennick I want
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:44.440]  to get into solutions in the next segment with you this is a short little
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:49.880]  segment but you were just talking about Rumsfeld attacking you after 9-11 and
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:54.440]  and and at the same time Bush went to the UN and said let us never tolerate
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:59.200]  outrageous conspiracy theories you know which means don't investigate don't look
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:05.000]  at me don't look under the rug I mean I mean it's really me thinks you protest
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.400]  too much but get into what Rumsfeld said. Well it's very simple once you get
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:14.440]  into this type of situation where Rumsfeld said you know if you accuse me
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.960]  in the Republican administration when she really directed towards me as a
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:22.360]  conspiracy theorist which was absurd I said fine it's reality then you have to
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.760]  talk about Roosevelt rating for Harvard and I said of course Roosevelt had a
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:29.880]  stand-up for Harvard. It's the same thing with Obama but many he talks about as
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:34.040]  conspiracy theory or silliness or whatever he wants to say then what
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:39.440]  happens is it repercusses back to him and it opens up his own narcissistic
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:43.880]  vulnerability which is a fancy way of saying listen the more you pump yourself
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  up stupid the more you're going to be vulnerable to the American public
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.200]  asking questions of what did you do in Chicago when you were growing up while
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:56.720]  you were married before you're married before you were educated what kind of
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:01.080]  education did you really have let's look at really what you did because the more
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:05.480]  stupid things you say and you do to the American public the more vulnerable you
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:10.000]  become and go ask Axelrod who's not the brightest guy in the world and ask your
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.240]  own heads of national intelligence who remain there because they get pensions
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.920]  and they get double pensions these are not the same guys from the 90s and 80s
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.320]  work for Bush and Reagan who really sacrificed their lives these are guys
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.480]  who earn their pensions remain there and really had never been in the outside
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:30.840]  world so I want this president to keep on attacking me and you and the American
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.960]  public to come out with more and more stupidity because underneath it all
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:39.280]  he's not just a liar he knows he's a sociopath he knows it from the day he
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:43.040]  was born he's a sociopath you don't get to be President of the United States unless
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.720]  you want to manipulate that's even life but this is not a man who's basically
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.200]  all that bright in the same way Condoleezza was not very bright we know
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:56.520]  Bush Jr. was stupid Clinton was very bright but he's a bright liar this man
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:00.760]  is not even a bright liar he would it would do well for him to go to Clinton
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.520]  to understand how to lie convincingly but this president is getting stupider
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.200]  and stupider in fact when he's trying to promote himself at a time when he's so
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.480]  weak and he can't really get out of the notion of the birther issue out of the
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:18.400]  notion that while we have a support of each day where we have PSA now what in
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.280]  God's name are PSA people doing putting their hands in your project feeling you
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.440]  off delaying everything and making believe that they caught any terrorist
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:31.200]  there is no terrorist that they could find furthermore if they want to look at
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:35.760]  anything what you look at the harbors what you look at overseas and really look
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.240]  at what you're looking at the only parents we had is turd off who started
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.240]  all of his nonsense with the PSA because he owns a lot of the machinery and the
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:48.760]  neocons who are still around trying to promote America and we have a president
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:53.520]  who was so pathetic late in that he knows that he knows that guys like me
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.600]  cannot be convinced because I didn't buy him when I heard from congressman that
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:03.560]  Hillary Clinton couldn't lie for a run you know why because Bill Clinton was
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:07.240]  still screwing around he was still screwing around so I was asked by a
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.360]  congressman who I will not identify why Hillary Clinton will not be able to win
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.800]  the presidency and I said Bill Clinton will never win allow the Hillary Clinton
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:20.240]  to win the presidency because he's screwing around so you had a man out
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:25.640]  of nowhere who came out of nowhere Chicago with a ballet dancer who was his
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:30.680]  right-hand man around the Emmanuel who really it was a totally dysfunctional
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:37.000]  ballet dancer and it came to the forefront and he said he was a very
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.600]  powerful man and intimidated he didn't intimidate anybody one senator said very
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:46.080]  convincingly I wish he were more of a kneebreaker than a ballet dancer he gave
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:50.520]  away eighty billion dollars in pharmaceutical grants to the pharmacy in
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.240]  order to pass Obamacare stay there sir yeah I was written by the insurance

[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:12.600]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:16.840]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:21.200]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:25.320]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:29.880]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:33.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:37.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:19.040]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:23.040]  right now there are literally hundreds of articles coming out
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:28.040]  I'm scanning over the headlines the Atlantic that attacked me yesterday saying I was a
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:33.040]  coop for questioning the bin Laden kill now their editor comes out with the slippery
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:38.040]  story of the bin Laden kill drudge has it linked up at drudge report and it just goes
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:41.040]  through the fact that people are not buying it
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:45.040]  seven out of ten calls I actually was sitting there driving in my car with a
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:49.040]  piece of paper doing the four lines and the fifth line through it counting
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:54.040]  seven out of ten callers national local are not buying it
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:03.040]  a complete route has begun doctor up a chinic for those that just joined us is the
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:08.040]  is the Jack Ryan of course of the Patriot games that character from the books of
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:13.040]  Tom Clancy you know really spy master overthrowing governments running
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:19.040]  assassinations you name it working in five administration sir what do you make of
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:23.040]  the fact that this is starting to blow up in their face is there any danger in them
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:27.040]  now trying to pull some even more ridiculous rabbit out of a hat how could
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:32.040]  this escalate well this can escalate very quickly by what you saw that in fact
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.040]  we're going to increase our terrorist watch we're going to suppress the
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.040]  American public more we're going to have more security but in fact I have more
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:44.040]  faith in our military particularly the army than I do in our civilian government
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:49.040]  I have faith in my general portray as other generals who I will not mention
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:54.040]  where the army will not tolerate this type of behavior by civilians who are
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.040]  really a net and really what's happening is the quicker that the general
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:04.040]  portrays gets into the CIA and is able to keep a control of this and so-called
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:09.040]  intelligence apparatus which really has not been functional as I told you 850
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.040]  thousand of these Intel boys and counterterrorism had top secret they're
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:17.040]  all making money it's become a big business one of my close general friends
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.040]  said to me the greatest weapon of mass destruction is the centers for counter
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:27.040]  terrorism thinking that counter terrorism are the biggest dangers of that
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.040]  so I'm not as afraid because the American public is going to resist it
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:36.040]  they're going to say you know F you fire up and they're going to they should
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:41.040]  stand up and say that's enough we don't have the attacks the attacks did not
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:46.040]  occur for 30 years it only occurred after Bush and Cheney created an attack
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:51.040]  9-11 and then they made it this absurd scyops that said since 9-11 we haven't
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.040]  had an attack yeah we've had attacks we've had attacks by basically a
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:00.040]  security force that never existed the PSA for homeland security which is a
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:06.040]  misnomer run by a woman a woman from Arizona who barely could run Arizona
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:12.040]  in her own border and now you have incompetency on steroids so what you
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:17.040]  have to do now is to watch our own military say in effect quietly
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.040]  cease and desist to our civilians I know Obama cannot handle our military I
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.040]  know in fact that Obama is surrounded by sick events from Chicago all of whom
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.040]  are ex Chicago you know convicts pre-convicts ex convicts with questionable
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:37.040]  histories you know what it does I'm very happy when he attacks me or you
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.040]  know because it opens up it opens up daily its brothers it opens up
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:46.040]  exactly what they did in Chicago and you quite frankly they're messing with
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:51.040]  the wrong guy you know they really don't understand I'm not that special
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:57.040]  I'm just another American who will not tolerate the BS of an organization
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:02.040]  that's corrupt deceptive and at the same time what they're going to do is
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:06.040]  they're going to ramp up their ineffectualness and dysfunctionalism
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.040]  what happens in effect if you're not good at telling a lie you're not going to be
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.040]  good at reversing that lie because you're going to be on continuously
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:18.040]  unthreading these lies by saying well that's not the picture I mean it's absurd
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:25.040]  it becomes so comical that Obama becomes nothing more than iconic picture
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.040]  of stupidity incompetence dysfunctionalism and self-aggrandize which is
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:35.040]  really what's happening and he knows that and he's getting very pissed off every
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:39.040]  time saying that because it's going right into the White House and he knows guys
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.040]  like me who've been to the schools that he's been to and then some will not
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:48.040]  tolerate the nonsense he came forth with and may believe that he was that important
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:52.040]  that smart he is not that important he's not that smart it's really quite
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:57.040]  incompetent and has never arrived with anything in his life so I want the mechanics
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.040]  the truck drivers the doctors every one of us to stand up and said we've had
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:07.040]  enough and I want to go after Mr. Johnny you who are in the front page of the
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:12.040]  New York Times the man who wrote a South Korean naturalized in America who wrote
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:18.040]  the Patriots Act five weeks before we had 9 11 and wrote in the memorandum that
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:23.040]  we should have torture of our terrorists so-called terrorists Mr. you who I
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.040]  attacked on September 12th because I already picked up what he had done
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:33.040]  he was unpatriotic un-American he has criminal charges against him he's at the
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:38.040]  University of Berkeley and I want the students at Berkeley to protest his
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:43.040]  presence and refuse to accept the legal degree because he's a lawyer there who's
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.040]  tenured at University of Berkeley a liberal school run by the Chancellor
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:53.040]  Robert Virginia the version no a Canadian who's been at MIT for 25 years
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  this is the beginning of the unraveling and counterbalancing what was happening
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.040]  in 9 11 and the absurdity John you came on the front page of the New York Times
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.040]  and said we are justified in the Bush administration for torturing well John
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:09.040]  you should be tortured and should be put in prison so that he understands what
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.040]  happened I want your public to go in and see John you why oh oh and see how many
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:18.040]  charges have been pressed against him and how now the University of Berkeley the
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:24.040]  great liberal school in California California at Berkeley has retained him
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.040]  as a tenured professor and I want the Chancellor to fire him and if the Chancellor
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.040]  doesn't I would like Jerry Brown the governor to fire the Chancellor because
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:36.040]  there's no excuse I want to go further though the day of retribution comes back
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:42.040]  nine years later my friend doctor doctor they're obviously scared I mean a bunch
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.040]  of the torturers went to prison but then Bush wrote a book last year saying he
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.040]  ordered torture he do it again Rumsfeld's out promoting it they're trying to
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:55.040]  resuscitate torture lying and saying that torture enhanced interrogation
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.040]  rough interrogation as they orwellian whitewash it led to the killing of
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:03.040]  bin Laden then the White House comes out and says actually torture didn't lead
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:08.040]  to this KSM of course confessed to bombing buildings that were built after
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.040]  he was already captured and spent you know many years of torture and mind control
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:17.040]  at Gitmo so expanding on that are they trying to resuscitate torture because
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.040]  of they can sell our troops on doing that they can have an army of darkness or
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:26.040]  is it more about trying to not end up down the road going to prison for what
[02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:31.040]  they've done I think it's more about ending up in not an ending up in prison
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:36.040]  bit too cowardly those people who espoused it Bush junior and Cheney who's
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:40.040]  never been in the army Cheney refused to serve our country eight times you know
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.040]  that an alcoholic who was kicked out of Yale for alcoholism was sent to
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.040]  university Wisconsin and his wife the great neocon who decided to get pregnant
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:53.040]  on the ninth time eight times I told my general refused to go to the army but
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:56.040]  he didn't have a problem sending our troops into war and he said the
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:01.040]  Vietnam War was not my kind of war see talking about the chicken hawks these
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:05.040]  guys should be in prison should be indicted but more importantly you who
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:09.040]  wrote that memorandum should be thrown out license taken away but more
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:15.040]  importantly what what Obama is trying to do is to cover up for Bush junior so
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.040]  there's a story a narrative that seems very consistent which is absolutely
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:23.040]  absurd torture does not work I've been in the field 30 years never had a
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:28.040]  torture anyone never had a touch them never had to do anything but sit down
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:33.040]  and any detective and any policeman in any town knows the following you sit
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:37.040]  down you have a smoke you have a drink together you talk you get a lot more
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:41.040]  information and torturing waterboarding does not work but if they are not
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:45.040]  convinced I'd be happy to waterboard Donald run spell so that you can explain
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:50.040]  how he did 9-11 I'd be happy to waterboard Cheney to explain how he did 9-11
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:55.040]  I'd waterboard Wolfowitz for 9-11 since he's a coward and Elliott Abrams who's
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:59.040]  the council in foreign relation and he is a total coward who was also involved
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:04.040]  in Honduras and Nicaragua and the contra fair he's never been held accountable
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:09.040]  so we have all of these people have never been held accountable coming back again
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:15.040]  like you're like sewerage we have a backup of a sewerage system and now the
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:19.040]  garbage owner is Obama and he's just stirring the pot to make sure that
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:24.040]  everybody gets to be like and everybody has a narrative that's consistent
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:29.040]  with suppression oppression and he gets reelected the Republicans are no better
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.040]  believe me they are just pathetic if you look the entire field they have nothing
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:38.040]  to say except platitudes well the main doctor and again we're talking the real
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.040]  life Jack Ryan folks you know co-wrote the books with Clancy but wrote the modern
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:51.040]  black op system cannons that are used and he's here basically spilling the
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:56.040]  reality out for people because we're in such crisis a crisis because the elite
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:05.040]  like Nero or Caligula is going insane and they are just putting out more and
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:09.040]  more bizarre lies what about the childish media that keeps saying well why
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:14.040]  would Bush not do the fake killing of bin Laden and then why would Obama as if
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.040]  they're fighting with each other when both parties continue to cover up for
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:22.040]  the crimes of the last administration and this is all part of that continuity
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:26.040]  of the military industrial complex and then and then I want to get into the
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:30.040]  point and what it means to be a news reporter and anchor person number one
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:35.040]  in order to get information you have to be egregious to access yourself to the
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:39.040]  individual you want to write about so from the very beginning the media
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:43.040]  want to portray itself as an adversary but really what they are sick of them
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.040]  you look at the entire dynamic of the media which I really talk to the press
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:52.040]  it's fake fights fake fights they're total sick of them they basically will call
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:56.040]  up oh would you please talk to me really on the record off the record we
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:00.040]  can play games with the media and I've done it where I've had three different
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:05.040]  quotations all done by myself off on on the record off the background deep
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:09.040]  background so you play games with them in the psyops world we play games with
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:13.040]  them in the world of Obama he needed in order to feed his ego because he has
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:17.040]  nothing else there's nothing else to manipulate except the people in the
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:22.040]  media who become the news itself so you have the very personalities in the
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:26.040]  media talking about themselves and the people of America getting sick it's
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:30.040]  egregious we're getting sick I don't want to see every one of them they have
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:34.040]  nothing to say most of them have never really done anything except read a
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:38.040]  teleprompter having said that however there are very brave journalists I do
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:43.040]  want to say Anderson Cooper did a very great job in Egypt the people at CNN
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:47.040]  when they were in Terere Square really sacrificed their lives on the line but
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:52.040]  for the most part there are certain guys like Bernie Gworkman and others whom
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:55.040]  I've known who've been really brave who've gotten down the field but those days
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:20:02.040]  are gone all right doc doc one final segment stay there amazing will I have

[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.040]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:16.040]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:21.040]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the U.S. antagonizing China by
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.040]  calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying
[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:29.040]  about 70% of U.S. Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:33.040]  Treasuries our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:37.040]  U.S. dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing

[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:54.040]  done it's it's it's it's dr. Pachennick on records telling you who the 9-11
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:58.040]  conspirators are saying I'll go before a federal grand jury nine years ago
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:03.040]  breaking down the fake bin Laden garbage it is incredible in closing sir
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:07.040]  studying homeland security I saw governor reg eight years ago on a two-hour
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:12.040]  c-span program with top CEOs say that they are going to first take over the
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.040]  airports train us to be you know felled up and everything they'd phase it in
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.040]  and then they were going to federalize to the fusion centers and roll it out
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:25.040]  everywhere now I've seen CNN announcing naked body scanners to go in the malls
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:30.040]  9000 locations and now have TSA screens including Walmart's saying
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:36.040]  title on your neighbors big right of 1984 and they are announcing in CBS news
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:40.040]  that they are now going to prepare a pedestrian malls shopping centers and
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:48.040]  there's a Tia TSA PSA showing them in a mall and that now randomly federal
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:52.040]  potbellied goons are going to wander over and stick their hands down your
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:57.040]  pants as an active total submission and domination as a psychiatrist and expert
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.040]  in this sir is this not the the martial law rollout without them telling us it's
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:07.040]  martial law well in effect it is that the fact or martial law but basically
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.040]  it's very ineffectual what happens is that you increase suppression on a
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.040]  domestic population which has not been in any way
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:21.040]  disturbance or in any way these have been quite contented has not shown any
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:26.040]  activity of disruption it's very dangerous what happened in effect you're
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:30.040]  creating a very disruption that you fear and once again there the head of
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:34.040]  Homeland Security really does not understand the dynamics of having
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:38.040]  security versus having freedom and neither does the president of the United
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:42.040]  States and one of the most important things to understand is our liberties are
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.040]  the most important we have a very stable society we've had very little terrorism
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.040]  we are not going to have terrorism the terrorism that occurred at 9-11 was
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:56.040]  because of a president that wanted to go to war if they insist on putting more
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:00.040]  so-called security to protect ourselves against ourselves for things that
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.040]  didn't exist this will be the beginning of the second American Revolution which
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.040]  in many ways will be very peaceful but they'll be very disturbing because
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:15.040]  Homeland Security and this president's real legacy to America will be the
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:20.040]  agitation and the disruption and the lies that are continuing and well you know
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:23.040]  what they're going to do they're going to start arresting they're going to start
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:28.040]  to learn history they better learn American history because when we're left
[02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:32.040]  alone we're very fine but you know basically there are many of us who
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:36.040]  believe in our rights and will defend it and will go to war the same way I will
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:40.040]  the reason I went on your show is I've gone eight times to war for our country
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:44.040]  and eight missions and I'll go a ninth time including this one which I see is
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:50.040]  an absurd, absurd disruption of our democracy and our freedoms and if they insist
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:54.040]  that this is what they think is best for national security then they must pay the
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:59.040]  price I render on the Caesar that which is Caesar and I will give it to him if
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:04.040]  Obama sees himself as Caesar and denigrates us then he will go the way of
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:09.040]  Caesar as will Homeland Security there is no other solution because the more force
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:14.040]  he will use against peaceful people it'll come back to hurt them all they have to
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:20.040]  look is Egypt, Libya, the Middle East those young students can be mobilized here
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:24.040]  in the United States they should be and they will not be tolerating this type of
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:29.040]  suppression and they don't understand that now with the technology that we have
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:34.040]  and the ability for people like you to reality test this and then eventually
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:39.040]  what'll happen is they will they are they are seeding the seeds of their own
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:43.040]  destruction and this is what Obama does not understand he's not smart enough
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:47.040]  No exactly the founding fathers finally
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:51.040]  one of the key things that people never got to is he just not very bright
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:55.040]  and the fact that they think he went to Harvard doesn't mean anything I've got more
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:59.040]  idiots who came from Harvard who don't know how to run a paycheck or don't know
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.040]  how to run a mortgage I never hire anybody in a business who came out of Harvard
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:07.040]  Business School they're just not that bright it's not an everyday man but the man has
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:12.040]  never done anything so what we have here is the seeds of imperial presidency
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:17.040]  from Bush Junior before that Clinton and now we get to the supreme idiocy
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:22.040]  of a man who really doesn't understand psychological warfare, national security
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:28.040]  or war and has ordered our military to sacrifice its best men and women
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:32.040]  in a noble cause that they always believe in defending our freedoms but are really
[02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:36.040]  involved in civil action civil... I hear you we're out of time
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:42.040]  We're out of time doctor StevePochinic.com, StevePochinic.com
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:46.040]  links at info wars.com he'll be back tomorrow and Friday
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:30:10.040]  stay with us, stay with us folks
[02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:19.040]  you won't have time to think, you must act automatically
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:23.040]  what does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:26.040]  no time to think, just act automatically
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.040]  when the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:34.040]  you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need

[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:30.440]  So we're going to expose the globalists, the one-worlders,
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:33.520]  the communistic New World Order minions,
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:36.240]  and always charging forward against the enemy
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:37.960]  as Lord Christopher Monkton.
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.720]  By the way, I haven't been plugging new affiliates.
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:41.160]  We're getting three or four a week.
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:43.880]  We were on the cover of Talkers Magazine
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:46.120]  as the fastest growing radio show in the country,
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.080]  on the keynote speaker there,
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:52.360]  along with Sean Hannity coming up next month.
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:55.160]  We got a huge station, one of the top talk stations
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:34:00.160]  in Minnesota, KYCR, Big Salem Station, 1570 AM.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:03.840]  We're on three stations now in Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:06.360]  We're on three stations in Dallas, Fort Worth.
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:09.480]  We're on several stations in Chicago.
[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:12.120]  Big stations going into Los Angeles.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:17.120]  Huge, the big number one station there in Orlando, Miami.
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:19.600]  This is getting scary.
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:22.560]  I mean, we are reaching, by the way,
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:24.880]  I keep saying we reached two million a day
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:27.200]  and off and on, some listen every day,
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.480]  some listen off and on.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:32.080]  Total, I've said three, four million a week,
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:33.120]  just on the AM and FM.
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:35.760]  It's now over three million a day.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:37.760]  Number one radio show on the internet,
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:40.160]  millions a day between the live streams
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:42.600]  and the 500,000 listing of the podcast,
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:45.240]  the millions watching us on YouTube.
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:48.680]  We've got 103 million views just on one YouTube channel,
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:51.840]  370 plus million views on all eight.
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:56.840]  Number one on iTunes for radio.
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:34:58.280]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:00.040]  This is the success of you, the listeners,
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:03.720]  the success of our guest with the light of liberty.
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.840]  I can't believe, and in fact,
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:07.520]  I'm the opposite of a narcissist.
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:10.880]  I come off as arrogant because I'm aggressive
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:15.880]  and because I'm, as I think it was Lord Nelson said,
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.120]  damn the maneuvers, go straight at him.
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:20.840]  I mean, I'm so committed to this, I just,
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:21.880]  I go straight at him.
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:24.160]  The truth is, I don't like this job.
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:26.040]  I wish we didn't have to do this.
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:27.680]  There's a lot of other things I want to do.
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:31.560]  We have a family ranch and farm for over 100 and,
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:35.440]  I don't know, since 1830, we bought from the Spanish.
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:38.320]  And I'd rather be out there, I mean, believe me,
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:39.640]  but we're here fighting.
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:42.200]  I'm sure Lord Moncton, scientist,
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.080]  to journalist, editor, chief advisor to Margaret Thatcher,
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:48.520]  has a lot of other things he wants to do,
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:50.480]  very accomplished and veteran, his own right.
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:53.720]  UKIP.org, I'm sure he'd rather not have to run
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:57.400]  for the parliament in Scotland.
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:01.120]  I'm sure that Nigel Farage would rather not be
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.520]  in the EU parliament having to hang around
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:06.720]  with Herman von Roompi and Barroso
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:08.400]  and others calling for world government,
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.600]  but you have to because if you want to be free
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:12.680]  and you want to be left alone,
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:16.560]  you've got to go face the miscreant weevils
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:19.080]  that want to get into the body politic
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:21.040]  and eat out our substance.
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:23.440]  And there's been some big developments
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.640]  on the EU trading scheme on carbon credits,
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.560]  attacks on every man, woman and child
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:33.320]  and human respiration and all fuels that are being used
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:35.840]  for our industrial society, that's fallen through.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.520]  This is a great victory.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:41.480]  The trading scheme here is falling apart,
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:42.960]  but they're still trying to enforce it
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:46.520]  by executive fiat outside of congressional law,
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:49.120]  but that's being fought by more than 30 attorney generals
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:53.480]  led by Texas and our economy is going into depression
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:55.800]  and they're trying to push it into one,
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:58.320]  one in seven Americans now on food stamps,
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:01.840]  stocks sink led by energy prices increasing,
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:04.680]  they won't let people drill, that's CNBC.
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:07.280]  That's why we've got Lord Christopher Moncton on
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:10.680]  right now today and there's also a media blackout
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:12.640]  in Scotland despite the fact that they're now
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:15.080]  the second biggest party in the UK.
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:17.160]  The system is so scared that they keep winning
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:19.600]  in England, winning in Europe because you get to
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:21.880]  obviously have members from England in the EU Parliament
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:25.240]  that they're trying to block Lord Christopher Moncton
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:26.960]  right now from even being heard.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:29.680]  So the elections tomorrow, Lord Moncton,
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:31.200]  thank you for joining us today.
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:34.680]  Well, Alex, what a wonderful piece of timing
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:39.000]  that here I am doing my eve of election broadcast
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.640]  to the people of Scotland via the Alex Jones show
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:44.880]  in all those wonderful media where you now have
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:48.760]  so many tens of millions of viewers and listeners
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:51.080]  on every kind of electronic medium.
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:54.000]  And I'm very glad to be able to do it because
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.560]  I will reach more people in Scotland in this broadcast
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:00.920]  than I have managed to reach using
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:04.120]  the mainstream news media here in the UK
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:06.440]  even though I'm speaking to you from Edinburgh
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:09.840]  overlooking the castle right to the centre of events
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:13.280]  but they will not put me on the air.
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:17.320]  They have had, for instance, party leaders' debates
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.080]  on television on both the BBC and Scottish television,
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:22.880]  the private independent channel,
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:26.280]  and neither of them would allow me to take part
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:28.080]  in the leaders' debates.
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:31.080]  In fact, when I turned up for the STV one last night,
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:34.040]  I was escorted out of the building by security.
[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:37.520]  They were so anxious not to allow me to go anywhere near
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.920]  the other party leaders who of course are all
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:43.400]  in agreement that Europe is wonderful, climate change
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.280]  is terrible, and that therefore we need a world government
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:48.880]  to take charge of everything and push us around.
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:51.680]  And the Scottish National Party is
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:54.920]  planning to cover Scotland in wind farms
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:57.520]  which will destroy our scenery,
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:58.800]  which is our great tourist asset.
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:00.720]  It will destroy our great game birds.
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:03.360]  They go to the eagle, they osprey.
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:06.080]  It's already destroying millions of bats
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:08.280]  by causing their lungs to implode.
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:10.480]  And we've now got a report just out here
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:13.360]  that all of Scotland's windmills,
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:18.200]  even if they ran for 20 years at their present capacity,
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  would reduce global warming just by 0.0002 Celsius,
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:27.600]  that's 150,000th of a Celsius degree.
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.960]  On top of that, UKIP is the only party which opposes
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:34.240]  Britain's membership of the European Union
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:37.240]  and would give Britain's people the choice
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:40.480]  whether they wanted to stay in this dictatorship,
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.640]  this tyranny by Clark from Brussels,
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:45.000]  or whether they would like to be a democratic,
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.240]  free and independent nation once again.
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:50.280]  But once again, the media don't want
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:51.640]  to let us anywhere near it.
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:55.000]  But I'm glad to say that the EU and climate change
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.080]  have come together in a bit of a train wreck
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:00.040]  in the shape of the EU trading scheme,
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:02.240]  the carbon trading scheme,
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:04.520]  which has already failed twice.
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:07.120]  And a new report out today suggests
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:10.640]  that it is now so corrupt from top to bottom
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:14.520]  that something like 90% of the trades are fraudulent.
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:17.280]  There is an incentive to the regulators
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:20.120]  as well as to both parties to every transaction
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:23.320]  to maximize the size of the transaction.
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:25.160]  And guess who ends up paying?
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:28.880]  The ordinary little guy paying his electricity bill.
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:31.800]  The pensioner who can't afford to heat her home
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:33.640]  in the winter when it's really cold
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:35.320]  and the windmills aren't turning.
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:39.600]  And she's having to pay these vast levies and subsidies
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:42.360]  to support these loss-making, useless,
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:45.160]  climate irrelevant windmills.
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:47.480]  And we are the only party that opposes that.
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:49.520]  We're the only party that opposes the EU
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:51.040]  and all this carbon trading nonsense.
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:55.560]  We would close down the climate change department,
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:00.240]  now costing $30 billion a year just in the UK.
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.800]  That's before you get into the $92 billion a year
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:07.760]  that the European carbon trading scheme costs
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:09.960]  and all of these massive costs
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:12.360]  are being borne by taxpayers right across Europe.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:14.920]  And of course, Obama would like to do it to you
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:17.960]  in America as well if he could.
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:18.960]  But here in Scotland,
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:22.280]  UKIP is beginning to make itself felt
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:24.800]  because what's happening is that thanks to your program,
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.000]  Alex, a lot of people are getting to hear about it
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.480]  and they are beginning to say to each other,
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:34.040]  isn't it strange that Lord Monkton, who's quite personal,
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:38.600]  who's quite articulate, is not being allowed to broadcast
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:42.120]  on any mainstream medium during an election campaign
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:44.840]  in which his party is one of the largest parties
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:46.360]  in contention.
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:49.520]  Isn't it strange that the media are now so biased
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:53.880]  and so terrified of freedom, so terrified of the truth
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:57.280]  that they won't let me anywhere near a microphone
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:58.560]  or a television camera.
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:01.120]  It is quite startling and a lot of people are commenting
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:02.120]  about it and they're beginning to say,
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:05.640]  well, look, this really is the end of freedom
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:08.720]  if people with different views
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:10.840]  from the current political establishment.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:13.000]  That happened to be very, very popular.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.320]  I don't know about those views at all.
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:17.440]  By the way, your views are very, very popular.
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:20.360]  I've seen the polls where upwards of 80% of Brits
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:22.400]  don't want the EU to take them over.
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:23.920]  You've never been given a vote.
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:26.600]  I see the other polls where most Brits
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:31.160]  are against the carbon taxes, same thing with the Scots.
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:35.320]  Most of the people in Ireland didn't want to be part
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:38.320]  of the EU until they brought the vote back up
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:40.840]  over and over again with big PR campaigns.
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:43.840]  The truth is, your ideas are popular.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.120]  Your ideas are good.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:48.040]  I was talking to Paul Watson, who lives in England
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:51.040]  and writes for us at prisonplanet.com.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.720]  And I said, and he made the point, he said,
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:57.440]  well, I'm not into this whole royal thing.
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:01.920]  But he said, the point that Moncton makes, Lord Moncton,
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.920]  that you're not even allowed to have the UK flag,
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:09.800]  much less an English flag, that literally,
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:12.640]  you can only put it out during a royal wedding,
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:15.800]  or your neighbors think you're racist and the media says
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:19.480]  that even having your national flag out is evil
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:22.600]  and that shows how the system wants to debilitate
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:24.840]  national sovereignty.
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:27.160]  And so I can see why you were saying
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:31.040]  it's nice to see the flag out there
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:36.040]  because this system is so anti-national sovereignty.
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:38.280]  I mean, Watson doesn't lie.
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:41.000]  Have you, can you speak to that,
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.360]  that things are so politically correct
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:47.080]  that it might upset one of the foreigners on welfare
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:51.080]  if they see the national flag,
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:52.800]  or God forbid, the English flag?
[02:43:53.880 --> 02:43:56.240]  Well, certainly you see national flags
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:43:58.800]  much less often than you used to.
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:03.200]  And the EU actually had a scheme where if it pays
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:07.520]  some of our money back to us by way of an EU subsidy,
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.520]  say for a windmill or whatever,
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.800]  you have to fly the EU flag and no other flag
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:15.400]  on or near that project.
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:19.600]  But if you fly your own flag instead, they can find you.
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:23.000]  They can impose financial penalties on Britain
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.320]  for flying its own flag and not flying the EU flag.
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:27.680]  It is mad.
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:29.440]  And of course, Alex, you're quite right.
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:31.560]  They don't like national sovereignty.
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:32.400]  For why?
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:36.480]  Because national sovereignty is the guarantee of freedom.
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:40.640]  That's how we stay free because we have nations
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:42.320]  whose governments we elect,
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:44.080]  or at least that's how it used to work.
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.120]  It still doesn't America up to a point.
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.920]  It doesn't work at all here in the UK.
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:50.720]  We have elections, we have more elections
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:52.080]  than we ever had before,
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:54.560]  but we're electing people who are powerless.
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:57.360]  We elect people to the European Parliament.
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:00.520]  The next one of those comes up in three years time.
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:03.560]  And the European Parliament cannot even bring forward
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:05.520]  a bill, it can't propose legislation.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:08.200]  We have elections for the Scottish Parliament.
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:11.960]  And 83% of the bills that it brings forward,
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:14.920]  it only brings forward because the unelected commissars
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:18.000]  of the European Union meeting in secret
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:21.720]  behind closed doors have issued a directive,
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:23.200]  which the Scotland's Parliament,
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:25.320]  just like the Westminster Parliament,
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:30.320]  is obliged to pass whether it likes it or not.
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:33.600]  And so we've got this fiction of democracy,
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:35.440]  all the trappings, all the appearances,
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:37.280]  parliament everywhere,
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:41.000]  but none of these parliaments now has any real power.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.640]  The power has passed, not forever, I hope,
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:45.120]  we're trying to get it back,
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:50.120]  from elected hands here to unelected hands somewhere else.
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:54.960]  And the same system is being set up all over the world.
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:58.600]  We have continuity of agenda by the bureaucratic government
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:03.400]  ruling class that's gotten power through fraud and stealth,
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:05.320]  just like the SPP documents talk about
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:07.600]  North American integration by stealth
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:10.400]  that judicial watch student got four years ago,
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.560]  but expanding on the good news,
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:15.440]  the EU trading scheme collapsing,
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:20.440]  the US carbon credit stocks collapsing,
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:22.720]  looks like Bill Clinton, Al Gore,
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:25.640]  and all the rest of these weasels are in deep trouble.
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.600]  I think they are, I think because what has happened
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:31.360]  is that people have now come to realize
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:33.520]  what nonsense all this is.
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:35.560]  I went to some hustings in St Andrews,
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:38.000]  which is a wonderful old cathedral city
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:42.160]  on the coast of Fife just a couple of days ago,
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:43.560]  in a 14th century church,
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.080]  and there were all the candidates,
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:47.880]  including UKIP this time on the platform.
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:50.040]  And I asked all the other candidates,
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:52.880]  I said, right, how many of you think
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:55.240]  that it's worth spending tens of billions
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:46:58.920]  to forestall 150,000th of a Celsius degree
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:02.240]  of temperature of global warming with all these windmills?
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:05.600]  I said, is there any point in doing that at all?
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:07.080]  And we're wrecking our countryside,
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:09.120]  wrecking our tourist industry,
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:10.400]  flinging our people into poverty,
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:11.960]  and soon the lights will be going out
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:13.800]  all over Scotland because these wretched things
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:16.520]  don't produce any electricity when the wind doesn't blow.
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:20.320]  And one after another, they all admitted
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:22.080]  that they'd gone off the idea
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:24.520]  of all this global warming stuff.
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:25.360]  And this was very interesting.
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:27.200]  It was the first time I've seen candidates
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:30.000]  from all major parties saying, yeah,
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.200]  actually the game's up, it's all over,
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:34.560]  bother shouting, we're fed up with this nonsense,
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:36.160]  and we are going to stop it.
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:38.320]  The Scottish National Party,
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:41.360]  which is most likely to end up as the governing party
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:43.520]  here in Scotland after the elections,
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.480]  its candidate came closest to saying he wanted it to carry on
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:50.520]  because their policy is to at least double
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:52.680]  the number of windmills all over the place.
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:56.160]  But even he ended up saying he hoped it wouldn't happen
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:58.840]  because he could see it was simply no use.
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.640]  And I think what is happening is the debate on the climate now
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.480]  is shifting from a science where everybody can see
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:08.800]  that global warming simply isn't happening
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.840]  at the rate they predicted, yes.
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.320]  You know, there's been a little bit of warming
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:14.480]  over the last 100 years,
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:17.640]  but it really isn't enough to write home about.
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:19.440]  It's certainly nothing light enough
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:21.880]  to match the sort of absurd forecast we're getting.
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:23.760]  And the warming has stopped in the last,
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.760]  and the warming has stopped in the last,
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:28.360]  and actually gone down a bit in the last 15 years,
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:31.760]  but this is huge news that more and more of the hoax
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:34.560]  is collapsing even in public.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:36.960]  People are peer pressured into saying,
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:39.800]  oh yes, the green agenda, I wanna hand all my money
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:42.160]  over to communist and to, you know,
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:45.080]  crony capitalist on the inside like Ken Lay
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:47.440]  who thought up the trading scheme with Al Gore
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:48.800]  and 95 on record.
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:51.080]  They're more and more, they're not towing the line,
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:52.880]  they're not buying into the hoax
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:55.600]  because with the population it's dead,
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:58.440]  the corrupt system is losing all credibility
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:48:59.920]  and bleeding to death.
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:02.400]  But that's exactly it.
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:05.240]  Everybody's now pretty much got the point
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:07.240]  that this one has been oversold.
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:09.680]  They thought they could use it
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:12.200]  as an engine to set up a world government.
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:15.040]  They've put the mechanism of that world government
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:18.000]  in place in the Cancun agreement.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.880]  But I think they're going to find it increasingly hard
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:23.040]  to get the member states to pay the money
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:25.960]  they've promised to pay to make this world government happen.
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:28.160]  I think that's how it's gonna be brought to an end.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:31.320]  Gradually, as it becomes more and more apparent
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:33.440]  that the rate of global warming
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:35.600]  is simply wholly insufficient
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.600]  to match the absurd forecast we were getting,
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:40.320]  and it also becomes apparent
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:43.160]  that even if it were warming at that rate,
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:46.000]  our capacity to do anything to stop it warming
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.680]  is just so small you might as well not bother
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:51.760]  and the cost of trying to do it is so excessive
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:53.920]  that you do real harm.
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:55.760]  That's happening, I think what's also happening,
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:57.600]  which is very interesting here in Scotland,
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.400]  which is one of the most communistic countries in the world,
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:03.280]  it's all but the major parties up here,
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:06.200]  the Conservatives, the Labour, the Liberals in the Scotland,
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:09.400]  they're all one variety of communist or another.
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:11.440]  They all believe in central planning,
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:13.200]  central control and so on.
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:16.480]  But even among the working people now,
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:19.800]  there's a growing realization that this climate bulldog
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:21.720]  means above all else financially
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:24.480]  an enormous transfer of wealth,
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.480]  not from the rich to the poor, but the other way round.
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.600]  It's from the working classes to the rich landowners
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:33.360]  who are putting up these windmills
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:35.200]  and collecting massive subsidies for it.
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:37.760]  And the working classes having to pay for this
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:40.920]  through a near doubling over the last five years
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:42.080]  in their electricity bills.
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:44.280]  And the curious thing is that here is UKIP,
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:46.680]  which is often seen as a party of the right.
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:49.960]  And of course, we are in fact a party of the radical centre,
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:53.080]  which is now the only party speaking up for the work...
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:55.600]  Absolutely, stay there.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:57.960]  Stay there, Sir, let's come back and talk about that.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.560]  You've got the bot off left and right,
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:01.320]  it is the radical centre.

[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.640]  The U.S. economy is at a tipping point.
[02:53:03.640 --> 02:53:06.760]  40 cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed.
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:08.720]  The President of the Federal Reserve in Dallas
[02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:10.240]  was recently quoted saying,
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.400]  this path will lead to insolvency,
[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:15.480]  resulting in the collapse of our government and our economy.
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:17.360]  Our country can function like this,
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:18.960]  and neither can your household.
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:20.400]  That's why you need to prepare,
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:22.640]  and priority one is your food supply.

[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:10.560]  Final segment with Lord Christopher Monkton,
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:14.040]  the UK Independence Party, UKIP.org,
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:15.720]  and this fight they're having over in England
[02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:16.920]  is the same one we're having here,
[02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:19.720]  and we're trying to break this electronic media blockade.
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:22.760]  The EU is the heart of the global government dictatorship
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:24.040]  they're trying to set up.
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:28.520]  We've got Dr. Tarpley joining us to break down
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:30.600]  the geopolitical actions against Pakistan.
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:32.800]  I want to put up on screen the Drudge Report.
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:35.040]  All this news is also at infowars.com
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:36.440]  and prisonblinded.com.
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:39.440]  Obama, we don't need to spike the football.
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:41.640]  Top GOP lawmaker, too risky to release
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:43.440]  bin Laden death probe photos.
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:44.520]  Two by the therm in the ocean, huh,
[02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:45.760]  and the Easter Bunny too.
[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:47.960]  Conspiracy theorist will just claim photos,
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:50.200]  doctored anyway, quote from Obama.
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:53.680]  Senator Brown, I've seen the pictures,
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:57.040]  he's definitely dead, you know that's gonna leak.
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:54:58.880]  Boehner, I don't need to see it.
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:01.280]  Yesterday, Panetta said the photo was coming.
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:06.160]  This is just amazing, that's all coming up.
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:08.560]  Lord Monkton, we have more and more healthy skepticism.
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:11.920]  They call it a conspiracy theory whenever,
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:14.280]  you don't believe whatever Pichari said when they,
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:16.560]  so they had all these studies proving the Himalayas
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:18.800]  were melting, turned out it was a photo student
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:20.280]  who had just claimed it.
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:22.400]  It turns out that everything they've said
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:25.840]  upon inspection is just a manifest baloney.
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:31.160]  Are we talking about these guys ever getting in any trouble
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:33.320]  for what they've done or do they just have
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:37.600]  a collection of kangaroo establishment bureaucratic courts
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.120]  that remove any blame from them?
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:44.960]  I think you're certainly right about the removal
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:47.560]  of the blame because we had three inquiries
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:50.360]  in the UK into the Climate Gate Affair
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:52.520]  where tens of thousands of emails
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:57.520]  between the small number of conspirators
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:00.320]  who were really driving this scare
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:04.040]  came to light and became public a couple of years ago.
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:06.920]  And these inquiries were the most extraordinary whitewash.
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.360]  We had one by a fellow called Lord Oxborough
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:13.440]  who turned out to have but didn't declare
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:16.040]  a conflict of interest in that he is in charge
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:18.400]  of one of these green businesses
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.120]  and was making a lot of money out of it.
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:23.440]  And he then was supposed to do
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:26.120]  what was called a scientific assessment panel.
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:27.600]  And he's very short report,
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:29.320]  start out with the immortal words.
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.120]  This scientific assessment panel does not see itself
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.160]  as being a panel whose job is to assess the science
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:37.320]  and they deliberately looked the other way
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:39.800]  at all these ludicrous mistakes and errors
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.480]  and deliberate wrongdoings among the scientists.
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:46.880]  So yes, they're all covering up for each other like mad.
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:50.480]  And as the scare collapses,
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:53.240]  they're getting more and more desperate to cover it up.
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:57.480]  And of course, we do now have at least one attorney general,
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:01.280]  that's in Virginia, who is actually thinking
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:04.600]  of conducting a criminal prosecution
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:08.920]  under the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act of the Year 2000
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:12.480]  in Virginia because of a bogus graph
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:17.480]  that made its way into the 2001 IPCC report.
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:20.760]  And that graph was so bogus
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:23.080]  that the attorney general thought he would investigate.
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:24.360]  And so he said to the university,
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.800]  I want all the documentation to do
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:29.320]  with the production of this graph turned over to us
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:31.520]  so that we can have it independently examined.
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:35.400]  And the university, which had willingly turned over
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:37.600]  material by another of its alumni
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:39.400]  who disagreed with global warming
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:42.440]  when the Greens challenged him, suddenly went all moral.
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:45.280]  I said, well, we can't possibly be handing over data
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:46.640]  from this particular scientist.
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:49.720]  That would constitute a gross breach of academic freedom.
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:51.880]  And they're refusing to hand over the document.
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:56.320]  So yes, the prostitutes now are on the march.
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:57:59.320]  And eventually, I think heads will begin to roll.
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:01.920]  Those who have improperly made millions
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:04.280]  or even billions out of this scam
[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:07.320]  are going to regret that they ever had anything to do with it
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:09.200]  because there's going to be, I'm sure,
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:10.760]  is it going to happen in country after country?
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:12.760]  There are going to be major inquiries
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:14.960]  to find out why it was
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:19.160]  that the more or less the entire governing class worldwide
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:20.520]  decided to go along with this.
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:22.120]  And of course, the reason why they did
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:23.880]  was they were getting rich by it.
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:24.720]  This is a-
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:26.960]  And they're seizing the entire energy in-
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:29.280]  And they're seizing the entire energy infrastructure.
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:30.560]  Well, I hope you have a good showing
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:32.960]  to continue to build the party in Scotland tomorrow.

[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:40.080]  on the Bin Laden hoax coming up.
[02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:45.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.160 --> 02:58:49.600]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:53.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:58:53.320 --> 02:58:55.720]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.720 --> 02:58:57.920]  Number one, new climate legislation
[02:58:57.920 --> 02:59:00.080]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:02.200]  Number two, our new energies are
[02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:03.800]  wants to control how much power
[02:59:03.800 --> 02:59:05.840]  your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:08.720]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:11.480]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.480 --> 02:59:13.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:15.880]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:18.160]  And now, new socialist legislation
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:19.800]  is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.800 --> 02:59:21.480]  Number four, dangerous weather
[02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:23.320]  is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:25.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:27.040]  from weather-related onages.
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.080]  Number five, a solar power generator
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:32.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:59:34.120 --> 02:59:35.640]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:59:35.640 --> 02:59:37.040]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:41.240]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.240 --> 02:59:43.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.240]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[02:59:45.240 --> 02:59:47.200]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:50.840]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:55.680]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.680 --> 02:59:59.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.240 --> 03:00:00.080]  Network.
[03:00:00.080 --> 03:00:02.720]  Dodd Johnson Interim Producer
[03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:01.460]  Mark
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:26.400]  Webster gryphon Tarpley just left a TV studio.
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:27.600]  Dr. Tarp will be joining us
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:32.600]  coming up in the next segment, we have cell phones from the streets of Washington, DC.
[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:37.920]  I already had Lord Moncton set up to talk about the greenies and their seizure, their
[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:39.360]  attempted seizure of the infrastructure.
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:42.840]  So we had him on for that 30 minute respite from the Bin Laden hoax.
[03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:47.840]  Now, a lot of things were being distracted from is the dollar mega plunging stock market
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:54.600]  mega plunging today, Chinese dumping more T bills, more monetization of debt, gas prices
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.000]  exploding.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:02.280]  You notice that he'll Bin Laden and now they're telling you, we're going to even have more
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:03.480]  hands down the pants.
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:06.080]  We're going to have checkpoints on the side of the road.
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:09.920]  In fact, if we have that CBS news piece up, I want to play part of this, you can hear
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:10.920]  it for yourself.
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:16.320]  Oh, there's counter strikes by Al Qaeda and Zarkawi and Goodon all trained in the U.S.,
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:18.200]  all U.S. government on record.
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:19.360]  This is all public.
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:23.320]  They're going to attack us so the government has to stick its hands down your pants and
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:27.360]  now they want to be at all of the shopping malls.
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:34.920]  Now they want to, I mean, here's the headline, security checkpoints near soft targets may
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:35.920]  soon become the norm.
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:37.840]  We'll break down all the Bin Laden stuff.
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:41.960]  It's totally disintegrating when we come back from this quick break, but counter terrorism
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:46.120]  experts say the retaliation attack with some of Bin Laden's death is inevitable.
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:50.000]  And the news is saying nuke attacks are inevitable, AP last week.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:54.600]  Experts are expected to aim for more vulnerable soft targets like shopping malls and museums.
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:55.600]  See how this works?
[03:01:55.600 --> 03:01:56.600]  Oh, the airports.
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:01:58.120]  We got to turn those into a prison.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:03.760]  Oh, now the schools, the colleges, oh, the Walmart, oh, the highway.
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:06.680]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:08.800]  And then Al Qaeda might try to hit a farmhouse.
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:14.240]  We've got to search you on the little farm road just randomly and the whole economy shifts
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:20.320]  and the millions intelligence contractors and the, I mean, it's their business.
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:23.640]  The military industrial complex owned by the big banks is eating America.
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:27.560]  Do we have that CBS clip?
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:28.840]  I'll take that as a yes.
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:30.280]  We'll go ahead and play a clip of this.
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:32.040]  Here it is.
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:37.960]  Terrorism experts say a retaliation attack for Osama Bin Laden's death is inevitable.
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:43.520]  Terrorists are expected to aim for more vulnerable soft targets like shopping malls, even museums.
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:47.080]  CBS2's Hazel Sanchez reports.
[03:02:47.080 --> 03:02:51.400]  They are places jam-packed with people, pedestrian malls, shopping centers and stadiums.
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:56.680]  Yeah, I feel safe, but of course in the back of my head, I know that things can happen.
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:01.040]  Counterterrorism expert Cheval Aviv says terrorists seeking revenge for Osama Bin Laden's
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:06.160]  death will turn to attacks less dramatic than the destruction on September 11th, focusing
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:11.560]  instead on soft targets like hotels, places of worship and mass transit hubs.
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:15.240]  It's easier, less complicated for them to carry out.
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:21.120]  What they're going to achieve if they're successful is to kill as many people as possible.
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:25.200]  Security consultant David Bohm says the future could include security checkpoints entering
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:28.280]  all soft targets, like your local department store.
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:31.280]  Bohm says even with a police presence, the areas are vulnerable.
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:35.760]  The reason they're called to solve this because it's so easily accessible to anyone.
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:39.640]  There has to be security checks for the safety of all people.
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:45.520]  Now, there's the local cops, they're the Israeli security expert.
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:54.520]  They show New York the model troops, Hercules teams, cops in black uniforms with dogs and
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:59.560]  machine guns and they're saying everywhere is going to have security checkpoints.
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:02.960]  You go on a target, you go on a Walmart and this is going to go in everywhere and this
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:04.680]  is going to be the new job.
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:08.480]  This is going to be the new scholarship degree when you go to college.
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:10.800]  This is the new system.
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:13.400]  Remember Obama during his State of the Union this year?
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:21.840]  He said, don't worry, now you're going to be able to ride on these new trains, these
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:27.000]  bullet trains we're going to put up all over the country and you won't get groped by the
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  TSA.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.040]  You won't have to go through the scanners.
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:36.720]  Folks, it's always been their plan to take over all of society and oh, we got bin Laden.
[03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:39.080]  Now what's in New York is going to have to go everywhere.
[03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:43.160]  New York, you're driving down the road, they just randomly set up a checkpoint to search
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:44.160]  people.
[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:48.640]  Training your kids how to be little prisoners and sticking their hands down their pants.
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:52.080]  This is martial law without the name.
[03:04:52.080 --> 03:05:02.960]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[03:05:02.960 --> 03:05:03.960]  Our big story.
[03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:23.760]  Yes, there is a threat of seed shortages due to climatic weather events.

[03:06:05.880 --> 03:06:09.160]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:06:09.160 --> 03:06:13.320]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[03:06:13.320 --> 03:06:14.320]  documents.
[03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:18.760]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:21.240]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:24.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.880]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:26.880 --> 03:06:32.240]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:06:32.240 --> 03:06:34.720]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:39.200]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:40.200]  financial system.
[03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:43.080]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:43.080 --> 03:06:46.800]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:47.960]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:47.960 --> 03:06:49.600]  You're everyone else.
[03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:50.600]  Invisible Empire.

[03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:09.280]  Have you ever wondered if you could make your car run on 100% electric power for free?
[03:07:09.280 --> 03:07:10.280]  It is now possible.
[03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:15.000]  How about a simple device that is both a super efficient motor and a free energy generator
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.520]  at the same time?
[03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:21.720]  What if this could also be used to restore useless batteries and save you lots of money?
[03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:25.400]  Because our customers asked for it, we have organized a Renaissance Charge Conference

[03:07:54.840 --> 03:08:08.040]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:41.200]  My self by name.
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:45.200]  And here's one out of the post Gazette called it's time for conspiracy theorists to shut
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:46.200]  up.
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:50.560]  And I was on national British radio last night and the guy called in, sounded like Psyops,
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:53.520]  and said, you're an extremist, you know, you need to, you know, this stuff's against the
[03:08:53.520 --> 03:08:56.400]  law criticizing the government fables.
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:01.840]  It's time for conspiracy theorists to shut up, says Reg Henry, and he had to be listening
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:02.840]  to the show today.
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:06.080]  This just came out about an hour ago because this is everything I said at the start of
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:12.520]  the first hour that they, they, they covered up Jessica Lynch, had Jerry Bruckheimer produce
[03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:13.520]  it.
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:14.520]  I'm not just saying that.
[03:09:14.520 --> 03:09:16.720]  That was all staged with Jerry Bruckheimer.
[03:09:16.720 --> 03:09:21.080]  And then when the team, the survivors exposed that she cowered and it was all fake and that
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:25.400]  the hospital was already taken by us forces and they did a fake raid on it.
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:29.720]  Five of them were killed very quickly, uh, double tapped in the head and stuff here in
[03:09:29.720 --> 03:09:34.560]  the U S had drowned, uh, murdered, uh, suspiciously dying.
[03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:39.520]  Uh, and, uh, I brought up Pat Tillman and how they murdered him and he says Pat Tillman
[03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:46.640]  was killed by friendly fire, not by hostile fire in the initial Pentagon story.
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:51.080]  But he did leave his professional football career for 9 11 and did die for his country.
[03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:54.840]  He goes on to say, yeah, Jessica Lynch may not have been Rambo woman.
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:56.680]  That's what I called her a few hours ago.
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:10:01.200]  He must have just banged this out, uh, and it says it's time for conspiracy theorists
[03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:03.440]  to shut up.
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:04.560]  And he goes after me.
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:08.040]  We're going to Webster Tarpley, Dr. Tarpley here in a moment, it says, meanwhile, over
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:12.280]  the website of syndicated radio host Alex Jones, stalled info wars.com, because there's
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:19.240]  a war on for your mind, a great froth of conspiracy was brewing sample headline, Osama, Obama
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:24.080]  shamefully exploits bin Laden, fairytale and transparent PR stunt.
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:27.680]  People who have lost their minds in the info war will believe this.
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:32.240]  And he goes on, um, we're going to be breaking all this down at the bottom of the hour after
[03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:37.600]  Dr. Tarpley, uh, leaves us and we go into retransmission and it'll be back to the latest
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:41.200]  live interview with Dr. Steve Pachennick, uh, today.
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:48.640]  But the big news here is that the story has changed more than 20 times now, uh, and there's
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:56.040]  even headlines here out of Atlantic monthly, uh, saying that they're totally losing credibility.
[03:10:56.040 --> 03:11:01.080]  Atlantic monthly, yesterday, Savage doors truly and said I was basically a delusional
[03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:09.000]  fruit cake to Jeff Goldberg, uh, the Israeli guy, uh, but then this continues today, their
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:13.720]  head editor came out and said the slippery slope of the bin Laden kill and basically
[03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:15.800]  said that nobody's buying this.
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:20.440]  And I monitored talk radio last night and today the liberals and conservatives, seven
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:25.280]  out of 10, I was taking notes, called in, none of them are buying at 70%.
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:26.920]  This is a complete route.
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:29.800]  The drudge report is now shifting towards reality, which is fine.
[03:11:29.800 --> 03:11:33.560]  They had to kind of as objective journalists go with what was being said and show both
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:34.560]  sides.
[03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:39.120]  And now Panetta says the photo's coming out, then it's not coming out.
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:42.240]  Obama responds and says, Oh, I'm not going to release a photo.
[03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:44.960]  The conspiracy theorists won't believe it anyways.
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:49.240]  Uh, this is a complete, they put out a fake photo Sunday night in all the major papers
[03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:56.040]  and Monday kind of quietly said, Oh no, it's fake, but I'm sent it.
[03:11:56.040 --> 03:11:59.560]  People that work here are sent it by people that are in their families, military people
[03:11:59.560 --> 03:12:01.400]  saying, No, this is a real photo.
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:03.000]  See that's how psyops work.
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:04.520]  They're targeting weak minded.
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:08.840]  They are still believing the fake one from three days ago is real.
[03:12:08.840 --> 03:12:11.880]  Now they won't release the new fake one.
[03:12:11.880 --> 03:12:15.840]  And we said a month ago, two months ago, repeatedly with Tarpley, they're getting ready to frame
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:18.760]  Pakistan to start a new war with them.
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:20.520]  Three weeks ago they caught the CIA guy.
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:24.320]  They said it wasn't and they had to admit it was trying to give uranium to some of their
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:27.320]  operatives to the blame on the Pakistani government.
[03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:33.200]  I mean, the setup is on and Tarpley really called it months ago with Saudi Arabia running
[03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:38.680]  for support with the nuclear powered Pakistan, general ghoul, former head of Pakistani intelligence,
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:44.440]  former head of the Taliban, Mujahideen confirmed what Tarpley saying, Steve Pachennik, super
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:51.800]  high powered in the system, one of the top black op, psyop people of the modern age totally
[03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:54.480]  agrees it's all staged.
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:58.680]  And so we're now learning nothing we were told was basically true.
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:12:59.680]  Well, no kidding.
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:03.640]  A lot of them was dead a long time ago of kidney failure from the good sources we have
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:05.320]  and we're on record saying that.
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:08.280]  Webster Tarpley, what is happening here?
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:10.800]  A, what was the point of the psyop?
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:13.120]  B, how is the psyop going?
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:18.200]  You concur that it is turning into a complete blow up in the face route of the system?
[03:13:18.200 --> 03:13:24.960]  Well, I certainly think that the contradictions and the clowning and bungling of the Obama
[03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:30.200]  White House has helped a lot of people to see that this was a manufactured story.
[03:13:30.200 --> 03:13:36.000]  We have to remember that this pseudo bin Laden, right, we're talking about the alleged death
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:41.560]  of a pseudo bin Laden because we know nothing is nothing is substantiated, nothing proven
[03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:42.560]  in this.
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:45.720]  But that is simple, that's the life of bin Laden.
[03:13:45.720 --> 03:13:50.320]  He died as he lived in the sense never anything proven about him.
[03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:56.880]  He's told me all the things you think you know about him, be it the 9-11 stuff, the
[03:13:56.880 --> 03:14:02.840]  hijackers, all the rest of this stuff, these are simply assertions of the FBI at the time.
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:08.720]  And if you go back to the famous speech of FBI Director Mueller in the Cosmos Club of,
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:16.040]  I'm sorry, the Cosmopolitan Club, the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco in 2002, he said that
[03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:21.560]  in all running around in Afghanistan that the U.S. had done, not one scrap of evidence
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:27.160]  had ever come to the surface connecting anything in Afghanistan to 9-11.
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:31.320]  So this is simply an exercise in mass brainwashing.
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:36.560]  Now, we used to think that the neocons were the greatest liars of the age, but they have
[03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:40.800]  now been eclipsed by Obama and his soft power group.
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:46.020]  And what is I think disturbing is a lot of the left-wing elites, the people who used
[03:14:46.020 --> 03:14:52.080]  to be peacenicks when it was a question of Bush and Cheney at war, have now become war-mongers.
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:57.720]  And you're seeing the entire left liberal community going, as I had feared, three years
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:03.840]  ago from being opponents of military adventurism to becoming the leading edge with the bloodthirsty
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:04.840]  rhetoric.
[03:15:04.840 --> 03:15:08.880]  Now, the timing, I think, has everything to do with what you've just mentioned.
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:16.920]  The attempt by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to join together and make a joint escape or jailbreak
[03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:22.480]  from the U.S.-British world empire, it seems to me, is the reason for this.
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:28.600]  Remember, they have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in building up bin Laden as a figure
[03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:33.200]  to disorient and confuse people in the Arab and Islamic world.
[03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:37.440]  They don't liquidate this from one day to the next for no reason.
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:39.680]  So it's an extreme situation, a desperate situation.
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:45.600]  They've actually tried to manufacture in the last 15 years their own opposition.
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:52.600]  Now, notice the new four leaders of al-Qaeda, three of them are admittedly born in the U.S.,
[03:15:52.600 --> 03:15:56.080]  and two of them you can 100% prove work for Western intelligence.
[03:15:56.080 --> 03:16:00.200]  I mean, this is getting so cartoonish, Webster.
[03:16:00.200 --> 03:16:07.080]  Well, you have, I guess it comes down now to a fight between Awlaki, Anwar Awlaki of
[03:16:07.080 --> 03:16:14.560]  New Mexico, known in the trade as Awlaki the CIA lackey, versus Aiman Zawahiri of MI6.
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:22.120]  So we've got a CIA candidate and an MI6 candidate, and nothing good to be expected from it.
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:26.720]  It's clear that bin Laden, the biological bin Laden, has been dead for a long time.
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:32.320]  What you've had in the meantime is a kind of theater company puts out audio tapes, videotapes.
[03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:36.040]  The doubles that they use have not been very consistent.
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:42.120]  They've had a fat bin Laden, a thin bin Laden, an angry bin Laden, a jovial bin Laden.
[03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:45.200]  We've had old recut tapes of when he was alive.
[03:16:45.200 --> 03:16:51.720]  The CIA has admitted May 25, 2010, spy talk, Washington Post, that yeah, we made some
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:58.120]  fake videos, trying to basically put that out the back door in case it ever comes out
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:01.120]  in a big way later.
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:05.520]  Also the reelection launch bid, but Webster, I want to continue why they're doing this,
[03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:12.800]  why they're going after Pakistan right now, but first before we get into more detail there,
[03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:16.840]  how is it going, studying what's happening with them?
[03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:21.160]  How is this going for the power structure right now?
[03:17:21.160 --> 03:17:26.800]  Well, obviously there's a lot of international attention to the bungling side of it, but
[03:17:26.800 --> 03:17:32.080]  in terms of the overall judgment, this is not clear because we have to remember that
[03:17:32.080 --> 03:17:37.880]  the main problem now is that the danger of the false flag terror attack attributed to
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:38.880]  this.
[03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:43.280]  As we went into the weekend, or at the middle of the weekend, by Saturday night, that the
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:49.440]  danger was a false flag terror attack attributed to Libya, pinned on Libya in the wake of the
[03:17:49.440 --> 03:17:55.200]  attempt to assassinate Gaddafi, and indeed the assassination of his son and three grandchildren
[03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:57.000]  and little kids.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:05.360]  Now as of Sunday, the main danger shifts to a false flag terror attack, possibly attributed
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:11.920]  to al-Qaeda, but you also have CIA spokesmen, informal ones, coming forward to say there
[03:18:11.920 --> 03:18:18.040]  will be a new terror attack, we would say a false flag event, with the attempt to attribute
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:25.960]  this to the inter-services intelligence service of Pakistan, the Pakistani version of the
[03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:27.160]  CIA.
[03:18:27.160 --> 03:18:32.960]  So I think right now it's maximum alert, and remember the key to all this is when drills
[03:18:32.960 --> 03:18:40.800]  go live, when exercises are flipped live and taken live, this is when these tragic events
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:41.800]  occur.
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:47.080]  The build-up, and we got to Pakistan, there was a very harsh statement by the United States
[03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:52.560]  in one of these terror reports about four to five weeks ago, about the time that Bandar
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:54.800]  went to Islamabad.
[03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:59.680]  We then had this Ray Davis case, which you point out, with a lot of accusations being
[03:18:59.680 --> 03:19:05.440]  made in the Pakistani media about possible activities as a terror controller, and possible
[03:19:05.440 --> 03:19:10.800]  involvement in the attempt to create a radiological dirty bomb, let's think about that, because
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:13.480]  that may be the template that's going to be used.
[03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:19.120]  Then they say we've got to go in and have war and take the nukes away from Pakistan,
[03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:24.080]  but expanding on that, first they said Davis wasn't CIA, later they had to admit he is
[03:19:24.080 --> 03:19:25.080]  CIA.
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:30.040]  So just this continued wall of deception, and the system is losing all credibility as
[03:19:30.040 --> 03:19:31.040]  they're caught in more lives.
[03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:34.600]  Certainly on the international level, this is for sure.
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:40.920]  We also then had this question of Admiral Mullen going to Pakistan and saying you guys
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:46.080]  work with the Pakistani network, you're no good, and then we had WikiLeaks, the famous
[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:50.920]  CIA limited hangout operation, putting out all this stuff about how the center of gravity
[03:19:50.920 --> 03:19:56.440]  of al-Qaeda is really in Pakistan, so WikiLeaks doing its job for the CIA wants to know.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:20:00.640]  Absolutely, stay there Webster, I want to break down this looming maximum alert false
[03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:01.640]  flag.
[03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:05.480]  Concerned about radioactive fallout, the number one way by which your body protects itself
[03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:08.680]  from radiation or any other free radical is with glutathione.
[03:20:08.680 --> 03:20:11.960]  Glutathione is the most ubiquitous antioxidant in the body.
[03:20:11.960 --> 03:20:15.960]  The number one mechanism for removing toxic elements from the body is glutathione.
[03:20:15.960 --> 03:20:19.760]  In order for your body to make optimal levels of glutathione, it needs an abundance of the
[03:20:19.760 --> 03:20:21.520]  amino acid cysteine.
[03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:26.880]  The highest dietary source of cysteine is non-denatured whey protein powder from grass
[03:20:26.880 --> 03:20:27.880]  fed cows.
[03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:32.280]  The most non-denatured whey protein powder on the market is One World Way.
[03:20:32.280 --> 03:20:35.880]  One World Way is an industry first with its true cool process.
[03:20:35.880 --> 03:20:39.320]  It retains all the active components of fresh raw whey.
[03:20:39.320 --> 03:20:43.800]  One World Way is rich in immune, bodybuilding, and detoxification factors that make it a
[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:46.400]  life-giving power food for everyone.
[03:20:46.400 --> 03:20:51.040]  One World Way is sweetened with cold processed stevia and comes in three delicious flavors.

[03:23:05.400 --> 03:23:08.160]  and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:10.560]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[03:23:10.560 --> 03:23:12.920]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct.
[03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:17.440]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[03:23:17.440 --> 03:23:19.200]  You must act automatically.
[03:23:19.200 --> 03:23:22.640]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:25.480]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[03:23:25.480 --> 03:23:29.880]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:33.800]  to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:38.960]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit with serious supplies and real food to secure
[03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:40.760]  two adults for five days.
[03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:47.960]  This powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from E-Foods
[03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:48.960]  Direct.
[03:23:48.960 --> 03:23:54.800]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash alex or call 800-409-5633.
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:24:20.360]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this is not some fancy of radio that we're here.
[03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:22.040]  Ooh, the maximum alert is here.
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:24.920]  I totally agree with Webster Tarpley.
[03:24:24.920 --> 03:24:29.120]  This weekend, Tarpley was here during the week, but this weekend we had another person
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:32.320]  here in town to be interviewed for a film, and we were all in there eating barbecue.
[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:37.000]  And I said, I feel the greatest disturbance in my gut I've ever felt.
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:41.200]  And I told my wife, I told people in the office, I said, I think it's war.
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:47.520]  And obviously you study intellectual information, and then basically your subconscious analyzes
[03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:52.160]  it and is more powerful than your consciousness and tells you, man, this is bad.
[03:24:52.160 --> 03:24:55.360]  But I was able from the chatter pre-9-11 to predict that they would blow up the World
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:57.760]  Trade Centers and blame it on their CIS at Bin Laden.
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:24:59.080]  Because I saw the pre-programming.
[03:24:59.080 --> 03:25:00.880]  It was very obvious.
[03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:04.200]  They are in CBS News everywhere.
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:09.800]  They put out news the last month that Al Qaeda's got nukes buried, WikiLeaks, that they're
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:13.320]  going to detonate nukes in Europe and the U.S. if he's killed.
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:15.400]  That comes out right before, I mean, come on.
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:17.280]  Folks, it's the scripting.
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:19.320]  It's like watching a bad drama.
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:22.280]  It's so fake.
[03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:24.840]  And you can just see it all happening.
[03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:29.040]  So when Webster Tarpley's telling you this, they're already hyping.
[03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:32.160]  And notice the circular logic.
[03:25:32.160 --> 03:25:34.280]  We go to the Middle East, Bin Laden attacks us.
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:35.560]  We have a 10-year war.
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:39.920]  It's actually several trillion that have been spent, hundreds of millions domestically.
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:42.160]  Every year, it's not hundreds of millions.
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:45.080]  It's in the trillions now overall in the aggregate.
[03:25:45.080 --> 03:25:51.040]  And the circular logic is now we kill him, and now here's the new four Bin Ladens.
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:55.920]  You cut one head of the snake, four more, and on record, a whole bunch of them are globalist.
[03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:58.800]  I mean, on record, at the Pentagon.
[03:25:58.800 --> 03:26:02.560]  And now we're going to kill them, and then there'll be even more terror attacks, and
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:04.200]  it just never ends.
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:08.920]  And Webster, they're on CBS News, you name it, saying now there are going to be checkpoints
[03:26:08.920 --> 03:26:11.400]  at all the malls, grocery stores.
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:12.600]  Everyone will have to be searched.
[03:26:12.600 --> 03:26:16.040]  I mean, this is, again, to heighten the paranoia, Webster.
[03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:23.400]  Well, we have now a situation where the U.S.-British imperialism, it doesn't really have an enemy
[03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:27.080]  image, and this, of course, is something they always want to have.
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:31.600]  For quite a while, it was the Soviet Union and World Communism and the Warsaw Pact, or
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:32.600]  maybe Red China.
[03:26:32.600 --> 03:26:36.760]  Then it became, of course, Bin Laden and terrorism.
[03:26:36.760 --> 03:26:40.200]  So they have to attack us again to introduce the new Bin Laden.
[03:26:40.200 --> 03:26:47.040]  Yeah, some new enemy image has to be fabricated fairly quickly, given especially the tremendous
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:49.840]  economic and social crisis in this country.
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:57.520]  I'm interested to hear what you say, Alex, because my feeling is Sarajevo, 22nd of June
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:27:04.880]  1914, right, this assassination of an Austrian Archduke by Serbs egged on by the British
[03:27:04.880 --> 03:27:07.000]  and some French.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:12.800]  And then five weeks later, you have the outbreak of World War I, the catastrophe.
[03:27:12.800 --> 03:27:18.240]  And in that period of five to six weeks, people write that they were living in a trance,
[03:27:18.240 --> 03:27:22.720]  they were in a dream world, they thought that the problem had been solved, they didn't
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:27.440]  think that there would be any general war, and precisely when they were most in the land
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:33.680]  of dreams and la-la land, that's when the mobilization started and the war became a
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:34.680]  foregone conclusion.
[03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:40.200]  I think we're, I think right now, I think right now, we're probably going to, right
[03:27:40.200 --> 03:27:43.160]  now, if people don't get the word out and tell, we're probably going to have World
[03:27:43.160 --> 03:27:44.160]  War III.
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:48.000]  And I want to come back briefly or start now, how that's going to unfold, obviously.
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:51.960]  They strike Pakistan, claiming they're trying to get the nukes.
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:55.080]  They're now framing Pakistan, as you said, Moscow, they would do, claiming they're working
[03:27:55.080 --> 03:27:57.480]  with Al Qaeda.
[03:27:57.480 --> 03:28:03.440]  And then the Chinese get involved, the Indians come in, and the Middle East blows up even
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:06.040]  more, right as the dollar's plunging.
[03:28:06.040 --> 03:28:10.840]  I mean, you can see all the classic ingredients, as you've said, when the dollar starts going
[03:28:10.840 --> 03:28:15.880]  down, they start a war, and then they're going to blow up a bunch of stuff domestically,
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:19.720]  crack down on the media and say, we've got to arrest people that say the government's
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:24.280]  doing it, and pull the plug on the web, the internet kill switch, and then all the good
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:26.720]  old boys will be worshiping Obama, and that's it.
[03:28:26.720 --> 03:28:30.880]  The bankers win, and we're all enslaved, and the FEMA camps are opened up.
[03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:39.040]  This is the moment when something like a general strike would normally come to mind as perhaps
[03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:45.920]  the only adequate response, in other words, a mass movement against the possibility of
[03:28:45.920 --> 03:28:46.920]  imminent war.
[03:28:46.920 --> 03:28:52.000]  The problem we have right now is that the left liberal opposition, the main forces of
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:57.840]  the peace movement that were deployed against Bush and Cheney up until 2007 or so, have
[03:28:57.840 --> 03:29:03.480]  now switched over into the war monger camp, and if you watch the programs on MSNBC, if
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:09.400]  you watch the foundation-funded leftists who were such great enemies of Bush and Cheney,
[03:29:09.400 --> 03:29:12.360]  they are now bloodthirsty war mongers.
[03:29:12.360 --> 03:29:17.560]  They're calling for essentially attacks on Pakistan, or they're setting the stage for
[03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:21.080]  that, and we should remember Pakistan is a huge country.
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:24.000]  It's almost 200,000 people.
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:28.720]  There are nuclear weapons, and it just so happens that the supply line for the U.S.
[03:29:28.720 --> 03:29:34.680]  forces in Afghanistan goes across Pakistan from the port of Karachi up through Pakistan
[03:29:34.680 --> 03:29:36.800]  across the Khyber Pass.
[03:29:36.800 --> 03:29:38.280]  That is the supply line.
[03:29:38.280 --> 03:29:39.880]  Let's talk about the timeframe.
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:44.400]  I mean, is this a bluff to get the Saudis to go back and grovel to the Anglo-American
[03:29:44.400 --> 03:29:45.400]  establishment?
[03:29:45.400 --> 03:29:46.480]  How's it going to end?
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:48.320]  How could World War III start?
[03:29:48.320 --> 03:29:49.960]  Where do you think they'll launch their false flag?
[03:29:49.960 --> 03:29:51.800]  Is he just to love them?
[03:29:51.800 --> 03:29:55.520]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.520 --> 03:30:25.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:49.360]  It's

[03:32:05.540 --> 03:32:17.040]  Concerned about nuclear contamination? You're not alone. If you understand the risk of today's food being contaminated from nuclear fallout, you would not only trust wild food for survival, you'd count on it.
[03:32:17.040 --> 03:32:27.840]  Wild food is the most prolific, fastest growing food available. It's fresh, because it doesn't sit in the field for 8-10 weeks being fertilized or sprayed with pesticides, accumulating radiation.
[03:32:27.840 --> 03:32:37.740]  And wild food is not genetically altered. Ounce for out, wild food has more nutrition and less harmful elements than any animal or commercial, agriculturally grown food.
[03:32:37.740 --> 03:32:49.340]  It can detoxify the body, and the best part, wild food is free for the taking. Let author Linda Runyon show you how to identify, harvest, prepare, eat, and store wild food.

[03:33:13.340 --> 03:33:28.840]  You know, I don't want to get into a distraction here about media events that I've been part of. We're not playing most of the TV interviews here, I've done in the last few days.
[03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:42.640]  But one in particular, and we'll get the whole thing up on infowars.com, I'll have one of my great webmasters out there, post this Alex Jones and Osama video, but we're about to play it for the radio listeners and TV viewers.
[03:33:42.640 --> 03:33:50.640]  At prisonplanet.tv here in a moment, but we'll also get it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, just post the whole thing. It's short.
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:34:02.640]  And it says that the interview is disastrous. Hartman is totally outmatched and unable to lead Jones down the path he carves out and get him to criticize anything from a partisan perspective.
[03:34:02.640 --> 03:34:14.640]  Because they want to make it, oh, Republicans don't believe the Ben Laden hoax to then get Democrats tribally in identity think to go, oh, we now believe the hoax.
[03:34:14.640 --> 03:34:22.640]  We now identify with the war like that Renna mob of mindless patsies, the flash mob out there that could hardly talk.
[03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:32.640]  We've got the video on the website saying that we love, oh, we'll kill Saddam. We killed Saddam. They're like, look, Radowski's like it's Ben Laden, him too.
[03:34:32.640 --> 03:34:48.640]  I mean, it is just idiocy. They're trying to get them like baby chicks or baby geese, Gosling's to identify because when a chick hatches out or Gosling, they'll identify with someone in a goblin outfit with a red ball.
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:57.640]  They see first a dog, a person and follow you around and worship you. So they're like, you know, oh, the war torture, secret arrest, World War three is coming.
[03:34:57.640 --> 03:35:04.640]  You're going to get drafted. We're setting up FEMA camps, little, little Gosling's. Look, you love Obama. You've put your identity into him.
[03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:14.640]  You feel like he's getting beat up right now. Well, guess what torture and secret arrest and World War three are kind of sexy and the Gosling's are, you know, chirp, chirp, chirp like a bunch of idiots.
[03:35:14.640 --> 03:35:22.640]  And they did not like it that I was leading the Gosling's, you know, to reality and to, you know, grow up and not be slaves.
[03:35:22.640 --> 03:35:32.640]  And, you know, to actually, well, you see my point, Webster, and this Hartman guy melted down just throwing Psyop distractions in.
[03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:37.640]  And I called him. I said, it's a Psyop and he got this look on his face because they're following a handbook.
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:44.640]  And then I was on Inside Edition today. It was the same handbook. I mean, these guys, I mean, these guys are really revealing themselves.
[03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:49.640]  And we're having that moment where the facade is just falling everywhere, Webster.
[03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:58.640]  But, you know, why people instinctively know World War three is about to happen. Depression, folks, if we don't get the word out on these people, it's over.
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:04.640]  And then where will the chicken neck Hartman be? Hartman, do you really want to help the globalist launch World War three?
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:07.640]  Tarpley, what's your view? Good question, Alex.
[03:36:07.640 --> 03:36:16.640]  Remember, the left liberals always believed in and needed the 9-11 myth even more than Bush and Cheney.
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:23.640]  Bush and Cheney were, of course, they built their house on 9-11, and the myth of Bin Laden as the enemy image.
[03:36:23.640 --> 03:36:29.640]  But before Togong, they shifted off. They had Saddam Hussein. They had Iraq. They had all sorts of other things.
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:37.640]  Whereas the left liberals stuck with the myth about 9-11. And this is the roots of what we see with Obama, right?
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:44.640]  That Iraq was the bad war and the mistaken war. But Afghanistan, of course, was the good war that had to be escalated.
[03:36:44.640 --> 03:36:55.640]  And that's, of course, what he's been doing. And it's clear to us that the real purpose of the Afghan war is to attack Pakistan, to export the Afghan Civil War into Pakistan.
[03:36:55.640 --> 03:37:06.640]  Also, for a deeper reason, that the left liberal wanted to believe that this group of Arab terrorists had been able to bring the United States to its knees,
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:12.640]  because this was the blowback thesis. They wanted to believe in the blowback thesis, which is a way of saying...
[03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:19.640]  And America deserved it. That was the Lord Churchill tribe about the 3,000 that died were little Eichmans.
[03:37:19.640 --> 03:37:24.640]  Those little kids visiting mommy, the secretary, they deserved it.
[03:37:24.640 --> 03:37:32.640]  Exactly. So there's a deep emotional need to believe in the myth, because the idea is that just punishment was needed out to the United States on 9-11.
[03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:41.640]  This, of course, absolute baloney. There is no collective guilt. This was done by a network. The American people do not bear the collective guilt for this in any way.
[03:37:41.640 --> 03:37:48.640]  And, of course, the irony with bin Laden is that how many battles did he fight after his death, right?
[03:37:48.640 --> 03:37:56.640]  The best guess is that he died somewhere between 2001 and 2002. This is what the Pakistani government has said.
[03:37:56.640 --> 03:38:01.640]  It's been announced by FBI officials and others in these little red press things.
[03:38:01.640 --> 03:38:08.640]  Who was the British main minister, Robin Page? A week after he went public, he had the heart attack and died. Correct? That's the name on him.
[03:38:08.640 --> 03:38:18.640]  Actually, I had his statements printed out yesterday and then lost them and I can't keep all the names straight. We also had Sybil Edmonds.
[03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:29.640]  We had Benazir Budo, the president. She said it. They killed her. I mean, they kill major government people when they touch this myth because they had a special narrative to unwind later.
[03:38:29.640 --> 03:38:40.640]  Well, unfortunately, it just doesn't add up. You have to be very gullible to believe the greatest liars of the age when they come with another one after all the ones you've mentioned.
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:49.640]  Remember the Spanish hero and he played in the movies by Charlton Heston? The guy who fights his last battle when he's already dead? They strap him into a horse?
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:52.640]  Yeah, he's been shot in the chest with an arrow. Excellent movie.
[03:38:52.640 --> 03:39:02.640]  It looks like, of course, that was a couple of days at most after the actual death, but Ben Laden is still fighting battles nine or ten years after his alleged great feat.
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:12.640]  But of course, it's all a tissue of lies and I would tell people, don't get involved in the internal contradictions of this because it's all invented from beginning to end.
[03:39:12.640 --> 03:39:28.640]  Exactly. They add all the admitted many lies and stories to make you accept the larger system. Oh, it's only these lies, fog of war, instead of the whole thing being a ridiculous cornucopia of baloney.
[03:39:28.640 --> 03:39:43.640]  But the entire method of the, I guess it's the Hamilton, the Cain Hamilton Commission, right, the National 9-11 Commission, their method was simply to assume what they were supposed to prove.
[03:39:43.640 --> 03:39:50.640]  In other words, they started from the idea that Ben Laden and Al Qaeda did it and then they took it from there.
[03:39:50.640 --> 03:39:58.640]  Webster, I've got to stop you. Bottom line, we'll get you back up either in the next few days or next week as this develops.
[03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:08.640]  They're saying it's a certainty we're going to be hit, nukes. Are the globalists capable of even setting off a nuke? Where do you expect them to hit? What's the time frame?
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:17.640]  Do we call Congress, as I did in July of 2001, and say, don't stage the false flag? Do we call the White House right now?
[03:40:17.640 --> 03:40:30.640]  I think it's important, as you say, to spread the word in any possible way to inoculate people that if a false flag takes place, especially if it's attributed to Pakistan, the ISI, or any of the other factors that might be brought in,
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:40.640]  that this is axiomatically not to be believed. In other words, it's time to stop being gullible, or we will all have a hard time continuing to exist.
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:54.640]  But remember, what they're responding to is a tectonic shift in the world that all of these countries, from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan, are interested in realigning with Russia, with China, with all kinds of other countries.
[03:40:54.640 --> 03:41:00.640]  And this is now a general jailbreak going on out in the world of which we hear almost nothing in the media.
[03:41:00.640 --> 03:41:12.640]  Webster, I've got to stop you again because we've got to go to this video, but I just want to say this. Of everybody we've interviewed, you have been the most accurate, frighteningly so.
[03:41:12.640 --> 03:41:24.640]  I mean, two, three months, it was longer than that. You said, watch Pakistan. It's next. They're going to try to blame them for terror. You broke down that they would try to connect things through these networks.
[03:41:24.640 --> 03:41:33.640]  You said Alaki, I remember, eight years ago with CIA, now it's admitted, and you've really had your finger on the pulse, and that's what's so frightening is.
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:54.640]  Gull agrees with you. Hamid Gull, General Gull, Steve Pachinik, Dr. Pachinik, I mean, and you can see them saying, oh, Pakistan's got a lot of explaining to do. I mean, you can really see, as the Rand Corporation said two years ago, they want a new world war, and it's on.
[03:41:54.640 --> 03:42:11.640]  I mean, it's on like Donkey Kong as the kids properly have said in the last decade, the kids won't get to be an old man here, folks, the youngins. I do sound like my grandpa now, but the point is, is that it is on.
[03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:25.640]  I mean, it is coming down, and I'm not, folks, I'm begging the listeners, people in government, media. I mean, a lot of times I'll be talking to these reporters when they're, and I say, look, this isn't funny.
[03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:39.640]  Come on, you know they lie. You understand how dangerous this is? We are at a historic crossroads, and if you can't feel it in your gut or even see it intellectually, when it all comes down, remember I told you again.
[03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:48.640]  Now, I'm going to tell you right now, they're fully capable of vaporizing the Sears Tower with a low yield nuclear device, okay?
[03:42:48.640 --> 03:43:02.640]  Oh, just like 9-11, I told you what they were going to hit. Okay, I can see into their eyes, I can see into their soul, I can study them, I know the enemy, and as you know yourself, I can see them bombing the Eiffel Tower.
[03:43:02.640 --> 03:43:17.640]  I can, the unholy hell is being prepared, okay? They are about to launch what's going to trigger World War III, and then they've got their bunkers, everything built, they've got their secret police grids, they've been running around to every professional in the country,
[03:43:17.640 --> 03:43:28.640]  including my dad, other dentists he knows, saying, well, you spy on people for us, they've set up the grid, they're announcing on the news that TSA people are going to be sticking their hands down your pants now at the mall.
[03:43:28.640 --> 03:43:38.640]  This is martial law. This is red dawn. They are the terrorists. They are the foreign bankers that did this. Get it, folks. This is real. We were right. We know what we're talking about.
[03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:46.640]  Webster Tarpley, it's time to come to Jesus. It's time for folks to have that moment. It's time for them to wake up your final comments.
[03:43:46.640 --> 03:44:01.640]  Well, my advice, as always, get active or get radioactive. Remember, the old Italian proverb says, lies have short legs. They don't last long. And you can't reorganize world affairs around a tissue of lies.
[03:44:01.640 --> 03:44:17.640]  So I recommend people that get busy and get the truth out and don't fall for these crazy stories. Don't be stampeded. That's what President Eisenhower said in the wake of the Kennedy assassination. Don't be stampeded. That's good advice right now.
[03:44:17.640 --> 03:44:33.640]  Well, you said it, but they are. Lies do have short legs, like a wiener dog. But at the end of the day, they only need to carry us so far in our hype. America, USA, USA. Boom, we get hit. America was hit after getting bin Laden.
[03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:48.640]  That's when the tactical nukes hit Islamabad. I mean, you can see the script and Obama up there at the photo on the good old boys going, I like Obama now. And it's the Blitz syndrome where when we get bomb, we get angry.
[03:44:48.640 --> 03:44:53.640]  And it's all sleight of hand so they can finish destroying the country.
[03:44:53.640 --> 03:45:11.640]  One other thing though, there may be countervailing forces within the United States government. In other words, the network that wants this apocalyptic event that we seem to be seeing in front of us, they may not have the entire say, there may be some other faction that says,
[03:45:11.640 --> 03:45:26.640]  well, we'd rather not be involved in the thermonuclear confrontation with Russia and China and everything else that this would mean. We'd rather pull back from the brink and take some other approach. Don't exclude that possibility, because I think it's real.
[03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:42.640]  What do you think Steve Pacinac, who is a former, you know, Black Ops, Psy Ops, Dean, and he's the Jack Ryan character on record, helps write Clancy's books, worked for Kissinger, all the other big king makers, Baker.
[03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:54.640]  Why do you think he would come on my show, contact, I think I contacted or he contacted me. He contacted me in 2002 saying he died of renal failure. They're going to roll him out later than Albright came out and confirmed that.
[03:45:54.640 --> 03:46:08.640]  Now he comes back on and says, Bush chained into 9-11. I know a top general who was in there. I'm ready to testify in federal court. Call me. This is a guy no one even has his photo. And he's coming out because he says, yes, we're on the verge of total meltdown of everything.
[03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:12.640]  I mean, clearly things are getting crazy.
[03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:24.640]  Perhaps this illustrates what I was trying to point to. He may indeed, I had to study the particular case more closely, but he may indeed represent the kind of phenomenon that might occur at this point.
[03:46:24.640 --> 03:46:35.640]  In other words, a more rational faction, which does not want to go into the abyss of some kind of a strategic adventure and a world conflagration.
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:55.640]  It's almost like German high command that didn't want to go into Russia, but then Hitler was actually running things. But there is no head of this. It's a bunch of adult oligarchs when they're not taking ballet lessons from Roman manual together and having their valets service them, their male valets.
[03:46:55.640 --> 03:47:01.640]  They're prancing around preparing World War III. I mean, how do you stop a group of demonic zombies?
[03:47:01.640 --> 03:47:18.640]  Well, that's where the getting the word out. In other words, making the perspective absolutely clear that this is not going to be a cakewalk, which is what they tell themselves, that the potential here is for military action that would not be a one-way street.
[03:47:18.640 --> 03:47:36.640]  In other words, it would mean losses for the aggressor, assuming the United States is taking that role, that it's caught with danger and that the intelligent thing to do is not to jump over the edge of this cliff and then see what happens.
[03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:48.640]  Well, that's what Pachennik said. He said all this domestic police state is going to trigger resistance. And at the same time, if they left these other countries alone, they wouldn't run away from the Anglo-Americans.
[03:47:48.640 --> 03:48:06.640]  They've totally lost the soft power. They think they're covered because the liberal and conservative flanks love war, get off on it at a subconscious level because of their impotent in their soul. And it's a perfect storm.
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:19.640]  Folks, I feel the disaster coming. I just want to tell you right now, and you better pray to God and you better get involved because trust in God, the tithe or camel is the better one, say, Webster, great talking to you. Be safe there.
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:27.640]  My final advice, let us work now while it is called today for the night cometh in which no man can work and no woman either.
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:37.640]  Yeah, thank you. Boy, I'm getting chills and I'm going to take a few days off in the middle of this. I was already planning it for months and they're going to have fill in host Watson and Aaron Dyches will do a great job.
[03:48:37.640 --> 03:48:49.640]  I've got to get away. I mean, I wish months ago I wanted to like go to the hills and sit in a cabin for a month and really get my mind ready for all this because I need to be focused like never before.
[03:48:49.640 --> 03:49:00.640]  In such a leadership position here and I couldn't do without your support listeners. I couldn't do without my great crew, the wonderful job they do and they realize the incredible historical events that are happening and that we're at the tip of the spear.
[03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:08.640]  I hope all of you out there listening realize how important you are in this historical fight. We've only got about 11 minutes left. This is a nine minute clip.
[03:49:08.640 --> 03:49:24.640]  This was Tom Hartman who always acted like a nice guy pretty fair on on on his radio show. Radio America. What's it called? What's the liberal radio network called?
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:32.640]  Air America. Thank you. And he totally flip flopped lately when I've gone to show in a cartoonish way.
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:45.640]  He had a really cartoonish intro to it where he made fun of everybody. That's not on this clip they released. But here it is. And the slate and others say that it was a complete route and I destroyed him.
[03:49:45.640 --> 03:49:58.640]  And I did because he's not in reality. I am and he's trying to say that I'm not in reality because I don't drink their Kool-Aid Lies. The world's waking up. Got it? We see through you. Emperor has no clothes. Here it is.
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:11.640]  The Deathers are spreading. You know, all those people who think that Osama bin Laden's takedown mission was actually fake and that bin Laden was actually or is actually still alive.
[03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:21.640]  Or was dead a long time ago and frozen. At least they'll think that way until they see the long form body. Even then I'm sure they'll find some other conspiracy theory to hang on to.
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:28.640]  For a one-stop shop for all your death or needs, log on to WorldNet daily. Take a look at some of the headlines on the website today.
[03:50:28.640 --> 03:50:40.640]  Osama DNA analyzed within 24 hours? Right. DNA evidence must be a lie. Not everyone believes bin Laden really dead. That one speaks for itself.
[03:50:40.640 --> 03:50:51.640]  Burial at sea? Upsets relatives of 9-11 victims? As in what President Obama really did was anger 9-11 victims, not kill bin Laden.
[03:50:51.640 --> 03:50:56.640]  And then there was a WorldNet Daily poll in which visitors were asked to sound off on the death of Osama bin Laden.
[03:50:56.640 --> 03:51:00.640]  The most popular response to the poll garnering 28% of the vote was. See straw man's here.
[03:51:00.640 --> 03:51:04.640]  The timing of Obama's order was from a Republican angle, like I'm a Republican.
[03:51:04.640 --> 03:51:11.640]  And the fourth place response with 7% of the vote was, I'm skeptical bin Laden is actually dead. Figures.
[03:51:11.640 --> 03:51:17.640]  Here was radio host Alex Jones' take on bin Laden's death yesterday on this network.
[03:51:17.640 --> 03:51:24.640]  Osama bin Laden, according to two White House sources, and I'm on record with this, and another State Department source.
[03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:34.640]  We have one of the names is public in 2002 saying he died, he's frozen, literally frozen, and that he would be rolled out in the future at some day.
[03:51:34.640 --> 03:51:44.640]  Then Madeline Albright in 2003. Alex joins me now to talk more about this pressing issue.
[03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:53.640]  He's a filmmaker, author and investigative journalist and host of the Alex Jones radio show. Alex, welcome.
[03:51:53.640 --> 03:51:58.640]  Hey, it's great to be here. I'd like to just make two central points here.
[03:51:58.640 --> 03:52:09.640]  Number one, the CIA last May 25th in spy talk in the Washington Post. Two unnamed high-level CIA sources told the paper they did make fake bin Laden videos.
[03:52:09.640 --> 03:52:17.640]  Those were fake. The famous ones weren't even good. Computer renditions. Linguists and others had listened to the voice and didn't even pass the voice.
[03:52:17.640 --> 03:52:23.640]  This doesn't mean God was frozen. That means Bush was running a PR campaign trying to scare the hell out of us.
[03:52:23.640 --> 03:52:32.640]  Well, while expanding on that, the point is they do make fake videos and they're going to be releasing those fake photos probably tomorrow, so there is a history.
[03:52:32.640 --> 03:52:41.640]  And you guys make it all partisan. It was Madeline Albright on Fox News and CNN in 2003 that said the word was he was frozen and was going to be rolled out.
[03:52:41.640 --> 03:52:52.640]  That's part of the record. It was Walter Cronkite. It was Theresa Hines-Carrie that came out and the word was Bush was planning to do that, but because they put that out, he backed off.
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:54.640]  Why continue the wars?
[03:52:54.640 --> 03:53:13.640]  Is that what you're suggesting? Alex, that's the reason that this is just the idea that the Bush administration had bin Laden's body all these years frozen and any time, like three weeks before the election to help out John McCain, they could have rolled that thing out and said,
[03:53:13.640 --> 03:53:18.640]  hey, look at this. We just got it. But now they're letting Obama take credit for it. I don't get it.
[03:53:18.640 --> 03:53:31.640]  Well, Dr. Steve Pachennick, who served under Baker, Kissinger, and others as the deputy secretary of state in those departments, came on my show first in 2002 in April and said this.
[03:53:31.640 --> 03:53:42.640]  And then I did talk to a White House source high level, well known here in Austin, Texas, and then through another trusted media source who talked to another person in the White House that that is the case.
[03:53:42.640 --> 03:53:53.640]  And we've seen all the dirty tricks. I believe that a lot of people told you this or told you that they knew somebody who told you this. I'm just wondering why? Why would, you know, if...
[03:53:53.640 --> 03:54:09.640]  Well, let me answer your question. They needed to keep the myth of bin Laden alive, you know, for the next seven, eight, nine years, if they had admitted that he was dead, then they wouldn't be able to teach school kids to be afraid of him and that he was under the table.
[03:54:09.640 --> 03:54:12.640]  So the TSA needs to stick their hands down.
[03:54:12.640 --> 03:54:17.640]  But again, why give Obama the credit for this? Why not? But okay, we've gone around...
[03:54:17.640 --> 03:54:24.640]  No, why give him credit? Because this is... I'm not partisan with this. Sure, the Tea Party doesn't believe it. Brett Bart doesn't believe it.
[03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:26.640]  Yeah, I'm not suggesting you are.
[03:54:26.640 --> 03:54:35.640]  That's their issue. My issue is, I'm on record nine years ago with this information. I'm not partisan. And at the presidential level, they may fight over who gets to be president.
[03:54:35.640 --> 03:54:46.640]  But on the trillions, on the wars, on the torture, on the secret arrest, the Democrats toe the line, just like the Republicans, just like they have the same secretary of defense that Bush had, Robert Gates.
[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:51.640]  So this is the same deal, and this is to signal a new era in war and the boss to the take your role.
[03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:53.640]  So in your mind, it's meet the new boss, say the old boss.
[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:55.640]  And to frame Pakistan. And to frame Pakistan.
[03:54:55.640 --> 03:55:04.640]  I'm wondering where Glenn Beck fits into this. You've said that he's a government operative, and I'm wondering what agency he works for.
[03:55:04.640 --> 03:55:15.640]  Well, he works for basically the right-wing foundations that cover the right-wing of the controlled paradigm to keep folks on the reservation fighting with each other.
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:25.640]  And then there's the George Soros Ford Foundation arm that basically created the CIA, the Ford Foundation, and others are on record working in...
[03:55:25.640 --> 03:55:35.640]  Isn't it after World War II? Yes, in the 1947 National Security Act. Look, this is the same government that gave us fake WMDs.
[03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:44.640]  This is the same government that gave us fake WMD documents and told us that hydrogen blimp pumps were anthrax systems.
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:51.640]  Alex, you're never going to get me to disagree with you that our government has lied to us.
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:54.640]  Alex, I'm agreeing with you.
[03:55:54.640 --> 03:55:56.640]  This is wag the dog.
[03:55:56.640 --> 03:56:04.640]  I'm telling you, yes, I know our government has lied to us. The Gulf of Tonkin is one of the most notorious in my lifetime, frankly.
[03:56:04.640 --> 03:56:10.640]  But I'm just wondering why the 9-11 Truthers would love Glenn Beck if he actually works for a government agency.
[03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:14.640]  9-11 Truthers love Glenn Beck?
[03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:22.640]  Okay, they don't. All right, great. In that case, give me your thoughts on William Edward Hickman becoming the role model for Objectivism.
[03:56:22.640 --> 03:56:28.640]  Glenn, see, you're trying to create a partisan wedge to keep people in the partisan left-right paradigm here.
[03:56:28.640 --> 03:56:35.640]  Glenn Beck is a 9-12er who says we should remember the spirit the day after 9-11, same thing Obama said Sunday night.
[03:56:35.640 --> 03:56:50.640]  These guys are basically pushing the same paradigm. They have fake controlled opposition to make Obama look like he's on the left while he passes an insurance plan written by the insurance companies as social as healthcare while he continues the war.
[03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:54.640]  Glenn Beck gives him left cover by attacking him, claiming he's on the left.
[03:56:54.640 --> 03:56:57.640]  Look, man, I'm way past this junior high controlled state.
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:56:58.640]  I got that. I got that.
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:10.640]  William Edward Hickman, a serial murderer in 1927, cut up a little girl, threw out her body parts, you know, in the car when her father finally came to pay the ransom.
[03:57:10.640 --> 03:57:23.640]  As I'm sure you know, he was the role model that I and Rand used for her hero in The Fountainhead and another one of her novels, and basically was her idea of the Superman, somebody who was incapable of feeling the pain of others.
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:30.640]  We're seeing this now in the Ryan budget plan. We're seeing it right across the board, Objectivism and Libertarianism.
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:35.640]  I don't mind all that. Chicago School, I'm not into all that. I'm not a fault.
[03:57:35.640 --> 03:57:44.640]  I'm not asking if you're into it. I'm asking your thoughts on Objectivism and Libertarianism coming out of a sociopathic mass murderer.
[03:57:44.640 --> 03:57:52.640]  Well, I mean, you can put the labels. I mean, you can put the labels. I mean, you can say Stalin was a leftist and killed 30 million people, or Hitler was a leftist.
[03:57:52.640 --> 03:58:00.640]  No, I'm talking about I and Rand here. I and Rand wrote, you know, letters and long words. I mean, she was in love with this guy.
[03:58:00.640 --> 03:58:06.640]  Hey, there's a total diversion out of the fact that we can't believe anything the government tells us. They threw the body into the sea.
[03:58:06.640 --> 03:58:13.640]  You've got black ops, long history. I mean, private, private lynch. That turned out Jerry Brookheimer produced that whole thing.
[03:58:13.640 --> 03:58:18.640]  She hit under the truck. Then when the rest of her team said that they had, had, had killed the Iraqis.
[03:58:18.640 --> 03:58:25.640]  As I said, Alex, I, you know, there's a long list of times our government has lied to us. I'm not disagreeing with you about that.
[03:58:25.640 --> 03:58:30.640]  But I'm trying to get some answers to some of your questions.
