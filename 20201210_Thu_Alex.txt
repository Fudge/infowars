[00:00.000 --> 00:16.120]  Hi, Steve Adler, stay home, home, home, home, home, home.
[00:16.120 --> 00:22.560]  Plato wrote that one of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end
[00:22.560 --> 00:26.640]  up being governed by your inferiors.
[00:26.640 --> 00:34.320]  Subversive legislation, illegal votes, destroyed ballots, machine glitches, poll watchers denied
[00:34.320 --> 00:41.240]  entry while windows are blocked with cardboard, and thousands of sworn affidavits.
[00:41.240 --> 00:46.800]  While covering up the biggest flood of election fraud evidence in U.S. history, CNN admits
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.720]  to taking orders from the Democrat Party.
[00:50.720 --> 00:56.720]  The two-party system was a product of the Civil War, and devolved into a rigged two-party
[00:56.720 --> 01:04.520]  system set upon destroying our American birthright from within, using election fraud as its primary
[01:04.520 --> 01:07.640]  method of infiltration.
[01:07.640 --> 01:13.600]  Strong evidence of voter fraud in favor of George W. Bush occurred in 2000, and after
[01:13.600 --> 01:19.640]  Al Gore got the Florida courts to order a recount, the Supreme Court put a stop to it
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.000]  after determining the recount to be unconstitutional.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  What makes you think the Supreme Court will rule in favor of Trump?
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.320]  Attorney General William Barr seems to be defending the corrupt establishment.
[01:33.320 --> 01:37.360]  How many actual patriots are there in the Trump administration?
[01:37.360 --> 01:43.920]  And if Biden is inaugurated as president in January, we already know what to expect.
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.920]  While vacationing in Cabo, Austin Mayor Adler told residents to stay home.
[01:48.920 --> 01:55.440]  Trying to do contact tracing to see if we may have to close things down if we're not careful.
[01:55.440 --> 01:58.280]  If we're going to be closing things down, it would be great to be able to do it in a
[01:58.280 --> 01:59.720]  really surgical way.
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.680]  Pfizer today said that they think they have a vaccine, but know that even when those vaccines
[02:04.680 --> 02:10.480]  are available, the CEO of Pfizer was reminding us that we're going to be wearing masking
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.520]  and social distancing and being disciplined well into 2021, so everybody just needs to
[02:15.520 --> 02:18.560]  get mentally prepared for that.
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.160]  LA residents have been ordered to stay in their homes.
[02:23.160 --> 02:28.840]  Michigan Governor Whitmer tells her constituents not to travel for Christmas.
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.560]  An American couple was charged with second degree reckless endangerment for attempting
[02:33.560 --> 02:38.720]  to fly home after testing positive for COVID-19.
[02:38.720 --> 02:44.000]  And a bar owner was arrested in Staten Island for simply trying to run his own business.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.520]  We have been told by several doctors that the testing being used for COVID doesn't
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.400]  work, including the inventor of the test himself.
[02:54.400 --> 02:58.920]  And when the Pfizer vaccine comes, we can expect the real horror.
[02:58.920 --> 03:06.280]  A top EU scientist has found that the new experimental mRNA vaccine will likely cause
[03:06.280 --> 03:09.200]  sterilization in women.
[03:09.200 --> 03:16.320]  The globalist depopulation agenda is now in full view, and the actual end of America
[03:16.320 --> 03:18.320]  is now seen on the horizon.
[03:18.320 --> 03:24.000]  If you care about the future of the Republic, if you care about preserving your children's
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.120]  birthright, then get yourself to Washington, D.C. this Saturday.
[03:29.120 --> 03:32.920]  This is when the real draining of the swamp begins.
[03:32.920 --> 03:40.080]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.880]  We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield.
[03:43.880 --> 03:47.840]  We will never give in, we will never give up, and we will never back down.
[03:47.840 --> 03:54.400]  We will never, ever surrender.
[03:54.400 --> 04:01.360]  Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
[04:01.360 --> 04:07.760]  Drain together this Saturday in D.C., stop the steal, and drain the swamp.
[04:07.760 --> 04:10.760]  Our lives depend on it.
[04:10.760 --> 04:20.280]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[04:20.280 --> 04:26.360]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got
[04:26.360 --> 04:27.360]  one.
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[04:58.360 --> 05:01.800]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[05:01.800 --> 05:02.800]  They want control.
[05:02.800 --> 05:04.720]  They want domesticated slaves.
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.040]  That's the process that is taking place right now.
[05:08.040 --> 05:12.680]  And when you shop at the big box stores, and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they
[05:12.680 --> 05:16.960]  are creating monopolies, and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns,
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.760]  gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.760]  If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[05:21.760 --> 05:25.520]  But if you'll shop at Info Wars, where we have thousands of products made right here
[05:25.520 --> 05:30.360]  in America with our warehouses and our crew, it's incredible, and it changes the whole
[05:30.360 --> 05:31.360]  world.
[05:31.360 --> 05:35.000]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the Info War, and if you want to stop the globalist
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.080]  at infowarstore.com, and tell others to do their shopping at infowarstore.com.
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.580]  We have amazing products.
[05:40.580 --> 05:44.800]  We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th.
[05:44.800 --> 05:46.280]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.960]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money, and
[05:49.960 --> 06:02.000]  do your shopping, and get great products at infowarstore.com.
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:07.720 --> 06:09.840]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.880]  Well so does he.
[06:11.880 --> 06:16.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:16.960 --> 06:27.000]  Thursday, December 10th, year of 2020, year only, 41 days out from the inauguration of
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.200]  the Chinese Communist frontman that is trying to steal the election, Joe Biden.
[06:31.200 --> 06:35.080]  He will only expand the oppression and the attempt to break our economy and our will
[06:35.080 --> 06:39.520]  if he gets in, the reign of terror against free speech, and the divide and conquer operations
[06:39.520 --> 06:42.520]  are going to be tenfold what you've seen so far.
[06:42.520 --> 06:47.920]  This will be true warfare, economic, cultural, and then physical, the roll out of secret
[06:47.920 --> 06:52.240]  police, arrest teams, contact tracers, it's all official.
[06:52.240 --> 06:57.280]  Now everything we've warned of is now out in the open because the enemy is in the flux
[06:57.280 --> 07:00.760]  period between going between beta and full operational.
[07:00.760 --> 07:04.040]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a drill.
[07:04.040 --> 07:09.040]  That's why it's more important than ever that we understand that no matter what the mainstream
[07:09.040 --> 07:14.000]  corporate media says, no matter what the system pushes, no matter what the states do, no matter
[07:14.000 --> 07:21.960]  what the corporations do, we the people are declaring our second independence.
[07:21.960 --> 07:28.880]  We the people, as I said three weeks ago in Washington, D.C., are declaring the second
[07:28.880 --> 07:34.760]  American Revolution, the second American Declaration of Independence.
[07:34.760 --> 07:43.440]  And here we are now, in the year 2020, with only a few days left, a few weeks left, and
[07:43.440 --> 07:48.840]  you see the historic planets aligning as in history, they always do.
[07:48.840 --> 07:54.520]  And I don't just mean metaphorically the planets aligning, we are seeing actual planet alignments
[07:54.520 --> 07:59.440]  that we've not seen in 800 years, like the Christmas star coming up in just a few days
[07:59.440 --> 08:02.360]  of Saturn and Jupiter aligning at night.
[08:02.360 --> 08:06.840]  The globalists are really obsessed with these types of celestial activities.
[08:06.840 --> 08:12.000]  But when I say the planets are aligning, I mean that metaphorically in that you notice,
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.920]  we had Dr. Steve Pachennick on two weeks ago, he said, you will see it explode in the news
[08:16.920 --> 08:20.720]  that Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, or Communist Chinese agents, the evidence will be damning
[08:20.720 --> 08:22.600]  and they will have a chance to step down.
[08:22.600 --> 08:26.120]  Well, now what did you see break last night?
[08:26.120 --> 08:29.400]  We'll see if Pachennick's going to be right or wrong, but I believe his sources in the
[08:29.400 --> 08:33.680]  Pentagon and at the White House did tell him that, because I've talked to high-level sources
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.320]  at the White House who are saying, we don't care what Bill Barr does, we don't care, we're
[08:38.320 --> 08:42.560]  about to remove him if need be, and this information will be released.
[08:42.560 --> 08:48.000]  And the president's preparing those Oval Office speeches to release the information, to declassify
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  the information.
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.040]  That's why they're so scared of General Flynn, who will be in D.C. this weekend.
[08:55.040 --> 09:00.440]  And I will get on an airplane tonight, I will travel to D.C., and I will be there at rallies
[09:00.440 --> 09:03.600]  and events on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[09:03.600 --> 09:06.520]  This is the battle for the Republic.
[09:06.520 --> 09:12.280]  You've also seen all of these different states join Texas down 19 states against the five
[09:12.280 --> 09:18.360]  fraudulent states that violated federal and state law, did not pass legislature laws allowing
[09:18.360 --> 09:22.760]  the mailing out of 80 million ballots, but just get it by fiat as part of their mass
[09:22.760 --> 09:23.760]  fraud.
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.480]  The president's face overturns the election, and the Texas suit is the best.
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.760]  That's why the Supreme Court removed the other suits, because they want that main suit.
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.960]  Now will they betray America?
[09:33.960 --> 09:35.960]  Will they betray common sense?
[09:35.960 --> 09:41.280]  Well, a lot of these justices were so persecuted by the globalists on the left that they might
[09:41.280 --> 09:46.600]  actually find their soul, like Darth Vader did, in return of the Jedi, again, to use
[09:46.600 --> 09:50.640]  another parable or another allegory.
[09:50.640 --> 09:54.680]  On line, we're all about to find out that I will be demonstrating at the White House,
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.560]  we will be demonstrating in front of the Supreme Court, we'll be at Freedom Plaza, we will
[09:58.560 --> 10:07.000]  be at the big event on Saturday as well, there on the Lincoln Memorial, and I'm a speaker
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.760]  at a lot of these big major events, but regardless, we'll be leading marches throughout D.C.,
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.760]  and we will be fighting as hard as we possibly can to show the world that we don't buy this
[10:16.760 --> 10:19.800]  giant gaslighting in this line.
[10:19.800 --> 10:23.200]  Now continuing, we have a huge report, I'm going to be very disciplined at the bottom
[10:23.200 --> 10:27.080]  of the hour, and I'm going to cover this life and death situation.
[10:27.080 --> 10:34.120]  I remember when I had my second child, she's 16 now, and the nurses, when I refused the
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.040]  vaccines, called me aside and they said, you know, none of us take them too.
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.440]  The preemie area, every time we're ordered by the bioethics board here at the hospital,
[10:43.440 --> 10:49.200]  who aren't doctors mainly, they're just globalist operatives, to vaccinate the preemies, about
[10:49.200 --> 10:51.960]  a third of them stop breathing and some die.
[10:51.960 --> 10:57.880]  So we threatened them, and so now they provide ventilators to try to keep them alive, so
[10:57.880 --> 11:02.800]  they give them the shots knowing a third of them will die, and then they ventilate them.
[11:02.800 --> 11:06.080]  So it's like shooting you in the head and giving you a bandage, but that's only because
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.160]  the nurses spoke up, this is keep the baby comfortable, this is kill them, oh, they're
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.200]  a preemie, let's quietly kill them, that's the bioethics board, seeing if they can kill
[11:14.200 --> 11:17.280]  babies in plain view and get you to accept it.
[11:17.280 --> 11:26.680]  That's what this whole vaccine rollout situation is about, is over blow the COVID hundreds
[11:26.680 --> 11:30.880]  of times what it actually does, hype it up, count all the other deaths as it, but tell
[11:30.880 --> 11:34.000]  us that it's super scary so we never go outside again.
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.000]  But then when it comes to the real vaccines and massive death, massive brain damage, massive
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.840]  neurological disorders, neon beret, narcolepsy, epilepsy, cancer, autism, it's all right here,
[11:48.840 --> 11:52.840]  it's in the inserts that it does that, and they're on the news saying, oh no, no, no,
[11:52.840 --> 11:55.960]  no, no, no, no connection to neurological disorders, and then the damn inserts say it.
[11:55.960 --> 12:01.320]  The fine print, you got to get a magnifying glass to read, when my eyesight was 2015,
[12:01.320 --> 12:05.040]  I had to get a magnifying glass, now I can't even read it.
[12:05.040 --> 12:09.280]  Think about that, and why do I raise that, what's coming up at the bottom of the hour?
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.760]  The British government has had so many people collapse and have convulsions one week into
[12:13.760 --> 12:18.320]  giving the vaccine, they've already had deaths, but they're trying to attribute them to, well,
[12:18.320 --> 12:21.960]  something else happened, now if you have the convulsion after you get in your car or get
[12:21.960 --> 12:26.440]  on the bus and leave, they don't count, they've had so many convulsions and deaths in the
[12:26.440 --> 12:32.320]  clinics in the UK that they've ordered emergency nurses with defibrillators and mouth to mouth
[12:32.320 --> 12:36.120]  for resuscitation.
[12:36.120 --> 12:44.480]  Same thing the nurses told me at the North Austin Women's Medical Center, and the reason
[12:44.480 --> 12:51.720]  I raised that is, I told that story on air, and then Rob Do and David Knight were contacted
[12:51.720 --> 12:56.960]  by nurses around the country saying, have you not seen the American Medical Journal?
[12:56.960 --> 13:02.080]  Admitting that giving these preemie babies is killing them, and so we dug up those original
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.720]  articles and the original David Knight report, so understand, it's not just this new vaccine
[13:07.720 --> 13:13.960]  is killing people and causing them to literally fall over and start convulsing and stop breathing,
[13:13.960 --> 13:19.480]  that's full grown adults, imagine preemies.
[13:19.480 --> 13:23.920]  So we're going to play these nurses for you, ladies and gentlemen, that put their names
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.920]  on the line and came out about all this, and this was many years ago, but we've reposted
[13:28.920 --> 13:33.120]  the articles and videos, and we're fighting to keep them full wars up, we're fighting
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.720]  to keep man.video, all these archive videos were removed from YouTube, they're removed
[13:36.720 --> 13:40.320]  from Facebook, Twitter, only place they live is at man.video, only place they live for
[13:40.320 --> 13:44.360]  you to go get it and warn people, and thank God they found it in our archives from eight
[13:44.360 --> 13:46.080]  years ago.
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.400]  Thank God they found it in the archives and put it back up, and that's why it's so over
[13:50.400 --> 13:53.680]  the top impressive, I guess it was six years ago.
[13:53.680 --> 13:58.280]  So again, nurse confirms babies are damaged by vaccines, that headline's not strong enough
[13:58.280 --> 14:05.880]  – nurses confirm vaccines killing babies, nurses confirm vaccines kill babies, make
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.520]  babies stop breathing, see even us it's never hardcore enough, no the babies die, I have
[14:11.520 --> 14:20.440]  the Associated Press, people are dying, they have to be resuscitated, they stop breathing.
[14:20.440 --> 14:25.640]  And again, this is the giant threat that they normalize it, they tell you don't worry,
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.240]  and so you're not – no one's chicken-littling from the vaccine, no one's chicken-littling
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.240]  from the doubling in suicides, mainly of young people, no one's talking about the
[14:34.240 --> 14:37.640]  forty-some percent of small businesses never to reopen, nobody's talking about the millions
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.200]  already starved to death, or the billion that are set to go into poverty the UN admits
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.520]  from the lockdown, or how all the globalists ignore all the laws themselves, or how the
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.400]  big banks admit they're doing this to consolidate power and consolidate total control.
[14:51.400 --> 14:56.120]  This is all intertwined, this is the globalist rollout, this is the globalist power grab,
[14:56.120 --> 15:00.600]  this is the new world order system, this is everything.
[15:00.600 --> 15:05.280]  And so complying with it is your destruction, saying no and getting educated and recognizing
[15:05.280 --> 15:11.320]  the threat, and getting state legislatures and governors and churches and good doctors
[15:11.320 --> 15:15.720]  and good people in Congress to say no, and saying we're not following Joe Biden, we're
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.480]  not following the globalist, and Trump tried to take control of the vaccine situation so
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.680]  he'd quote me the hero that was political, Trump was wrong there too, and that was where
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.240]  Trump really screwed up, it doesn't matter, he's not a chai-com agent, and he's already
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.200]  coming out and saying COVID's a fraud, and now starting to expose the vaccine, he was
[15:31.200 --> 15:34.480]  using reverse psychology to get them to turn against the vaccines when he endorsed them,
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.800]  I get what he did, but I still disagree with it, just straight shoot people, but he's Trump,
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.960]  I'm Alex Jones, that's where we're different, we'll be right back, I'm gonna go through
[15:41.960 --> 15:47.240]  all this huge breaking news, we've got massive guests on today, I'll tell you about the guests
[15:47.240 --> 15:52.880]  later when we come back, but I forgot, Chinese troops secretly being brought into Canada,
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.640]  those documents, Ezra Levanska to join us, Dr. Steve Pacenek and so much more.
[15:56.640 --> 16:03.280]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome, they are forcing mutations,
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.400]  this is forced evolution, or de-evolution, when you look at all the major research,
[16:08.400 --> 16:12.840]  all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter
[16:12.840 --> 16:18.640]  or folks that live longer or more oral, no, it's turning humanity into a commodity, now
[16:18.640 --> 16:23.560]  we see some dropping into like communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines
[16:23.560 --> 16:28.720]  to make our soldiers superman, that's a way to make it sexy that hey, we're experimenting
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.040]  on our troops, we'll send things that happen to our troops, and thousands and thousands
[16:33.040 --> 16:38.360]  of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine, not to talk to high level folks inside
[16:38.360 --> 16:41.560]  the federal government, they have to stay to check the self department, they say Alex
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.760]  you know it hurts a lot of people, it's for a greater good, but that's not even true,
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.240]  and it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, the federal state law, this
[16:50.240 --> 16:54.320]  is violence being carried out against us by medical charity, and we have a right to resist
[16:54.320 --> 16:56.760]  it with any means necessary.

[17:49.880 --> 17:59.880]  today.
[17:59.880 --> 18:06.880]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:06.880 --> 18:30.000]  Laying siege to the globalist, exposing their plans, we are the dreaded enemy of the New
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.560]  World Order, Satan and his minions, we carry.
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.720]  The blessing of God's providence with us, and we're very thankful for it.
[18:40.720 --> 18:42.600]  We are the Infowar.
[18:42.600 --> 18:49.680]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday broadcast, December 10th, 2020.
[18:49.680 --> 18:58.080]  Now, next segment, I'm going to show you how the globalists soft kill you and your family.
[18:58.080 --> 19:04.200]  And this information is the most life-saving, powerful info there is on the planet.
[19:04.200 --> 19:08.240]  It's all hiding in plain view, they get you afraid of something that isn't scary at all
[19:08.240 --> 19:14.320]  if you have the proper nutrition, while right around you, they're killing everybody you
[19:14.320 --> 19:17.920]  know, and just normalizing it because you're tough.
[19:17.920 --> 19:20.800]  When you see everybody else being tough, you're tough, when you see everybody freaking out,
[19:20.800 --> 19:25.520]  you freak out, because in our entire development as humans, normally when the rest of the pack
[19:25.520 --> 19:30.960]  sees a threat from a grizzly bear, a saber-toot tiger, or other humans, or a wildfire, somebody
[19:30.960 --> 19:34.120]  runs up and says, hey, a big fire is coming, we got to go, well, that's your cousin, that's
[19:34.120 --> 19:35.680]  your brother, you believe it.
[19:35.680 --> 19:39.640]  But what happens when people in suits and ties lie to you?
[19:39.640 --> 19:45.720]  What happens when they break the social contact and engage in fraud, it's called tyranny.
[19:45.720 --> 19:51.760]  So next segment, the biggest vaccine news ever, of course, the fact that Swalliswell was penetrated
[19:51.760 --> 19:56.960]  by a Chinese communist sex op, of course, I've called Swalliswell a chai-com agent.
[19:56.960 --> 20:00.520]  The entire California group has been completely taken over.
[20:00.520 --> 20:06.880]  Einstein, Barbara Boxer was run by it, the governor's run by it, I mean, they are chai-com
[20:06.880 --> 20:09.880]  agents, 110%.
[20:09.880 --> 20:18.920]  You make bang bang with fang fang, let me give you money, let me love you a long time.
[20:18.920 --> 20:25.160]  Swalliswell, Swalliswell likes girls, that's a little surprising there, but, and of course
[20:25.160 --> 20:31.720]  was coming out with Hunter and all the rest of it, but let's get into this, let's get
[20:31.720 --> 20:32.720]  into this right now.
[20:32.720 --> 20:36.720]  Again, the media won't talk about the Texas suit and the 18 states that have joined Texas
[20:36.720 --> 20:37.720]  as of this morning.
[20:37.720 --> 20:43.440]  I think a minute ago they told me another state joined it, maybe it's 20 states now.
[20:43.440 --> 20:50.960]  But it's strong because states have a higher level of standing than just an individual
[20:50.960 --> 20:57.040]  because they represent a large number of individuals and then the Constitution and Federalist Compact,
[20:57.040 --> 21:00.480]  they have basically equal standing with the federal government.
[21:00.480 --> 21:06.320]  And so this is a big deal and the suit's very well written by Ken Paxton, who's been on
[21:06.320 --> 21:09.480]  the show and who's a listener, proud of him, he's been under a major attack because he
[21:09.480 --> 21:10.480]  has taken action.
[21:10.480 --> 21:14.640]  That's why they've had a bunch of turncoach and his office claim he's been paid off or
[21:14.640 --> 21:19.280]  and, you know, took money or something because they really, you know, look for Paxton, you
[21:19.280 --> 21:23.400]  know, to die in a car wreck or, you know, it's just plain go down and I'm not saying
[21:23.400 --> 21:24.400]  that's going to happen.
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.040]  I'm just saying, don't be surprised, we're in a war, folks.
[21:28.040 --> 21:29.040]  So pray for Paxton.
[21:29.040 --> 21:33.840]  I'm just proud of Texas again, once again, trying to save the Republic.
[21:33.840 --> 21:36.080]  This is the one hell of a time to be alive.
[21:36.080 --> 21:37.080]  And what are they going to do?
[21:37.080 --> 21:39.760]  This is a pretty court-made betray America.
[21:39.760 --> 21:44.240]  But if we pray and we protest and we take action and we put out millions on the streets
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.760]  so they see politically there's pressure to do the right thing, we can give them the courage
[21:48.760 --> 21:57.400]  they need to flat out throw out all the delegates of those states that went to Joe Biden's refraud
[21:57.400 --> 22:02.720]  and then Trump wins in a landslide.
[22:02.720 --> 22:04.160]  And that's what happens.
[22:04.160 --> 22:14.200]  And Trump has even said he would go for the new election in those states absolutely, absolutely
[22:14.200 --> 22:16.720]  and you know, Trump said he would have the military oversee that.
[22:16.720 --> 22:21.360]  And some have said, oh, martial law, no, Trump knows that people trust the military more
[22:21.360 --> 22:24.080]  than the general public and more than the government.
[22:24.080 --> 22:27.920]  And I really wouldn't because they're commanded by some bad people in many cases, but still
[22:27.920 --> 22:28.920]  rank and file.
[22:28.920 --> 22:29.920]  Yes.
[22:29.920 --> 22:30.920]  I don't think they're going to be engaged in election fraud.
[22:30.920 --> 22:35.520]  It'll be a third party just like for fires or earthquakes or you know, whatever we call
[22:35.520 --> 22:39.760]  the military in, it's a whole nother question.
[22:39.760 --> 22:47.760]  But the point is, is that we are in a crisis and we've been overrun by globalists.
[22:47.760 --> 22:51.040]  It's time to overturn what they've done.
[22:51.040 --> 22:54.560]  And the blue states have already implemented martial law.
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.240]  And so how do you overthrow a martial law?
[22:57.240 --> 23:02.360]  Well, you do it with a declaration of independence, which then means a declaration of war, which
[23:02.360 --> 23:07.600]  by its very nature is martial, martial coming from military.
[23:07.600 --> 23:09.880]  And so nobody likes a military conflict.
[23:09.880 --> 23:11.400]  I know President Trump doesn't.
[23:11.400 --> 23:13.160]  I certainly don't want a military conflict.
[23:13.160 --> 23:17.280]  But if the globalists just run the media and run everything and engage in this fraud and
[23:17.280 --> 23:20.040]  say they're taking over and say they're just going to bankrupt the country no matter what
[23:20.040 --> 23:26.400]  we do, and they are threatening myself and the Trumps and millions of others, poll watchers,
[23:26.400 --> 23:30.000]  the list goes on and on, then at what point do we push back?
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.240]  Well, we don't want citizens to randomly go do it.
[23:33.240 --> 23:36.400]  So who would call out the militia under the Constitution?
[23:36.400 --> 23:40.280]  Many of the civilian governments have been compromised by the Communist Chinese, as you
[23:40.280 --> 23:42.120]  now see all over the news.
[23:42.120 --> 23:45.480]  Well, how would George Washington counter that?
[23:45.480 --> 23:47.440]  How would Abraham Lincoln counter that?
[23:47.440 --> 23:54.000]  How would President Jackson handle it?
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.200]  President Jackson was the most famous and respected southerner of his day.
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.320]  And when the South tried to have its first civil war over the North, screwing them over
[24:02.320 --> 24:09.280]  on tariffs and trying to ship their tobacco and cotton and stuff out to Europe, he said,
[24:09.280 --> 24:16.280]  I will lead an army of 100,000 men to the South, and I will crush you if you launch
[24:16.280 --> 24:17.960]  a rebellion to split this country.
[24:17.960 --> 24:20.960]  He said the damn British are behind this, and they were.
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.880]  Now, after his death later, they were able to launch a civil war, and both sides were
[24:25.880 --> 24:26.880]  wrong.
[24:26.880 --> 24:32.920]  And that was him threatening martial law to stop an outside power breaking up the country.
[24:32.920 --> 24:39.680]  This is real history, not the fanciful stuff that people act like they know, but the reality.
[24:39.680 --> 24:42.560]  So I'm telling you, Trump doesn't have control of the military.
[24:42.560 --> 24:44.680]  He doesn't have the real military power to do that.
[24:44.680 --> 24:46.600]  The public's too ignorant to understand it.
[24:46.600 --> 24:50.360]  The media's already pre-programmed them that, oh, you know, Trump tries to come in and take
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.240]  out some of these Democrat globalists, you know, that they'll call him a dictator.
[24:54.240 --> 24:59.080]  So instead, you're going to get the plutocracy or the oligarchy of the big banks and the
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.800]  megacorporations and their corporate boards where you never know who the technocrats are
[25:03.800 --> 25:09.880]  and you can never defeat them because it's these councils of corrupt scientific technological
[25:09.880 --> 25:12.960]  controllers that Eisenhower warned of.
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.360]  And so then there's the process of trying to educate the public about how Agenda 21,
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.880]  Agenda 2030 operates, how they're waging siege to collapse our economies, to vertically integrate,
[25:22.880 --> 25:27.520]  to consolidate control in their own words, and how, oh, but now they have the Vatican
[25:27.520 --> 25:28.520]  and the UN.
[25:28.520 --> 25:32.240]  Oh, we didn't know the COVID lockdown would cause a world depression.
[25:32.240 --> 25:34.640]  Don't worry, we're going to all give you universal incomes.
[25:34.640 --> 25:36.880]  You just got to take the shots we want you to.
[25:36.880 --> 25:41.560]  This isn't me predicting this 10 months ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago, which we
[25:41.560 --> 25:42.560]  did.
[25:42.560 --> 25:49.080]  They're now doing it, global guaranteed income, but you will live at a 200 square foot coffin.
[25:49.080 --> 25:51.040]  You will take all the shots we say.
[25:51.040 --> 25:52.260]  You will do what we say.
[25:52.260 --> 25:53.760]  You will vote like we say.
[25:53.760 --> 25:54.840]  You are owned by us.
[25:54.840 --> 26:00.520]  It's all been announced.
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.440]  In fact, now I open up mainstream news every morning on the computer and it's worse than
[26:05.440 --> 26:07.040]  I thought it'd be moving faster.
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.800]  So I have to really apologize the listeners and make a correction.
[26:11.800 --> 26:13.880]  This is moving quicker and worse than I thought.
[26:13.880 --> 26:16.760]  I mean, but again, that's because they were so far behind.
[26:16.760 --> 26:20.240]  They are now launching the full operation.
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.920]  But if we resist and speak up and say no and educate others, they will be spent very,
[26:24.920 --> 26:25.920]  very quick.
[26:25.920 --> 26:27.440]  This is the full assault.
[26:27.440 --> 26:31.120]  And if we expose, they launched the lockdown to collapse the world economy because now
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.000]  Bill Gates is out and says, Melinda, oh, we're sorry, we didn't know the lockdown would kill
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  millions.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.800]  Oh, oh, we didn't know because they know we're exposing them and they know it's their damn
[26:40.800 --> 26:41.800]  Achilles heel.
[26:41.800 --> 26:48.640]  You're going to go to present Bill Gates with your husband, Melinda and Big Mike for
[26:48.640 --> 26:49.920]  what you've done.
[26:49.920 --> 26:52.040]  Do you understand you little piece of health?
[26:52.040 --> 26:53.040]  Yeah.
[26:53.040 --> 26:54.040]  Well, pay.
[26:54.040 --> 26:55.040]  We're right back.
[26:55.040 --> 26:56.040]  Stay with us.
[26:56.040 --> 26:59.080]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[26:59.080 --> 27:01.960]  Other dictionaries have somewhere else.
[27:01.960 --> 27:07.520]  Terrorism is the threat of force or action carrying out force for a political or financial
[27:07.520 --> 27:08.520]  reason.
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.040]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[27:13.040 --> 27:15.960]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[27:15.960 --> 27:21.400]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[27:21.400 --> 27:23.800]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[27:23.800 --> 27:28.880]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within
[27:28.880 --> 27:29.880]  three months.
[27:29.880 --> 27:30.880]  Okay.
[27:30.880 --> 27:32.280]  It's a quarter million.
[27:32.280 --> 27:37.920]  If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[27:37.920 --> 27:38.920]  These are real numbers.
[27:38.920 --> 27:39.920]  These are real facts.
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.000]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  taught we're not essential.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.120]  All the big box tours in Amazon take over the planet.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.960]  You could stand up against it.
[27:49.960 --> 27:50.960]  This is slavery.
[27:50.960 --> 27:54.840]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[27:54.840 --> 28:00.040]  I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news.
[28:00.040 --> 28:07.320]  Info Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[28:07.320 --> 28:11.840]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.480]  word of mouth have overridden that and they are so scared of info wars.com and banned
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.520]  on video and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.160]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now.
[28:25.160 --> 28:29.720]  This is our most important month to fund ourselves in the next year and I understand the economy
[28:29.720 --> 28:30.720]  shut down.
[28:30.720 --> 28:32.200]  I understand there's not as much money as they're used to be.
[28:32.200 --> 28:35.880]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery, but info wars really need your support.
[28:35.880 --> 28:40.680]  You just buy great items through your Christmas shopping and infowarstore.com with huge sales,
[28:40.680 --> 28:44.720]  amazing products and then you know you're funding the info war and not funding Amazon
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.120]  and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.560]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time
[28:52.560 --> 28:53.560]  at infowarstore.com.
[28:53.560 --> 28:54.560]  Thank you.
[28:54.560 --> 29:10.560]  Now it's easier than ever to have banned.video on your iPhone.

[29:22.800 --> 29:25.040]  I suggest banned.video.
[29:25.040 --> 29:29.480]  You will now have banned.video app on your home screen despite the fact that Tim Cook
[29:29.480 --> 29:30.480]  tried to stop it.
[29:30.480 --> 29:34.760]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action you can override them,
[29:34.760 --> 29:38.980]  have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[29:38.980 --> 29:43.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.800]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[29:46.800 --> 30:16.740]  Be sure and share banned.video.
[30:42.580 --> 30:46.180]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen of this live Thursday December 10th global transmission.
[30:46.180 --> 30:48.780]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[30:48.780 --> 30:54.620]  We're going to get into the most serious subject you possibly can and that is the global rollout
[30:54.620 --> 31:03.980]  of the forced COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA, genetic recombinant, mutating your entire body, sterilizing
[31:03.980 --> 31:05.900]  you, causing cancer.
[31:05.900 --> 31:10.860]  It's all these top medical experts, former chief science officer at Pfizer, head of
[31:10.860 --> 31:17.740]  the EU commission, top medical doctors, thousands of them signing letters just saying what the
[31:17.740 --> 31:22.340]  hell is going on if this is like something Hitler would do, it doesn't even protect you
[31:22.340 --> 31:23.340]  from COVID.
[31:23.340 --> 31:30.860]  But I thought I'd just show you one thing from medical journals going back five years.
[31:30.860 --> 31:36.140]  And then six years ago when we first broke this information here at Info Wars with Rob
[31:36.140 --> 31:38.580]  Do and David Dike covering it.
[31:38.580 --> 31:45.820]  Look at this, UK requires resuscitation facilities, that means you're dying, you're not breathing.
[31:45.820 --> 31:52.740]  UK requires resuscitation facilities at Corona vaccine centers after allergic reactions
[31:52.740 --> 31:59.100]  where people stop breathing, have convulsions and are dying before they are legally dead.
[31:59.100 --> 32:01.820]  They are resuscitated.
[32:01.820 --> 32:04.540]  Now how many times have you heard me explain what's in the inserts?
[32:04.540 --> 32:11.060]  If you go read it yourself, can cause you to die, asphyxiation, can cause a convulsion,
[32:11.060 --> 32:15.180]  can cause Guillain-Barreys, narcolepsy, we've already covered this a thousand times.
[32:15.180 --> 32:23.700]  But you hear on the news, oh conspiracy theorists say it can cause problems, why it's not true.
[32:23.700 --> 32:27.540]  But we do have liability protection.
[32:27.540 --> 32:31.620]  But let's go back to this article, May 5th, 2015.
[32:31.620 --> 32:36.740]  This interview has been banned off YouTube, that we haven't re-uploaded, banned off video,
[32:36.740 --> 32:39.500]  I'm about to play it right now for you.
[32:39.500 --> 32:43.140]  Nurse reveals routine vaccine induced injuries.
[32:43.140 --> 32:50.500]  What a softball headline, they accuse us of exaggerating or making things sound worse
[32:50.500 --> 32:51.500]  than ours.
[32:51.500 --> 32:55.460]  She said that they would go into the premium area when they were ordered by the hospital
[32:55.460 --> 32:58.460]  middle board to vaccinate premature babies.
[32:58.460 --> 33:01.900]  They say, when we do that, they stop breathing a bunch of them and get sick or die.
[33:01.900 --> 33:06.020]  They said, do it, they said, fine, we're going to quit or sue the full hour-long interviews.
[33:06.020 --> 33:10.300]  Now I've been re-uploaded to banned off video, I'm about to play two minutes of it.
[33:10.300 --> 33:13.620]  And they said, okay, you can try to resuscitate them.
[33:13.620 --> 33:18.860]  So they give them shots knowing that a third of the time or so, it kills them.
[33:18.860 --> 33:21.260]  It would kill them.
[33:21.260 --> 33:26.180]  Like a heroin overdose or whatever, or like 50 bee stings.
[33:26.180 --> 33:28.260]  Think about how out of control that is.
[33:28.260 --> 33:29.860]  Think about how evil that is.
[33:29.860 --> 33:35.380]  And then a year after we have these ladies on, this is just an interview with one of them,
[33:35.380 --> 33:46.100]  June 22nd, and then a year after that, new Journal of American Medical Association confirms
[33:46.100 --> 33:53.060]  nurse whistleblower routine hospital vaccine damage happening to infants.
[33:53.060 --> 33:54.060]  But here it is.
[33:54.060 --> 33:59.660]  But on solos, our reports on its link to Reuters AP, this is not denied, UK requires resuscitation
[33:59.660 --> 34:04.380]  facilities at Corona vaccine centers after allergic reactions, Britain's National Health
[34:04.380 --> 34:09.580]  Service confirmed on Wednesday that it's deploying resuscitation facilities, close quote, coronavirus
[34:09.580 --> 34:15.740]  vaccination centers following the revelation that two healthcare workers suffered bad
[34:15.740 --> 34:16.740]  reactions.
[34:16.740 --> 34:23.860]  I guess the word is anapathic, a toy, it's anaphylactic shock, I guess the term.
[34:23.860 --> 34:29.580]  They're receiving the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on the first day of the rollout.
[34:29.580 --> 34:40.460]  And they say older people above 70 you get five, above 40 you get four, above 30 you
[34:40.460 --> 34:45.620]  get two, and children and young people get one.
[34:45.620 --> 34:48.980]  By the way, each time they give it to you, it's creating more of an autoimmune response
[34:48.980 --> 34:52.580]  because you're becoming allergic to the cold virus.
[34:52.580 --> 34:55.780]  When they admit in the medical literature, this is probably going to make everybody allergic
[34:55.780 --> 34:59.700]  to the common cold and it's going to kill people by a cytokine storm.
[34:59.700 --> 35:02.940]  That's in the big EU emergency paper.
[35:02.940 --> 35:06.900]  They know what they're doing, Bill Gates, these people are taking away your immune system
[35:06.900 --> 35:11.460]  by either jacking it up or it kills you, or they admit causing a total collapse of your
[35:11.460 --> 35:16.020]  immune system and then you get cancer because your body's killing cancer every day.
[35:16.020 --> 35:24.180]  I mean, folks, this is a death sentence, but they're rolling it out, rolling it out, where
[35:24.180 --> 35:30.220]  it's just, oh, he died, she died, what did the military say last week in the UK?
[35:30.220 --> 35:34.100]  We need AI to monitor everyone because we think there's going to be so many bad reactions
[35:34.100 --> 35:35.980]  and so many deaths.
[35:35.980 --> 35:37.380]  So Bill Gates, what does he said?
[35:37.380 --> 35:43.220]  He said, if we do a really good job of vaccines, we can cut population growth in half.
[35:43.220 --> 35:49.180]  You're like, why is he up there in a purple sweater acting totally calm?
[35:49.180 --> 35:52.940]  Because if you hide it in blame, you can go, hey, there's this great thing we're going
[35:52.940 --> 35:53.940]  to do.
[35:53.940 --> 35:58.460]  Yeah, a lot of you will get sick, some will die a big deal, but we've got to get rid of
[35:58.460 --> 35:59.460]  the people.
[35:59.460 --> 36:01.860]  And he talks to you like he's Mr. Rogers.
[36:01.860 --> 36:07.100]  I remember one time they had these guys on Fox News, these medical doctors that tortured
[36:07.100 --> 36:11.940]  people, and we're like, well, we do it very professional and again, that's how this is
[36:11.940 --> 36:12.940]  all done.
[36:12.940 --> 36:16.900]  He's very old, it's very matter of fact, but oh, COVID is the scariest thing we ever
[36:16.900 --> 36:17.900]  saw.
[36:17.900 --> 36:21.460]  Two and a half million will be dead in two months every run for the hills.
[36:21.460 --> 36:26.340]  And then meanwhile, they exaggerated 25 times what it actually was.
[36:26.340 --> 36:29.380]  And most of that's exaggerated numbers that they had of other people.
[36:29.380 --> 36:30.380]  And you see the headlines.
[36:30.380 --> 36:35.900]  COVID was worse than we thought ABC News, CNN, Doctors Overwhelmed, so much worse than
[36:35.900 --> 36:36.900]  they thought.
[36:36.900 --> 36:42.900]  All of it, Hype, all of it BS and empty hospitals, but they're always real pneumonia is real
[36:42.900 --> 36:44.380]  flu is real death.
[36:44.380 --> 36:48.100]  And they're there saying all of that is this incredible.
[36:48.100 --> 36:54.180]  So let's go to just two minutes of the video, the full video is posted at ban.video, the
[36:54.180 --> 37:03.340]  full interview with this lady, this great nurse from October 4th, 2015, confirming vaccines
[37:03.340 --> 37:04.340]  killing babies.
[37:04.340 --> 37:08.900]  In fact, we posted the video in full to infowars.com, plastic nurse confirms vaccines, killing
[37:08.900 --> 37:09.900]  babies.
[37:09.900 --> 37:10.900]  Here it is.
[37:10.900 --> 37:13.020]  I think we are doing them too young.
[37:13.020 --> 37:18.180]  I think we are doing a way too many at once if you just look at how fast the schedule
[37:18.180 --> 37:19.180]  has grown.
[37:19.180 --> 37:25.220]  But I think what a lot of people don't realize in a closed space like a NICU is they've decided
[37:25.220 --> 37:30.700]  that we need to vaccinate these babies on time two months after they're born, bam, there
[37:30.700 --> 37:31.700]  it goes.
[37:31.700 --> 37:36.540]  If this baby could be four months early and still supposed to be inside their mother and
[37:36.540 --> 37:42.220]  weighing three or four pounds, that's a good point amount of vaccine as a 200 pound man
[37:42.220 --> 37:50.380]  and, and you and I've sat in a, in a room with all of our on-cult staff, physicians
[37:50.380 --> 37:55.740]  and practitioners, like, oh, wow, this is so embarrassing this 25 week or never actually
[37:55.740 --> 38:00.060]  required a breathing tube and going on the vent, you know, after he was born, he was
[38:00.060 --> 38:04.100]  so strong, but we gave him his two month vaccinations and he got intubated last night.
[38:04.100 --> 38:06.620]  It's so embarrassing, like it's funny.
[38:06.620 --> 38:07.620]  Wow.
[38:07.620 --> 38:11.220]  I mean, the step down units are calling the NICU saying, hey, we're going to go ahead
[38:11.220 --> 38:14.540]  and give these four babies their two month shots today.
[38:14.540 --> 38:19.300]  Make sure you have beds ready because we all know they're going to have increased breathing
[38:19.300 --> 38:24.940]  difficulty, feeding and digestion difficulty, apnea, you know, forgetting to breathe and
[38:24.940 --> 38:25.940]  brain and cardio.
[38:25.940 --> 38:26.940]  This is what goes on.
[38:26.940 --> 38:32.580]  And so the whole medical ethic of first do no harm just goes out the door so they can
[38:32.580 --> 38:35.580]  follow the vaccine company schedule.
[38:35.580 --> 38:41.180]  Somehow it's just everybody's on this straight, they're marching the line of this is what
[38:41.180 --> 38:42.820]  we need to do.
[38:42.820 --> 38:48.020]  And so now that I'm in private practice in the clinics, you just see these kids, they
[38:48.020 --> 38:54.220]  are so sick and it, and they come in sick and, and, and a lot of pediatricians are giving
[38:54.220 --> 38:58.540]  them vaccines while they're sick, even though that is a contraindication and they're just
[38:58.540 --> 39:02.180]  getting kicked while they're down over and over and over again.
[39:02.180 --> 39:07.740]  So chronic ear infections, of course, autism rate, one in 64, who knows what the number
[39:07.740 --> 39:15.620]  is going to be next, eczema, you know, all sorts of just asthma, all sorts of problems
[39:15.620 --> 39:16.620]  going on.
[39:16.620 --> 39:18.420]  And we just keep telling the line.
[39:18.420 --> 39:24.620]  I really don't understand kicking them while they're down, violating the, the indications
[39:24.620 --> 39:26.820]  on this because they put the fine print, don't do it.
[39:26.820 --> 39:29.860]  But the bioethics board says it because they want to kill kids.
[39:29.860 --> 39:30.860]  They're in a death cult.
[39:30.860 --> 39:33.540]  This is a sick cult of freaks.
[39:33.540 --> 39:35.860]  I've had family that worked highest levels of the medical field.
[39:35.860 --> 39:37.020]  They told me about this when I was a kid.
[39:37.020 --> 39:38.220]  I didn't believe it.
[39:38.220 --> 39:41.660]  But there's probably 10% of these doctors are part of this death cult and they literally
[39:41.660 --> 39:44.020]  get sexual arousal out of killing babies and others.
[39:44.020 --> 39:47.140]  You always hear about the doctors they catch, nurses they catch killing kids.
[39:47.140 --> 39:49.340]  Well then that's just part of the cult and they get caught.
[39:49.340 --> 39:52.340]  That Bill Gates is with the leader of the death cult and wants to kill you and your
[39:52.340 --> 39:53.340]  family.
[39:53.340 --> 40:00.820]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year 2021.
[40:00.820 --> 40:02.700]  I'm Alex Jones.
[40:02.700 --> 40:06.260]  I started in full wars but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[40:06.260 --> 40:10.460]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the
[40:10.460 --> 40:14.340]  planet is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on.
[40:14.340 --> 40:18.220]  That's why it's so important for those of you out there that have supported the broadcast
[40:18.220 --> 40:22.380]  and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out to realize
[40:22.380 --> 40:24.900]  how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.
[40:24.900 --> 40:26.860]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[40:26.860 --> 40:29.620]  Also as Christmas is almost here, don't wait.
[40:29.620 --> 40:34.380]  Go to your shopping at infowarstore.com, get amazing food, suitable to boost your immune
[40:34.380 --> 40:39.260]  system and make your life so much better overall for adults and children.

[40:50.340 --> 40:53.780]  and again thank you all for your support and Merry Christmas, God Bless.
[40:53.780 --> 40:59.500]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[40:59.500 --> 41:03.060]  There's a headline out from Zero Heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[41:03.060 --> 41:09.020]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December.
[41:09.020 --> 41:12.620]  It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[41:12.620 --> 41:18.460]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[41:18.460 --> 41:21.900]  Well see, that'll knock out all the small airlines and its holiday control and it's
[41:21.900 --> 41:26.300]  the same in every single industry and the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[41:26.300 --> 41:30.940]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[41:30.940 --> 41:34.460]  That's why the great stock market crash of $29 later turned out was engineered by some
[41:34.460 --> 41:35.540]  central banks.
[41:35.540 --> 41:38.620]  This is how the global estate control.
[41:38.620 --> 41:43.580]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare
[41:43.580 --> 41:47.980]  and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars
[41:47.980 --> 41:49.620]  in fake derivatives.
[41:49.620 --> 41:55.580]  Only the truth will set us free, infowars.com.
[41:55.580 --> 41:59.940]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[41:59.940 --> 42:06.460]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of the species
[42:06.460 --> 42:12.620]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats and that if we just sit
[42:12.620 --> 42:16.540]  back and enjoy the ride everything will be great but then they tell us that humans are
[42:16.540 --> 42:20.540]  obsolete, non-essential, and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out.
[42:20.540 --> 42:27.060]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive
[42:27.060 --> 42:31.420]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[42:31.420 --> 42:36.500]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote, animal kingdom
[42:36.500 --> 42:42.020]  is that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our own systems,
[42:42.020 --> 42:48.540]  we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[42:48.540 --> 42:52.300]  But instead we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans and
[42:52.300 --> 42:55.300]  us as cattle and that's the trick.
[42:55.300 --> 43:00.900]  You must guard your humanity, you must guard your children's humanity, you must guard the
[43:00.900 --> 43:03.100]  very genetic code of the planet.
[43:03.100 --> 43:07.820]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world but they are the ones
[43:07.820 --> 43:11.620]  that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[43:11.620 --> 43:17.180]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to
[43:17.180 --> 43:22.780]  the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target to madden with the mRNA
[43:22.780 --> 43:25.980]  vaccines which are not vaccines.
[43:25.980 --> 43:33.780]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome
[43:33.780 --> 43:36.420]  to take over your body's systems.
[43:36.420 --> 43:44.220]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[43:44.220 --> 43:47.100]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[43:47.100 --> 43:50.300]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting
[43:50.300 --> 43:53.180]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[43:53.180 --> 43:58.140]  It's all the same in the end.
[43:58.140 --> 44:21.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:21.020 --> 44:24.620]  Well you snap your fingers and you're inside the new world order.
[44:24.620 --> 44:30.500]  Whether you live in Europe or the US or Africa or Latin America or Asia, it's all the same
[44:30.500 --> 44:34.060]  global system, the same apps, the same big tech companies.
[44:34.060 --> 44:35.060]  They tell you you're not essential.
[44:35.060 --> 44:38.860]  They tell you you're a piece of garbage and they tell you that it's going to be mandatory
[44:38.860 --> 44:43.740]  to have a vaccine even though if you read the literature, anyone who's ever had a bad
[44:43.740 --> 44:52.380]  allergic response to peanuts, to bumblebees, to honeybees, to penicillin, they'll tell
[44:52.380 --> 44:53.380]  you.
[44:53.380 --> 44:58.660]  If you go into the hospital or go to a doctor, do you have a history of anaphylactic shock?
[44:58.660 --> 45:01.820]  I was just talking to my lawyer yesterday.
[45:01.820 --> 45:06.900]  He'd never had allergies, but he'd forgotten to take his penicillin after he got a tooth
[45:06.900 --> 45:08.100]  worked on.
[45:08.100 --> 45:12.540]  He doubled the dose and had a huge anaphylactic response and collapsed.
[45:12.540 --> 45:16.900]  Woke up a day later and the hospital almost died.
[45:16.900 --> 45:20.700]  And they've told him, you can't take vaccines now.
[45:20.700 --> 45:25.020]  We had a lady work here.
[45:25.020 --> 45:30.140]  She was going to go again to Vietnam.
[45:30.140 --> 45:32.180]  And this is about five years ago.
[45:32.180 --> 45:33.380]  They told her, take all these shots.
[45:33.380 --> 45:34.380]  She took them.
[45:34.380 --> 45:38.300]  She collapsed, had medical problems, shut down her immune system.
[45:38.300 --> 45:42.540]  For six months, she wore a mask here in the office and then she went and got another job.
[45:42.540 --> 45:44.620]  And by the way, never got to go to Vietnam.
[45:44.620 --> 45:52.780]  Again, two people that work here who get really mad if I even hint who they are, lost babies
[45:52.780 --> 45:58.620]  that were totally healthy on their second round of shots.
[45:58.620 --> 46:00.620]  One was a boy, one was a girl.
[46:00.620 --> 46:03.140]  These are real people.
[46:03.140 --> 46:05.540]  This is real.
[46:05.540 --> 46:10.340]  My grandmother was told she got polio from the vaccine from her doctor here in Austin
[46:10.340 --> 46:13.700]  in the 1950s.
[46:13.700 --> 46:17.220]  She lived a tortured life after that.
[46:17.220 --> 46:18.340]  She was a beauty queen.
[46:18.340 --> 46:20.340]  She was a wonderful person.
[46:20.340 --> 46:25.140]  It tortured the hell out of her for the rest of her life.
[46:25.140 --> 46:31.340]  So they're normalizing coming after you with not even the old-fashioned tainted vaccines
[46:31.340 --> 46:33.540]  with cancer viruses and the rest of it.
[46:33.540 --> 46:38.420]  They're coming at you with a genetic re-engineering system.
[46:38.420 --> 46:44.020]  And then Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter, when you put up the head of the EU advisory
[46:44.020 --> 46:50.020]  board or you put up the former head science officer of Pfizer saying this targets the
[46:50.020 --> 46:53.100]  uterus, they are banning it.
[46:53.100 --> 46:57.580]  They are aiding and abetting Joseph Mengele level depopulation.
[46:57.580 --> 47:01.620]  They are violently attacking us now.
[47:01.620 --> 47:03.740]  They are not liberals that are misguided.
[47:03.740 --> 47:11.060]  They are eugenicist death cult members at Google, at Facebook, at Twitter, run by Microsoft
[47:11.060 --> 47:18.580]  and IBM that created them all as sub-front companies with a eugenics cult inside British
[47:18.580 --> 47:19.580]  U.S. intelligence.
[47:19.580 --> 47:28.300]  And it's not our whole government, but this is a governmental directed system.
[47:28.300 --> 47:31.620]  And my dad, I knew, was involved in a lot of weird stuff.
[47:31.620 --> 47:42.660]  But he never told me any of this until Endgame was almost done in 2007, when we were going
[47:42.660 --> 47:43.660]  to a ballet recital.
[47:43.660 --> 47:51.420]  I told the story 30 times, probably, for my first daughter.
[47:51.420 --> 47:58.500]  And my mom and dad sat there and watched the end of the movie, that I was just finishing
[47:58.500 --> 47:59.500]  the end.
[47:59.500 --> 48:01.940]  I make these films in linear.
[48:01.940 --> 48:08.340]  And she goes, David, that's not true, because she knew, and he goes, oh, it's absolutely
[48:08.340 --> 48:09.860]  true, it's worse than that.
[48:09.860 --> 48:17.020]  So on the way to the ballet recital 20 minutes away, you went ahead and just told us all
[48:17.020 --> 48:18.020]  about it.
[48:18.020 --> 48:20.500]  And it's something all of us already know.
[48:20.500 --> 48:26.260]  But they were recruiting the smartest high school students, there were six of them out
[48:26.260 --> 48:32.500]  of Texas, the group he was in, planned to at UT, and after he'd been in that for a while,
[48:32.500 --> 48:37.220]  we're going to talk about intern where you give people coffee, like MD Anderson Cancer
[48:37.220 --> 48:41.180]  Research Facility when you're 15, 16 years old, seeing people with their lower mandibles
[48:41.180 --> 48:44.620]  removed, people that signed on to trials of lethal stuff.
[48:44.620 --> 48:50.580]  I mean, my dad was put right into the program, and then the head of the botany department
[48:50.580 --> 48:56.540]  calls him in when he's 18 and says, we're set up a world government, we're the elite,
[48:56.540 --> 49:00.100]  we're going to wipe out all the dumb people, are you on board?
[49:00.100 --> 49:05.420]  Didn't tell me that till 2008 or wherever it was.
[49:05.420 --> 49:10.860]  So folks, this is the real world, and you can sit there and play games with it and rearrange
[49:10.860 --> 49:13.740]  deck chairs on the Titanic.
[49:13.740 --> 49:18.700]  But we engage in real wide spectrum analysis of systems and what the governing class is
[49:18.700 --> 49:23.980]  into, and we know their number, and now everything we told you, they're externalizing, and they're
[49:23.980 --> 49:26.420]  doing this.
[49:26.420 --> 49:31.140]  And you look at Congress, there are always 100 steps behind, because they're lawyers
[49:31.140 --> 49:36.380]  caught in their own little process believing like Chinese emperors, they're in charge when
[49:36.380 --> 49:39.100]  they're not.
[49:39.100 --> 49:45.980]  Congress lives in the Forbidden City, and this is an allegory or a parallel to where
[49:45.980 --> 49:49.140]  we are now.
[49:49.140 --> 49:53.020]  You go back to the Chin Dynasty and all the rest of it, I probably only read 20 books
[49:53.020 --> 49:57.020]  on Chinese history, I should read more.
[49:57.020 --> 49:59.500]  Not exaggerated, that's a small amount for me to read on that subject.
[49:59.500 --> 50:04.140]  I got too much into European history, too much into Mesoamerica and all sorts of other
[50:04.140 --> 50:08.220]  ones, but part of the world in Japan that I have on China, and China is so central
[50:08.220 --> 50:12.300]  and important, but it's the oldest centralized civilization.
[50:12.300 --> 50:18.620]  And it started about 4,000 years ago, over about 1,000 years, the kind of legalist class
[50:18.620 --> 50:25.460]  had learned how to tell the royalty, you're so powerful, and you're so important that
[50:25.460 --> 50:30.180]  no one can see you, you're a god, and you can't wipe your own butt, and you can't take
[50:30.180 --> 50:34.140]  out your own trash, you can't feed yourself, so you've got to have your feet bound because
[50:34.140 --> 50:37.620]  you've got to be carried because you're a god, you never touch the ground, you've got
[50:37.620 --> 50:42.500]  to wear little shoes so you can't walk to prove it, you've got to have long fingernails
[50:42.500 --> 50:48.660]  so you can't feed yourself, and after about 1,000 years of them slowly domesticating them
[50:48.660 --> 50:52.780]  and teaching them that they were elitist, they finally had literally mentally retarded
[50:52.780 --> 50:58.740]  Chinese emperors who would just sit there and couldn't wipe their own butts, and storytellers
[50:58.740 --> 51:03.780]  would come in and read them books all day, and then the legalist class, the power behind
[51:03.780 --> 51:06.260]  the throne, ran China.
[51:06.260 --> 51:11.300]  Well, Congress is almost like that, they don't know how things work, they don't know how
[51:11.300 --> 51:17.060]  things operate, they don't even know what's going on, and we're totally, they're all lawyers
[51:17.060 --> 51:22.340]  and fancy suits and ties, and big tech knows how to come lie to them and pay them money
[51:22.340 --> 51:26.600]  and make them feel important, and fly them around on jets, they're idiots, they're lightweight
[51:26.600 --> 51:29.840]  morons.
[51:29.840 --> 51:35.820]  This is the data, this is how the world works, this is the nightmare, and now I always knew
[51:35.820 --> 51:41.020]  that when it finally went operational, people would have heard what I said and would go,
[51:41.020 --> 51:48.300]  oh my God, it's true, and we are seeing a big awakening, but it isn't about myself getting
[51:48.300 --> 51:57.300]  vindicated, it is about the reality of what you are up against.
[51:57.300 --> 52:01.980]  They are telling all the sheeple that they are obsolete, they're telling them that everything
[52:01.980 --> 52:05.060]  will be fine, they'll be able to go outside again, have a job again, if you take the
[52:05.060 --> 52:06.060]  shot.
[52:06.060 --> 52:09.500]  Now they're like, no, the shot's coming, but that's not enough, you still, another year
[52:09.500 --> 52:14.440]  of you're non-essential, so they're totally domesticated, never working in to be totally
[52:14.440 --> 52:21.060]  obsolete to then continue to take vaccines that totally sterilize them, and at a sick
[52:21.060 --> 52:25.980]  level of survival of the fittest, I'm like, yeah, if you're dumb enough to buy into this,
[52:25.980 --> 52:29.580]  you deserve to be sterilized, I mean, and I'm really struggling with this, not because
[52:29.580 --> 52:35.060]  if you can't beat them, join them, if the public fails this test, I guess Bill Gates
[52:35.060 --> 52:42.020]  is actually right, I mean, if you people really let them do this to you, and let them kill
[52:42.020 --> 52:47.340]  babies with vaccines, and let them do all that, I just want to say something, to the
[52:47.340 --> 52:54.780]  political class serving us that thinks they're cute, you're idiots, because there is a God
[52:54.780 --> 53:00.500]  in this universe, and there will be metaphysical punishment for what you've been involved in,
[53:00.500 --> 53:05.860]  and then if you look at Bill Gates and his family, the Asters and all, they're horrible
[53:05.860 --> 53:09.860]  people, their children are horrible, they're totally unhappy, they are just murderous creatures
[53:09.860 --> 53:13.860]  that want power, they're not trying to guard the earth, they just like the power and control
[53:13.860 --> 53:14.860]  over it.
[53:14.860 --> 53:19.900]  All right, I'm going to go to break, I'm not fun about Bill Gates or Ted Turner or George
[53:19.900 --> 53:24.100]  Soros or all the same group, the good club as they call it, I'm funded by you, and where
[53:24.100 --> 53:27.380]  do my blocket pockets go, I guess Owen took them in his studio, we've got these great
[53:27.380 --> 53:33.020]  little Faraday cages, they're like 99% good, if you're right under a cell tower it'll still
[53:33.020 --> 53:36.380]  beam through it and get your location, but with the contact tracers and the globalists,
[53:36.380 --> 53:38.940]  we just got a bunch of these in this week, they were sold out for months, they're the
[53:38.940 --> 53:44.100]  highest quality, they're $19.95, people sell this exact same unit for $29.95 all day long,
[53:44.100 --> 53:47.100]  the reason we sell so many is we sell at the lowest price, you're going to find a high
[53:47.100 --> 53:51.420]  quality blocket pocket for your droid or iPhone anywhere, you put it away, when you want to
[53:51.420 --> 53:54.900]  use it you do, it doesn't matter if you turn your location services off, they're still
[53:54.900 --> 53:57.980]  tracking you, it's hard wired in, that's all admitted, so you've got to put it in a Faraday
[53:57.980 --> 54:02.260]  cage, when you sleep at night, when you travel, when you go places, when you do something
[54:02.260 --> 54:07.420]  private, when you're going to do whatever it is you're doing, they are using the info
[54:07.420 --> 54:08.420]  against you.

[55:44.660 --> 55:48.820]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[55:48.820 --> 55:53.740]  redistribute wealth, and create a planetary universal income, which of course, the United
[55:53.740 --> 55:57.500]  Nations and Global Corporations will control through the apps on your phone, and finally
[55:57.500 --> 55:58.700]  a chip under your skin.
[55:58.700 --> 56:04.660]  It's all now completely official, part of the UN great reset of the Davos Group, and
[56:04.660 --> 56:09.420]  Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[56:09.420 --> 56:14.060]  Foundation, all the rest of them, at 10 to 21, at 10 to 2030, it's here, and only gets
[56:14.060 --> 56:19.540]  worse like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[56:19.540 --> 56:25.380]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil, and stopping
[56:25.380 --> 56:26.860]  abortion.
[56:26.860 --> 56:32.300]  We must start valuing human life again, we must start saying that we are not expendable,
[56:32.300 --> 56:36.100]  that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[56:36.100 --> 56:41.660]  Until we do that, we are all slaves, we must stand up and declare our basic God-given human
[56:41.660 --> 57:11.580]  rights now.
[57:11.580 --> 57:23.540]  All right, we're back, we've got Ezra Levant joining us next segment, he did a foyer
[57:23.540 --> 57:30.540]  request, he's being harassed by Justin Tradone, the guy that said the great resets here, let's
[57:30.540 --> 57:35.300]  get that clip right next segment, for the UN takeover, and they got a bunch of documents,
[57:35.300 --> 57:38.980]  I guess they accidentally didn't redact it, these documents were already public, but they
[57:38.980 --> 57:43.180]  got a bunch of documents, 30-something pages, about Chinese troops coming in to learn the
[57:43.180 --> 57:47.500]  secrets of the Canadian military, the Canadian military secretly blocked it, and Trudeau
[57:47.500 --> 57:52.340]  threw a temper tantrum, because he's a Chai Khan globalist, that's all coming up next
[57:52.340 --> 57:57.860]  segment, and it ties into Swallow's well, and ties into Hunter Biden, in fact get that
[57:57.860 --> 58:02.100]  Hunter Biden clip with him, I met with the top Chinese spy chief, I'm under criminal
[58:02.100 --> 58:06.540]  investigation, my daddy, my poppy poppy.
[58:06.540 --> 58:11.780]  So Ezra Levant joining us next segment, let's just play a few of these clips though, they
[58:11.780 --> 58:15.660]  all go together, this is a New York lawmaker introduces Bill to make vaccine mandatory,
[58:15.660 --> 58:18.700]  of course they're not going to take it, so there's always loopholes, where if you have
[58:18.700 --> 58:22.620]  an allergy or skillness or whatever you don't have to, but they won't tell the public that,
[58:22.620 --> 58:28.340]  it's all about fraud upon fraud, violence and urban code, you name it, and then let's
[58:28.340 --> 58:34.180]  play the clip of Kerry Mullis, the PCR inventor, who right before all this started said Fauci
[58:34.180 --> 58:37.440]  was a fraud, and they shouldn't be getting ready to use it, and then he mysteriously
[58:37.440 --> 58:43.260]  died, another big whistleblower just died, who said she would never commit suicide to
[58:43.260 --> 58:47.900]  expose big pharma in the vaccines, but let's play the local newscast, and then let's play
[58:47.900 --> 58:50.460]  this inventor PCR test.
[58:50.460 --> 58:55.580]  We've all been waiting for a vaccine, because that is part of the solution to moving our
[58:55.580 --> 58:56.900]  lives ahead.
[58:56.900 --> 59:01.300]  And state assembly member Linda Rosenthal of the Upper West Side has introduced a
[59:01.300 --> 59:06.660]  bill requiring most New Yorkers get a COVID-19 vaccine.
[59:06.660 --> 59:13.060]  She says if at least 70% of the population does not get the vaccine on their own, then
[59:13.060 --> 59:14.980]  it should be mandatory.
[59:14.980 --> 59:19.780]  Then the State Department of Health would have the ability to say that more people have
[59:19.780 --> 59:23.700]  to get it, and they would set the rules and they would set the structure.
[59:23.700 --> 59:28.860]  Labor and employment lawyer Helen Rella says your boss could force you to get a COVID-19
[59:28.860 --> 59:29.860]  vaccine.
[59:29.860 --> 59:37.140]  This is literally tyranny, it's link to sterilization, this is 1984, this is Nazi Germany, this
[59:37.140 --> 59:38.540]  isn't a drill, it isn't a game.
[59:38.540 --> 59:43.100]  Notice he said before we can move forward, they're going to keep everything locked down
[59:43.100 --> 59:47.460]  and then say oh sorry we can't open things because there's still COVID cases, which they
[59:47.460 --> 59:51.780]  make up by turning up the test, and then they never let you go, and then they blame those
[59:51.780 --> 59:56.300]  of us that don't submit to them to why they kept things locked down to vertically integrate
[59:56.300 --> 59:58.180]  with a great reset and take over.
[59:58.180 --> 1:00:01.860]  Here's the inventor of the PCR test, they obviously killed, right before all this came
[1:00:01.860 --> 1:00:04.860]  out.
[1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:11.580]  What is it about humanity that wants to go to all the details and stuff, and these guys
[1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:14.660]  like Fauci get up there and start talking, you know, he doesn't know anything really
[1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:18.820]  about anything, and I'd say that to his face, nothing.
[1:00:18.820 --> 1:00:22.500]  The man thinks you can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope and
[1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:25.260]  if it's got a virus in there you'll know it.
[1:00:25.260 --> 1:00:29.780]  He doesn't understand electron microscopy, he doesn't understand medicine, he should
[1:00:29.780 --> 1:00:32.540]  not be in a position like he's in.
[1:00:32.540 --> 1:00:36.420]  Most of those guys up there on the top are just total administrative people and they
[1:00:36.420 --> 1:00:39.700]  don't know anything about what's going on on the bottom.
[1:00:39.700 --> 1:00:45.220]  Those guys have got an agenda, which is not what we would like them to have, being that
[1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:48.620]  we pay for them to take care of our health in someone.
[1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:53.460]  They've got a personal kind of agenda, they make up their own rules as they go, they change
[1:00:53.460 --> 1:00:57.300]  them when they want to, and they smugly, like Tony Fauci does not mind going on television
[1:00:57.300 --> 1:01:01.980]  in front of the people that pay his salary and lie directly into the camera.
[1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:06.460]  You can't expect the sheep to really respect the best and the brightest.
[1:01:06.460 --> 1:01:09.340]  They don't know the difference, really.
[1:01:09.340 --> 1:01:17.220]  I mean, I like humans, don't get me wrong, but basically there's a vast majority of them
[1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:24.340]  do not possess the ability to judge who is and who isn't a really good scientist.
[1:01:24.340 --> 1:01:28.900]  I mean, that's a problem, that's a main problem, I think, with science, I'd say in this century
[1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:35.220]  because science is being judged by people, funding is being done by people who don't
[1:01:35.220 --> 1:01:36.220]  understand it.
[1:01:36.220 --> 1:01:37.220]  Who do we trust?
[1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:38.220]  Fauci.
[1:01:38.220 --> 1:01:41.900]  Fauci doesn't know enough to, you know, if Fauci wants to get on television with somebody
[1:01:41.900 --> 1:01:45.820]  who knows a little bit about this stuff and debate him, he could easily do it because
[1:01:45.820 --> 1:01:47.820]  he's been asked.
[1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:50.820]  I mean, I've had a lot of people.
[1:01:50.820 --> 1:02:19.820]  And then we're going to add and pause the clip I wanted.
[1:02:19.820 --> 1:02:43.860]  Get it back.
[1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:48.400]  can kill you, absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous, towards
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:03:13.400]  something that is incredibly dangerous, because the media says it's safe, they do it.
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:19.520]  In the hour number two, broadcasting worldwide, I am your host, Alex Jones. And the quickening
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:26.120]  is here, the alignment of the political, cultural, spiritual, economic planets is upon us. Wow,
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:30.880]  China, China, China. You know, we heard about Trump, he was this Russian agent and hookers
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:36.160]  were in St. Petersburg, pissing in his face. And none of it was true. It was all fake.
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:41.920]  It came out, the writer of the dossier steel admitted it was not true, was all funded by
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:50.000]  Hillary Clinton and other deep state operatives like George Herbert Walker Bush's son, Jeb Bush.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.360]  But when it comes to China, and the Bidens and the Clintons, my goodness, and Swallowswell
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:04.680]  and Diane Feinstein, her main assistant being the Chinese Communist agent. And we've got
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:13.360]  Biden saying every aspect of American life should be run by the Communist Chinese and
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:18.320]  his son, we'll play the clip coming up next segment, saying that I met with the head of
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:23.560]  Communist Chinese intelligence and now that the FBI is investigating me and my dad, they
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:30.160]  gave me billions of dollars, it's all recorded, it's all real, it's all smoking gun, just
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:40.320]  like the election fraud. And then you add this giant 500 ton cherry Chinese military
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:45.840]  since troops to Canada PLA training with Canadian forces documents show. And when the military
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:51.240]  said they're stealing our secrets and kicked them out or canceled it, Trudeau freaked out
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:56.080]  explosive documents Canadian Prime Minister requested Chinese troops be stationed in Canada.
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:02.200]  That is from the rebel news dot com secret military documents Trudeau invited Chinese
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:06.600]  troops to train at Canadian military bases. And the left will spend it the 30 plus pages
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:10.920]  of secret documents like, Oh, big deal. Oh, really, the military said it was an actual
[1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:15.520]  security breach. The military said it shouldn't happen. And Trudeau blew up and said, I am
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:22.680]  the Prime Minister, you will do what I say. So this is simply incredible because they're
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:27.360]  not just stealing your secrets. They're offering you money. They're buying you off every Chinese
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:31.440]  businessman that's part of the party or under the party and every member of the Chinese
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:38.840]  military is an asset is an agent in the US military. 99% of people are not a spy or less
[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:44.280]  out of 5,000 people in the US military, Air Force Army Marines, none of them are spies.
[1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:49.960]  Okay, even if you're in psy ops, very few are operational in the field. Okay. But if
[1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:54.000]  you were Nazi Germany, all you know, a lot of you were or if you're in an authoritarian
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:00.120]  Soviet system, a 30 year people are same thing with the with the tricom so Ezra Levant of
[1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:05.000]  rebel media major journalist, who's you can hear to tell you how he got these unredacted
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.880]  documents that no one else ever got. And just what this means and how big this is. I mean,
[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:14.520]  I thought the last thing he broke with Trudeau saying, we're in the global reset for the
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:18.440]  new world order, the UN will run everything, you know, that that was public. But as we're
[1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:23.200]  found it made it popular. That's really what's important. And now I thought that was the biggest
[1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:28.520]  Trudeau trader is faux pas now this. So as we tell us about the Providence, where this
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:33.840]  is going, I mean, how they're trying to suppress this with all the other swallows, well news,
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:37.680]  with the sex operative controlling him, the congressman that was always saying Trump was
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:41.960]  a Russian agent with no proof and and Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and his brother, all under
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:46.840]  criminal investigation, we now know, which we broke months ago, when the audio tapes
[1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:53.200]  came out in the laptop, the media tried to ignore, but this is breaking news in the mainstream.
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:57.360]  What's the best way to cover this thing? Sure, Alex, thanks for having me on. This is the
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:03.320]  biggest story I've ever covered in my life. I will never have a story this big, this important,
[1:07:03.320 --> 1:07:09.000]  this dramatic again. And it's incredible. And it started a year and a half ago when
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:16.360]  I saw a little snippet reported on a Russian state broadcaster called Sputnik that Canada
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:24.680]  had sent a delegation to participate in China's Navy 70 anniversary celebration. I thought,
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:31.120]  why is Canada celebrating the 70th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army Navy? And
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:35.200]  I don't know if you know this, Alex, but just a few months before that, China grabbed two
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:41.160]  Canadian civilians off the streets and has held them hostage ever since. So it's gross
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:47.000]  that a NATO member and a NORAD member like Canada would celebrate the People's Liberation
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:53.480]  Army celebration at all. But this was just months after China kidnapped two Canadians.
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:57.480]  So I saw news of this nowhere else other than on this Russian site. I did what's called
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:04.080]  an access to information request, a freedom of information request. They delayed 19 months,
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:09.880]  but they finally answered. And yes, they confirmed that Trudeau sent someone to celebrate the
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:16.880]  Chinese Navy. But that was the least of it because they sent 34 pages of internal documents
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:22.680]  that I never actually even asked for. And instead of blacking them out as secret documents
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:29.560]  usually are, they only grade them out. You can read every single word. And I put them
[1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:33.360]  up on the internet at the Chinafiles.com. You can take a look. But let me just tell
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:37.920]  you the craziest thing in there. I did not know any of this. And I like to think I follow
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:45.760]  the news closely. In 2019, there were not one, not two, not five, not 10, there were
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:55.080]  18 exchanges between the Canadian Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army, 18, where
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:59.560]  we were sending our Canadian troops to China, where China was sending their troops here.
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:07.320]  And you're correct. One of them, the cold weather training at CFB boarding, our Canadian
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:12.960]  forces base, sorry, Padawawa in Ontario. There's a Canadian forces base in Ontario, specialist
[1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:19.600]  in cold weather warfare. Our Canadian military canceled that. As soon as Trudeau heard that
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:25.240]  the military canceled that, he raged at them. He sent a memo to them saying, never cancel
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:30.760]  a partnership with China again without my permission. And on this cancellation, we have
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:36.720]  to work with you on crafting the language so that Chinese don't lose face. So yes, we
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:41.840]  believe that cold weather warfare training was eventually cancelled by the military.
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:47.960]  They got help for it from Trudeau. But the real news here is that there were 17 other
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:55.360]  military exchanges, including Chinese one star and two star generals coming to Canada
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:01.640]  to study in our war colleges. If you go to these documents, the most interesting pages
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:06.120]  are the last two pages. I see you're scrolling them on your screen right now. Go to the last
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:13.920]  two pages. You'll see a list of all 18 exchanges. I got to throw one more thing at you, Alex.
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:21.800]  In October of 2019, in the city of Wuhan, maybe you've heard of it, that China held
[1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:29.520]  the military world games. It's like the Olympics for soldiers, huge propaganda coup for China.
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:37.160]  China sent nearly 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel for nine days to Wuhan. Now you
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:42.760]  got your questions about the virus. Let's put those aside. You got the propaganda bonanza
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:48.840]  for China. Let's put that aside. Why on earth would you send 200 physically fit young men
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:55.880]  and women, most of them single for nine days to China, where they'll be wind and dined
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:11:02.640]  and wooed, Swalwell style? At the very least, China will know a lot more about those 200
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:08.080]  soldiers forever. And at most, maybe one or two of them will be turned, extorted, entrapped
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:10.280]  in a honey trap. Who says 200 young soldiers?
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:14.840]  Sir, you would never send regular soldiers. You would only send spies to infiltrate them.
[1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:18.200]  That's why they always have the joke, James Bond having sex with the other operatives,
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:21.880]  because both sides are spying. You don't send regular troops into a situation like that.
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:25.960]  And that's the thing. On the Canadian side, when we were getting these people coming to
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.640]  Canada to study our systems, they're not sending regular GIs. They're sending probably people
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:36.920]  with photographic memory, people who have studied our systems and are actually just
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:43.400]  trying to crack our codes and processes and strategies. The crazy thing is we're inviting
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:48.280]  them in. We're sponsoring them. We're letting them wander around on our military bases
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:53.800]  without a minder. And this is all from Canada, which is your best friend and ally. What the
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:59.160]  hell are we doing? So here's the thing. When we cancelled the cold weather warfare exercise
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:03.120]  with China, and this is right there in the documents, this is why these documents are
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:10.520]  so incredible, 34 pages unredacted, secret, they're marked secret. Some of them are marked
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:17.960]  Canadian eyes only. So when our soldiers said, no, no, we got to cancel this military winter
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:24.200]  warfare training, the Prime Minister said, why? And so the military said, well, you know,
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:28.680]  knowledge transfer, and we've had complaints from allies. And you can see this email exchange.
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:32.840]  You can see you stay right there. And also want to ask you did a foyer for one thing,
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:36.680]  got something else. I think it's pretty safe to say this is a rebellion against reason
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.840]  against Trudeau that they leaked you classified stuff. That's why it's in gray because they
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:44.640]  never got classified. They recommend it be blacked out. You were given a secret document.
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:48.840]  The only areas blacked out, you decided to do so to protect the innocent. This is huge
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:54.960]  thoughts. We're right back. Three months ago, we sold out of our privacy pouches. The reason
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:00.200]  we sold out is they are super high quality. And it's all over the news that the UN and
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:04.640]  the Clintons and Microsoft and others of contact tracers are tracking everywhere you go and
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:09.520]  everything you do. They admit it's a cover for bringing in their casual society AI system
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:13.920]  of total control. So to block the UN to block the globalist to get the habit of realizing
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.480]  what a surveillance system phones are, everybody needs a privacy pocket. They fit almost all
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:23.960]  sizes of droids and iPhones from small to big. They also make a great gift to educate friends
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:28.480]  and family about what's going on. Now, again, there's lots of privacy pocket type systems
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:33.440]  out there. Most of them are about a 90% effective. We found a model that's actually pretty inexpensive
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:38.400]  and has around 99% effectiveness right under a cell tower. It'll still blast through the
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:44.120]  Faraday cage. They're at infowarstore.com at $19.95. This exact same system is sold everywhere
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:48.120]  else for $29. It's still a great deal. We sell a lot of these. We have the best price.
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:50.120]  Give us a great Christmas gift at infowarstore.com.
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:14:00.160]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot. Well, info wars is white
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:05.240]  hot right now. World government, globalist forces trying to take over the United States

[1:14:54.220 --> 1:15:11.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:17.960]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:24.420]  Well, this is 100 times crazier than a Tom Clancy novel. We have the co-author Tom Clancy,
[1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:30.980]  Dr. Stephen Cheney joining us next hour. This is the real world. And I've been interviewing
[1:15:30.980 --> 1:15:34.340]  Ezra Revant for probably six, seven years. I've known who he is for over a decade. The
[1:15:34.340 --> 1:15:38.540]  guy's a great journalist, an amazing person. I sleep good at night knowing he's out there,
[1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:42.340]  literally. Now, you know, most guests, I don't have those type of platitudes, but he really
[1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:46.420]  kicks ass. To have him say this is the biggest thing he's ever broke because it exposes all
[1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:50.620]  this clandestine training no one knew about. And the military saying we're concerned and
[1:15:50.620 --> 1:15:55.500]  allies are concerned and Trudeau flipping out like the little globalist he is. I mean,
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:59.340]  Ezra, when you say this is huge, this is seismic. You were getting to a big point though when
[1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:01.500]  you got cut off by the break.
[1:16:01.500 --> 1:16:06.740]  No problem. Listen, I want to tell you, you know, in my own way, this was my bohemian
[1:16:06.740 --> 1:16:11.540]  grove. When you went there and saw with your eyes, what you always sensed, then you knew
[1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:16.380]  you were on the right track. It confirmed your suspicions. Same thing here. I did not
[1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:23.540]  know how pervasive the anti-American nature of our militia, of our bureaucracy was and
[1:16:23.540 --> 1:16:29.180]  the pro-China nature. See, we knew that Justin Trudeau, like his father, Pierre Trudeau,
[1:16:29.180 --> 1:16:33.380]  the prime minister of Canada a generation ago, we knew he had a soft spot for communist
[1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:39.820]  regimes. The Trudeaus loved Castro. Pierre Trudeau went to the Soviet Union on a holiday,
[1:16:39.820 --> 1:16:44.420]  said Siberia was land of the future. So we knew that the Trudeau family had a soft spot
[1:16:44.420 --> 1:16:49.580]  for tyranny, but we did not know how deep it went into the bureaucracy. Can I play
[1:16:49.580 --> 1:16:53.820]  for you a clip? I sent it to your producer. When Trudeau was running before he was prime
[1:16:53.820 --> 1:16:59.700]  minister, he was asked a question at a fundraiser that he wasn't prepared for. It wasn't scripted.
[1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:04.860]  So he actually answered from the heart. He was asked, what country in the world do you
[1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:11.620]  most admire? Listen to what he says and his explanation for it. I think you've got the
[1:17:11.620 --> 1:17:22.140]  clip. Take a listen. Here it is. All of admiration I actually have for China. Because their basic
[1:17:22.140 --> 1:17:29.660]  dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime. Wow, dictatorship.
[1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:33.900]  Not the fact that they have hundreds of millions of slaves and that we've cut our market down
[1:17:33.900 --> 1:17:38.380]  and given it to them with one side of deals. Wow, that is, I forgot that clip. That is
[1:17:38.380 --> 1:17:43.900]  a profound statement. Well, I mean, I admire many things about China, too. I admire their
[1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:50.740]  history, their, their intelligence, their culture, their language, their food. There's
[1:17:50.740 --> 1:17:57.620]  many things to admire about China. But what was the one thing he named? Their basic dictatorship.
[1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:00.860]  That's the one thing he liked. That's the one thing I hate about them. That's the one
[1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:05.980]  thing they love about them. And so I thought, well, maybe that was a flourish, an off script
[1:18:05.980 --> 1:18:11.780]  comment. But look at this. I sent you one more clip. This was Trudeau's handpicked ambassador
[1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:19.460]  from Canada to China. During the events we've been talking about, the exchanges between
[1:18:19.460 --> 1:18:25.300]  the People's Liberation and the Canadian Armed Forces. Listen to Trudeau's ambassador talk
[1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:31.420]  about what his marching orders were to China. Take a listen. In 24 hours of arriving in
[1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:38.660]  China, I was invited to present my credentials to President Xi Jinping, and I conveyed to
[1:18:38.660 --> 1:18:44.540]  him a message from our prime minister that can be summarized in three words, more, more,
[1:18:44.540 --> 1:18:52.900]  more, or in Mandarin. So this is a total capitulation to a government that admits they've killed
[1:18:52.900 --> 1:18:57.700]  over 100 million of their own people that does secret experimentation and has millions
[1:18:57.700 --> 1:19:02.900]  in death camps. I mean, there's not much stuff worse than Hitler or Stalin, but they seem
[1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:06.580]  to have found it and they're in love with it. And this is Trudeau pledging allegiance
[1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:07.580]  to it.
[1:19:07.580 --> 1:19:14.580]  And the thing is, I thought maybe these were just expressions of enthusiasm for public
[1:19:14.580 --> 1:19:21.500]  consumption. No, no, no. These 34 pages of unredacted secret military documents show
[1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:27.980]  that this is being pushed through the entire foreign affairs apparatus of Canada. And what's
[1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:32.740]  so crazy to me is Canada and the United States are the closest friends. We share the world's
[1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:37.660]  largest undefended border. Culturally, we're very similar. Historically, very similar.
[1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:44.500]  We fought in World War I and II together. We fought in Korea together. So many friendships,
[1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:50.220]  so many commonalities. You're our greatest friend and ally. And frankly, your military
[1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:56.180]  has subsidized our way of life because you defend the entire continent. And to watch
[1:19:56.180 --> 1:20:04.380]  these bureaucrats suck up to China and disparage the Trump administration, because when the
[1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:09.020]  general, the chief of the defense staff in Canada said he wanted to cancel this winter
[1:20:09.020 --> 1:20:14.940]  warfare training, the prime minister's office and his staff said, who was it who ratted
[1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:22.740]  this out? Who objected? And the army said, well, our allies, sir, who was it? Was it
[1:20:22.740 --> 1:20:28.820]  Trump? Because it was as if Trudeau was saying, if the Australians or the New Zealanders or
[1:20:28.820 --> 1:20:36.340]  the Brits objected, okay, fine, but they specifically call out, quote, the Trump administration.
[1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:41.580]  And I say to you, Alex, every letter sent by the prime minister's side in this internal
[1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:48.180]  battle could have been written by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. It was so anti-American
[1:20:48.180 --> 1:20:49.180]  and pro-China.
[1:20:49.180 --> 1:20:54.340]  We know what happens. The globalists use Communist China as a base. They give them most favorite
[1:20:54.340 --> 1:20:58.020]  status. They set up where they can operate however they want so that no one can compete
[1:20:58.020 --> 1:21:01.740]  with them. They put environmental rules on us, including Canadians, where we can't compete.
[1:21:01.740 --> 1:21:07.100]  So all our jobs go there. And then the bureaucrats sit there and basically sell us out even further
[1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:11.580]  for money and for funding. And now they're a great reset. China's open for business,
[1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:15.860]  but Canada, the U.S., Europe isn't. And then they're saying, oh, the great reset with the
[1:21:15.860 --> 1:21:21.620]  Vatican will now all give you universal guaranteed incomes. This is, this is siege. We're economically
[1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:26.300]  shut down. China's open for business. The left is all invested in China. Their takeover
[1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:31.220]  is very clear. The CFR admits all of this. The Council of Foreign Relations admits it's
[1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:36.140]  the Chinese century. That's the jewel in the crown of world government. Here's Trudeau
[1:21:36.140 --> 1:21:39.580]  a few months ago talking about the great reset.
[1:21:39.580 --> 1:21:43.820]  Building back better means getting support to the most vulnerable while maintaining our
[1:21:43.820 --> 1:21:50.660]  momentum on reaching the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs. Canada is here
[1:21:50.660 --> 1:21:57.620]  to listen and to help. This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset. This is our chance
[1:21:57.620 --> 1:22:02.740]  to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually
[1:22:02.740 --> 1:22:08.940]  address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality, and climate change.
[1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:13.460]  Which are all buzzwords for power grabs central government. Shut us down. Leave China open.
[1:22:13.460 --> 1:22:18.140]  Ezra, incredible. This story I know has gone mega viral. Where do you think it goes from
[1:22:18.140 --> 1:22:19.140]  here?
[1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:25.180]  Well, I mean, that's the crazy thing. I listened to a press conference in on Parliament Hill
[1:22:25.180 --> 1:22:29.700]  in Canada today where the conservative leader, the opposition said, I'm going to have a press
[1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:34.780]  conference to talk about these documents. So all the mainstream media were there. You
[1:22:34.780 --> 1:22:40.100]  had the CBC state broadcaster. You had the big wire services. Six questions and follow-ups
[1:22:40.100 --> 1:22:46.780]  were asked. Not one were about these documents. We have published these documents for the
[1:22:46.780 --> 1:22:53.420]  world to see. I invite any media to use them. There's a wealth of material in there that
[1:22:53.420 --> 1:22:59.660]  would take weeks to unpack. Not one question because the media party, as I call it, is
[1:22:59.660 --> 1:23:06.700]  absolutely in sync with the political industrial military security complex. And they, I mean,
[1:23:06.700 --> 1:23:12.540]  you would think the word secret would make them curious. And this was a press conference
[1:23:12.540 --> 1:23:18.020]  specifically about the documents. Not one question about the documents. It's like it
[1:23:18.020 --> 1:23:22.660]  never happened. But I promise you it did. Let me throw one more thing at you.
[1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:25.900]  Hold on. I've got to go to break. Tell us this on the other side. Plus, I would expect
[1:23:25.900 --> 1:23:30.460]  this is already so big on the U.S. media. Trump's going to cover it. Throw us into the next
[1:23:30.460 --> 1:23:34.900]  big thing we're going to cover. Ezra Levant is our guest. Read the exclusive documents
[1:23:34.900 --> 1:23:40.220]  and information on his extremely important website, rebelnews.com. It's right there
[1:23:40.220 --> 1:23:45.340]  on the front page, rebelnews.com. We, of course, have it all linked up on infowars.com
[1:23:45.340 --> 1:23:49.380]  and newswars.com. Stay with us.
[1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:53.660]  During our war for independence, during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson, the
[1:23:53.660 --> 1:23:57.300]  man credited with writing our Declaration of Independence and much of our Constitution
[1:23:57.300 --> 1:24:00.980]  later said, look, this is not going to be an easy fight. We're not going to be transported
[1:24:00.980 --> 1:24:07.020]  to liberty on a bed of feathers. No, ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible
[1:24:07.020 --> 1:24:11.500]  successes with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro and the liberty movement worldwide. We're
[1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:15.860]  going to have major setbacks, but there is a giant awakening happening. That's where
[1:24:15.860 --> 1:24:20.580]  the Globals have gone ahead and launched their great reset, global collapse, worldwide social
[1:24:20.580 --> 1:24:25.660]  credit score, tracking app, microchip, force modulation takeover now, because if they don't
[1:24:25.660 --> 1:24:29.340]  force it now, they're never going to get it. So, InfoWars has never been more critical.

[1:25:48.780 --> 1:25:55.420]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations.
[1:25:55.420 --> 1:26:00.620]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution. When you look at all the major research, all
[1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:05.060]  the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter
[1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:10.900]  or folks that live longer or more oral. No, it's turning humanity into a commodity. Now
[1:26:10.900 --> 1:26:15.780]  we see some propaganda like communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to
[1:26:15.780 --> 1:26:20.860]  make our soldiers supermen. That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting
[1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:25.180]  on our troops. We'll say things that happened to our troops and thousands and thousands
[1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:30.460]  have died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine. I've talked to high-level folks inside
[1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:33.780]  the federal government. They have the state of Texas health department. They say Alex
[1:26:33.780 --> 1:26:38.260]  knows it hurts a lot of people. It's for a greater good. But that's not even true. And
[1:26:38.260 --> 1:26:43.060]  it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, the federal state law. This is violence
[1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:47.180]  being carried out against us by medical charity. And we have a right to resist it with any
[1:26:47.180 --> 1:26:48.180]  means necessary.
[1:26:48.180 --> 1:27:04.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:22.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're
[1:27:22.020 --> 1:27:42.220]  listening to the Alex Jones show. As a Levant is our guest here today. I'm Alex Jones and
[1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:48.500]  he is with Rebel Media out of Canada and has broken huge news of a whole bunch of secret
[1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:55.980]  military operations inside Canada over the years under Trudeau with the communist Chinese
[1:27:55.980 --> 1:28:01.620]  who are incredibly aggressive taking over Africa, the South China Sea, you name it. And then
[1:28:01.620 --> 1:28:06.780]  when Trudeau found out they got mad, the Canadian military did saying, hey, we're getting spied
[1:28:06.780 --> 1:28:10.420]  on here. Well, he blew up at them. And then, Ezra, let's go back to this and make the other
[1:28:10.420 --> 1:28:13.900]  point you got caught off before the break here. Again, here on the Alex Jones show people
[1:28:13.900 --> 1:28:18.620]  just tuned in. How do you think you got the secret documents? You asked for a four year
[1:28:18.620 --> 1:28:23.540]  request about Canadian trips going to Wuhan months before the outbreak and then you get
[1:28:23.540 --> 1:28:27.420]  all these secret documents that aren't blacked out. Have you any idea why that happened or
[1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:28.420]  what's going on?
[1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:33.180]  You know, I could only speculate. I mean, I suppose the simplest answer is they just
[1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:38.100]  made a mistake. But that's an awfully big mistake that a lot of people didn't catch.
[1:28:38.100 --> 1:28:44.220]  Another more conspiratorial speculation is that someone inside the government wanted
[1:28:44.220 --> 1:28:50.060]  the world to know and they knew that if they gave these documents to say Trudeau's CBC
[1:28:50.060 --> 1:28:54.660]  State Broadcaster, the documents probably would have been sat on. But by giving it to
[1:28:54.660 --> 1:29:00.140]  us, they knew we would publish because that's the thing. I asked a very narrow question.
[1:29:00.140 --> 1:29:06.180]  Did Canada send a delegation to the 70th anniversary birthday party for the People's Liberation
[1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:12.420]  Army Navy? I thought that was a gross thing to celebrate for Canadians, for a NATO country.
[1:29:12.420 --> 1:29:17.620]  They could have given me a one line answer, a one page answer, but they gave me 34 pages
[1:29:17.620 --> 1:29:22.940]  on a whole bunch of related things. I don't even understand how that can happen except
[1:29:22.940 --> 1:29:29.300]  on purpose. So I don't know if it was on purpose or by mistake, but the fact is we have the
[1:29:29.300 --> 1:29:35.020]  documents. We were given them legally. I didn't steal them. I didn't hack them. I didn't spy
[1:29:35.020 --> 1:29:41.380]  for them. I asked for them and someone on the inside chose not to black them out. Alex,
[1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:46.140]  we make over a thousand FOIA requests as they're called in the States. They're called something
[1:29:46.140 --> 1:29:50.900]  different up here. We make over a thousand a year. Some of them are trivial. We'll FOIA
[1:29:50.900 --> 1:29:59.260]  a local school board about a small issue. The fact that this one topic, Canada-China
[1:29:59.260 --> 1:30:04.980]  military relations, out of the thousand we do a year, that this is the one that gets
[1:30:04.980 --> 1:30:12.380]  over answered and unredacted feels like a miracle because, let's say we were investigating
[1:30:12.380 --> 1:30:16.860]  a local school board on something and they gave too much away. It's cool, but it doesn't
[1:30:16.860 --> 1:30:24.700]  change the world. This can change the world. Why? Because it shows just how deep the pro-China
[1:30:24.700 --> 1:30:31.620]  forces are in our foreign affairs department, trying to infect our military. The pro-China
[1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:38.300]  deep state is real. You can see it in 34 pages. Let me throw one thing at you. I know you
[1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:43.020]  mentioned Stalin earlier, one of the world's worst killers. Well, the New York Times had
[1:30:43.020 --> 1:30:49.140]  a reporter named Walter Durante who covered up Stalin's crimes. He actually won a Pulitzer
[1:30:49.140 --> 1:30:54.820]  Fort for the New York Times. He called him Michael Jode, didn't he? Oh, yeah. He tried
[1:30:54.820 --> 1:31:00.340]  to humanize Stalin, and he covered up the crimes only later was it revealed. And if
[1:31:00.340 --> 1:31:05.600]  I'm not mistaken, I think they might have stripped the Pulitzer posthumously from him.
[1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:11.420]  That cover-up was enabled one of the crimes of the century, the crimes against humanity.
[1:31:11.420 --> 1:31:18.580]  I would say Stalin committed crimes against humanity. In these 34 pages, we see evidence
[1:31:18.580 --> 1:31:25.420]  that the Canadian diplomatic force in China is aware of atrocities, and they cover them
[1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:31.540]  up. Let me give you an example. In the western Chinese province of Xinjiang, where the Uyghur
[1:31:31.540 --> 1:31:37.420]  Muslim minority is, where there's reportedly a million or more Uyghurs, that's the name
[1:31:37.420 --> 1:31:41.980]  of the ethnic group, in concentration camps, slave labor camps, making your Nikes and your
[1:31:41.980 --> 1:31:50.580]  Adidas or whatever, the police there use an app on your smartphone to track everything,
[1:31:50.580 --> 1:31:56.180]  including your movements. And in these documents, in these 34-page documents, which you can
[1:31:56.180 --> 1:32:01.980]  see at the ChinaFiles.com, you have all the reports that our embassy in Beijing knows
[1:32:01.980 --> 1:32:09.260]  about this, including that they've personally observed this smartphone app at police checkpoints
[1:32:09.260 --> 1:32:15.580]  in Xinjiang. But like Walter Duranty, they're covering it up. The only reason we know that
[1:32:15.580 --> 1:32:21.100]  is because they failed to black it out. They just grayed it out. Page after page, you see
[1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:26.940]  Chinese human rights atrocities blacked out, except for they weren't blacked out. They
[1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:33.500]  were grayed out. So why is it that we are the Walter Durantys of 2020? Why is it that
[1:32:33.500 --> 1:32:35.740]  we're covering for Xi Jinping?
[1:32:35.740 --> 1:32:41.700]  Well, you're absolutely right. And now Apple helps from the worst death camps, gets components
[1:32:41.700 --> 1:32:46.260]  from it, and they're lobbying against bills that would just repudiate slave labor and
[1:32:46.260 --> 1:32:50.140]  make it be listed that, hey, this didn't come from a Uyghur slave camp or a Christian or
[1:32:50.140 --> 1:32:56.140]  a Buddhist slave camp. And then we have the left just absolutely trying to cover this
[1:32:56.140 --> 1:33:00.620]  up. The Washington Post saying they hope Xi Jinping, quote, destroys President Trump.
[1:33:00.620 --> 1:33:07.660]  This is a China communist file. You've heard of Angla files. You've heard of Franken files.
[1:33:07.660 --> 1:33:13.180]  You've heard of pedophiles. You mean somebody likes something. This is a commie Chai-Com
[1:33:13.180 --> 1:33:19.620]  file, disgusting, disgusting movement. And now Amazon, all these big corporations are
[1:33:19.620 --> 1:33:25.420]  bringing in the AI surveillance systems of their factories used against the Uyghurs.
[1:33:25.420 --> 1:33:32.820]  I mean, this is just incredible. An alliance of big tech with Mordor.
[1:33:32.820 --> 1:33:38.700]  That's true. What's fascinating to me is it's obvious that in Canada, and I'm sure it's
[1:33:38.700 --> 1:33:44.660]  the same for countries around the world, we know it. These half redacted, these grayed
[1:33:44.660 --> 1:33:51.940]  out, not blacked out documents show the human rights abuses that we know about. But the fact
[1:33:51.940 --> 1:33:56.860]  that they're grayed out shows you what they wanted to black out, right? It's almost like
[1:33:56.860 --> 1:34:04.300]  they're directing your attention to the interesting parts. So why would they seek to redact human
[1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:07.180]  rights atrocities? Again, that's something China's forming.
[1:34:07.180 --> 1:34:11.380]  Yeah, they're showing you what I'm sure what happened is they gave you a blacked out copy
[1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:16.580]  and somebody got rebellious in the computer program and removed it. So they've got people
[1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:20.340]  trying to kick Joe Rogan off because he has free speech to Spotify, deleting my interview
[1:34:20.340 --> 1:34:24.660]  with him and sabotage. And so those are bad guys. But I think there's good guys obviously
[1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:29.900]  inside as well. Yeah, you know, one of the things that comes through again and again
[1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:36.860]  is how important Canada's Foreign Affairs Department believes helping Xi Jinping save
[1:34:36.860 --> 1:34:43.300]  face is. That's really what underlies all their attacks on the Canadian Armed Forces.
[1:34:43.300 --> 1:34:48.980]  They didn't want China to think for a second that we were mad at them, that we were punishing
[1:34:48.980 --> 1:34:55.180]  them, that we were engaging in a diplomatic response to them. It's all about saving face
[1:34:55.180 --> 1:35:00.580]  for Xi Jinping. It's bizarre. They're obsessed with it. And like I say, let's be clear. I
[1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:05.420]  mean, I mean, the left wants to say, you know, that being a white man is bad. And YouTube
[1:35:05.420 --> 1:35:10.260]  says all white men will be suppressed on our platform in all this. But meanwhile, they
[1:35:10.260 --> 1:35:15.260]  run death camps in China. And again, it's just worshiping the tyranny. It's not just
[1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:25.260]  covering up for it. It's worshiping it. Yeah, I find it incredible. And the irony is they're
[1:35:25.260 --> 1:35:31.740]  onto something China does believe in saving face culturally, but any dictatorship has
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:36.740]  to as soon as people can laugh at a tyrant, they take away half his power, which is your
[1:35:36.740 --> 1:35:43.620]  fear of him. That's why Hong Kong democracy protesters would show Winnie the Pooh, because
[1:35:43.620 --> 1:35:48.660]  Xi Jinping looks a little bit like the cartoon Winnie the Pooh. So if you're laughing at the
[1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:53.620]  tyrant, you're rebelling against him, you're showing you're not afraid of him. I think
[1:35:53.620 --> 1:36:01.460]  it was was it Orwell or who said every joke is a little revolution. And that's right.
[1:36:01.460 --> 1:36:05.500]  In 84 Winston is down there in the cafeteria. And this other guy's making jokes that are
[1:36:05.500 --> 1:36:09.380]  wedding, even though he's pro party, Winston goes, Oh, he'll be dead soon because he's
[1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:13.600]  funny. They don't want humor. Well, I think Solzhenitsyn was sent to prison for making
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:20.540]  a one liner about Stalin's mustache. So they're onto something when they say you've got to
[1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:27.820]  let Xi Jinping save face. You can't embarrass Xi Jinping because culturally, it's saving
[1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:32.180]  face but for any tyrant. And ironically, they're pointing in the wrong direction because what
[1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:38.140]  we should learn from that is if you want China to amend its behavior to become more democratic,
[1:36:38.140 --> 1:36:43.900]  more free, less tyrannical, less abuses, commit fewer atrocities, then call them out. That's
[1:36:43.900 --> 1:36:51.340]  right. Call them out. Call tyrants out. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:36:51.340 --> 1:36:56.580]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family
[1:36:56.580 --> 1:37:01.820]  member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish
[1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:08.100]  oil from info wars store.com. Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:14.100]  can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate
[1:37:14.100 --> 1:37:19.620]  of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the
[1:37:19.620 --> 1:37:27.060]  digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate
[1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:33.140]  immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for
[1:37:33.140 --> 1:37:39.860]  my family. And now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain
[1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:47.220]  to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[1:37:47.220 --> 1:37:53.140]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism. Other dictionaries have similar
[1:37:53.140 --> 1:37:58.980]  ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:04.660]  or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to
[1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:09.780]  them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines
[1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:14.740]  from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more devastating
[1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:20.020]  they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[1:38:20.020 --> 1:38:25.460]  just eight months ago, within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million. If you count
[1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:30.580]  all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are
[1:38:30.580 --> 1:38:35.300]  real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[1:38:35.300 --> 1:38:39.460]  never come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the
[1:38:39.460 --> 1:38:45.700]  planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with
[1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:52.740]  and survive. I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news.
[1:38:52.740 --> 1:39:00.500]  Info Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:05.620]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your word
[1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:10.500]  of mouth have overridden that and they are so scared of InfoWars.com and Bandod video and
[1:39:10.500 --> 1:39:15.860]  they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth. But we're bringing in the
[1:39:15.860 --> 1:39:19.860]  same amount of money we brought in last December right now. This is our most important month.
[1:39:19.860 --> 1:39:24.420]  We'll fund ourselves in the next year and I understand the economy shutdown. I understand
[1:39:24.420 --> 1:39:27.060]  there's not as much money as they're used to be. They're trying to kill Trump's recovery.
[1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:31.700]  But Info Wars really needs your support. You just buy great items. Do your Christmas shopping
[1:39:31.700 --> 1:39:36.340]  at InfoWarsStore.com with huge sales, amazing products and then you know you're funding the
[1:39:36.340 --> 1:39:40.900]  Info War and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to
[1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:44.980]  destroy small businesses. Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great
[1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:51.780]  products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com. Thank you. Our entire modern system has been built
[1:39:51.780 --> 1:39:56.740]  to track and trace us. Not because we're doing anything wrong but so we can be socially engineered
[1:39:56.740 --> 1:40:01.780]  and controlled and now that's out in the open. One way to take back a lot of your power is to
[1:40:01.780 --> 1:40:06.660]  put your so-called smartphone in a privacy pocket when you're not using it. That way hackers,
[1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:11.140]  Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clintons contact tracers and all these big corporations that are
[1:40:11.140 --> 1:40:14.980]  setting up this tracking and control grid in the name of fighting COVID. They admit their internal
[1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:21.300]  documents truly about a casual society control system don't have that power over you. They protect
[1:40:21.300 --> 1:40:25.940]  their locations. They protect where they're going and what they're doing. I can tell you, I was the
[1:40:25.940 --> 1:40:30.980]  first person 20 years ago to sit cover up the cameras on your computer and now of course Bill Gates
[1:40:30.980 --> 1:40:34.980]  and all of them admit they're doing that. Mark Zuckerberg, show get your privacy pockets. They
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:38.260]  make great stocking stuffers and great gifts. They've been sold out for months. They're little
[1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:43.220]  fair day cages. They're only $19.95 and they're back in stock at infowarstore.com. Give the gift
[1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:46.900]  of privacy and security and safety with privacy pockets at infowarstore.com.
[1:40:46.900 --> 1:41:16.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is an authoritarian revolution happening
[1:41:16.100 --> 1:41:23.620]  on the planet and the globalist robber barons set up Mao Zedong and 49 to set up a controlled society,
[1:41:23.620 --> 1:41:32.100]  a laboratory of control. And now 70 years later, communist China is the model of the planet.
[1:41:32.100 --> 1:41:37.460]  We've got this footage. We can roll here. Let's play it with audio of inside Amazon factories,
[1:41:37.460 --> 1:41:43.540]  inside Amazon shipping centers where people have to social distance and AI robots, watch them.
[1:41:43.540 --> 1:41:49.300]  This is the control already tested in China now being brought here with their alliance with Big Tech.
[1:42:04.900 --> 1:42:10.020]  So it's all about how you're guilty, how you're bad, how robots are replacing you or how they're
[1:42:10.020 --> 1:42:17.300]  turning you into a robot. Well, one way to become aware of what's happening and how these smart
[1:42:17.300 --> 1:42:21.940]  phones are really spy devices that surveil you and track you for hackers, government,
[1:42:21.940 --> 1:42:27.780]  UN contact tracers, the Bill and the Gates Foundation, the Clintons, is privacy pockets.
[1:42:27.780 --> 1:42:33.460]  Now this is a high quality fair day cage. People sell the same unit we private labeled for $29.95.
[1:42:33.460 --> 1:42:38.100]  We're selling it for $19.95. They cost us $11 a pouch because they're high end,
[1:42:38.100 --> 1:42:42.020]  they're high quality and they have a 99% rate of not letting you be tracked,
[1:42:42.020 --> 1:42:45.220]  unlike others that are about 90%. And if you're right under a cell tower,
[1:42:45.220 --> 1:42:48.900]  you can still beam through it and still track where you're at. But that's the way to put your
[1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:52.740]  phone away, to have less screen time, to be aware of how you're being tracked. This is the best
[1:42:52.740 --> 1:42:57.220]  stocking stuffer, the best Christmas present. We've got it in four different colors, blue,
[1:42:57.220 --> 1:43:04.340]  green, red and black. They've been sold out for months. They're back in stock infowarstore.com
[1:43:04.340 --> 1:43:08.980]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three,
[1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:12.660]  three, one, three, nine. So you have 100% reviews. We've tested a lot of other ones out
[1:43:12.660 --> 1:43:16.020]  that aren't as good. They're still pretty good, but these are the best we've found.
[1:43:16.020 --> 1:43:20.260]  And they're pretty low price. We've had like $40 ones that cost us like 20 to buy that didn't
[1:43:20.260 --> 1:43:25.300]  even work as well. So those are at infowarstore.com. We also have the 60% off and free shipping,
[1:43:25.300 --> 1:43:28.180]  double patriot points. And if you get your orders in by the 18th,
[1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:33.140]  you will get it before Christmas here in the United States. So take advantage of the big
[1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:39.380]  Christmas mega sale at infowarstore.com. We're funded by you, not by Bill Gates,
[1:43:39.380 --> 1:43:44.260]  not by the new world order, not by Gigi Ping. Getting back to Ezra Levant,
[1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:49.220]  final segment we have with him, I want to play this clip one more time and then give you the
[1:43:49.220 --> 1:43:53.780]  floor to add any other key points or addendums of where this huge story of all these secret
[1:43:53.780 --> 1:44:00.260]  communist Chinese drills in Canada. And then finally the military saying no, and your globalist
[1:44:00.260 --> 1:44:06.980]  prime minister getting angry with that clip of him a few years ago saying, I admire communist
[1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:14.420]  China the most in a TV show, just incredible, because they have a basic dictatorship and do
[1:44:14.420 --> 1:44:19.300]  the best job. I mean, this is just an incredible admission of these authoritarians. Here it is.
[1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:30.500]  All of admiration I actually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing
[1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:36.500]  them to actually turn their economy around on a dime. You notice that's pretty boy Trudeau
[1:44:36.500 --> 1:44:40.740]  with a bunch of women. Stockholm said, and not putting women down to a statistic show,
[1:44:40.740 --> 1:44:44.340]  they'll go into dictatorship a lot quicker. Men will just go off and party and do nothing and
[1:44:44.340 --> 1:44:48.420]  not stand up, I guess, in the modern system. But Ezra Levant of rebel media, this is so huge,
[1:44:48.420 --> 1:44:53.380]  this is so seismic. That's a few years ago. Now here we see he's basically a client of
[1:44:53.380 --> 1:44:59.220]  communist China living out what he actually said he did. I think he should, this is enough
[1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:03.780]  to have him raided. This is enough to have his files checked. I bet you he's getting some money
[1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:09.380]  from some Chinese front companies, just like the big voting machine companies are in the case of
[1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:13.140]  Smartmatic and the case, of course, of Dominion. What do you think?
[1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:19.140]  Well, there's actually no need for an investigation. We already know the facts about that. There are a
[1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:24.900]  bunch of groups around Justin Trudeau that are not formally his political party, but they're
[1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:30.820]  associated with him. There's the Trudeau Foundation. There's his sort of in-house think tank called
[1:45:30.820 --> 1:45:38.340]  Canada 2020. And they take massive donations directly from China. For example, Huawei,
[1:45:38.340 --> 1:45:45.700]  the monster tech company that wants to build 5G around the world. They're a major, major donor
[1:45:45.700 --> 1:45:51.620]  to Canada 2020. Trudeau's in-house think tank. So he's not even hiding it. Other donors,
[1:45:52.820 --> 1:46:01.540]  giving six figures plus to take at fundraisers for Trudeau. He is absolutely up to his eyeballs
[1:46:01.540 --> 1:46:07.540]  in it. And the trouble is, you show the news, like we revealed these 34 pages for the whole
[1:46:07.540 --> 1:46:12.500]  world to see. And like I mentioned this morning, there was a press conference on Parliament Hill
[1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:17.620]  about these documents. Six journalists in a row, none of them cared because either
[1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:24.580]  they like China or they just support whoever is against the West, or they like Trudeau,
[1:46:24.580 --> 1:46:31.300]  or just as likely, their own media companies are compromised in some way. There's nothing
[1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:36.820]  cheaper to buy off than a journalist in the year 2020. Media companies are broke and who has all
[1:46:36.820 --> 1:46:43.860]  the cash? China. So, I mean, why do you think media companies would be less susceptible to Chinese
[1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:51.060]  cash and honey traps than any other industry? And why do they have all the cash? They've
[1:46:51.620 --> 1:46:56.580]  closed a few months, have been open. We're supposedly never going to reopen. And the same
[1:46:56.580 --> 1:47:01.940]  China-centric politicians tell us, China did a great job. You'll never be open till you give
[1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:08.260]  us martial law. I mean, this is really, you can see the siob is right there. Who are the biggest
[1:47:08.260 --> 1:47:14.100]  boosters of the lockdowns in the West? Aside from the public health officers who are enjoying
[1:47:14.100 --> 1:47:20.740]  their moment of fame, Dr. Fauci, etc. It's the media, the media who put on their masks when
[1:47:20.740 --> 1:47:24.580]  they're on camera. The second they think they're off camera, they throw the mask away and say,
[1:47:24.580 --> 1:47:28.820]  I'm not pretending. The people who go to the fancy restaurants with Gavin Newsom,
[1:47:28.820 --> 1:47:33.780]  the people who get their hair done with Nancy Pelosi. But then when the lights and camera on,
[1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:39.220]  they want to lock down for the rest of us. So my point is, the media are the least skeptical
[1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:44.660]  about China. And they're really the enforcers of the pandemic lockdown, even though they themselves
[1:47:44.660 --> 1:47:48.660]  have never lost a day's work. And they're the ones pushing censorship of the independent media
[1:47:48.660 --> 1:47:54.020]  because they can't survive if we're still there in closing. Is it not positive, though,
[1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:59.140]  that Swallowswell and Biden and his son and his brother are under criminal investigation?
[1:47:59.140 --> 1:48:02.980]  And more and more of this is coming out. And that's a good sign. All these states have joined at
[1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:07.460]  the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's taken the case about this illegal ballots. I mean, this is,
[1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:13.380]  this is a crazy time. It's true. And I like the fact that you're taking a glass half full approach
[1:48:13.380 --> 1:48:17.940]  because the world is full of bad news and you have pointed out some glimmers of hope.
[1:48:17.940 --> 1:48:22.500]  But wouldn't it have been nice to have known many of these things, including about Hunter Biden
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:27.940]  before the election, as you point out, the big tech companies censored it. But we'll keep fighting
[1:48:27.940 --> 1:48:32.740]  up here. And I know you'll keep fighting down there. All right, Ezra, what else are what else
[1:48:32.740 --> 1:48:37.540]  do you have cooking in the last 60 seconds at rebel media? I mean, you've always got huge stuff.
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:42.180]  Give us a little prelude to what you might have come out next. Well, you know, we've started a
[1:48:42.180 --> 1:48:48.420]  civil liberties project in Canada, Australia and the UK for people who have been given outrageous
[1:48:48.420 --> 1:48:54.340]  lockdown fines as a program called fight the fines.com. We're actually offering free lawyers
[1:48:54.980 --> 1:49:00.020]  to the first 1000 people that have locked down fines. We've hired a bunch of lawyers. We're
[1:49:00.020 --> 1:49:04.340]  doing a civil liberties fight. That's our big project. Next Alex. Well, I mean, I'm not just
[1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:10.900]  saying this. I admire you because you take so much action. You get so much results because you
[1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:15.860]  actually do it. And I just so does project Veritas. But I think you're like the Veritas of Canada,
[1:49:15.860 --> 1:49:20.260]  but you also affect the rest of the world. So Ezra, please anytime you've got news,
[1:49:20.260 --> 1:49:23.620]  you know, we called you are ready to come on. A lot of times you've got too much going on,
[1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:27.700]  I get it. But anytime you want to get to this audience and tell people about what's going on,
[1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:31.620]  please reach out to us. We really, really appreciate you got a lot of websites.
[1:49:31.620 --> 1:49:35.060]  What's the best one? What's the mother ship for folks to visit rebel media?
[1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:41.780]  rebelnews.com rebelnews.com. And you can find out all we're up to. And you can obviously read
[1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:46.180]  these secret documents there, too. So thanks for the opportunity to talk to your people, Alex.
[1:49:46.820 --> 1:49:52.180]  Ezra, we love you. Godspeed. Okay, next hour, former head of psychological operations for the
[1:49:52.180 --> 1:49:57.780]  State Department, the CIA. Dr. Steve Picinic will join us on the election and a lot more.
[1:49:58.340 --> 1:50:00.820]  You do not want to miss that. I will just say this right now.
[1:50:02.820 --> 1:50:07.380]  I sleep great knowing that as little events out there, and I sleep great knowing oans out there
[1:50:07.380 --> 1:50:14.580]  and newsmax and the right side and just everybody. But info wars is the tip of the spear. We are the
[1:50:14.580 --> 1:50:20.100]  enemy's main threat because we have the largest audience of you badasses. Okay, so it's you,
[1:50:20.100 --> 1:50:24.340]  they hate. Okay, I mean, hell, I'm not even that important. It's all these guests, as you just heard.
[1:50:24.340 --> 1:50:29.220]  So remember that they are working around the clock. You know to tune into local radio station
[1:50:29.220 --> 1:50:33.780]  or TV station or info wars.com. But I run people all the time. I used to love you. I wish you were
[1:50:33.780 --> 1:50:37.620]  still on there. I heard you're off air because I'm not on Facebook or YouTube. I'm like, no, no,
[1:50:37.620 --> 1:50:41.860]  I'm at Band-Aught Video. Really? You're still on there? I mean, I can't go to the grocery store
[1:50:41.860 --> 1:50:47.460]  or a restaurant and it gets tears in my eyes because I look at these people, old ladies, young men,
[1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:53.140]  black, white, I go, hey, you're habituated to going to Facebook and Twitter. They're like,
[1:50:53.140 --> 1:50:57.700]  what's habituated? You know, you have a habit because I'm not in your feed doesn't mean that
[1:50:57.700 --> 1:51:04.740]  I'm not there info wars.com, Band-Aught Video. And a lot of folks get that. But it's not about, oh,
[1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:09.140]  I want the biggest show on the traffic. I want to beat this steal. They wanted us off the air
[1:51:09.140 --> 1:51:15.060]  because we've got the globalist number. So whatever you do for yourself and your family this Christmas
[1:51:15.940 --> 1:51:20.420]  or Hanukkah or whatever the hell you want to call it, you better do this. You better spread the
[1:51:20.420 --> 1:51:24.500]  word about whatever you think the best news organization is standing up for your freedom
[1:51:24.500 --> 1:51:29.380]  and all our freedom collectively. And I believe info wars.com is that site. But whatever you do,
[1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:35.300]  don't stay silent because your word of mouth is king. Our number three, two minutes ahead. Stay with
[1:51:35.300 --> 1:51:44.180]  us. The US Postal Service tells info wars that as long as you get your order in by December 18th

[1:52:09.460 --> 1:52:14.420]  against the globalist. But now is the time to redouble all our efforts in praying for a great
[1:52:14.420 --> 1:52:19.060]  awakening, which is starting to happen and spreading the word about info wars.com news wars.com
[1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:25.860]  and band.video. And at the very same time, buying amazing products at infowarstore.com.
[1:52:25.860 --> 1:52:29.620]  They have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year, certainly on some items,
[1:52:29.620 --> 1:52:34.340]  the biggest sales of the year on new pharmaceuticals, you name it, at infowarstore.com. So thanks for
[1:52:34.340 --> 1:52:40.500]  your support. Get those orders in and God bless. The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global
[1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:46.020]  government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income,
[1:52:46.020 --> 1:52:50.020]  which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on
[1:52:50.020 --> 1:52:55.220]  your phone. And finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the
[1:52:55.220 --> 1:53:01.540]  UN great reset of the Davos group and cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books
[1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:06.740]  by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them at 10 to 21, 20 to 2030. It's here.
[1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:12.180]  And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[1:53:12.180 --> 1:53:19.300]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle to first evil and stopping
[1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:25.620]  abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable,
[1:53:25.620 --> 1:53:32.900]  that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand
[1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:44.020]  up and declare our basic God given human rights now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:44.020 --> 1:54:02.980]  I don't like it. You know, you have a Democrat governor. You have all these Democrats watching
[1:54:02.980 --> 1:54:08.980]  that stuff. Be poll watches when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing
[1:54:08.980 --> 1:54:14.740]  they do. I have told you that Trump had about a 20% chance in the last three weeks since this
[1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:19.780]  fraud unfolded to prove it to the American people and to override this corruption because the gas
[1:54:19.780 --> 1:54:24.580]  lighting and the mass hoax and the incredible censorship by big tech and the control corporate
[1:54:24.580 --> 1:54:32.820]  media is so unbelievable. But thanks to the grace of God and all these wonderful men and women,
[1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:42.020]  black, white, Hispanic, old, young Indian Americans, Native Americans, Indians from India that are
[1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:49.620]  Americans, Chinese Americans, black Americans, all Hispanic Americans, all telling the same stories
[1:54:49.620 --> 1:54:55.780]  of the organized fraud in those key five states. Any, any kind of oversight and you know, those
[1:54:55.780 --> 1:55:00.660]  ballots getting duplicated without an oversight and all of this fraud that was happening, it was
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:05.620]  heartbreaking. So that's why I decided to put myself here. I didn't have my GOP tag on. So
[1:55:05.620 --> 1:55:11.940]  automatically I was assumed to be a Democrat. And I have seen some women who came to me and I said,
[1:55:12.980 --> 1:55:19.140]  let's get these MFs out. And she was singing that song. And for me, I don't listen to secular music
[1:55:19.140 --> 1:55:23.860]  and these days you can't even tell what is custom and what is a song. So I thought maybe she was
[1:55:23.860 --> 1:55:30.020]  really singing a song. But then when I saw that she was targeting white male Republicans accusing
[1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:35.380]  them of something like your mask slipped, you were not six feet away. So you need to go out and you
[1:55:35.380 --> 1:55:40.500]  know, your phone was out and they were really intimidating all these white people. And I put
[1:55:40.500 --> 1:55:45.460]  myself out there, tried to help them saying, why are you getting them in trouble? And they said,
[1:55:45.460 --> 1:55:51.940]  why are you taking their side? Then I showed my GOP tag. And then she said to me that I'm on the
[1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:59.460]  wrong side because I had a GOP tag on. So I personally observed USB cards being uploaded
[1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:05.700]  to the voting machines by the voting machine warehouse supervisor on multiple occasions.
[1:56:06.260 --> 1:56:11.220]  I saw this personally. I brought it to the attention of the deputy sheriff who was there
[1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:15.780]  stationed who was a senior law enforcement officer. And I brought it to the attention of the clerk of
[1:56:15.780 --> 1:56:23.540]  elections. I brought it to their attention. I objected. And I said, this person is not being
[1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:28.260]  observed. He's not part of the process that I can see. And he's walking in with baggies,
[1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:33.380]  which we have pictures of and it was submitted to in our affidavits. And he was sticking these
[1:56:33.380 --> 1:56:43.940]  USBs into the machines. So in talking to US Attorney General McSwain and other law enforcement
[1:56:43.940 --> 1:56:50.340]  officers, I found out that was not the case that generally, you know, more than more than two is
[1:56:50.340 --> 1:56:56.500]  unusual. We have a lawyer coming in studio later who went and pull watched and caught them engaged
[1:56:56.500 --> 1:57:02.740]  in criminal activity in Travis County. I was personally appointed by the Travis County Republican
[1:57:02.740 --> 1:57:09.780]  Party. So you were there on official business? Yes, my intent was to get it recorded, to take
[1:57:09.780 --> 1:57:16.020]  pictures of what was happening and to make this situation public. Flex snapped these three pictures
[1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:21.140]  and sent them to us. The pictures show, she argues, the clerk's office obstructing poll
[1:57:21.140 --> 1:57:26.980]  watchers from doing their job. We had no audio at all. We could not hear what was going on.
[1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:31.860]  They were running ballots. They were signing reports. When we would tap on the window so that
[1:57:31.860 --> 1:57:37.060]  we could ask a question or so that we could see a report, which is allowed under the statute,
[1:57:37.060 --> 1:57:43.220]  they would ignore us. Fleck then called 911 asking for a deputy to file a police report.
[1:57:43.220 --> 1:57:49.620]  When the deputy arrived, the clerk's office found out Fleck had taken pictures and told her to leave.
[1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:53.060]  The county clerk has been caught over and over against stealing elections.
[1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:58.340]  This woman, when she called the police, she was arrested. But guess what? She had hidden video
[1:57:58.340 --> 1:58:05.620]  and got it all. But the police confiscated the hidden video. All right, we're going to start
[1:58:06.740 --> 1:58:12.260]  the next segment with Steve Pacenek, who was on with me two weeks ago and said all the China
[1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:15.540]  stuff is about to come out on the Bidens. And then they'll be given a chance to step down.
[1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:20.340]  Then he said it again Sunday with Owen Schreuer hosting my show. And now you see all this is
[1:58:20.340 --> 1:58:25.860]  breaking and coming out. I've known Pacenek 19 years and he's never BS me. He might have been
[1:58:25.860 --> 1:58:29.060]  wrong about a few things, but he's been right more than I've been about things, which is,
[1:58:29.060 --> 1:58:34.020]  I'm right about 95% or so. He's been right about 97%. So we'll see if he's right. You're coming up
[1:58:34.020 --> 1:58:46.900]  in 41 days. Stay with us. But I think he means well at the end of the day. Stay with us. Most
[1:58:46.900 --> 1:58:52.660]  of the world submitted the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist Chinese
[1:58:52.660 --> 1:58:57.780]  and the United Nations. And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient,
[1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:02.900]  the worst Australian models of complete lockdown so you can't even leave your house for months and
[1:59:02.900 --> 1:59:08.420]  months are being announced. And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water
[1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:13.300]  cannons to blast men, women and children that protests the fact that Merkel, the dictator,
[1:59:13.300 --> 1:59:18.180]  has put them under her control. That's right. She's been ringing elections for years and years.
[1:59:18.180 --> 1:59:23.460]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States. This is world government in Philadelphia.
[1:59:23.460 --> 1:59:28.020]  They've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested. They're announcing
[1:59:28.020 --> 1:59:32.980]  that Christmas is canceled. This is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you,
[1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:38.820]  to take red of all your due process and absolutely transform the world into a prison
[1:59:38.820 --> 1:59:44.740]  planet. How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back. America is the last bastion.
[1:59:44.740 --> 2:00:00.740]  Stop submitting.
[2:00:00.740 --> 2:00:17.460]  My three and a half year old daughter is begging me to see snow. We live in central Texas. She
[2:00:17.460 --> 2:00:22.180]  hasn't seen snow. And she says, Daddy, I want to see a snow this Christmas. Well, according to
[2:00:22.180 --> 2:00:26.180]  the Southern Prairie Law Center, that's because she's racist. They actually say why Christmas is
[2:00:26.180 --> 2:00:32.740]  racist. But that's the left trying to divide this country and divide the world. The good news is
[2:00:32.740 --> 2:00:37.380]  everybody, no matter what melanin you got in your skin, is seeing through this. And that's
[2:00:37.380 --> 2:00:42.260]  the good news. All right. Dr. Steve Pachett, former head of psychological operations, a psychiatrist,
[2:00:42.260 --> 2:00:47.220]  a lot of other stuff of the State Department, worked in regime changes, helped found Delta Force,
[2:00:47.220 --> 2:00:54.260]  co-wrote a bunch of books and made movies with Tom Clancy. And he came out here three weeks ago.
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:01:00.020]  And he said, Biden's going to basically be exposed to Chinese agent, and he'll be given the chance
[2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:04.260]  to step down and not contest this, or they're going to go to prison, but if he wants to pardon,
[2:01:04.260 --> 2:01:09.300]  he'll get one. I'm like, okay, sounds like wishful thinking. That's dead story. The media totally
[2:01:09.300 --> 2:01:13.380]  locked it down during the election. He said, watch, it's going to come out. He was on Sunday and said,
[2:01:13.380 --> 2:01:17.460]  just watch, it's imminent. We'll play a clip in a moment, but he was on for an hour. The full
[2:01:17.460 --> 2:01:23.220]  interview said to Bandai video. And I think the headline is intelligence insider. Biden won't be
[2:01:23.220 --> 2:01:27.940]  given a chance to step down to avoid prosecution. I know I watched it like Sunday night. I didn't
[2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:33.300]  watch it live. But that's it, Bandai video. And so indeed, that's now happening. Questions. Will
[2:01:33.300 --> 2:01:39.220]  the investigation continue on? Swallow as well with a sex op attached to him. We've got federal
[2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:45.460]  criminal investigation to Hunter into Joe Biden, his brother, the bag man, all these senators calling
[2:01:45.460 --> 2:01:50.420]  for criminal investigations. This isn't like Trump and Russia where you squeeze our stone,
[2:01:50.420 --> 2:01:55.540]  no blood comes out. This is like shooting a 10,000 pound hog blood just sprays out every orifice.
[2:01:56.100 --> 2:02:00.740]  I mean, just talking about like it's like hitting the spindle top in South Texas or something.
[2:02:00.740 --> 2:02:05.700]  I mean, this damn thing is the mother load. These people are complete commie agents. Talk about a
[2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:10.980]  big giant target on their back. The Machiavellian side of me hopes they put Biden in. We'll destroy
[2:02:10.980 --> 2:02:16.100]  the whole Democratic Party. But I'm sorry. Going back to Pachettic, who's been saying, hey, we got
[2:02:16.100 --> 2:02:20.260]  hope. It's all right. Like waving the flag of the battle. Don't give up. They were like, out there,
[2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:26.580]  you'll be optimistic. Well, that's all we got. But it seems to be with Texas joining a now 19
[2:02:26.580 --> 2:02:31.780]  other states joining as parties of the suit, not just signing on that the worm is turning. Like
[2:02:31.780 --> 2:02:36.980]  you said, I hope you're right with 41 days, buddy. So here's the clip that you Sunday with Owen
[2:02:36.980 --> 2:02:43.620]  Schreuer. I think Biden understands this. He may not always be the sharpest bulb in and the sharpest
[2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:50.020]  mind around. But I think he has a pretty good idea that he's under indictment. His son is.
[2:02:50.660 --> 2:02:58.260]  And if anything is to come about, my suspicion is that Biden will resign as well as son, because
[2:02:59.220 --> 2:03:05.300]  either or a both might go to prison. My suspicion is Trump will remain. He will be a president
[2:03:05.300 --> 2:03:11.540]  for the next eight years. Biden will concede and somewhere there will be remuneration. That's only
[2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:17.460]  my suspicion. So is that a Roosevelt prediction? All right, Steve, again, you've been on the air
[2:03:17.460 --> 2:03:21.620]  19 years. You suppose a lot of stuff. You've been accurate most of the time. I don't think you're a
[2:03:21.620 --> 2:03:26.180]  bad guy. I think you're a good guy. But I tell you, things sounded $3 weeks ago when you said this.
[2:03:26.180 --> 2:03:32.500]  Now they seem to be going your way. What's what's going on? Well, it's not going my way or anyway.
[2:03:32.500 --> 2:03:39.060]  Number one, I just want to thank you for always being open to alternative point of view. And
[2:03:39.060 --> 2:03:46.420]  you have to understand this is not flattering you, but I am. I do enjoy your presence. It's amazing.
[2:03:48.340 --> 2:03:55.540]  The reason we come on this air and over 20 years, you have become literally the mainstream media
[2:03:55.540 --> 2:04:04.420]  with all due respect to that word. As a result of that, we were able to say what I was able to say,
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:12.180]  which is number one, Biden and his crew are really going to be rolled up. It's something that Trump
[2:04:12.180 --> 2:04:19.140]  and a group of us in cyber command. And really, we owe a lot of gratitude to not Cassone,
[2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:26.900]  Keith Alexander, Colin A.G. and special forces, Boykin. I can't explain to you how important
[2:04:26.900 --> 2:04:34.340]  our military has become, not because they're kinetic. Those days of kinetic warfare are over.
[2:04:34.340 --> 2:04:40.420]  And what these gentlemen and others and including the civilians and General Brown and the Air Force,
[2:04:40.420 --> 2:04:46.260]  what they began to understand along with Trump, who really catalyzed all this,
[2:04:46.260 --> 2:04:52.500]  we're in the 21st century. And in order to compete with China and Russia, we have to
[2:04:52.500 --> 2:05:00.340]  immediately co-op the Chinese, the Russians, and our own internal corruption. The amount of
[2:05:00.340 --> 2:05:07.620]  corruption that was present or extent has been here for 40 to 50 years in a way with all due
[2:05:07.620 --> 2:05:13.940]  respect to you, Alex. The reason I came on 20 years ago is because you were the only show that
[2:05:13.940 --> 2:05:22.100]  understood the veracity of the 9-11 false flag. So this is the payback for those of us who went
[2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:31.060]  to Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, underneath the auspices of every
[2:05:31.060 --> 2:05:37.220]  chicken-hawk president we had. Bush Sr., who claimed that he was shot down, but he ejected
[2:05:37.220 --> 2:05:43.540]  from his plane. Bush Jr., who never served, he was too cowardly. Obama, who never served,
[2:05:43.540 --> 2:05:49.540]  but there was a CIA operator who brought along with him that Catholic idiot, John Brennan.
[2:05:49.540 --> 2:05:56.100]  And at the same time, we had all of these people, Susan Rice, one of the greatest cowards of all
[2:05:56.100 --> 2:06:01.780]  time from National Cathedral, Stanford, could have prevented the death of a million Tutsis,
[2:06:01.780 --> 2:06:07.540]  but didn't say anything. And now she's being appointed as domestic counsel. John Kerry,
[2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:14.100]  Secretary of State, another loser who goes into the Vietnam War with a camera to show how grandiose,
[2:06:14.100 --> 2:06:21.540]  of course, his family converted from Judaism to Episcopalian. And then he went to a private
[2:06:21.540 --> 2:06:27.700]  school and then went to Yale. Oh, by the way, who did the same thing? Barr's family. Barr's
[2:06:27.700 --> 2:06:35.780]  father just converted from Judaism to Christianity. And Barr himself was a DI, as I said, a director
[2:06:35.780 --> 2:06:43.460]  of an analyst, a DDO, an operative. And we have suspicions about Barr and why there weren't any
[2:06:43.460 --> 2:06:50.980]  indictments beforehand. The reason was simple. The catalyst for all of this, quite frankly,
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:58.100]  were two elements. One is your friend in my acquaintance, Roger Stone. The minute they had
[2:06:58.100 --> 2:07:04.420]  even thought of bringing Roger Stone in or anywhere near prison was already a catalyst
[2:07:04.420 --> 2:07:11.700]  that was a warning to me. But the real catalyst in all of this was the fact that they were pinpointing
[2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:17.620]  Michael Flynn in an amazing director of a defense intelligence agency.
[2:07:18.180 --> 2:07:23.780]  That was when I came on your show and a year or two years ago, I said, under no condition,
[2:07:23.780 --> 2:07:31.620]  will Mike Flynn be arrested or convicted or indicted. And that was the real rolling stone
[2:07:31.620 --> 2:07:37.780]  behind all of these efforts. Once you attacked one of our major operatives in the defense
[2:07:37.780 --> 2:07:45.700]  intelligence agency, all the other colleagues, including myself, who were in cyber command,
[2:07:45.700 --> 2:07:52.740]  military intelligence began to understand, uh-oh, we got a problem that has been there for 40 years,
[2:07:52.740 --> 2:08:01.300]  which our great president Eisenhower said, CIA has led a legacy of ashes. And this is part of the
[2:08:01.300 --> 2:08:10.340]  CIA disaster that occurred with Gina Aspel, George Tennant. No, I agree. Let's talk about what you
[2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:14.900]  expect to see the next 40 days. And hopefully this goes well. Trump seems very confident.
[2:08:14.900 --> 2:08:18.820]  The states are lining up. Pennsylvania being thrown out. It's not a big deal because they
[2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:24.580]  wanted a stronger state level because it has stronger standing. I look at the body language
[2:08:24.580 --> 2:08:29.620]  of Brennan and Clapper. They're on air crapping their britches right now. I look at body language.
[2:08:29.620 --> 2:08:35.460]  They look scared. They should be scared. Clapper, Brennan, Hayden, and a bunch of them
[2:08:35.460 --> 2:08:41.860]  have already been targeted by our own people in cyber command. So number one, will people actually
[2:08:41.860 --> 2:08:49.460]  go to a prison? Some will. Many of them you will not know. Number two, we have ordered and we built
[2:08:49.460 --> 2:08:57.540]  a huge Guantanamo base in the mountains of Cuba to make that clear. Number three, there will be
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:05.700]  indictments in the Biden community and Biden will have to relinquish any sense of being a president
[2:09:05.700 --> 2:09:11.460]  or anything else because Hunter Biden is so exposed at this particular point in time that there
[2:09:11.460 --> 2:09:16.980]  will be a quid pro quo. A quid pro quo will be simply, sorry, the dogs are going out.
[2:09:19.380 --> 2:09:24.100]  You can see the worm turning now from what you were saying sounded absurd three weeks ago
[2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:28.740]  to now. It's like, whoa. So I want to hear this. As you said, it's going to come out. I'm like,
[2:09:28.740 --> 2:09:33.460]  they've already buried the China stuff, Steve, and you're like, watch and boom,
[2:09:33.460 --> 2:09:37.780]  just like night following day, day following night, you've been right so far. So I've crossed
[2:09:37.780 --> 2:09:42.340]  my fingers. I hope you're in telling what your side's going to win. But pro America will be right
[2:09:42.340 --> 2:09:48.980]  back. Stay with us. You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity.
[2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:54.980]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians
[2:09:54.980 --> 2:09:59.700]  of this world, but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system poisoning the
[2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:06.980]  planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to the
[2:10:06.980 --> 2:10:13.140]  GMO crops. And now they have moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA vaccines,
[2:10:13.140 --> 2:10:21.460]  which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses. We're then
[2:10:21.460 --> 2:10:28.180]  inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts
[2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:35.300]  for the mRNA vaccines. And then remember, you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien
[2:10:35.300 --> 2:10:39.940]  takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting
[2:10:39.940 --> 2:10:43.780]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[2:11:10.500 --> 2:11:14.420]  All the rest of the information we put out to realize how important your work has been and to
[2:11:14.420 --> 2:11:19.220]  redouble your efforts. So I salute you and I thank you. Also, as Christmas is almost here,

[2:11:43.460 --> 2:12:03.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:13.780 --> 2:12:27.860]  Okay, folks, welcome back. Alex Jones here with Dr. Steve Pachennick, very interesting fellow.
[2:12:28.500 --> 2:12:33.060]  And I remember him, we already played some of the clips, but I remember him saying,
[2:12:33.060 --> 2:12:38.340]  you're going to finally see massive firings at the CIA. They're going to fire the head of the CIA.
[2:12:38.340 --> 2:12:44.660]  They're going to fire the head of the civilian head of the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense.
[2:12:45.220 --> 2:12:50.900]  And now today, massive firings of the CIA, massive cutouts kicking them out of the Pentagon because
[2:12:50.900 --> 2:12:57.140]  they become Chinese communist agents. Well, let's just say third parties that sell us,
[2:12:57.140 --> 2:13:00.980]  as like Trump said, three months ago. I may not be here soon if I don't succeed, but it's okay.
[2:13:00.980 --> 2:13:05.860]  I got to give it a shot. I'm an American. There's these middlemen sold us out. And so
[2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:11.460]  they're being cut out right now. Steve Pachennick, let's go through that. But I want to drill in,
[2:13:11.460 --> 2:13:15.700]  because I get you've got your message, what you're saying. A lot of it is unfolding to be accurate.
[2:13:15.700 --> 2:13:20.580]  Thank God. I mean, I know you meant well in it all, but talking to your sources, who again,
[2:13:20.580 --> 2:13:24.900]  aren't God, they're people like us that are looking at the battlefield and what's happening.
[2:13:26.740 --> 2:13:31.780]  What do you do when the general public, at least half of them are gas lit that Joe Biden won when
[2:13:31.780 --> 2:13:37.380]  he didn't? What do you do when it comes out that they fraudulently sent out these ballots and the
[2:13:37.380 --> 2:13:41.940]  Supreme Court overturns it as it looks like things are moving towards? What happens then?
[2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:49.220]  Let me explain some. My sources didn't say any of these things that I'm saying to you.
[2:13:49.780 --> 2:13:56.500]  I'm basing it on the simple principle of knowing the dynamics of each of the characters and how
[2:13:56.500 --> 2:14:02.580]  a Biden is self-destructive, Nancy Pelosi self-destructive. But the most important thing I've
[2:14:02.580 --> 2:14:09.300]  always said to you in your audience is the fact, do not listen to Trump, watch what he does. And
[2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:14.100]  now he's going to clean out everything. What is the new administration going to look like?
[2:14:14.660 --> 2:14:20.260]  Probably Mike Flynn will come in and either serve as head of intelligence or head of
[2:14:20.260 --> 2:14:27.620]  secretary of defense. We're going to have a very clean slate because Trump will arrest a lot of
[2:14:27.620 --> 2:14:30.980]  the politicians. Okay, I want to talk about that. We'll do that this segment or next. But let's get
[2:14:30.980 --> 2:14:36.100]  into meat and potatoes here. You did say three weeks ago that you talked to high-level folks
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:40.020]  in these agencies, and I can talk to them too. They call me up. They're just people like us.
[2:14:40.020 --> 2:14:44.180]  But they said, we're hanging on. Trump's going to win. I've talked to Trump's top lawyers.
[2:14:44.180 --> 2:14:48.580]  I've talked to Trump's son. They say they're going to win. They say the same stuff you're saying.
[2:14:48.580 --> 2:14:52.020]  They just are more cryptic. Look at this. Look at that. Then it becomes accurate.
[2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:57.940]  I'm just simply asking you, because what the timetable is, because you said, look, they're
[2:14:57.940 --> 2:15:01.620]  going to bring out the corruption on Biden. And I thought, well, they already buried that. Boom,
[2:15:01.620 --> 2:15:07.140]  it's back. So it looks like that's on track to legitimize the political cover to the Supreme
[2:15:07.140 --> 2:15:12.820]  Court to follow the law and overturn this fraudulent election. Correct. So what will happen? There
[2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:19.140]  will be an overturn of the election. Biden will concede and will either claim that he's sick
[2:15:19.140 --> 2:15:23.460]  or whatever he goes. You said that three weeks ago, two weeks later. I forget
[2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:30.500]  he said, I may just sign off and say, I'm sick. Well, what can I tell you? I mean, I don't have
[2:15:30.500 --> 2:15:37.140]  a fortune cookie. Alex, basically, you and I work off of the dynamics of the system and the
[2:15:37.140 --> 2:15:44.980]  consistency of of personalities. And when you come up against the Sidney Powell, who will probably be
[2:15:44.980 --> 2:15:51.460]  the next attorney general of the United States, you have tense there. What I'm getting at is you
[2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:59.700]  have to and the American public has to understand this took years to implement this took years for
[2:15:59.700 --> 2:16:05.140]  our military and others to be like an iceberg. We see a general Flynn. We see a Sidney bow.
[2:16:05.140 --> 2:16:11.780]  We see a Donald Trump. There's a whole movement behind that. Correct. And what I said, and most
[2:16:11.780 --> 2:16:17.620]  people didn't understand it, was that there was a massive mobilization of troops all over the
[2:16:17.620 --> 2:16:23.540]  United States, certainly here in northern Florida, certainly in other places in Fort Hood and in
[2:16:23.540 --> 2:16:31.700]  California. That was done not to create martial law, but to prevent any problem that we need to
[2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:36.260]  in per martial law. In other words, that was a preventative action. The globalists try to
[2:16:36.260 --> 2:16:41.940]  create localized crises to overturn the Republic. We have forces to stop it. Black Lives Matter
[2:16:41.940 --> 2:16:48.260]  kind of junk coming up again. Let me tell you the following. The coronavirus pandemic will be
[2:16:48.260 --> 2:16:54.580]  eliminated by Trump. He will basically say, and he has to, that we no longer need this
[2:16:54.580 --> 2:17:00.660]  nonsensical isolation of a government. That has been the most absurd thing I have seen.
[2:17:00.660 --> 2:17:07.780]  And it was a cover under which the Democrats could maintain their sense of power. At this point,
[2:17:07.780 --> 2:17:14.340]  we have to eliminate the notion of a mask. It's absurd. I mean, what you have seen and Trump
[2:17:14.340 --> 2:17:20.900]  will eliminate it is a very important element that I said years ago to your people. I said that
[2:17:20.900 --> 2:17:28.100]  wearing of a mask is the equivalent of the Jews wearing this golden star under Hitler. And that's
[2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:36.980]  the people he took care of. Namely, if I wanted to create a massive fascist organization, I have
[2:17:36.980 --> 2:17:41.700]  already done it. Oh, it's like an armband. It's a symbol that you subserve. It's a symbol you buy
[2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:48.340]  in the ideology. Correct. So you have and promote a man like Fauci, who would theoretically would
[2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:53.140]  go to Biden, but he will be fired and asked to leave the government. He's been there a long
[2:17:53.140 --> 2:17:59.780]  enough time. He's created a hysteria that was nonsensical. We will probably eliminate the notion
[2:17:59.780 --> 2:18:05.700]  of wearing masks and the pandemic and explain to people that you can use antibiotics or the
[2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:12.180]  other products that you have. And all of this nonsense has to go away. And we will free up
[2:18:12.180 --> 2:18:19.060]  our economy. The most important part of what Trump has to do now, and he understands it,
[2:18:19.060 --> 2:18:24.740]  he has to restart the economy. He's willing to put in millions and millions of dollars.
[2:18:24.740 --> 2:18:29.620]  He's willing to help. You'll have the floor to cover that. Let's let's get down to this.
[2:18:29.620 --> 2:18:34.340]  People see them announcing Biden's the winner, even though he's not under law. What do you expect
[2:18:34.340 --> 2:18:39.140]  to happen with the Supreme Court from your like analysis of the whole deal? And what's going
[2:18:39.140 --> 2:18:48.260]  on for that? Well, basically, declare that this was a major revolution that was a revolution of
[2:18:48.260 --> 2:18:55.700]  corruption. And they will overturn every state that had Biden primarily elected. That's a perfect
[2:18:55.700 --> 2:19:04.260]  term. This is a revolution of corruption. Correct. And what we have seen is the beginning and the
[2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:11.220]  evisceration of corruption that's been indigenous in our system for 60 to 70 years.
[2:19:11.220 --> 2:19:18.180]  Sidney Powell said it. Look, this is not about Biden. And Giuliani said it. This is not even about
[2:19:18.180 --> 2:19:24.660]  Trump. This is way beyond any individual. This is about what happened to the system
[2:19:24.660 --> 2:19:31.380]  as we progressed from one chicken hawk president to another, both Republicans and Democrats.
[2:19:31.380 --> 2:19:38.100]  And what happened at the local levels when corruption was the basic media and the basic
[2:19:38.100 --> 2:19:46.340]  currency of advancement. Now, why is that so unusual? For the most part, when you're a politician,
[2:19:46.340 --> 2:19:52.660]  on any level, you want to appeal to the people. But your narcissism has to be such
[2:19:52.660 --> 2:19:59.700]  that you're willing to do things against, quote, the law. In other words, Biden said it very early
[2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:06.420]  on 47 years ago. If Daria can take that video, he said, yes, I'm corrupt. I have to be corrupt
[2:20:06.420 --> 2:20:13.140]  in order to be a politician. That was the suing. Stand there. That's him. 47 years ago, Biden's
[2:20:13.140 --> 2:20:18.660]  elected the Senate. Biden says, don't say I'm not corrupt. And that ties into what Jeff Zucker's
[2:20:18.660 --> 2:20:22.900]  saying in these videos. The Veritas got. They're like, he goes, listen, everyone's corrupt, guys,
[2:20:22.900 --> 2:20:27.380]  let's be corrupt. That's the beginning of how this works. Like, we're all corrupt now. So we
[2:20:27.380 --> 2:20:32.100]  don't stand for anything. That's someone trying to create slaves. So we'll talk about that and
[2:20:32.100 --> 2:20:35.860]  what he sees coming next. Because he told us what he thought was going to happen three weeks ago.
[2:20:35.860 --> 2:20:41.460]  It's starting to actually move that crazy direction. And so what, what, what happens next with Dr. Steve
[2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:47.620]  Puccini? During our war for independence, during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson,
[2:20:47.620 --> 2:20:51.780]  the man credited with writing our Declaration of Independence and much of our Constitution later
[2:20:51.780 --> 2:20:57.060]  said, look, this is not going to be an easy fight. We're not going to be transported liberty on a bed
[2:20:57.060 --> 2:21:02.820]  of feathers. No, ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible successes with Donald Trump
[2:21:02.820 --> 2:21:08.020]  and Bolsonaro and the Liberty Movement worldwide. We're going to have major setbacks, but there is
[2:21:08.020 --> 2:21:11.700]  a giant awakening happening. That's what the globalists have gone ahead and launched their
[2:21:11.700 --> 2:21:16.980]  great reset. Global collapse, worldwide social credit score, tracking app, microchip, forced
[2:21:16.980 --> 2:21:21.540]  modulation takeover now. Because if they don't force it now, they're never going to get it.
[2:21:21.540 --> 2:21:25.140]  So info wars has never been more critical. I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:21:25.140 --> 2:21:29.940]  And I want to encourage you to do your Christmas shopping now at infowarstore.com. If we ship your

[2:22:13.060 --> 2:22:17.140]  most important month. You'll be able to fund ourselves in the next year. And I understand the
[2:22:17.140 --> 2:22:20.420]  economy shutdown. I understand there's not as much money as there used to be. They're trying to kill
[2:22:20.420 --> 2:22:25.140]  Trump's recovery, but info wars really need your support. You just buy great items through your
[2:22:25.140 --> 2:22:30.180]  Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com with huge sales, amazing products. And then you know you're
[2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:35.060]  funding the info war and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying
[2:22:35.060 --> 2:22:39.220]  to destroy small businesses continue to fund the second American revolution while getting great
[2:22:39.220 --> 2:22:45.780]  products at same time at infowarstore.com. Thank you. Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted
[2:22:45.780 --> 2:22:50.500]  they would. They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:56.260]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term on January 20th,
[2:22:56.260 --> 2:23:00.500]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to
[2:23:00.500 --> 2:23:05.060]  explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the
[2:23:05.060 --> 2:23:10.180]  energy source to us. So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic
[2:23:10.180 --> 2:23:15.060]  domination. This is economic war. We're being consolidated. We're being taken over. The democrats
[2:23:15.060 --> 2:23:20.420]  aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt
[2:23:20.420 --> 2:23:25.220]  the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the
[2:23:25.220 --> 2:23:30.660]  infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[2:23:30.660 --> 2:23:35.140]  Cloud Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your
[2:23:35.140 --> 2:23:41.300]  business is only a 25% for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is a master
[2:23:41.300 --> 2:23:57.220]  plan. Say no. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:00.820 --> 2:24:07.220]  The West is the best.
[2:24:07.220 --> 2:24:14.340]  And she's going to do the rest. All right. Steve Chinick is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[2:24:14.340 --> 2:24:17.860]  I'll host about 15 minutes the next hour. Matt Bracken is going to take over ahead of Owen
[2:24:17.860 --> 2:24:22.260]  Shore in the warm. Let me just tell you the story. I don't get orders from headquarters. I don't
[2:24:22.260 --> 2:24:28.980]  ever... I just do research and when I'm ready to go with my gut, I go with it. I finance a lot of
[2:24:28.980 --> 2:24:32.900]  websites that are well-known, a lot of groups, a lot of journals, a lot of people. And back in the
[2:24:32.900 --> 2:24:38.260]  day, when I made a lot of money before the banning on Facebook and Twitter and all that, I put tens
[2:24:38.260 --> 2:24:43.300]  of millions of dollars some years into other people. And a lot of the things you've seen that
[2:24:43.300 --> 2:24:48.740]  have been successful have been us. And that isn't about me getting credit. You need to know that I
[2:24:48.740 --> 2:24:53.540]  took that money and instead of having my own private jet I owned or a 20 bedroom house, I've
[2:24:53.540 --> 2:24:57.620]  got a five bedroom house that didn't damn things too big. I don't want to get a smaller house.
[2:24:57.620 --> 2:25:04.980]  The point is, I'm about to buy a trailer. I'm about a piece of property. I'm about to get a double-wide
[2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:10.900]  trailer since it's $100,000. But seriously, what I'm getting at here is when you spend money here,
[2:25:10.900 --> 2:25:16.500]  it goes into the war. So there were a bunch of demonstrations for the 12th and no one would pay
[2:25:16.500 --> 2:25:21.380]  the speaker systems and stuff because it's like $100,000 of the park service to do it. So I'm not
[2:25:21.380 --> 2:25:25.700]  going to tell you which ones. There's a bunch of events this weekend and we're financing a bunch
[2:25:25.700 --> 2:25:31.300]  of things. So that's just an example of when you buy the products, what we're doing, when I think
[2:25:31.300 --> 2:25:36.340]  something needs money and nobody else will do it, we do it. So go do your Christmas shopping
[2:25:36.340 --> 2:25:42.820]  at infowarstore.com and buy the water filters. The air filters are all top-rated. The storeable food,
[2:25:42.820 --> 2:25:46.420]  that's their biggest sell of the year. A huge discount on a one-month food supply
[2:25:46.420 --> 2:25:52.500]  for parallelx.com. But infowarstore.com has the krill oil and the turbo force and the brain force
[2:25:52.500 --> 2:25:58.580]  and the X2 and the X3 and the shortwave radios and survival gear and solar panel systems and
[2:25:59.860 --> 2:26:06.660]  seed center and freeze dryers. All of it is there and that funds our operation. You get great products
[2:26:06.660 --> 2:26:10.820]  at great prices and that's how we fund our operation with the big Christmas sale. So I
[2:26:10.820 --> 2:26:16.420]  thank you all, but my accountant's like, okay, you can operate about three months at this point.
[2:26:16.420 --> 2:26:20.980]  What are you doing paying for these damn rallies? You got to pay. You got to pay the park service
[2:26:20.980 --> 2:26:24.660]  and put up the thing. Some of these people aren't even having you speak. You're paying for it.
[2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:29.780]  It doesn't matter. Somebody's got to step up. So it's not about the credit I get. It's not about
[2:26:29.780 --> 2:26:34.660]  that. It's a war and you can just know that I will spend money in the war. I will, and I think I'll
[2:26:34.660 --> 2:26:38.100]  do a pretty damn good job we've shown. So we're going back to Dr. Steve Pachennick. We got this
[2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:42.820]  segment the next. A big picture because people are going to call me by the hundreds and we're
[2:26:42.820 --> 2:26:47.300]  going to get thousands of emails, literally like ask Pachennick who told him or why he thinks or
[2:26:47.300 --> 2:26:51.780]  what's coming next. I get you get some intel. You talk to folks that aren't God. They got their
[2:26:51.780 --> 2:26:57.220]  perspective. This is a moving part. No one knows except God. But what is the real battle space of
[2:26:57.220 --> 2:27:03.300]  America and the world right now as what you said sounded absurd three weeks ago? I mean, I knew it
[2:27:03.300 --> 2:27:08.500]  had a good shot. It was true. Moving towards now reality. What's the real battle space? What can we
[2:27:08.500 --> 2:27:16.020]  as citizens do right now? Well, most importantly, you as citizens number one for you to continue
[2:27:16.020 --> 2:27:24.580]  in the donations are important. Also to support James O'Keefe and Project Veritas. Yes. All these
[2:27:24.580 --> 2:27:32.980]  so called sidebar shows are becoming the mainstream. New York Times, CNN, NBC, that's all gone.
[2:27:32.980 --> 2:27:40.660]  That's a major turn of events. I also predict that Zuckerberg is going to be indicted and convicted
[2:27:40.660 --> 2:27:47.300]  for all kinds of irregularities and particularly a monopoly that he knows he's running. So the
[2:27:47.300 --> 2:27:54.260]  lawsuit is there against Zuckerberg. There will be another lawsuit against Dorsey on Twitter if
[2:27:54.260 --> 2:28:00.980]  he doesn't cease and desist his nonsense. And then for Facebook, Zuckerberg will pay a very heavy
[2:28:00.980 --> 2:28:08.260]  price. So what is happening now is on the international or the national level. I said to
[2:28:08.260 --> 2:28:15.300]  you 20 years ago, the power is devolving from Washington. Basically what Trump has done is to
[2:28:15.300 --> 2:28:20.820]  empty the swamp and literally interrupt. Elon Musk came out this weekend in a Wall Street Journal
[2:28:20.820 --> 2:28:24.900]  interview and said powers evolved from the east and west coast to the middle of the country in
[2:28:24.900 --> 2:28:31.300]  Texas, something you said here 18 years ago. Correct. And I admire Elon Musk. I invest in his
[2:28:31.300 --> 2:28:37.780]  companies. But this is a South African genius in Afrikaner that we call from Pechoria, where I
[2:28:37.780 --> 2:28:44.420]  invested and he correctly moved from California to Texas. Most people are moving from California
[2:28:44.420 --> 2:28:51.940]  to Florida. New York is empty. Chicago will be empty. Every democratic state in every democratic
[2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:58.500]  city will be empty. And basically people will go to the outskirts and to other places where they
[2:28:58.500 --> 2:29:06.500]  don't have to pay taxes. That's number one. Number two, the so-called control by the internet is
[2:29:06.500 --> 2:29:13.860]  breaking up. And that's why my guys in cyber command was the spear of the frontal attack,
[2:29:13.860 --> 2:29:20.900]  because the internet was a product of what I have said 20, 30 years ago, a product of the CIA
[2:29:20.900 --> 2:29:29.700]  through a company called iNQTEL. We talked about it, iNQTEL. And in turn, they thought they really
[2:29:29.700 --> 2:29:36.660]  could control everything until we were able to build up the military capacity on cyber command.
[2:29:36.660 --> 2:29:43.540]  So you're going to get rid of the 16 units that we have in intelligence, reorganize that intelligence.
[2:29:43.540 --> 2:29:49.140]  Grinnell may come back. He's been an incredible advocate. Sidney Powell has been an incredible
[2:29:49.140 --> 2:29:56.420]  advocate. So we have the presses are going to go. Hollywood is gone. We are developing independent
[2:29:56.420 --> 2:30:01.540]  stations like you. People tune in, they hear this, they go, a lot of that's already happening. You
[2:30:01.540 --> 2:30:05.380]  said on my show 15 years ago, Hollywood's dead, Hollywood's gone. So you've been right about
[2:30:05.380 --> 2:30:10.180]  that. But would people want to hear Dr. Please entertain us here or just, you know, please,
[2:30:11.780 --> 2:30:16.980]  whatever the term is, indulge me. Please tell us. I'm indulged here. I indulge us. Tell us your
[2:30:16.980 --> 2:30:22.500]  take on the next 41 days, how you see this playing out. I'm sure that it might not happen just like
[2:30:22.500 --> 2:30:26.820]  you said, but you're not saying this is the gospel truth. You're saying your opinion is, how's this
[2:30:26.820 --> 2:30:33.460]  about the play out? This is going to play off. We're pretty much trumped by the new year we'll
[2:30:33.460 --> 2:30:39.940]  have turned around the entire ballot system and shown that he won the electoral colleges. The
[2:30:39.940 --> 2:30:48.020]  Supreme Court will reaffirm that. He will come back in. He will select a new group of people to
[2:30:48.020 --> 2:30:53.540]  come into the White House, many who have fought for him on the side. Number two, there will be a
[2:30:53.540 --> 2:31:01.060]  breakup of the huge internet company. Zuckerberg will be indicted. Dorsey will be indicted. Others
[2:31:01.060 --> 2:31:07.700]  who have taken the social network and taken it out of control will be indicted. In turn, they
[2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:14.260]  don't go to prison, but they will have what we call proposition 230 will be imposed. And that
[2:31:14.260 --> 2:31:21.620]  means that every huge internet company will now be liable for all kinds of penalties. The second
[2:31:21.620 --> 2:31:27.460]  thing and the third thing is that we will eliminate this pandemic nonsense of wearing coronavirus
[2:31:27.460 --> 2:31:35.300]  and the masks. The fourth thing is that we're going to have to deal with problems overseas,
[2:31:35.300 --> 2:31:41.940]  but quite frankly, Putin has been a quiet ally of ours. The Chinese will understand that we will
[2:31:41.940 --> 2:31:48.340]  come back in full force if they do not comply with our wishes in terms of national security.
[2:31:48.340 --> 2:31:56.660]  In particular, we've deployed our Navy quietly to the South China Sea because we want to control
[2:31:56.660 --> 2:32:03.380]  the area where Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia is. The Chinese understand that.
[2:32:03.380 --> 2:32:08.820]  There will be another force structure that is surrounding the Chinese and that I can
[2:32:08.820 --> 2:32:14.580]  talk about some of the Japanese are building all their own islands now. Correct. The Japanese
[2:32:14.580 --> 2:32:20.660]  have always been our ally after World War Two. What is not known and I'm not revealing a terrible
[2:32:20.660 --> 2:32:27.860]  secret is the deployment of battleships and soldiers in Japan was not quite accurate.
[2:32:27.860 --> 2:32:35.860]  So when you say Japan has a quote small defense military, what's not said is that within 90
[2:32:35.860 --> 2:32:42.580]  days, we can blow out that military from 30,000 to 900. They have a giant secret military ready
[2:32:42.580 --> 2:32:49.460]  to be retrofit and they have ships all over the Pacific, which is quietly shielded away from the
[2:32:49.460 --> 2:32:56.260]  Chinese. The Chinese know that once we allow the Japanese to go into the South China Sea,
[2:32:56.260 --> 2:33:02.740]  we have a spear right underneath their belly. At the same time, we will go and once again,
[2:33:02.740 --> 2:33:09.220]  Trump will try to make peace with North Korea because Kim Jong-un went to Switzerland. He
[2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:14.980]  understands he has assets in Switzerland and he's going to make peace. At the same time,
[2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:20.500]  I said to you, we were going to have another treaty with another country and it turned out today.
[2:33:20.500 --> 2:33:26.260]  It was Morocco and Israel and Israel. Well, you look at Morocco about a month ago.
[2:33:27.140 --> 2:33:31.380]  Right. We'll be right back. No, you've been dead on so far. Dr. Steve Bachanik,
[2:33:31.380 --> 2:33:35.940]  our guest on Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com. Jeff Zuckerberg hates it.

[2:33:46.420 --> 2:33:51.620]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot. Well, info wars is white hot right
[2:33:51.620 --> 2:33:57.540]  now. World government, globalist forces trying to take over the United States is mainstream news
[2:33:57.540 --> 2:34:02.900]  and info wars credibility has gone through the roof. That's why now is the time to contact

[2:34:42.660 --> 2:34:47.140]  world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes, then picked up by the Rockefeller
[2:34:47.140 --> 2:34:52.820]  family and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s is all about corporate global governance.
[2:34:52.820 --> 2:34:57.540]  And now you're seeing it. How does the blue states, the blue cities, the communist and socialist
[2:34:57.540 --> 2:35:02.820]  nations all working in unison under UN control, established a medical planetary dictatorship
[2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:09.860]  at the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central
[2:35:09.860 --> 2:35:14.660]  banking families, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very
[2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:19.140]  heart of that. Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same
[2:35:19.140 --> 2:35:25.940]  time, but they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and
[2:35:25.940 --> 2:35:31.620]  Islam. Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it. They're involved in
[2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:36.340]  plotting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the master all about. It's about
[2:35:36.340 --> 2:35:40.820]  bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply or comply with your own destruction, wake up.
[2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:47.700]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations,
[2:35:47.700 --> 2:35:52.340]  the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer all pushing the coven's most deadly
[2:35:52.340 --> 2:35:58.100]  thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold. But if you are deficient,
[2:35:58.100 --> 2:36:02.100]  then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes.
[2:36:02.100 --> 2:36:07.140]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical
[2:36:07.140 --> 2:36:11.940]  officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:16.100]  are basically bio weapons that are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that
[2:36:16.100 --> 2:36:20.980]  die, basically. When they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to
[2:36:20.980 --> 2:36:24.980]  resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record.
[2:36:24.980 --> 2:36:29.780]  It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:33.700]  save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine princess
[2:36:33.700 --> 2:36:38.420]  can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something
[2:36:38.420 --> 2:36:48.420]  that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[2:36:53.460 --> 2:37:00.020]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:05.620]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up,
[2:37:05.620 --> 2:37:12.420]  you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[2:37:12.420 --> 2:37:17.220]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[2:37:17.220 --> 2:37:21.620]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[2:37:21.620 --> 2:37:27.060]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you,
[2:37:27.060 --> 2:37:31.860]  whether you wanted to find big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook,
[2:37:31.860 --> 2:37:36.020]  on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[2:38:02.500 --> 2:38:14.020]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[2:38:15.540 --> 2:38:24.100]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones. So pack that up. That's from the Patriot,
[2:38:24.100 --> 2:38:30.900]  Mel Gibson. They're losing the battle. He waves the flag. That's all written off three
[2:38:30.900 --> 2:38:34.820]  composites, the real history that happened if you read the script, the swamp box, and two other
[2:38:34.820 --> 2:38:39.700]  composites. But this battle actually happened. Waving the flag. They say, that's false news.
[2:38:39.700 --> 2:38:43.940]  He's a fraud. They're losing the battle. What's he doing? Waving the flags, and they're going to win.
[2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:49.620]  That's Steve Pacenna's giving people false hope. That's what we're doing here. But we're not like
[2:38:49.620 --> 2:38:55.140]  Oprah Winfrey with, you get a car, and you get a car. Giving people fish, we're teaching them how
[2:38:55.140 --> 2:39:00.500]  to fish. It's if we have the history, we have the components, we have the victory, we then believe
[2:39:00.500 --> 2:39:05.460]  in it. We don't buy their psi op that they won when it's a fraud. We have to declare with confidence
[2:39:05.460 --> 2:39:09.940]  we did win. People that don't get that secret ingredient thing, we're up here just giving you
[2:39:09.940 --> 2:39:16.500]  pie in the sky. No, it's if you take it, the blue sky is there. If you can ingest it, if you can do
[2:39:16.500 --> 2:39:20.900]  it, if you can speak it, if you can knock on 100 doors tonight, you can email your whole family and
[2:39:20.900 --> 2:39:25.940]  call them. If you can spread the word, if you can come to DC, if you can believe, we're not giving
[2:39:25.940 --> 2:39:30.580]  up. And you see, we've come from where it looked impossible three weeks ago to where now the worm
[2:39:30.580 --> 2:39:35.860]  is turning. But there's still room for defeats. I don't be over positive here. Dr. Steve Pacenna,
[2:39:35.860 --> 2:39:42.260]  other points on your mindset, your intel, where you think we are and what every listener and
[2:39:42.260 --> 2:39:46.740]  viewer can do right now to restore this republic and not let these chai-com operatives get in control.
[2:39:48.340 --> 2:39:55.060]  The most important part is, again, people like yourselves, Project Veritas and Tom
[2:39:55.060 --> 2:40:02.980]  sitting at Judicial Watch, you became independent entities, which really reaffirmed the notion
[2:40:02.980 --> 2:40:07.940]  that the individual, not the corporation, it's far more important than America.
[2:40:08.500 --> 2:40:14.020]  So what Trump is doing, he's reinstituting the notion. And that's why they want AI to tell us how
[2:40:14.020 --> 2:40:18.580]  to walk and how to wipe our ass and what to do. They want us to give in. They want us to be robots
[2:40:18.580 --> 2:40:25.780]  because they fear the individual. Well, and no one is more individualistic than Alex Jones
[2:40:25.780 --> 2:40:33.300]  or myself or Project Veritas or Project Judicial Watch. But the most important part of this,
[2:40:34.180 --> 2:40:40.260]  you and I don't belong to a group. We don't belong to an entity that covered whatever
[2:40:40.260 --> 2:40:46.100]  rights and wrongs we may have committed. The difference was in the Biden administration,
[2:40:46.100 --> 2:40:52.660]  everybody had been in the Brookings Institute, the CIA, they went to Harvard, Cornell,
[2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:58.980]  and one of the other elites. So what I'm also saying, and people will understand this, hopefully,
[2:40:59.780 --> 2:41:08.420]  that is the end of the elite schools. I said a long time ago, Cornell will pay a very heavy price
[2:41:08.420 --> 2:41:13.540]  for the neocons they created. And they did not want to admit that they were a major part
[2:41:13.540 --> 2:41:19.700]  of 9-11. The president of Cornell said nothing about it, yet they produced Zalmihalis,
[2:41:20.340 --> 2:41:26.260]  a whole bunch of guys, Paul Wolfowitz, and a lot of nonsense that went into wars. Harvard.
[2:41:26.260 --> 2:41:29.300]  And notice how they're trying to, and this is always your message, it's great, but we want
[2:41:30.180 --> 2:41:36.340]  your latest stuff. What are they thinking putting rice in all this? It shows Biden looks like he's
[2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:41.860]  dying worse than ever, stumbling around. He can't even talk. They look defeated. They look insane.
[2:41:41.860 --> 2:41:48.580]  So this is this failing forward, this too big to fail. Are you seeing no scenario in which Trump
[2:41:48.580 --> 2:41:56.420]  loses? I do not see any scenario with Trump loses. Let me explain it since you want me to go and
[2:41:56.420 --> 2:42:05.780]  explain again. Trump's attitude is very simple. He broke the back of the media. He broke the back
[2:42:05.780 --> 2:42:12.900]  of TV and movies. He broke the back of the collectivity, whatever that was. And basically on
[2:42:12.900 --> 2:42:19.940]  his own, without any coverage, he was able to mobilize thousands upon thousands of people
[2:42:19.940 --> 2:42:26.100]  at a time when nobody believed he was really a viable candidate. Nevertheless, he said,
[2:42:26.100 --> 2:42:33.540]  I will win. And that is his attitude in life. And that is what he conveys to every individual.
[2:42:33.540 --> 2:42:38.100]  He is the first president. This is important. And I've said it to you before,
[2:42:38.100 --> 2:42:45.300]  who literally entertains the individual and speaks to the individual. And how did he do that?
[2:42:45.300 --> 2:42:51.140]  And that was the giveaway that none of the Democrats could see. He used a new media.
[2:42:52.340 --> 2:42:56.260]  They try to make you a collective. He goes back to the individual, the real ethos, right?
[2:42:56.260 --> 2:43:00.900]  And all he's done is break their hoaxes, break their frauds, and he's about to do it again with
[2:43:00.900 --> 2:43:06.820]  our help. Correct. And that's why within a few weeks, you're going to see the massive change
[2:43:06.820 --> 2:43:13.700]  where Trump will reaffirm his legitimacy. He will come back into the office. And I said to Owen,
[2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:18.420]  it's not going to be another four years. It will be another eight years on top of this.
[2:43:18.420 --> 2:43:25.220]  I'm not whistling Dixie. It's simply the simple fact that Trump is really the persona of what
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:31.860]  America was about. The entrepreneur, the person who took the risk, the willingness. Okay. So how
[2:43:31.860 --> 2:43:36.660]  do you expect this to unfold? Because you said this three weeks ago and last Sunday, the indictments
[2:43:36.660 --> 2:43:40.340]  are coming. They're already there. Southern District. You're about to see it. I'm like,
[2:43:40.340 --> 2:43:45.380]  I'm like, Doc, you were back again a week ago. I said, Doc, they've buried it. It's going nowhere.
[2:43:45.380 --> 2:43:50.100]  Boom. It's all over the news. I mean, where did that come from? Because if Barr is not doing it,
[2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:57.140]  how suddenly did this come out? This came out because you do not. And I said it on your show
[2:43:57.140 --> 2:44:03.060]  a couple of months ago, and I reaffirm it. It's not about Barr or even the Department of Justice,
[2:44:03.060 --> 2:44:09.380]  which is highly corrupt. And as I said, the FBI is highly corrupt. The person that you really want
[2:44:09.380 --> 2:44:15.700]  to talk about is Sidney Powell, this incredible woman. But more importantly, the man who was
[2:44:15.700 --> 2:44:23.620]  proven as metal through 40 to 50 years, and I've known about his metal from the 80s, is Giuliani.
[2:44:24.340 --> 2:44:30.660]  No one, but no one in their right mind should go up against Giuliani. And I've said this on your
[2:44:30.660 --> 2:44:37.220]  show and I'm going to say it again. In 1988, when I was recruited to Drexel Burnham from the State
[2:44:37.220 --> 2:44:42.980]  Department, I said to them, is he Burnham? You're going to have a problem. You won't be around. He
[2:44:42.980 --> 2:44:47.780]  said, what are you talking about? I said, well, you got Mike Milken on the cover of Time Magazine
[2:44:47.780 --> 2:44:56.100]  earning $600 million. That's in 1988. I have a guy in the Reagan administration and the Bush
[2:44:56.100 --> 2:45:03.620]  administration who's making $66,000, and he's going to take you down. And the answer was no way.
[2:45:03.620 --> 2:45:10.740]  Giuliani took down every investment banking firm on Wall Street within the next four months. So
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:18.100]  Giuliani will be convicting a lot of people, Sidney Powell will, but you don't mess with Giuliani.
[2:45:18.100 --> 2:45:24.580]  When Trump said, and he's correct, he was the most formidable mayor we've ever had in New York.
[2:45:24.580 --> 2:45:31.060]  I was there. I saw what he did. I've seen him fire. So is it Giuliani's intellect and IQ or
[2:45:31.060 --> 2:45:38.180]  his connections are both? No, he is a tough New Yorker. When you grow up with the mafia and
[2:45:38.180 --> 2:45:44.660]  within the mafia, and then you take down the mafia, you have to understand this is not about
[2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:50.740]  intellect. This is not about our intelligence. What this is about is consistency and dedication.
[2:45:51.540 --> 2:45:58.820]  Guys like you and I, we fail. That's what America is about. America is not about success. It's
[2:45:58.820 --> 2:46:04.420]  about failure. Giuliani failed. He had several marriages. He had prostate cancer. But guess
[2:46:04.420 --> 2:46:10.580]  what? He continues. I continue. I don't belong to any clubs. When I left the CFR, I said,
[2:46:10.580 --> 2:46:15.940]  I don't belong here. That's not for me. What do you expect to see next? Because when I look at
[2:46:15.940 --> 2:46:21.220]  Biden, he looks like he's like, he looked okay three weeks ago. He looks like he's in hell on TV.
[2:46:22.180 --> 2:46:25.300]  Who? Giuliani? No, I'm talking about Biden. What's going to happen with Biden?
[2:46:25.300 --> 2:46:32.260]  Oh, Biden. Well, Biden's already made his peace. He lives in a town called Rehoboth in Delaware.
[2:46:32.260 --> 2:46:40.580]  It's a beach. He basically understand the game is over. I will suspect that he, his wife, or others
[2:46:40.580 --> 2:46:46.900]  will receive some kind of remuneration. He will probably say he can no longer continue because
[2:46:46.900 --> 2:46:52.500]  he's sick and he has some other problem, which is fine. He will not go to jail. I do not want
[2:46:52.500 --> 2:46:56.980]  to go. But are they trying to get it across the 20th of January deadline to put Kamala in?
[2:46:56.980 --> 2:47:02.340]  They're not going to put Kamala in. The one thing you have to understand, my friend,
[2:47:02.900 --> 2:47:08.340]  at which point that Kamala said, I gave up my senator ship. Did she say that? No.
[2:47:09.780 --> 2:47:14.900]  Well, cynic one known. There it is. Yeah, why are we hearing about who's going to replace Kamala?
[2:47:14.900 --> 2:47:19.940]  That's a good point. There's nobody going to replace Kamala because Kamala isn't coming in.
[2:47:19.940 --> 2:47:27.860]  The point of fact is Kamala is a very practical individual who knows that a lot of the BS was
[2:47:27.860 --> 2:47:34.420]  created about her, but she wants to be a senator. Then she'll probably become governor of California.
[2:47:34.420 --> 2:47:40.020]  And then at some future time, she may want to run again. But Kamala is not coming in. She knows
[2:47:40.020 --> 2:47:44.420]  that. I get that CNN's gaslighting us that there's no way to stop Biden, blah, blah, blah. And
[2:47:44.420 --> 2:47:48.020]  things are starting to turn against Biden. But this is insane. This is going to be a crazy deal.
[2:47:48.020 --> 2:47:54.900]  Who in their right mind watches CNN? I don't know anybody. I agree with you that it's total
[2:47:54.900 --> 2:48:00.100]  gaslighting. And we all have to point out it's a lie. And I hear you. Steve Pachennick.com. Steve,
[2:48:00.100 --> 2:48:06.420]  thank you so much for the time. You predicted. Thank you and thank you for all the work you've
[2:48:06.420 --> 2:48:11.460]  done for America. Thank you. Steve Pachennick.com. Well, he said, look for more to come out on the
[2:48:11.460 --> 2:48:16.340]  Bidens. And here it is. And boom, before, before inauguration, Steve, hopefully join us again next
[2:48:16.340 --> 2:48:21.860]  week. Okay. Yeah, I will. More than happily. Thank you very much. All right. Author, Navy,

[2:49:32.420 --> 2:49:35.780]  Lamster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:41.940]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out
[2:49:41.940 --> 2:49:48.900]  force, for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:49:48.900 --> 2:49:54.260]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see
[2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:59.380]  the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more
[2:49:59.380 --> 2:50:05.060]  devastating than you'd ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead,
[2:50:05.060 --> 2:50:11.220]  just eight months ago, within three months. Okay? It's a quarter million if you count all of the
[2:50:11.220 --> 2:50:16.340]  people that died of other things. We're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are real numbers. These
[2:50:16.340 --> 2:50:21.300]  are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out,
[2:50:21.300 --> 2:50:25.380]  and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[2:50:25.380 --> 2:50:35.460]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[2:50:55.380 --> 2:51:04.180]  Matt Brackett's coming up about 10 minutes. He's loaded and ready to go. A lot of key intel.
[2:51:05.060 --> 2:51:08.740]  But I tell you, I like Daniel Taylor. He has a lot of original ideas. It's a great page for your
[2:51:08.740 --> 2:51:14.420]  whole finger news. But I really love hearing a term that I coined picked up by others,
[2:51:15.540 --> 2:51:20.580]  almost posthumously, because I never get the credit. I don't care. Planetary genetic overwrite.
[2:51:20.580 --> 2:51:28.660]  The big picture behind COVID mRNA vaccines. I love that headline because that's a term I coined,
[2:51:28.660 --> 2:51:35.060]  planetary genetic overwrite. But then he gets into his own research and the statements by the
[2:51:35.060 --> 2:51:41.380]  globalist of exactly what the transhumanist are doing. The very genetic code of the planet's
[2:51:41.380 --> 2:51:47.300]  biosphere, including humans, is being overwritten. The ultimate goal being the ability to manipulate
[2:51:47.300 --> 2:51:54.580]  patent and program at will, the biological process of life, turning matter into zeros and ones.
[2:51:54.580 --> 2:52:01.380]  Within 50 years, we could have more life forms invented in a lab than we have ever identified
[2:52:01.380 --> 2:52:09.380]  in nature, fidelity investments. Thinking big, synthetic biology, fidelity, and it goes on.
[2:52:09.380 --> 2:52:19.780]  Tom Knight, the genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It's time for a rewrite.
[2:52:22.340 --> 2:52:30.820]  It goes on from there. This is not protecting the environment. This is overwriting and rewriting
[2:52:30.820 --> 2:52:37.860]  the environment. This is mad scientists playing God on us to get testing to see what will give them
[2:52:37.860 --> 2:52:44.740]  life extension technologies in their own words. So they had to control the nature
[2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:51.700]  conservancy in Jacques Cousteau and the Audubon Society and the UN and ESCO to make themselves
[2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:56.260]  the guardians of the earth, kind of like Laura Sillsby changed her name after she got convicted,
[2:52:56.260 --> 2:53:00.580]  child kidnapping and stuff with the Clintons. She changed her name and now runs Amber Alert.
[2:53:00.580 --> 2:53:06.900]  I mean, if you're going to run that stuff, you've got to be the group over protecting it.
[2:53:08.900 --> 2:53:11.460]  That's like CEO level controller fraud is what they call it.
[2:53:14.660 --> 2:53:19.780]  And it goes on from there. But a very important article at oldfingernews.com, it's also
[2:53:19.780 --> 2:53:26.740]  up on infowords.com, but that really tells you everything you need to know. It's an overwrite.
[2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:36.660]  It's a rewrite. It's a takeover. And what's weird is we sit here begging people to care like,
[2:53:36.660 --> 2:53:42.500]  oh, believe what I'm telling you. Look, they said it. People are like, oh, nonsense. Not caring gives
[2:53:42.500 --> 2:53:47.700]  me power. When you're giving them the whole future and what's happening and trying to get
[2:53:47.700 --> 2:53:53.380]  the general public to be players in their own universe, in their own world, and not just be
[2:53:53.380 --> 2:54:00.100]  passive zeros and ones that can be overwritten. And so I've asked myself, what do you call what we
[2:54:00.100 --> 2:54:06.740]  do? Just a human destiny, human free will. I don't want to be overwritten. I don't want to and then
[2:54:06.740 --> 2:54:11.220]  it's all experimental and it doesn't work and it never works. And then it's all these crazy
[2:54:11.220 --> 2:54:17.140]  globalists that like want to sexualize children and love communism and are just a bunch of assholes.
[2:54:17.140 --> 2:54:28.260]  So we're in 2020. They've got super advanced technology they've suppressed. They've all
[2:54:28.260 --> 2:54:33.300]  lined it up now like Hitler on the Polish border in 1940. And they're launching the whole thing.
[2:54:34.580 --> 2:54:39.460]  It's called a war. And that's why it's going to move very quick with internet IDs
[2:54:39.460 --> 2:54:43.700]  and digital passports. And yeah, my neighbor died of a COVID shot, but it's worth it. I'm a hero.
[2:54:43.700 --> 2:54:47.860]  You're like, well, more dying from the shot than dying of the vaccine. It doesn't matter. I'm a hero
[2:54:47.860 --> 2:54:50.340]  criticizing it's a form of you can be arrested for that.
[2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:57.860]  So it's about a suspension of common sense. It's about a suspension of your will, a subservience
[2:54:57.860 --> 2:55:06.260]  of your will, a giving up of your free will. Hey, just get with the program. We can go back
[2:55:06.260 --> 2:55:12.100]  outside and have our businesses again. You've been trained to comply, comply, comply. Always
[2:55:12.100 --> 2:55:16.180]  sounds reasonable. And then they always let you out of the trap. You comply, they let you out of
[2:55:16.180 --> 2:55:20.180]  the trap. You comply, they let you out of the trap. This last time you go really deep down the trap
[2:55:20.180 --> 2:55:23.460]  and you can hardly make it through it. It's like you comply and you find out you're dead.
[2:55:24.420 --> 2:55:29.540]  Stop complying with your own destruction. It's the animating contest of liberty
[2:55:29.540 --> 2:55:34.260]  that will empower you. Even if you were a sociopath, you'd fight the system at this point
[2:55:34.260 --> 2:55:42.580]  because that would enrich you much more than submit it. Just in time for Christmas,
[2:55:42.580 --> 2:55:47.940]  a lot of our best selling products are back in stock. The privacy pockets are back in stock
[2:55:47.940 --> 2:55:53.860]  and massively discounted in 1995. A great stock and stuff for a great gift. Alpha Power sold out
[2:55:53.860 --> 2:55:58.180]  for a year because of the lockdown. A lot of the key patent and ingredients weren't available.
[2:55:58.180 --> 2:56:02.740]  It is now back in stock. Another great product that's been selling out because people realize

[2:57:05.700 --> 2:57:20.260]  How politically correct. It's a man and a woman giving each other presents and enjoying each other.
[2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:25.780]  How horrible they're being commercial. They like giving each other things.
[2:57:26.340 --> 2:57:30.260]  Now that was a convicted pedophile spending time with your children at Drag Queen Storytime.
[2:57:30.260 --> 2:57:35.620]  That's a whole other thing. That's good family fun. Gotta get them on their young like local TV
[2:57:35.620 --> 2:57:44.180]  station set in Houston. Yes, this Santa comes with an mRNA vaccine that'll destroy your immunity
[2:57:44.180 --> 2:57:51.860]  and give you cancer if it doesn't sterilize you. Welcome to your doctor. He will see you now.
[2:57:51.860 --> 2:57:57.060]  He just so happens to want control of you in a mass raping operation.
[2:57:57.060 --> 2:58:05.540]  And here's some of the breaking headlines. Ratcliffe, Space Force to become 18th member
[2:58:05.540 --> 2:58:11.140]  of the US intelligence community, which means you've got a new group Trump can appoint.
[2:58:11.780 --> 2:58:17.380]  We see this as critical step in establishing the nation's newest service, said Major General
[2:58:17.380 --> 2:58:23.060]  Lay Lauterbach, Space Force Director of Intelligence and Surveillance and Reconnaissance.
[2:58:23.060 --> 2:58:29.780]  US Special Forces soon will become the Space Force, the 18th member of the US intelligence
[2:58:29.780 --> 2:58:34.580]  community, Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe said of the US Space Force.
[2:58:34.580 --> 2:58:38.980]  Intelligence elements, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force are part of the US intelligence
[2:58:38.980 --> 2:58:43.860]  community. Space Force will be added next, Ratcliffe said during the eighth meeting of the
[2:58:43.860 --> 2:58:48.900]  National Space Council, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Very, very interesting on that front.
[2:58:48.900 --> 2:58:55.620]  Also breaking, exclusive YouTube employs Chinese Communist State Security Bureau,
[2:58:55.620 --> 2:59:02.900]  software engineers. Really? So that's all breaking. That's all unfolding. I want to hand the baton here
[2:59:03.540 --> 2:59:10.020]  to Matt Bracken of enemiesfarmdomestic.com. He's got a lot to cover. I'll be listening.
[2:59:10.020 --> 2:59:15.700]  Then Owen Schreuer comes up in about 52 minutes. But first, seriously, I'm not complaining, but
[2:59:15.700 --> 2:59:20.580]  the accountant bitched at me this morning. They're like, Jones, everybody else is raising money for
[2:59:20.580 --> 2:59:24.740]  these Trump marches. You don't even ask for money for it. And you're paying for some of the stages,
[2:59:24.740 --> 2:59:31.300]  $30,000 here, thousands there. Tell the listeners. I'm like, well, okay, I don't want the credit,
[2:59:31.300 --> 2:59:35.220]  but I do need the money. Nobody else could belly up and get these things going for these Trump
[2:59:35.220 --> 2:59:42.420]  marches. So I wanted them Sunday and Saturday and Friday. So I've made some donations to make
[2:59:42.420 --> 2:59:46.100]  sure that happened. And I'll be at these speeches, and it's going to be huge. And I'll see you in DC.
[2:59:46.100 --> 2:59:50.980]  But for this Christmas, give yourself the get the freedom, buy some products at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:50.980 --> 2:59:57.380]  We have these great blocket pockets in black, red, green and blue. They've got a 99% accuracy rate.
[2:59:57.380 --> 3:00:01.460]  Some of the other pockets aren't that good. We've tested them, believe me. You got to be right under
[3:00:01.460 --> 3:00:06.500]  a cell tower for them to be able to beam through this and get your location and track you. This
[3:00:06.500 --> 3:00:12.580]  works. When I say 99%, it's higher than that. They're an expensive any cell phone or, you know,
[3:00:12.580 --> 3:00:18.500]  iPhone or droid goes in them. They're $19.95. They cost us $11. Other folks sell for $29.95.
[3:00:18.500 --> 3:00:23.620]  They're at infowarstore.com. The perfect stocking stocker sold out for months. So they are the
[3:00:23.620 --> 3:00:29.620]  perfect stocking stuffer. Also, Prostagard isn't just for men. It's good for your glands. It's
[3:00:29.620 --> 3:00:32.980]  good for your prostate. Well, it's good for everybody at the study show. And it's got all the
[3:00:32.980 --> 3:00:37.460]  different vitamins, the zinc, the D3, and all this other stuff in it. It's a great product for men
[3:00:37.460 --> 3:00:42.340]  and women. It's back in stock, massively discounted. And then Alpha Power has a bunch of patented
[3:00:42.340 --> 3:00:46.020]  ingredients sold out for a year. Couldn't get it because of the lockdown and all the crises. I
[3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:49.780]  thought the product would be discontinued. Finally, they were able to get it to us. We got Alpha Power
[3:00:49.780 --> 3:00:55.860]  back in. It's selling out very, very quickly. TurboForce, BrainForce, X2, X3, all the products
[3:00:55.860 --> 3:01:01.540]  at infowarstore.com. Vaso Beats. They all make great presents. So why go to Amazon? Why go to the
[3:01:01.540 --> 3:01:06.500]  mall? Why give your money to the big box stores? Buy products. Give them as gifts. Or you can
[3:01:06.500 --> 3:01:11.780]  actually put a note in it. Check out on the receipt so that your friends or family, you can
[3:01:11.780 --> 3:01:17.540]  order something from us. Put in your friends and families address. Be sure you put in on the note
[3:01:17.540 --> 3:01:23.060]  at checkout on the receipt so your family knows it came from Bob or Bill or Karen or Steve or
[3:01:23.060 --> 3:01:27.140]  Sanchez or whoever. Some of the people call us up. Well, why did I get this? And I said they
[3:01:27.140 --> 3:01:30.740]  didn't put a receipt. And then later they find out it was their brother or their mother or
[3:01:30.740 --> 3:01:35.620]  their sister. But do your Christmas shopping at InfoWars to keep us on air so we can fight hard

[3:03:01.540 --> 3:03:06.180]  from the District of Criminals DC. Matt Bracken takes over. Matt Bracken.
[3:03:08.580 --> 3:03:12.980]  Yeah, what's there to talk about? Not much going on. I mean, it's one of those just
[3:03:12.980 --> 3:03:18.740]  dull months. Same old, same old. You got Hunter Biden in trouble. You're just begging me to come
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:23.860]  back in. You've got the chikuns in trouble. Got the Supreme Court case. This is an insane time,
[3:03:23.860 --> 3:03:29.540]  brother. What would you call this time? Call them before the storm, eye of the hurricane.
[3:03:31.860 --> 3:03:36.740]  You know, there's a, they say in the military, hope is not a plan. And right now everybody is,
[3:03:37.300 --> 3:03:41.860]  we're back in the, we're back in the revival tent saying Texas is going to save us.
[3:03:41.860 --> 3:03:47.860]  The Supreme Court is going to save it, save us. You know, it's, it's the, like a, like a junkie
[3:03:47.860 --> 3:03:54.260]  or a gambling addict. You know, we're just back in the casino with our kids lunch money for one
[3:03:54.260 --> 3:04:04.260]  more roll of the dice, like national ampoune Las Vegas vacation when Chevy Chase goes to back,
[3:04:04.260 --> 3:04:10.100]  back to the blackjack table and meets his nemesis, the dealer, and he's only got five bucks.
[3:04:10.820 --> 3:04:16.500]  And says, what can I do with five bucks? And the dealer says, you can, you can buy a bullet
[3:04:16.500 --> 3:04:23.700]  and rent a gun. So us hoping right now that the Supreme Court is going to save us. I think that
[3:04:23.700 --> 3:04:30.420]  we need to make another plan all the way back to the beginning of the Trump, the Trump era.
[3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:37.940]  We've been fed these false hopes. First, it was Jeff Sessions. He was going to be stealth Jeff,
[3:04:37.940 --> 3:04:43.940]  stealth Jeff. You know, he was just doing that low key approach, but secretly he was in the
[3:04:43.940 --> 3:04:50.900]  Department of Justice, taking names and getting ready to kick ass. That was all BS. Then it was,
[3:04:50.900 --> 3:04:56.980]  okay, we got Robert Barr. And then we've got, we've got a special prosecutor Durham. They're
[3:04:56.980 --> 3:05:02.980]  going to do the job. You know, then it, now it just before the election and through the election.
[3:05:02.980 --> 3:05:09.940]  Oh, it was the, uh, Frankfurt, Germany, Seidel Farm. They're shipping people to Gitmo in secret.
[3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:16.180]  I'm not buying any of it. I don't think that there is this plan. I think that we respect your views
[3:05:16.180 --> 3:05:19.940]  when we come back. I'm going to be listening. What do you think is going to happen? What happens
[3:05:19.940 --> 3:05:27.140]  if Biden gets in and what's plan B? Resistance. We've got a plan for resistance. You can see
[3:05:27.140 --> 3:05:31.540]  his t-shirt. I'm going to stand up a little bit so you can see it. It's a reference to, uh,
[3:05:31.540 --> 3:05:37.300]  Normandy invasion and red dawn. The chair is against the wall. We've got to go to the,
[3:05:37.300 --> 3:05:41.940]  the next level because we're certainly not going to just cooperate like good serfs,
[3:05:41.940 --> 3:05:48.420]  like peasants. Our election was stolen. The rule of law is over and now we're into a new era with
[3:05:48.420 --> 3:05:56.180]  new rules and it's not going to be business as usual. It's going to be, it's going to be massive
[3:05:56.180 --> 3:06:02.660]  resistance in every way that we can. And some of it might manifest as physical resistance and some
[3:06:02.660 --> 3:06:07.940]  of it will be civil disobedience. And we're starting to see it with the, uh, you know, with
[3:06:07.940 --> 3:06:13.620]  people supporting their little restaurant tours and bars. We're going to see that on a much bigger
[3:06:13.620 --> 3:06:20.820]  level. And with, and with these rallies, you know, the DC million MAGA rally this Saturday,
[3:06:20.820 --> 3:06:27.060]  I was in, I was in Valdosta, Georgia, uh, just two hours from where I live. I was up in Valdosta
[3:06:27.060 --> 3:06:34.100]  last weekend and it was a sight to behold. It was, it was, um, you know, the MAGA nation is
[3:06:34.100 --> 3:06:39.060]  not going to lay down. We're not going to just, we're not just going to surrender and take it.
[3:06:39.060 --> 3:06:44.900]  Three months ago, we sold out of our privacy pouches. The reason we sold out is they are super
[3:06:44.900 --> 3:06:50.420]  high quality and it's all over the news that the UN and the Clintons and Microsoft and others
[3:06:50.420 --> 3:06:54.820]  and contact tracers are tracking everywhere you go and everything you do. They admit it's a cover
[3:06:54.820 --> 3:07:00.100]  for bringing in their cashless society, AI system of total control. So to block the UN, to block
[3:07:00.100 --> 3:07:04.820]  the globalist, to get in the habit of realizing what a surveillance system phones are, everybody
[3:07:04.820 --> 3:07:10.180]  needs a privacy pocket. They fit almost all sizes of droids and iPhones from small to big.
[3:07:10.180 --> 3:07:14.900]  They also make a great gift to educate friends and family about what's going on. Now again,
[3:07:14.900 --> 3:07:18.900]  there's lots of privacy pocket type systems out there, most of them are about a 90% effective.
[3:07:18.900 --> 3:07:24.980]  We found a model that's actually pretty inexpensive and has around 99% effectiveness. If you're right
[3:07:24.980 --> 3:07:29.540]  under a cell tower, it'll still blast through the Faraday cage. They're at infowarstore.com at
[3:07:29.540 --> 3:07:34.980]  $19.95. This exact same system is sold everywhere else for $29. That's still a great deal. We sell
[3:07:34.980 --> 3:07:38.900]  a lot of these. We have the best price. Give us a great Christmas gift at infowarstore.com.

[3:08:58.740 --> 3:09:08.900]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Matt Bracken.
[3:09:12.340 --> 3:09:18.260]  No, it's not too late to get a couple of nice hard copy books for Christmas presents. Just
[3:09:18.900 --> 3:09:25.620]  as a suggestion there. Now, I was pretty pessimistic in the opening segment saying that
[3:09:25.620 --> 3:09:30.100]  we're probably going to get the rug pulled out from under us again by the SCOTUS. It's going to be
[3:09:30.660 --> 3:09:37.860]  Lucy and Charlie Brown again with the football. So don't get your hopes up. But just in the event
[3:09:37.860 --> 3:09:46.260]  that somehow SCOTUS comes through and decides to uphold the Constitution, what's going to happen?
[3:09:46.900 --> 3:09:54.820]  Well, if it goes to the state legislatures, that's not a panacea because let's say that the
[3:09:54.820 --> 3:10:00.980]  Supreme Court says that these four states, they have to have at least a vote in their
[3:10:00.980 --> 3:10:05.460]  legislature. They put pressure on the legislature to choose their state electors.
[3:10:06.500 --> 3:10:12.740]  Well, those state legislatures, they're just made of human beings too. And we're in an era of
[3:10:12.740 --> 3:10:19.620]  just gross rampant intimidation, death threats, everything. So it's going to be asking a lot for
[3:10:19.620 --> 3:10:28.820]  those state legislatures to overturn the bogus fraud election of Joe Biden and see the slate of
[3:10:28.820 --> 3:10:35.940]  Trump electors. So no matter what the Supreme Court says, don't look for the state legislators to
[3:10:35.940 --> 3:10:43.700]  suddenly find all this courage when they're thinking about their children on the way to school or the
[3:10:43.700 --> 3:10:49.860]  Molotov through the bedroom window at night, because that's where we are folks. It's going to
[3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:57.140]  take an enormous amount of courage for them to defy this stolen election and overturn it.
[3:10:57.780 --> 3:11:01.620]  So no matter what the Supreme Court does, they're not just going to install Trump,
[3:11:01.620 --> 3:11:06.500]  they're going to send it to the state legislatures and it's very likely that it'll die right there.
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:14.340]  And what kind of pressure are we talking about? Look at Georgia. Look what happened to this young
[3:11:14.340 --> 3:11:22.820]  man whose car was blown up. Car accidents don't result in a massive explosion where the engine
[3:11:22.820 --> 3:11:31.220]  lands 200 feet from the car. Sometimes, depending on what happens, there's a fire after an accident,
[3:11:31.220 --> 3:11:39.140]  but accidents don't start with an explosion. I think that that was a message not only to
[3:11:39.140 --> 3:11:46.020]  Kemp and to Laughler because the young man was connected to both of them. This is a warning that
[3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:51.780]  this could happen to any of your family. This is the league we're playing in. This is the
[3:11:51.780 --> 3:11:56.420]  stakes we're playing in. That's why I don't think that I'm hyperbolic. We're in this,
[3:11:56.420 --> 3:12:02.580]  you know, the chairs against the wall t-shirt with the AR on it, because this is where we're
[3:12:02.580 --> 3:12:11.540]  heading. We've been backed into a corner. The left mistakes are our forbearance and patience.
[3:12:11.540 --> 3:12:17.940]  We're law-abiding people. We want to just live our lives in peace. They mistake that for weakness
[3:12:18.580 --> 3:12:25.540]  and they're playing the same Marxist playbook, using the same Marxist playbook that they've
[3:12:25.540 --> 3:12:32.580]  been using successfully in country after country. So they think there's no reason why this shouldn't
[3:12:32.580 --> 3:12:39.300]  work in America. Then there's the generation, the age factor, where the instigators of this
[3:12:39.940 --> 3:12:45.780]  are the Bill Ayers generation, the Bob Avakian generation, the Angela Davis generation.
[3:12:46.820 --> 3:12:54.500]  These godless communist atheists believe that they're essentially worm food once they assume
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:13:02.980]  room temperature. And the only greater glory that they are ever going to achieve is to be responsible
[3:13:02.980 --> 3:13:09.940]  for an ultimate communist revolution in the United States. Or, if not a communist revolution,
[3:13:10.660 --> 3:13:18.100]  the destruction of the United States of America as a free country. That this country will no longer
[3:13:18.100 --> 3:13:24.100]  threaten the revolution in the rest of the world because it'll be wrecked. And that's what,
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:30.340]  that's what they're going for now. This is not a partial deal. They will absolutely threaten the
[3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:37.460]  lives of these state legislatures in the four states in question, plus Arizona and Nevada.
[3:13:38.420 --> 3:13:44.500]  They are absolutely at this level now. And we have to be thinking long terms in terms of guerrilla
[3:13:44.500 --> 3:13:51.940]  warfare. But to begin with, we have to use the tools that we have. And that would be,
[3:13:51.940 --> 3:13:58.900]  we need an exodus off of enemy media. I'm not saying just necessarily quit Twitter and Facebook
[3:13:58.900 --> 3:14:05.540]  if you're on them, but don't only post there. You can parallel post it. Just leave Parler and
[3:14:05.540 --> 3:14:11.220]  Gab up and post there as well. So when the day comes that you're kicked off of YouTube or Twitter
[3:14:11.220 --> 3:14:17.620]  or Facebook, who cares? Or if you want to, just close your account on Twitter and Facebook.
[3:14:17.620 --> 3:14:25.700]  You know, Infowars got ahead of this game early. So it's kind of a case of necessity being the
[3:14:25.700 --> 3:14:33.220]  mother of invention by being banned from YouTube early. Look at what, what Alex has done, creating
[3:14:33.220 --> 3:14:41.060]  banned.video. It's a rock solid, searchable, tremendous video platform. And there's also
[3:14:41.060 --> 3:14:47.460]  now, you know, BitShoot's been out and is, and is established and rumble is coming on. And there are
[3:14:47.460 --> 3:14:55.540]  others, but we cannot depend on, on living inside of the enemy social media, where we're throttled
[3:14:55.540 --> 3:15:01.300]  in shadow banned. Look at what they did with this entire election. Half of the country never heard
[3:15:01.300 --> 3:15:08.820]  of, of the laptop from hell or Tony Babelinsky. They never heard of it. So the first step is
[3:15:08.820 --> 3:15:15.220]  moving into our own communication zone at all levels. You know, I even just, I just ordered a
[3:15:15.220 --> 3:15:23.220]  CB radio. I haven't owned a CB radio in, in decades and decades, but I want multiple channels.
[3:15:23.220 --> 3:15:30.180]  I've got a, you know, box full of the Balfang handheld UHF VHF radios. Communications are
[3:15:30.180 --> 3:15:36.980]  going to be essential. So that means not only your, your cell phone, which can be jammed or,
[3:15:36.980 --> 3:15:44.340]  or used as a tracker and the eavesdropping device, but all forms of communication. Handheld radios,
[3:15:44.340 --> 3:15:51.140]  shortwave radios are tremendous. Even if you're not a ham operator, that's a big investment in a,
[3:15:51.140 --> 3:15:57.700]  and a long term goal to be able to transmit long range. But everybody can listen long range.
[3:15:57.700 --> 3:16:02.180]  There are going to be people on shortwave that might be the only way we're getting unfiltered
[3:16:02.180 --> 3:16:08.500]  news and a shortwave receiver you can get for, you know, 50 or a hundred bucks. Then you can,
[3:16:08.500 --> 3:16:12.980]  you can find the schedules that people are going to be broadcasting because this is
[3:16:12.980 --> 3:16:19.780]  where we are moving. I do not assume for a second that Trump is going to spend the next four years
[3:16:19.780 --> 3:16:26.260]  in the White House. He has said if the electoral college votes against him, he's going to leave.
[3:16:26.260 --> 3:16:31.140]  That doesn't mean he'll accept it. I mean, he may not go to the inauguration and we may be an
[3:16:31.140 --> 3:16:38.020]  into resistance mode, but the left with Biden in the White House, even if it's only for,
[3:16:38.020 --> 3:16:45.220]  for a couple of weeks or a month, I expect he'll be gone over the Biden family corruption or his
[3:16:45.220 --> 3:16:53.780]  dementia. But we're going to be dealing with Kami Harris and AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi. These
[3:16:53.780 --> 3:16:58.820]  are the people that are going to be running our country and they're not going to just permit us
[3:16:58.820 --> 3:17:05.220]  to continue to, as they see it, spread our dangerous hate speech. You know, YouTube is
[3:17:05.220 --> 3:17:13.860]  already banning talk about fraud. I mean, we are moving into the USSA phase. You know, YouTube is
[3:17:13.860 --> 3:17:21.220]  owned by Google. And as Alex just said, they're employing Chinese communist engineers that are
[3:17:21.220 --> 3:17:29.380]  specialists in censorship and in the social credit system. That's where we're moving folks.
[3:17:29.380 --> 3:17:34.900]  That's why I keep pushing getting into alternate comms channels. We'll explore this more on the
[3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:40.420]  other side. The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance
[3:17:40.420 --> 3:17:45.460]  to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[3:17:45.460 --> 3:17:49.300]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a
[3:17:49.300 --> 3:17:55.780]  chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos
[3:17:55.780 --> 3:18:01.220]  Group and Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[3:18:01.220 --> 3:18:06.340]  Foundation, all the rest of them, at 10 to 21, at 20 to 30, it's here. And only gets worse,
[3:18:06.340 --> 3:18:10.420]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[3:18:12.100 --> 3:18:16.500]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil,
[3:18:16.500 --> 3:18:22.420]  and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we
[3:18:22.420 --> 3:18:28.980]  are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that,
[3:18:28.980 --> 3:18:33.940]  we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[3:18:36.100 --> 3:18:40.420]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses. They want control.
[3:18:40.420 --> 3:18:46.340]  They want domesticated slaves. That's the process that is taking place right now. And when you shop
[3:18:46.340 --> 3:18:51.860]  at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they are creating monopolies
[3:18:51.860 --> 3:18:56.580]  and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world
[3:18:56.580 --> 3:19:00.180]  government, all of it. If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there. But if you'll shop at
[3:19:00.180 --> 3:19:05.300]  InfoWars where we have thousands of products made right here in America with our warehouses and our
[3:19:05.300 --> 3:19:10.740]  crew, it's incredible and it changes the whole world. So do your shopping if you want to fund
[3:19:10.740 --> 3:19:15.060]  the InfoWars. Or if you want to stop the globalist at infowarstore.com and tell others to their
[3:19:15.060 --> 3:19:19.380]  shopping at infowarstore.com. We have amazing products. We can get everything delivered to
[3:19:19.380 --> 3:19:24.180]  you by Christmas if you order by the 18th. So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:19:24.180 --> 3:19:27.380]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money

[3:19:47.300 --> 3:19:53.700]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with
[3:19:53.700 --> 3:19:58.980]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu
[3:19:58.980 --> 3:20:04.820]  comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest
[3:20:04.820 --> 3:20:10.820]  band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[3:20:10.820 --> 3:20:14.580]  tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action,
[3:20:14.580 --> 3:20:20.180]  you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[3:20:20.180 --> 3:20:24.340]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[3:20:24.340 --> 3:20:54.180]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[3:20:55.300 --> 3:21:08.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:20.660]  You know, yesterday Alex had a guest on who I consider to be, you know, a genius on several
[3:21:20.660 --> 3:21:30.660]  levels. Robert Barnes, I consider him a super lawyer. He has an ability to explain complex
[3:21:30.660 --> 3:21:37.140]  legal issues in ways that the lay people can understand it. I mean, and that's a skill too.
[3:21:37.140 --> 3:21:42.420]  It's one thing to understand the law, but it's another thing to be able to translate it so that
[3:21:42.420 --> 3:21:48.420]  ordinary people can comprehend it. And I watched the show and I watched it again today
[3:21:48.420 --> 3:21:55.140]  before this because I consider it that important. It's up on top at band.video. I recommend you
[3:21:55.140 --> 3:22:01.780]  watch it if you haven't. He thinks that the Texas thing is going to come down to the Supreme Court
[3:22:01.780 --> 3:22:09.140]  having courage or not. And I agree with that, but I don't expect them to have courage because
[3:22:09.940 --> 3:22:16.580]  I think that the paradigm we're in now is they're afraid of kicking over the hornet nest of the
[3:22:16.580 --> 3:22:23.220]  left. You know, on November 3rd, our cities were boarded up, not because they were expecting Trump
[3:22:23.220 --> 3:22:30.180]  to lose, because they were expecting Trump to potentially win or probably win. And if so,
[3:22:30.180 --> 3:22:37.140]  the left was going to immediately go into a till of the Hun mood, you know, Antifa Black Lives
[3:22:37.140 --> 3:22:45.780]  Matter riot mode. Because they frauded the election, that was put on hold, but it's not over.
[3:22:45.780 --> 3:22:54.660]  And the Supreme Court, these five, the five that we would need, they have to be thinking,
[3:22:55.220 --> 3:23:00.900]  goodness, if I do anything that leads to the overturning of this fraudulent election,
[3:23:01.860 --> 3:23:08.100]  and the cities burn, I'll be blamed. So let's just kick the can down the road,
[3:23:08.100 --> 3:23:13.780]  let Biden have his four years, and we'll just try to get through it as best we can.
[3:23:13.780 --> 3:23:18.900]  That's what I expect. And if they kick it to the state legislatures,
[3:23:19.700 --> 3:23:24.180]  I expect that these state legislators are going to be terrified as well.
[3:23:24.980 --> 3:23:30.020]  They won't have the courage to do it, because they know their own homes will be targeted,
[3:23:30.020 --> 3:23:37.460]  you know, in all kinds of attacks. That bombing in Georgia, that car bomb, it wasn't just a message
[3:23:37.460 --> 3:23:43.940]  to Kemp and Laughler. It was a message to anybody that might overturn this fraudulent election. Now,
[3:23:45.380 --> 3:23:50.580]  Barnes mentioned yesterday that half of America, according to all polls, half of Americans now
[3:23:50.580 --> 3:23:55.860]  think that the fraud, that the election was, you know, won by Biden completely by fraud.
[3:23:56.420 --> 3:24:02.020]  80% of Republicans, a third of Democrats that are even willing to admit it, probably more,
[3:24:02.020 --> 3:24:08.900]  know that it was done by fraud. So Barnes, this is where I disagree and differ from Barnes.
[3:24:09.700 --> 3:24:15.380]  Robert Barnes said, the solution is to double down on democracy, you know, just get out there,
[3:24:15.380 --> 3:24:21.220]  and we'll have to, you know, work harder at a populist level, and I don't see that happening.
[3:24:21.780 --> 3:24:27.860]  I think that that's that potential of having another Andrew Jackson, like a new party,
[3:24:27.860 --> 3:24:33.700]  I don't see that working. You know, the first thing that's going to happen in a Biden presidency
[3:24:34.340 --> 3:24:40.260]  is at least 20 million illegal aliens are going to be amnestyed right out of the gun,
[3:24:40.260 --> 3:24:47.220]  right out of the chute, and they will be voting in every election henceforth. This is what happened
[3:24:47.220 --> 3:24:54.100]  in California, you know, where they where they put motor voter ballots, ballot applications
[3:24:54.100 --> 3:25:00.820]  at the DMV, and then advertised in Spanish on billboards, on radio, on television,
[3:25:01.460 --> 3:25:05.940]  that, hey, when you get your driver's license, we don't ask about your citizenship.
[3:25:06.820 --> 3:25:12.020]  And wink, wink, attached to the driver's license application is a voter card,
[3:25:12.660 --> 3:25:20.180]  and wink, wink, we've never charged anybody with voting fraudulently that wasn't a citizen.
[3:25:20.180 --> 3:25:28.660]  So they they basically, without an amnesty, because it's just a state, California did de facto
[3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:36.900]  what the what Biden and Harris are going to do legally, which is amnesty, probably at least,
[3:25:36.900 --> 3:25:43.460]  I would say 20 to 30 million illegals, they will be voting and your state, every state,
[3:25:43.460 --> 3:25:53.140]  will be californicated forever. So there is no next election. Plus, this fraud wasn't done
[3:25:53.140 --> 3:26:00.100]  in a secret way. This fraud was done in our faces. When they put the boards up in Michigan,
[3:26:00.100 --> 3:26:06.340]  blocking the view, they weren't hiding the fact that they were cheating. It was two middle fingers
[3:26:06.340 --> 3:26:13.140]  to us. Of course, we're cheating. When they bring in the boxes of ballots at 4am, they didn't
[3:26:13.140 --> 3:26:19.460]  expect that it would be a secret. The truck driver with the quarter of a million ballots
[3:26:19.460 --> 3:26:25.940]  driving from New York to Pennsylvania, then his trailer is misdirected and quote unquote lost.
[3:26:26.820 --> 3:26:32.980]  They knew this would come out. It's in our face. They're saying to us, like a mafia,
[3:26:33.620 --> 3:26:38.180]  like a mafia gang saying to a store owner, what are you going to do about it, punk?
[3:26:38.180 --> 3:26:44.420]  What are you going to do about it? Sure, we're in charge now and you can't do anything.
[3:26:45.380 --> 3:26:50.420]  The Supreme Court, you think it's going to be your last chance. Oh, the Supreme Court is going
[3:26:50.420 --> 3:26:55.460]  to save us. Yeah, just like Jeff Sessions, just like Barr, just like Durham, they're all going to
[3:26:55.460 --> 3:27:01.540]  save us. Commandoes in Frankfurt are going to bring the servers back. They're all going to save us.
[3:27:01.540 --> 3:27:08.020]  No, I think it's going to go through. Biden's going to be in the White House, at least for
[3:27:08.020 --> 3:27:13.860]  a day before Kami Harris takes over. And then we're going to have to go into a totally different
[3:27:13.860 --> 3:27:21.780]  mode because expect every channel that you can think of to be shut down. They don't want band.video
[3:27:21.780 --> 3:27:28.900]  to be able to retransmit these broadcasts. They're going to attempt to shut down everything. That's
[3:27:28.900 --> 3:27:36.740]  why Google YouTube is shutting down talk about the fraud. They don't want a competing message.
[3:27:36.740 --> 3:27:43.140]  That's why I'm saying get on every alternate channel while you can and use them, but also plan
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:50.260]  things like shortwave radio receivers, transmitters, if you can swing it. CB has a pretty good range,
[3:27:50.260 --> 3:27:56.420]  like a county wide range. You put up the right antenna. If you get a friend to MacGyver it,
[3:27:56.420 --> 3:28:02.820]  you can put out a lot more power. Don't worry about encryption. Just using in the clear and
[3:28:02.820 --> 3:28:10.660]  brevity codes will be enough to overwhelm any attempt to stifle free speech on the airwaves,
[3:28:10.660 --> 3:28:16.900]  even if it has to be done at a local level, rebroadcasting what people are hearing from
[3:28:16.900 --> 3:28:23.300]  shortwave. They're not going to quit now. They just had another election in Venezuela.
[3:28:24.020 --> 3:28:30.820]  And if you go back 25 years to Hugo Chavez, the conservatives in that country said,
[3:28:30.820 --> 3:28:36.420]  don't worry, he'll wreck the economy and then we'll have a big victory next time out. No,
[3:28:36.420 --> 3:28:42.820]  it doesn't work that way. They nail the doors shut behind them. They screw them down and glue
[3:28:42.820 --> 3:28:48.900]  them down. They don't give you another chance. That's where we are now. When they get these
[3:28:48.900 --> 3:28:55.300]  20 or 30 million illegals voting, they'll hardly need to cheat. Why would they need to cheat?
[3:28:55.300 --> 3:29:02.020]  They're going to have 20 million new votes spread across the states. And the Democrats will be saying,
[3:29:02.020 --> 3:29:08.740]  make sure to vote Democrat so that you can bring your entire family in and make them citizens too.
[3:29:08.740 --> 3:29:15.620]  Who do you think they're going to vote for? This is it, folks. This is the chairs against the wall.
[3:29:16.500 --> 3:29:22.020]  There is no more fallback position from this. We're going, you know, if Biden is in the White
[3:29:22.020 --> 3:29:28.500]  House, we're going to have to do things that you might not have imagined. You know, to using civil
[3:29:28.500 --> 3:29:34.900]  disobedience as a start, monkey wrench the entire system so that it can't function.
[3:29:35.540 --> 3:29:40.500]  If they're going to come after the guns, they're already coming after our free speech,
[3:29:40.500 --> 3:29:45.700]  then it'll be coming after the guns. And we're going to have to, in no uncertain terms,
[3:29:45.700 --> 3:29:53.540]  let them know we're not cooperating. This isn't going to be a smooth transition to Amara Zewala.
[3:29:54.180 --> 3:29:59.380]  That's the mistake of the left. They think that they can Venezuela is America,
[3:29:59.380 --> 3:30:05.940]  but we're not Venezuela. We've got tens and hundreds of thousands of former special operators.
[3:30:06.660 --> 3:30:12.660]  We've got people that know guerrilla warfare backward and forward. Fourth and fifth generation
[3:30:12.660 --> 3:30:19.540]  warfare. We understand it and we're going to have to use these methods now because we're not going
[3:30:19.540 --> 3:30:26.580]  to be turned into slaves just because they stole an election and our politicians are cowards who
[3:30:26.580 --> 3:30:33.780]  are afraid to call it out. And the media is part of the scam. We'll finish on the other side.
[3:30:33.780 --> 3:30:42.340]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year 2021.
[3:30:42.980 --> 3:30:46.900]  I'm Alex Jones. I started in full wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[3:30:47.620 --> 3:30:52.420]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet is
[3:30:52.420 --> 3:30:56.900]  waiting up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on. That's why it's so important
[3:30:56.900 --> 3:31:01.620]  for those of you out there that have supported the broadcast and the websites and the films and
[3:31:01.620 --> 3:31:05.540]  all the rest of the information we put out to realize how important your work has been and to
[3:31:05.540 --> 3:31:10.340]  redouble your efforts. So I salute you and I thank you. Also, as Christmas is almost here,

[3:31:37.620 --> 3:31:41.940]  during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson, the man credited with writing our
[3:31:41.940 --> 3:31:45.860]  Declaration of Independence and much of our constitution later said, look, this is not
[3:31:45.860 --> 3:31:50.740]  going to be an easy fight. We're not going to be transported liberty on a bed of feathers.
[3:31:50.740 --> 3:31:56.820]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible successes with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro
[3:31:56.820 --> 3:32:01.540]  and the Liberty Movement worldwide. We're going to have major setbacks, but there is a giant
[3:32:01.540 --> 3:32:05.460]  awakening happening. That's what the Globals have gone ahead and launched their great reset.
[3:32:05.460 --> 3:32:10.340]  Global collapse, worldwide social credit score, tracking app, microchip, forced inoculation
[3:32:10.340 --> 3:32:14.740]  takeover now because if they don't force it now, they're never going to get it. So

[3:32:36.740 --> 3:32:41.540]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations,
[3:32:41.540 --> 3:32:45.300]  the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer are all pushing the
[3:32:45.300 --> 3:32:50.340]  COVID's most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold. But
[3:32:50.340 --> 3:32:54.740]  if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying
[3:32:54.740 --> 3:33:00.020]  inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former
[3:33:00.020 --> 3:33:04.980]  Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the
[3:33:04.980 --> 3:33:09.380]  mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons and are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate
[3:33:09.380 --> 3:33:14.500]  people that die basically when they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines.
[3:33:14.500 --> 3:33:17.540]  They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[3:33:17.540 --> 3:33:21.460]  And that's on the record. It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy,
[3:33:21.460 --> 3:33:25.060]  cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you, safe and effective. No one's getting hurt.
[3:33:25.060 --> 3:33:29.860]  It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly.
[3:33:29.860 --> 3:33:33.620]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[3:33:33.620 --> 3:33:39.940]  because the media says it's safe. They do it. You must guard your humanity. You must guard your
[3:33:39.940 --> 3:33:45.380]  children's humanity. You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set
[3:33:45.380 --> 3:33:50.340]  themselves up as the guardians of this world, but they are the ones that are overriding every
[3:33:50.340 --> 3:33:56.660]  genetic system and poisoning the planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover
[3:33:56.660 --> 3:34:02.180]  of every human on earth to the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target,
[3:34:02.820 --> 3:34:08.740]  humanity with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA.
[3:34:08.740 --> 3:34:16.260]  From aborted cloned fetuses, we're then inserted into your genome to take over
[3:34:16.260 --> 3:34:22.500]  your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines,
[3:34:23.300 --> 3:34:27.700]  and then remember you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[3:34:28.340 --> 3:34:31.780]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting
[3:34:31.780 --> 3:34:39.140]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[3:35:01.780 --> 3:35:05.140]  Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:35:13.220 --> 3:35:19.620]  Alex was just talking about the RNA vaccine, and I mentioned this last week, but I want to
[3:35:19.620 --> 3:35:28.020]  mention it again. Please look up medicine from the 1950s, safe FDA approved, given to millions of
[3:35:28.020 --> 3:35:36.180]  women called DES. They didn't know for another 15 or 20 years that it would sterilize the daughters
[3:35:36.180 --> 3:35:42.020]  of the mothers that were taking this medicine for morning sickness. And there's another
[3:35:42.660 --> 3:35:51.220]  real beauty called thalidomide, which left children with horrible birth defects. Stump arms,
[3:35:51.220 --> 3:36:01.060]  flipper hands, really cruel, cruel birth defects. Other drugs have caused diminished
[3:36:01.060 --> 3:36:07.860]  intelligence and other consequences. And I'd like these politicians that are pushing this so hard
[3:36:07.860 --> 3:36:14.980]  right now for a disease which has such a low death rate compared to other diseases we've
[3:36:14.980 --> 3:36:21.620]  encountered in the past. I'd like them to be challenged. If it turns out that in five or
[3:36:21.620 --> 3:36:27.780]  ten years we find out that there are terrible consequences to this, are the politicians who
[3:36:27.780 --> 3:36:34.180]  pushed this on us, are they going to be held responsible? I've seen videos of some pretty
[3:36:34.180 --> 3:36:39.140]  big resistance to it going on in Britain. They're talking about these quote unquote
[3:36:39.140 --> 3:36:46.420]  health passports, total control mechanism. You know, wearing the mask is like a one visible
[3:36:46.420 --> 3:36:54.180]  sign of capitulation. Then it's going to be we've got the sheep herded successfully. We've got the
[3:36:54.180 --> 3:37:00.420]  sheep dogs running them around the pen, turning right, turning left. Next it's going to be take
[3:37:00.420 --> 3:37:05.540]  the vaccine or you can't get on the airplane. But what is going to happen when we find out,
[3:37:05.540 --> 3:37:11.940]  if and when we find out? It might not be for 15 or 20 years that the babies born of adults that
[3:37:11.940 --> 3:37:18.820]  took the vaccine have birth defects or are sterile. How are we going to react then? It's
[3:37:18.820 --> 3:37:25.620]  going to be too late. This is not just like a smallpox vaccine made from, you know, a natural dead
[3:37:25.620 --> 3:37:32.900]  product of cowpox. This is something, this is a whole new territory we're entering into. So
[3:37:32.900 --> 3:37:39.060]  overall today, I've been talking about the likelihood that no matter what we try, no matter
[3:37:39.060 --> 3:37:45.700]  what the Supreme Court determines or doesn't determine, or the state legislators vote for or
[3:37:45.700 --> 3:37:52.740]  don't vote for, we're probably going to see Biden as a proxy for the for the left in the White House.
[3:37:53.860 --> 3:38:00.820]  One of the ways that the massive resistance I'm talking about can manifest is resistance to taking
[3:38:00.820 --> 3:38:08.980]  the vaccine. And certainly resistance to any politicians that even suggest making it mandatory,
[3:38:09.700 --> 3:38:15.940]  making it, you know, for even if it's just a requirement to get on an airplane, forget it. Any
[3:38:15.940 --> 3:38:22.020]  politicians that are pushing that, I want to put in the same category as politicians who are pushing
[3:38:22.020 --> 3:38:28.820]  gun control is stripping our Second Amendment rights. We need to make it clear that we're not
[3:38:28.820 --> 3:38:35.060]  that we're not going to just knuckle under and become their slaves. We've already been pushed
[3:38:35.060 --> 3:38:41.780]  into the corner of the basement. There's nowhere more we can be pushed when they're stealing our
[3:38:41.780 --> 3:38:50.260]  election in front of our faces and essentially mocking us. So it's time to, for the friendly
[3:38:50.260 --> 3:38:58.740]  veneer to come off. You know, I just came up to a little while ago, another little acronym, because I'm
[3:38:58.740 --> 3:39:07.140]  tired of the politeness. When they say there's no evidence, that's beyond gaslighting. It's
[3:39:07.140 --> 3:39:13.300]  literally peeing on our back and telling us it's raining and telling us that we have to be grateful
[3:39:13.300 --> 3:39:20.180]  for the rain and ask for more. I'm done with it. I say, and I'm happy to see even, you know,
[3:39:20.180 --> 3:39:28.500]  pretty mainstream figures like like Rush Limbaugh. He's using the C word now, communist. It's beyond
[3:39:29.300 --> 3:39:37.220]  liberal or leftist or even socialist. They are pushing us toward communism. When you have
[3:39:38.420 --> 3:39:47.140]  communist Chinese engineers working for Google, that I call Gulag, when you have them working on
[3:39:47.140 --> 3:39:55.460]  the algorithms that will take a YouTube video down before it's had even 100 views. In other words,
[3:39:55.460 --> 3:40:04.500]  in the birth of a video, it's already nailed and deleted. I've made word means for Facebook,
[3:40:05.140 --> 3:40:11.460]  where the word election is in the meme, just the word election. And in two seconds,
[3:40:11.460 --> 3:40:17.220]  there's standard election warning. You know, go here for true facts, comrade, warning comes up.
[3:40:17.220 --> 3:40:25.540]  An original word meme with the word election in it gets snagged out of the ether in two seconds
[3:40:25.540 --> 3:40:31.060]  and given a warning. So here's my here's my acronym and maybe somebody come up with a better one.
[3:40:31.700 --> 3:40:40.100]  It stands for F off, you communist trader, and you can pronounce it foist. F off, you communist
[3:40:40.100 --> 3:40:49.380]  trader. I'm done with the courtesy. They are marching us step by step in the direction of Gulags.
[3:40:50.100 --> 3:40:57.060]  And by the time we see the trains, it's going to be too late. This is something called the ratchet
[3:40:57.060 --> 3:41:04.260]  effect. It's similar to the way that a fish trap, a fish weir works, you have a series of V shaped
[3:41:04.260 --> 3:41:11.380]  traps going into the lobster or the fish trap. You swim right in. It's very easy. You can't
[3:41:11.380 --> 3:41:17.460]  find your way out. By the time they get to the stage of, you know, you're going to have to
[3:41:18.100 --> 3:41:24.340]  give the extra bedrooms in your house to our new American friends. It's too late.
[3:41:24.980 --> 3:41:31.060]  We've got to start resisting and monkey wrenching now. And the politicians that are going along
[3:41:31.060 --> 3:41:37.460]  with all of this with with the end of our free speech, they can say, Oh, well, it's corporate.
[3:41:37.460 --> 3:41:44.740]  Come on, YouTube and Google own like 95% of information. They determine what people think
[3:41:45.620 --> 3:41:50.500]  by how they by how they rank things. They determine what people will see.
[3:41:51.460 --> 3:41:57.300]  Google ponchos have been bragging for years about how they see us as just, you know, a
[3:41:57.300 --> 3:42:04.180]  collection of information. And their goal is to steer us like sheep into thinking the thoughts
[3:42:04.180 --> 3:42:09.460]  that they want us to think. And they're bright and they brag about how well they're doing it.
[3:42:10.260 --> 3:42:17.780]  You know, a lot of this is also related to how we have been transformed kind of into being more
[3:42:17.780 --> 3:42:22.900]  gutless. The more possessions that you have, I mean, compared to our grandparents, we live in
[3:42:22.900 --> 3:42:30.500]  extreme wealth. We have air conditioning, you know, climate control, food full of fridges,
[3:42:30.500 --> 3:42:35.780]  fridges full of food all the time. And the more you have, the more you're afraid of losing it.
[3:42:36.340 --> 3:42:41.380]  When you think back to the pilgrims in the Mayflower and the people that founded Jamestown
[3:42:41.380 --> 3:42:48.660]  and other colonies, half of them died in the first year in America. Some colonies just disappeared.
[3:42:48.660 --> 3:42:56.020]  On average, the sailing ships that crossed the Atlantic, 10% of them were lost at sea.
[3:42:56.020 --> 3:43:02.580]  10%. Imagine the odds. That's like Russian roulette just to cross the Atlantic to go to the new world.
[3:43:03.220 --> 3:43:11.060]  Now, for a disease that's got, you know, a less than 1% overall for people even that are very old,
[3:43:11.060 --> 3:43:18.100]  for anybody under 70 who's basically healthy, there's no risk to COVID at all. And for this,
[3:43:18.100 --> 3:43:27.220]  they're going to force an RNA vaccine on the entire population. I was along with the COVID thing
[3:43:27.220 --> 3:43:32.340]  back when it was January and February, and it was an unknown factor. But now we know
[3:43:33.140 --> 3:43:39.300]  that the numbers just aren't there. For the Spanish flu, when there were 100 million Americans,
[3:43:39.860 --> 3:43:48.020]  700,000 Americans died. And guess what their average age was? 28. People in the prime of
[3:43:48.020 --> 3:43:54.020]  their health choked on their own sputum in like, you know, a matter of hours and died.
[3:43:54.740 --> 3:44:01.700]  There is no comparison between that and what we're seeing. But our risk aversion is so extreme
[3:44:01.700 --> 3:44:09.620]  that we can be scared into doing anything by the application of this 24-7 brainwashing.
[3:44:10.260 --> 3:44:16.500]  So the first thing we've got to do is find our courage. Think about those pioneers in the
[3:44:16.500 --> 3:44:23.860]  Conestoga wagons going across Indian country to get to the West for a new life. The chances that
[3:44:23.860 --> 3:44:30.100]  they took, the risks that they took, they didn't look at everything as, oh, I won't leave the house
[3:44:30.100 --> 3:44:38.820]  unless it's 1,000% safe. I mean, it's ridiculous how we've been just brainwashed into being terrified
[3:44:38.820 --> 3:44:45.860]  sheep. And we're not going to be able to resist this role into tyranny until we find our own
[3:44:45.860 --> 3:44:53.620]  personal courage. And part of that courage is being willing to be a little scary up the chain
[3:44:53.620 --> 3:44:59.220]  of command. Our bosses, our middle managers, and all the way up to the elites that run us,
[3:44:59.780 --> 3:45:05.940]  they've got to start being afraid of us. It's like that Jefferson quote, you know, when the
[3:45:05.940 --> 3:45:10.420]  people are afraid of the government, there's tyranny. And when the government is afraid of
[3:45:10.420 --> 3:45:16.260]  the people, there's freedom. Well, the government's got to start getting afraid of the people.
[3:45:17.220 --> 3:45:21.860]  And I hope a lot of people go to Washington and scare a lot of politicians this weekend.
[3:45:21.860 --> 3:45:42.100]  And I'll talk to you again.
