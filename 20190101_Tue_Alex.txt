[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from
[00:14.000 --> 00:40.000]  the front lines of the info war.
[00:40.000 --> 00:55.000]  I had an epiphany yesterday when I went and saw the movie Cheney and it was really an illustrative epiphany
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  that I'm going to carry out in the start of the next segment. I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[01:01.000 --> 01:10.000]  Obviously TV viewers will be able to see it and of course I'm calling the movie Cheney, it's the movie is Vice.
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  I'm teleprompter free here and I went to see it because I was interested because it was a political fiction piece
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  but also went because I was told that the movie basically ends with yours truly which it does.
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.000]  Just like the documentary about William F. Buckley did.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  I guess I'm this symbol of all that's wrong in the world to the left.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  And so they have to misrepresent who I am and what I stand for.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  But there's one part in the film and I think the film is well done.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  Hollywood's attacking it and giving it bad reviews or mixed reviews because it humanizes Dick Cheney.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  It makes him look like a terrible sociopath but it still humanizes him to a certain extent.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  That's kind of an oxymoron humanizing a sociopath.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  And it's a big apology for the Democrats, a big cover up.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  But there's one part, actually a couple parts.
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  They hit at 9-11 being an inside job and that just means the government stood down and let it happen.
[02:27.000 --> 02:39.000]  But they also have a scene early on in the beginning that shows an image that I remember seeing last year
[02:39.000 --> 02:49.000]  and I remember wanting to make the point about the photograph and the video we're going to show that was made in the film
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  and pinching myself that I hadn't made that point last year.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Now I've actually made this point many, many times.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  When you hear me make the point, you say, okay, yeah, we've heard that 100 times.
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  But if you get this point, you get everything.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  Absolutely everything.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  So I tend to get real excited when I cover things like this.
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  I'm going to try to be a good boy when we come back and really delve into this for at least one segment solid.
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.000]  I owe it to you, I owe it to myself, I owe it to my family to do this.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  So we'll do that when we come back from break.
[03:32.000 --> 03:45.000]  And then this story ties in to the whole rest of the enchilada.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  And you know, I've got all the treaties here in my hands.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  There's a lot of preparation for this.
[03:51.000 --> 04:00.000]  And that's really the problem is there's so much information that I tend to just get caught going into each little piece of what I'm covering
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  each little piece instead of just telling you, hey, here it is.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  And then you need to go look this for yourself.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  But there's a reason they want us off the air.
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  And I just can't believe that there's enough people in the establishment that even know what's going on.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  And they do.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  And they're going along with this.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  But they're doing it really out of fear.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  They're not just doing it out of they want power.
[04:27.000 --> 04:36.000]  Where we part of the power structure, they do it because, you know, you start bucking this, the knives come out.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  But see, the knives are already out.
[04:41.000 --> 04:54.000]  There is a genocide taking place that dwarfs everything Hitler did, conservatively, a hundred to one, at least a hundred to one.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  They will break it all down.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test.
[05:06.000 --> 05:15.000]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  That's all because you are the core.
[05:18.000 --> 05:28.000]  Listening to them for wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[05:28.000 --> 05:37.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying 2018 has been insane.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[05:55.000 --> 06:23.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[06:23.000 --> 06:31.000]  It's Friday, December 28th, 2018 and we've cracked the code.
[06:31.000 --> 06:41.000]  We've cracked the globalists, the technocracies, plan to get them to their world government.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  And for the globalists, world government is just the beginning.
[06:47.000 --> 06:56.000]  Now, the decision has been made to slowly poison and dumb down and kill everyone on the planet.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  Basically about 99%.
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  That's the internal document numbers is about a 99.9% extermination operation.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  The college students are told 80% extermination.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  Graduate students are told 90% extermination.
[07:10.000 --> 07:18.000]  Higher level government officials are told 99% extermination.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  And of course, you now see the public roll out of that everywhere.
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  We spent most of the show yesterday detailing it from the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, the Carnegie Endowment.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  Just humans are inherently evil.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  We have to get rid of them.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  And then we have the Malthusian eugenics background of that.
[07:33.000 --> 07:42.000]  We have the entire British Empire's funding getting behind it in 1855 in a global project that is all detailed in my film,
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  In Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  That's still, they're trying to have it removed off Amazon, but you can also watch for free on YouTube.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  But let me just stop there giving footnotes.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  There's a lot of big news out today.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  The EU has announced that we need a planetary world government to stop nation states.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  That's a quote.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  Merkel, disgraced but still the chancellor, but her party's lost power in the parliament,
[08:09.000 --> 08:18.000]  Merkel said, quote, nations must give up their sovereignty and that citizens of nations must be ignored
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  and that outside alliances must team up in an orderly fashion to stop the nations and their peoples.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  These are quotes she gave at a national televised event.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  That's the video. It's in German.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  That's cold treason.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  We're going to ignore the people.
[08:34.000 --> 08:41.000]  We're going to ignore our law and we're going to take your freedom away and merge with the Middle East.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  What have we been telling you for 20 years?
[08:44.000 --> 08:51.000]  But see, now that it's all happening, we've got to be off the air because the credibility's so high.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  That's what I've told my crew.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  Just us staying on the air is an incredible victory.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  I'll talk about that later in the broadcast.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  Just you spreading the word in any way is the end of these people.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  But you got to do it.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  Let's stop there.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  I'm going to get into a subject of the extremism project and I'm just going to look at a few of the tentacles.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  But two of the larger ones.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  And I'm going to look at one third tentacle as well.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  But all of these tentacles need you to opt into them.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  It's a metaphysical rule.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  It's like in the Bible it says the devil has to go out and get permission from God to do certain things.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  And so we have to be warned first.
[09:44.000 --> 10:00.000]  So in all three of these tentacles, you notice it's a Trojan horse you take in and that you accept and that you acquiesce to.
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.000]  And now we're entering the phase where even that's being removed and they're going to forced.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  So let me get into it.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  But first for TV viewers, radio listeners, obviously I will break it down.
[10:14.000 --> 10:25.000]  I went to see Vice, the movie about Dick Cheney yesterday because obviously I wanted to see it and reportedly the movie ended with yours truly as the ultimate sign of evil.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  Which it does end with yours truly as if I'm bathomet.
[10:31.000 --> 10:44.000]  Now, as if here's the new Cheney, here's the new enemy, which I'm the complete opposite of Dick Cheney.
[10:44.000 --> 10:55.000]  Now, before I get into the tentacles of death that are 100% already in your body, already in your DNA, already killing you right now.
[10:55.000 --> 11:04.000]  Most of us are walking dead. This is an absolute fact and they're about to really accelerate the extermination.
[11:04.000 --> 11:13.000]  So far it's just been ambient, it's been background, kind of like crickets sawing their feet together.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  Or like frogs or a leaf blower off in the distance.
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  It's going to be a freight train if you wanted to quantitate it on a sound scale.
[11:26.000 --> 11:42.000]  And actually some of it is sound at the microwave frequency that ravels water molecules and rubs them together at a perfect oscillation frequency to rip DNA apart.
[11:42.000 --> 11:54.000]  And it was designed and the exact oscillation has been chosen to make it the most vicious out of hundreds of combinations that wouldn't be as damaging.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  Oh, I'm sorry I haven't gotten to it yet.
[11:57.000 --> 12:18.000]  But the movie Cheney, Vice, about Cheney, opens up with we get so used to tyranny and so used to oppression that we can be standing right next to death itself and we don't even notice it.
[12:18.000 --> 12:27.000]  And I remember thinking the same thing when I saw this video in this photo I'm going to put on screen now of a golfer, a group of golfers in Washington State last year.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  And you see them playing golf, they're on the putting green.
[12:33.000 --> 12:47.000]  And as you zoom back, you see that there is giant fires in the background.
[12:47.000 --> 12:56.000]  So they say an image can say a thousand words.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  Well, it certainly has.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  We'll put it back on television for viewers.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  We can just put the Daily Mail article up if you'd like.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  Now, or we can roll the video for folks and we can do that to be nice as well.
[13:06.000 --> 13:25.000]  Now, this is illustrative of how you can be right next to a burning inferno with ash raining down on you.
[13:25.000 --> 13:37.000]  And you don't even care because everyone else goes on about their business as if it's no big deal and as if it doesn't matter.
[13:37.000 --> 13:47.000]  Because no one around you behaves like it's serious or something should be done so you don't take action even though people are dying.
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  Even though governments won't cut fire breaks as they did before and are allowing it to happen, even though it's burning down houses.
[13:54.000 --> 14:04.000]  You adapt to living in hell instead of changing your environment to make it better and to fix it.
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.000]  Now, if you can become callous or blind to fires in California or fires in Washington or fires wherever,
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  and not even be upset at the government that it has policies in place for 30 years, not letting you cut fire breaks that have allowed the epidemic.
[14:21.000 --> 14:32.000]  Well, what are you going to do about things you can't see like gravity or cell phone radiation up to 5G and higher that they admit gives you cancer?
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  What are you going to do?
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  Well, everybody knows if you jump off a cliff, you can't see the gravity, the gravity well of planet Earth.
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  But you know that if you jump off a 200 foot cliff, you're going to probably die.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  You're certainly going to wish you were dead. You're going to break your legs, your back, your head.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  You're going to break most of the bones in your body.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  But if a couple hundred yards away, there's a giant fast moving inferno.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  Well, it turned out in this case they had enough time to finish up their 18 holes and get in their car and go.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  But later the golf course did burn down.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  But it doesn't matter. You're going to finish your game.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  And again, it's part of a culture of total and complete selfishness.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  But if we could get people to understand cell phone radiation and things like that are like gravity.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  They're there, but you can't see them and they're killing you.
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  But instead of jumping off a cliff and you die 10 seconds, 20 seconds later, we hit the bottom.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  With radiation, it takes a few years, 20, 30 years, 10 years, 5 years, depending on the person.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  Some people are more susceptible to it. Others aren't.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  But within that recognizing the threat and being conscious of it, there's a way out of this.
[15:49.000 --> 15:59.000]  But if you can't see a giant fire coming your direction, how are you ever going to do anything for yourself or your family?
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  And only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  Silver Lungs.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly,
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[16:26.000 --> 16:38.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[17:58.000 --> 18:21.000]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[18:21.000 --> 18:29.000]  Wake up America, Patriot Blend Coffee. Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  And Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[19:25.000 --> 19:33.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com, that are truly independent.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing.
[19:37.000 --> 19:49.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[19:49.000 --> 19:57.000]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[19:57.000 --> 20:08.000]  We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[20:27.000 --> 20:41.000]  It's been a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thanks for joining us.
[20:47.000 --> 21:11.000]  Okay, let's get right into it. There is a global program. There is a global operation to establish a planetary world government whose aim is ending war by ending the mass of humanity.
[21:11.000 --> 21:25.000]  And the answer is bring in world government, have controlled wars, have controlled bioweapons released, call the populations down to a manageable 400 million is the public number put out by the U.N.
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  Again, more internal documents say 10,000, maybe. Those people are gonna merge the machines and become gods.
[21:32.000 --> 21:42.000]  And I told you this decades ago, now it's in the news. The philosophy of the elite, stewards of the earth by reducing population, and they believe humanity's obsolete.
[21:42.000 --> 21:50.000]  They will soon merge with silicon and become gods. This is the cult we're fighting.
[21:50.000 --> 22:02.000]  But to do that metaphysically, they've got to say, oh, vaccines, and then add things to vaccines. It's compartmentalized with the doctors and scientists aren't even aware of it in most cases.
[22:02.000 --> 22:18.000]  But then people see the convulsions, the deaths, the cancer, the autism, and then they have a project to manage that and handle that and get the public used incrementally to having mass death take place all around them.
[22:18.000 --> 22:31.000]  So when they first started coming out with cell phone radiation technology 40 years ago, it was already old technology then, there were studies and articles out about how it would vibrate DNA and cause massive DNA damage.
[22:31.000 --> 22:39.000]  That's what a microwave does. It rubs molecules together and then heats them up. So it creates a friction like that.
[22:39.000 --> 22:54.000]  And they just began to increase it out from that point. And they noticed a stickular cancer in things and truck drivers and other people that would have the old, more high powered cell phones between their legs.
[22:54.000 --> 23:06.000]  So they sort of tell them, hey, don't keep that thing between your legs. So we have all the old studies. And then as new studies come out showing increased cancer as the radiation gets stronger,
[23:06.000 --> 23:15.000]  their argument is, well, you've been warned about it kind of like on the side of a package of cigarettes, it tells you it can give you cancer, cause birth defects.
[23:15.000 --> 23:26.000]  But see, children aren't opting into this. And many adults aren't. But many schools, as you know, put the cell phone towers that are super powerful up on top of the facilities and they make money off that.
[23:26.000 --> 23:39.000]  There's been a big pushback. So they had to back off. I remember 20 years ago, again, talking about how they were going to put smart meters on the side of your house and how they were going to spy on you and how they were going to rip you off.
[23:39.000 --> 23:54.000]  And now it's all admitted. And now it's ubiquitous. And now they say, if you want power, period, you've got to have one of these. So they're going from making you opt in to where it's just the way it is.
[23:54.000 --> 24:13.000]  And so whether it's electricity or whether it's radiation, whether it's sulfur radiation, it's particles, charged particles, charged wavelengths blasting out the spectrum and affecting your body in a very damaging way.
[24:13.000 --> 24:28.000]  You know, every airline pilot I know is aware of this, no matter how great a shape they were in. You notice the elite pilots all like to fly at night now. The big global flights that are 10, 15, 18 hours long are launched at night.
[24:28.000 --> 24:43.000]  And it's not so you sleep on the plane, boys and girls. It's because the pilots are refusing to fly the airplanes during the day because there's a water shield up to about 20,000 feet and a dust shield up to about 20,000 feet.
[24:43.000 --> 24:54.000]  The water is about 10 feet of water condensed. The dust shield is about an inch to two inches and it shields you from high level space radiation.
[24:54.000 --> 25:06.000]  Now, see, that's just a fact that it's the equivalent of many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many chest x-rays.
[25:06.000 --> 25:19.000]  And airlines even looked 20 years ago into putting lead shielding, but then it would be so expensive and it would admit the radiation that they decided to not do it.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  But I mean, I know airline pilots that were in the Air Force 25 years ago that looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.000]  And now they look like they've been in a microwave oven. They've had dozens of cancers and they'll tell you, oh, we're all like this.
[25:31.000 --> 25:41.000]  And they're sunken in and their eyes are gone. It doesn't matter where sunglasses doesn't matter. And they've got cancer all over their body because they've been in space.
[25:41.000 --> 25:54.000]  Above 20,000 feet, maybe you're in space. The gravity still holds you into the earth, but you're in space, ba-ba. You're above the real atmosphere.
[25:54.000 --> 26:03.000]  And so all I'm getting in here is I could talk for 100 hours on this, but we live in a very small, thin environment on the surface of the earth.
[26:03.000 --> 26:12.000]  And most people live below 15,000 feet for a reason. And just air travel.
[26:12.000 --> 26:23.000]  And you're like, why are the flights suddenly at night? Because the more, you know, the big jets, the big elite pilots, they like living.
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  Now, let's move on to our children in 5G. One of the few areas Trump's really doing a bad job on, but he's just all about innovation.
[26:30.000 --> 26:40.000]  They tell him it's great and he can't see it. He drinks Diet Coke and he likes Kentucky Fried Chicken. He's super blue collar.
[26:40.000 --> 26:48.000]  You know, blue collar folks, they like to smoke cigarettes. They like to eat Kentucky Fried Chicken. You know, it's kind of that attitude. Tough guy stuff.
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.000]  But now the 5G is coming in taxpayer funded. There's not just a race with China to put this stuff in because it can surveil everything you're doing in your house.
[26:56.000 --> 27:08.000]  Literally look through walls, but also grab all your data. But they even have LA Times, Wired Magazine, all of them admitting that it's causing massive cancer in all the studies in rats.
[27:08.000 --> 27:19.000]  Much worse than the old technology because it's a lot stronger. Wow. Something's 20, 30, 40 times stronger and the old stuff gave you cancer. What's this going to do?
[27:19.000 --> 27:33.000]  It's like smoking filterless cigarettes versus filtered, but much worse than I've got all the stacks of news here where they know it's killing us, but they're going ahead with it and it's done on purpose.
[27:33.000 --> 27:47.000]  Well, guess what? Everybody has a right to not be living under this and people have to organize. They have to say no now because it's going to become more and more evident as the autism and the brain damage and the cancer is all exploding.
[27:47.000 --> 28:00.000]  They're just like vaccines that they're spiking on record. They can call all the world the U.N. ash with sterilants and cancer viruses. Most cancers viral. Your body beats it all the time, but then when your immune system gives up, then you're dead.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  And it's also a deal with cells replicating as they've replicated so many times and they have more mutations, but that's the secondary type of cancer.
[28:08.000 --> 28:20.000]  Most cancers viral. The Rockefeller Foundation discovered at the 20s. JFK discovered the research tried to kill it. That's even in the JFK movie that they were getting weaponized cancer.
[28:20.000 --> 28:37.000]  Down in New Orleans that they developed. Injectable. And they want you to opt into the vaccine too. Metaphysically, you've got to opt into the 5G. You've got to opt into the vaccine. They want you to opt in because then, oh, they didn't kill you. You opted into it.
[28:37.000 --> 28:48.000]  So we've got a special guest joining us. He'll be with us into the next hour, but I'm going to go to him about five minutes into the next segment. I have to finish this when we come back.
[28:48.000 --> 29:08.000]  And then we'll look at the big, globalist attack on China and why it's been chosen by the NWO to be the center and the seat of world government.
[29:08.000 --> 29:18.000]  Our last lethal combo is good for animal control. The four legged kind and two legged. When lethal force is necessary, reach for our stop them, drop them or our home defense combos.

[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[30:52.000 --> 31:00.000]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then go to wolfhillamo.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[31:00.000 --> 31:15.000]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS if came over.
[31:15.000 --> 31:24.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[31:24.000 --> 31:35.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[31:35.000 --> 31:43.000]  It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[31:43.000 --> 31:49.000]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[31:49.000 --> 32:17.000]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenplanet.com, because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.

[33:18.000 --> 33:23.000]  Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[33:49.000 --> 34:07.000]  And again, he witnessed what's really going on in the nation for a long time. I mean, I'll let him recap his awakening as a liberal over there and actually seeing what the left was embracing and why they thought Communist China was so great and how it is America's great rival.
[34:07.000 --> 34:23.000]  He is the best-selling author of Bully of Asia, and he wrote a big article for the New York Post that's excellent we're going to be getting into, and he can also speak about 5G, but let's finish up just with the documentation, if you're a viewer or a listener.
[34:23.000 --> 34:37.000]  Just like there are some cliffs in Austin that are about a thousand feet tall, they're not really mountains, but they call them Mount Benel and Mount this, Mount that. They look like little mountains. You can go up to the edge of a cliff and you can't see gravity.
[34:37.000 --> 34:46.000]  But everybody knows if you jump off when you hit the bottom in 20 seconds, you're going to wish you were dead or you're going to be dead. You'll probably be dead about 95% of the time.
[34:46.000 --> 35:02.000]  If you hit a tree or something or bounce on your way down, you're going to live. Now, you can't see gravity, but the planet has it. We're going to gravity well. We know how it works. Big things have gravity and they suck little things onto their surface.
[35:02.000 --> 35:22.000]  Now, I've got literally U.N. studies, Chinese studies, U.S. studies, British studies, telecom studies going back 30 years. I had them print me whole stacks of these today. You can just type it in and it's confirmed, confirmed, gives rats cancer, gives rats cancer, confirmed all these new tumors that kill so many people.
[35:22.000 --> 35:35.000]  Now, on the side of your head, you use the cell phone. They rattle DNA. Big studies that five minutes of cell phone use against the head raises brain temperature one degree. It actually heats your brain up.
[35:35.000 --> 35:49.000]  Now, what does radiation do? What does microwave radiation do? When you put a cup of water in it and turn it on for a minute, what makes it hot? The molecules rub together.
[35:49.000 --> 35:59.000]  It cooks your brain. So here's Wired Magazine. 5G smartphones cause cancer. Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[35:59.000 --> 36:07.000]  EU Reflex study shows DNA damage caused by radiation from wireless devices and mobile phones. This is from the U.N. themselves.
[36:07.000 --> 36:19.000]  Confirmed. Mobile phones break DNA, scrambled genomes, scrambled genome. What happens when your genome gets scrambled? It has a name. It's called cancer.
[36:19.000 --> 36:28.000]  And it just goes on. Oh, LA Times. Well, it causes cancer, but no big deal. 5G services coming and so are health concerns at the towers that support it.
[36:28.000 --> 36:39.000]  Oh, yeah, the towers are really bad. The cell phones are bad enough. So at least there's some consciousness to this. And then, oh, how adding iodine to salt boosted Americans IQ.
[36:39.000 --> 36:51.000]  That's even New York Times. In raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt, the iodine. Oh, but the U.S. took it out of the salt. We don't want that.
[36:51.000 --> 37:01.000]  But China, they had it. Let's see. So everything that's being done to the West, the culture, all of it is to literally dumb us down.
[37:01.000 --> 37:11.000]  Make us stupid. Make us totally sick. We're not outside. We're not in the dirt. There's another article. Bacteria found in dirt stops growth of superbugs. Resist antibiotics.
[37:11.000 --> 37:22.000]  Saskatchewan University linked up on info wars.com. Oh, if you let your kids play in the dirt and they're outside more, then suddenly you won't need all those antibiotics. I mean, my dad's really smart black man.
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.000]  He said to my grandmother when he was getting sick as a baby, she says, Miss Jones, you're going to kill that baby. You didn't let him play in the dirt. He's too clean.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  You make me clean him all the time. All the rest of it. He gets sick all the time. Of course, she then gave him what she called Hindu tea.
[37:37.000 --> 37:44.000]  Snuck it. Later told my grandmother, which was boiled chicken manure, which turns out to be the best antibacterial out there, but gives your body immunity.
[37:44.000 --> 37:53.000]  He didn't get sick anymore because she boiled chicken crap and fed it to him. But everybody knew this in the old times. We've just forgotten it now.
[37:53.000 --> 38:00.000]  So the answer is let your kids play in the dirt, not putting them on antibiotics every day. But the system knows this, so they're letting you opt in.
[38:00.000 --> 38:11.000]  The question is, why are they doing this? Why are they carrying this out? Why is this being allowed? Because there could be good clean vaccines, but they're not.
[38:11.000 --> 38:22.000]  There could be, again, communication systems that aren't as damaging, but they go for the worst. What's going on here is the larger question.
[38:22.000 --> 38:31.000]  Now, his book, I read it a couple of years ago when it came out, but it's more important than ever. Bully of Asia, Why China's Dream is the New Threat to World Order.
[38:31.000 --> 38:40.000]  And I'm not going to go over Mr. Moser's entire background. We're going to get more into China in the next segment, but briefly, since I'm getting into 5G and these invisible dangers,
[38:40.000 --> 38:47.000]  and then China's so big in the news right now, their executives arrest over their form of 5G. They're basically selling at cost.
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.000]  It's already dominated the world, and why this is so dangerous. It all ties together. Stephen M. Moser, thanks for joining us.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Oh, good to be here, Alice.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  Stephen M. Moser, thank you. Go ahead. Sorry.
[38:58.000 --> 39:07.000]  Yeah, I'm a subscriber. I was unhappy when YouTube and Big Tech decided that they were going to censor you.
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.000]  So I responded by subscribing to InfoWars and by encouraging my friends to do so as well. So thank you, my friend.
[39:14.000 --> 39:22.000]  Well, I appreciate you, brother. You know, I noticed when I criticized Apple and Google moving to China this year that that's when the hammer fell.
[39:22.000 --> 39:31.000]  Yeah, and they're in trouble because they're in league with a country that wants to dominate not only its own people, but the world.
[39:31.000 --> 39:42.000]  You know, the Chinese have a system now to monitor 1.4 billion people in their own country, and they'd like to apply that system to everybody in the world,
[39:42.000 --> 39:55.000]  all seven plus billion of us. And that's why they're selling these Huawei phones. That's why they want to set up 5G connections everywhere because it's a great, great data gathering enterprise.
[39:55.000 --> 40:05.000]  It's a great, big vacuum cleaner that vacuums updated about where you were born, what your name is, what your face looks like so they can use face recognition technology.
[40:05.000 --> 40:17.000]  Where your bank accounts are, everything they want to compile into one huge database. And once they have it, of course, they'll be in a position to pressure us in ways that we could only imagine in a horror story now.
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.000]  And you've been speaking about this forever. So people know about your curriculum vitae specifically in the School of Life.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  And that's when it's recap how you got to China, why you went there, and what you discovered in your awakening.
[40:29.000 --> 40:38.000]  Well, I was the first American allowed to go to China back in 1979, a long time ago. That's when China was first, what we called it, opening up to the West.
[40:38.000 --> 40:48.000]  Of course, that opening to the West was a way of getting stealing, begging, borrowing, stealing Western technology and overtaking us so they could dominate us.
[40:48.000 --> 40:57.000]  But we were hopeful at the time. I wound up in a commune in South China, learned very quickly from the people in the commune that communes don't work,
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  that people produce best when they're in family units with family owned enterprises, providing for themselves and their family and their neighbors,
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  not for the distant government bureaucracy, not for the state.
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  But it was a real wake up call. My friends in the local village took me to a local hill, which was known as Turtle Mountain,
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  where all of the people who were associated with the old regime were taken and shot in the early 50s, simply shot dead without a trial.
[41:25.000 --> 41:38.000]  Then they took me to a mass grave that was filled in 1961 and 1962 with the bodies of 400 people who had died during the great Mao Zedong Chairman Mao Famine of that year.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  They created great communes. They couldn't feed the people with the produce from the communes.
[41:43.000 --> 41:51.000]  And 400 people died in my commune alone. And of course, throughout China, 45 million people died.
[41:51.000 --> 42:00.000]  But the real wake up call was when I was in the operating room where they were arresting and bringing in to receive forced abortions,
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.000]  women who were illegally pregnant with second children or third children.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  Illegal, of course, because the Communist Party had declared these babies to be illegal.
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.000]  The mothers of these babies were arrested, brought in, tied down on operating tables and given cesarean section abortions.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  If you can imagine that, think about that.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  Think about your wife being arrested for the crime of being pregnant illegally,
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  taken by force by Communist Party officials to a local dirty little clinic.
[42:32.000 --> 42:41.000]  And they're tied down an operating table and given an abortion by Red Army doctors who were brought in from the nearby army base
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  because the local doctors refused to do these operations.
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.000]  They knew these people were their friends and neighbors, and so they had to bring in the Communist Party did.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  Stephen W. Moser, stay right there. Let's talk about this.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  This is a powerful story. You're going in depth into it and what happens.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  We prepare to close out 2018. Just remember, this life is a test.
[43:04.000 --> 43:12.000]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.000]  and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[43:17.000 --> 43:26.000]  Listening to M4 Wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[43:26.000 --> 43:34.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  and who tend to see it, and that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane.
[43:43.000 --> 43:50.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[43:54.000 --> 44:09.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.

[46:33.000 --> 46:38.000]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.

[46:52.000 --> 47:00.000]  to not just fight but to expand. We're on the march, the empire's on the run, I salute you all, now please take action at infowarstore.com.
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:37.000 --> 47:47.000]  Stephen W. Moser really was one of the first people allowed in by the Communist Chinese to actually live there and sent to one of their communes because he was a leftist, a liberal.
[47:47.000 --> 47:59.000]  He was a well-meaning one. My dad said when he was in college, you know, before that in the 60s that they were already priming him that China was the future, China was the way to go.
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.000]  And they had Chinese research scientists over here that my dad was working with, even in high school, at MD Anderson, but that's a whole other story.
[48:07.000 --> 48:20.000]  But the globalist chose China as the model for the world, took it from nowhere with no running water and 95% of the country to the industrial and technological juggernaut that it is now.
[48:20.000 --> 48:30.000]  But it's powerful how Mr. Moser, who became one of the leading people for orphanages, you name it, in China had his epiphany from the people themselves.
[48:30.000 --> 48:39.000]  People think the Chinese are monolithic. No, they're not. Not the Taiwanese, not many. In fact, I can hardly buy Chinese food for myself.
[48:39.000 --> 48:49.000]  When I go to Chinese place in Houston or Austin or New York, I was in a Chinese food restaurant last night and they were trying to keep me from pain.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  And they had, of course, epoch times being sold to the front.
[48:52.000 --> 49:00.000]  So most of the Chinese people that are out of China absolutely know how horrible it is. And they're free market people. They used to be Christian a lot of them.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  They get killed or Buddhist. And where's the left saying a word? I mean, imagine Hitler. Everybody overuses Hitler. Oh, it's like Hitler, it's like Hitler.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.000]  But if there was a Hitler around who was still in government, or let's say Hitler died, but the Nazis were still in power in Europe.
[49:16.000 --> 49:26.000]  They were still killing people in mass. You'd be concerned about it, but not China. And instead, they're bringing their technology that's been proven to have all these spy chips, all these controls,
[49:26.000 --> 49:41.000]  and are buying off our universities, our governments. Well, Stephen W. Moser has been one of the only other big voices out there other than myself and Bill Gertz and a few others who have talked about what the CFR has said,
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.000]  what the globalists have said that they're selling us out to China, that they have been holding their hand and positioning them.
[49:47.000 --> 49:55.000]  And now it's finally in the news that they've got spy chips and they're taking Kenya's only port and they've got 98% of Earth minerals and they've got all the major,
[49:55.000 --> 50:05.000]  they've been positioned by traders as part of a larger plan. We'll talk about that next hour and get into 5G and his huge article that's gone totally viral.
[50:05.000 --> 50:18.000]  It was like one of the top stories last week when Rudgerport linked to it about the Chinese Communist master plan and this dynastic royalty basically of the party that got arrested.
[50:18.000 --> 50:26.000]  How a rest of Chinese princess exposes regimes world domination plot. So we'll get into that in the 30 minutes next hour, but your personal story is so powerful.
[50:26.000 --> 50:36.000]  Finish up your awakening. I don't want to speak for you. Were you a liberal? Were you a leftist? The point was you meant well, but you drank the Kool-Aid because I've read your book and I've had you on several times,
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  but you describe it best, who you were, and then hopefully other liberals will wake up out there.
[50:42.000 --> 50:59.000]  Well, I was a doctoral candidate at Sanford University. I was teaching Chinese studies at the University of California at Berkeley and yeah, I'd read all the books that were published in the 60s and 70s praising Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party for
[50:59.000 --> 51:16.000]  claims that they had ended poverty. They had improved the lives of the people in the countryside. You know, it was typical left wing illusions, delusions, we should say, about a brutal thuggish Communist regime that when you look up close and personal,
[51:16.000 --> 51:31.000]  these weren't very nice people. This was the new party. This was the elite. These were people who kept the masses oppressed. They didn't raise up the masses. They kept the ordinary people oppressed and they of course had the best of everything.
[51:31.000 --> 51:47.000]  The now today 90 million members of the Chinese Communist Party absolutely dominate the 1.4 billion Chinese. They get the best of everything. Most of the money that's been generated by the export sector of the Chinese economy,
[51:47.000 --> 52:04.000]  which is the only sector of the economy that works, by the way, the rest of the Chinese economy is clunky, state owned dinosaurs. It resembles the former Soviet Union. The export sector of the economy, thanks to the stupidity of our leaders for the last 25 years,
[52:04.000 --> 52:19.000]  works with great efficiency to produce cheap goods for American open markets. Finally, that's coming to a close. So I get to China. I'm living in this commune and it takes a while for the locals to begin to trust me. Now I can read, write and speak Chinese.
[52:19.000 --> 52:36.000]  I can speak Cantonese, Mandarin and Taiwanese. So I was able to speak to them in a language they could understand and communicate in. And one by one, late at night, usually over a glass of rice wine, they would begin to tell me these horror stories of life under the commune.
[52:36.000 --> 52:50.000]  You know what they call the Chinese Communist Party? They call it the big landlord. The Chinese Communist Party of the Red Army came in, killed all the small landlords, the landowners, lined them up over there at that little mountain that I talked about and shot them dead.
[52:50.000 --> 53:05.000]  But it became the big landlord to control everything. The people were producing goods, silk and sugarcane and other things that they were forced to sell to the Chinese Communist Party at fire sale prices. So they remained poor while the party got rich.
[53:05.000 --> 53:25.000]  But this one child policy, I have to tell you about that, Alex, because to see women who are seven, eight and nine months pregnant, and in some cases only days or hours away from giving birth, arrested for the imaginary crime of being pregnant without the permission of the Chinese Communist Party,
[53:25.000 --> 53:39.000]  and then taken away by party officials in front of the horrified parents, brothers, sisters, husbands and children of these women, taken away by force, I went with them to the operating room.
[53:39.000 --> 53:53.000]  I was there when these women were opened up like tin cans by cesarean section by Red Army doctors who would then kill their babies by lethal injection. This is not abortion, Alex, as bad as that is.
[53:53.000 --> 54:06.000]  This is infanticide. This was a killing of nearly full term healthy babies at birth. And there were cases that the woman was so far advanced in labor that the baby's head was already crowning.
[54:06.000 --> 54:18.000]  The baby was already beginning to be born. And what the Red Army doctors did at that point is almost beyond describing. They would take a hypodermic needle, they would fill it with formaldehyde or alcohol,
[54:18.000 --> 54:28.000]  and they would give the baby a lethal injection into the soft spot of the baby's skull, killing the baby instantly after it was born.
[54:28.000 --> 54:39.000]  Now let's be clear, here in America they call it partial birth, but the women volunteer for it, and the baby under law cannot leave the canal or it's a live birth and you can't kill them, though they still do it.
[54:39.000 --> 54:46.000]  They use a high powered suction vacuum to punch a hole in the head and suck the brains out.
[54:46.000 --> 54:55.000]  Yeah, we can't claim any moral superiority over the Chinese in that sense. I mean, in one sense, we're a democratic country.
[54:55.000 --> 55:07.000]  We have, we elected the men who appointed the judges who allowed the abortion doctors to go in to the sanctity of the womb with their knives and their suction equipment and kill unborn children.
[55:07.000 --> 55:17.000]  So in a sense, we're doubly responsible. The Chinese women, the Chinese families who were devastated by these forced abortions, didn't elect these Communist Party leaders.
[55:17.000 --> 55:26.000]  Exactly. So the evil is it's being forced on them. Let's expand on that and we're going to get into the big inch a lot when we come back to the current state of the war with China and the traders in our own government.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  And so Americans can pick which side and others around the world can pick which side they want to be on here.
[55:31.000 --> 55:41.000]  With the author, the selling author, bully of Asia, Stephen W. Moser, why China's dream is the new threat to world order.
[55:41.000 --> 55:50.000]  The the left, David Rockefeller, where Mao Zedong died, as you know, in the late 70s, wrote huge op-eds New York Times praising how great communism is, how wonderful it is.
[55:50.000 --> 55:59.000]  Why would the ultra rich do this? And then why does the left love China? Because that's where you can really carry out the mass test, have a party that's ready to do it,
[55:59.000 --> 56:09.000]  and just use people like they're lower than animals. So what was it like for you who had drunk the Kool-Aid, as you said, to actually then actually be on the ground?
[56:09.000 --> 56:20.000]  They trusted you. You were a fellow traveler, China Studies guy. So you wanted the first to come in. And then what was it like in the process? Did it come all at once or was it incremental?
[56:20.000 --> 56:35.000]  Well, it took me the better part of a year. I'm a slow learner when it comes to some very important things. But by the end of my year in China, I realized that the Chinese Communist Party was a party of tyrants, of thugs,
[56:35.000 --> 56:51.000]  really a mafia that had taken control of the entire country. And we're not really out for the Chinese people in any sense of the meaning of the word. They were simply out for themselves. They were a party that wanted to accumulate as much power and wealth as they could.
[56:51.000 --> 57:05.000]  But see, George Arwell was a leading socialist and then woke up because he actually got his hands dirty. You got your hands dirty. That's the problem now. So many leftists are in bubble world, you know, living in the high rise apartment, going to college forever on the internet.
[57:05.000 --> 57:13.000]  They never get their hands dirty. It seems like anybody that gets their hands dirty who isn't evil always starts fighting collectivism.
[57:13.000 --> 57:27.000]  Yeah, if I could take all of my Stanford University colleagues with me to China and let them live in China for a year, they would come away with a very different view of socialism of communism in China.
[57:27.000 --> 57:43.000]  The trouble is they only see China from afar. They read the propaganda published by the Chinese regime. They're alienated from their own country. You see, that's the other problem. They're alienated from their own country, their own history, their own culture.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  They've been taught to despise their own history, their own culture.
[57:46.000 --> 57:57.000]  Talk about that. How are they inoculated to hate themselves? For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership. That's the globalist only hope.
[57:57.000 --> 58:08.000]  So when you support info wars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you are literally not just supporting info wars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people.
[58:08.000 --> 58:16.000]  But you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.000]  When you order products at infowarstore.com, you fund not just an American revolution but a global revolution against tyranny.
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[58:27.000 --> 58:43.000]  Every order gets a free t-shirt. Every order gets free shipping. Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance. And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight but to expand.
[58:43.000 --> 58:58.000]  We're on the march. The empire is on the run. I salute you all. Now please take action at infowarstore.com.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[59:19.000 --> 59:31.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at infowarstore.com on info or select storeable foods. They've got special diet foods. They've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[59:31.000 --> 59:39.000]  They've got so many great products there. And you've got a three year supply. If stuff happens you can feed your whole block. It's up to us to be self sufficient.

[59:44.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  infowarstore.com and info or select high quality storeable foods powered by my patriot supply.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  So, Communist China has bought up Hollywood. It's bought up the treasuries. We're going to get into this next segment. This is a short little segment.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  So I want to finish up with Stephen W. Moser's experiences in China as one of the first Americans, if not the first to be allowed into the communes.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  This is just so riveting and so interesting. I've been reading his work for decades. He's been on I think 10 years ago and then a few years ago again.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  We should get him on routinely. Pop.org is the website. We're not just here gloom and dooming. We're not bashing the Chinese.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  CNN before us said Trump hates Chinese people. He hates Asians. I've seen articles. Alex Jones hates Chinese.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  But Chinese people hate communes. It's super unpopular. My sister's Korean adopted. We don't. David Knight went and got he already has his own biological children.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  They went as Christians and adopted their daughter as a baby starving to death. She's now lives here in the U.S. almost 20 years old.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Great lady from China. No, we don't hate Chinese people. We're trying to stop them being aborted and being brainwashed and being turned into weapons against us.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  We want to see China free. We want humanity unified and only real Christianity can do that, which they're executing Christians and blowing up their churches.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  But in the four minutes to break, just recapping what you witnessed in China and your message to leftist. I've noticed the Malm youth brigades that run antifa that threaten us and do all sorts of things to other people.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Their operating system is the Confucian centers at the major universities that they now admit are Chinese government run.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  We've infiltrated some of the meetings that they know we've done that. And they actually have UT chairs that are praising Mao and communist at these meetings.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And the operating system is Maoist for the grassroots globalist movement, not just here, but in Europe. I've noticed.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Yeah, it really is the Confucian institutes are a Trojan horse with Chinese characteristics that they're planting all over the world.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  It's not just the United States. The United States is the favorite target because obviously we're the principal obstacle to China's domination of the world.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  If they could get rid of us, they think they can deal with these other what they call the little countries quite easily, you know, and that's their view of the world.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Their view of the world is that China is at the center. And if you're not a friend of China, you're an enemy of China.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  China doesn't have neighbors. It doesn't have neighborly relations. It either has the tributary states, vassal states, or it has enemies and only those two categories apply.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  But if they can if they can deal with us, they believe that Australia and New Zealand and Canada, Great Britain, all the rest will fall like dominoes because China is so much bigger and in their imagination, so much more powerful.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  And you, I'm not trying to talk you up to folks here, but I remember reading your stuff 20 years ago, you were warning of all this back when we saw it all happening and the Clinton is transferring the missile secrets and all the rest of it.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  But back then you were kind of a lonely voice. You're not too lonely now. I mean, looks like Trump and Pence and everybody in the military and I've had high level CIA reach out to us and they said you're dead on.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  We're actually helping get the government back from globalist with this China thing. It's unifying Americans to make a decision. And the fact that now they realize that there are a lot of Americans aligned with the Chai comms.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  That's actually causing a big wake up. Yeah, the Chinese Communist Party has learned how to play the American system. They've learned how to take hostages. They're taking Canadian hostages right now in China.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  They've learned how to hold hostage American companies that want to do business in China. They've learned how to use Fortune 500 companies lobbyists in Washington to lobby for the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  So they've gotten very clever in doing this. You know, 20 years ago, Alex, they were they accrued and they they blundered into giving money directly directly to Clinton's campaign.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  They were caught with the White House with suitcases of cash.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  Absolutely. That was that was crude. And then they were caught caught doing it. So so now they're much more clever in their approach.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  These Confucius institutes, of course, are in in intended to train the next generation of China watchers to be what to be panda huggers to be people who haven't learned real Chinese history, the brutal history of the Chinese Communist Party.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  It's a killing of 100 million Chinese, the starving death of 45 million Chinese, the elimination of 400 million.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Well, stay there then. You're going to have the floor for the next two segments. Give us the 35,000 view than the zero but view.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  We come back about what we're really facing when the chai comes, what their in game is and how we stop them.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Back the day with our powerhouse formula.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Happies can be an important part of your daily supplement routine with poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life.

[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  And it's all over for the unknown soldier.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  It's all over for the unknown soldier.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  You know, they talk about the silent majority, but what about the unknown soldiers of liberty out there? All of you that support us. The pray for us. We wouldn't be here without you.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Stephen W. Moser is our guest, one of the first Americans ever into communist China as a Stanford research fellow and his best selling book, the bully of Asia.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  Stephen W. Moser highly respected syndicated columnist. You read his latest article that's been one of the top stories last week how arrest of Chinese princess exposes regimes world domination plot.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  And you see Google and Apple about 10 months ago moved to China.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Trump lowers taxes from 40% to 15 on corporations to match China. That's a tariff they had having a lower tax was a reverse tariff.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  They go to zero, but they throw down the gauntlet and say even Reuters had their statement.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  You must become state run. And so Tim Cook said, you can have all the code keys to everybody in the world.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  This is beyond treason. This is madness. Google is helping them with AI, but not the Pentagon.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  So it's a big wake up call to all the old rich guys in both parties playing games that China raced way ahead of us.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  And you're not just getting cheap, you know, goods that break before they come out of the package anymore.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  The chai comms you built up to be your economic takeover leverage have turned around and bitten you in the butt,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  which was always planned by the Council on Foreign Relations and David Rockefeller, who said in the 70s when, you know, people like Moser were allowed in because he was on the on the game plan then to set China up to dominate the world.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  So give us the chai comm view of the world and what we're currently facing with 5G, what, because they've been taking our people hostages, they've been radiating our embassies, killing people.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  China's at war with us. They've been shooting at our ships. They're damn lucky this woman didn't just get indicted.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  You know, I'm seriously, we're in a war. I think it's Trump sending a little message. We're not going to just target your regular soldiers here.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  We're going to target your little princess. So break it down for us.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Well, let's be clear about what what China, how China views the world back in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed,
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Deng Xiaoping, who was then the supreme leader in China, called his senior Communist Party buddies together.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And he said the old Cold Wars over the United States has defeated the Soviet Union.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  He said the new Cold War is now beginning between China and the United States and China will win this one.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I wrote a book back 20 years ago called Hegemon, China's plan to dominate Asia and the world.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  And you know what, Alex, a lot of people said, oh, China doesn't want to dominate Asia.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  It doesn't want to dominate the world. It simply wants to join the existing world order.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  It wants to cooperate with us in building a more prosperous world.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Well, now 20 years later, everybody sees that wasn't the plan of China at all.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  The plan of China was beginning and end, one of domination.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  China, the word China in Chinese Zhongguang means middle kingdom.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  It's a kingdom at the center of the earth and the Chinese Communist Party wants China to be the kingdom at the center of the earth again.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  It has the Communist Party has a disdain for the lesser peoples around China's periphery.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Think about the Belt and Road Initiative. What is the Belt and Road Initiative?
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  China is spending trillions of dollars building infrastructure in places like Pakistan and Sri Lanka and India and Djibouti.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  They're built their first army base, naval base in Africa, in Djibouti, Africa.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  They're building infrastructure all around the world.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And that infrastructure is intended to bring the world's economy into China's domain.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  It's intended to recenter the world's economy around China so that China becomes the place where all goods are manufactured.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And the rest of the world becomes what?
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  It becomes the source of raw materials for China and it becomes the source of agricultural products.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  But China becomes the factory floor of the world.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  That's the goal.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  The goal of the Made in China 2025 plan by 2025, China wants to dominate robotics and artificial intelligence.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  And now we get to Huawei, they want to dominate 5G because they know that if they dominate the high tech industries of the future,
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  that is a path to dominating the world of the future.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And is it not, you hinted at this when we went to break without me even bringing it up.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  This is like a baby duck you can imprint on a wolf that's about to eat it.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  First thing it sees it loves, the vitriol.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  I mean you always hear the left hates America.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  I don't call them liberals through the left.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  But I'll go out to an event and I'll say America's coming back.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  We're getting unemployment down and we're coming together.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  They go, oh, and I go USA, USA, which you can make fun of the chant, it's like vampires seeing high noon.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  And they literally, you talk to them, America was never great.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  It'll never be great.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  China is great.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Everybody else is great.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  They literally have been taught to hate themselves and hate their heritage.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And they don't even know everybody wants to get in here, even though we're pretty much already done in many ways.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  What's left of the wreckage is so much better.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  They've never traveled these countries.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  They've never experienced it and you can't get through to them.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  It's like they have reflected glory from the collapse of America and they love China's rise.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  And it's like they're imagining Stockholm syndrome, like loving your abuser, that they're with the chai comms.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  When they're the first people the chai comms will get rid of.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  And we can probably talk for a long time about how the educational system in this country went 100 years ago from taking American children and teaching them that America is the greatest experiment in ordered liberty the world has ever seen.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  I wrote a speech for President Ronald Reagan once in which he talked about the city on the hill.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  He was a believer in the promise of America, not just for America, but that the lamp of liberty shining from America would lift other countries out of the darkness of tyranny and into the sunlit uplands of freedom and liberty.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  People in schools don't learn that anymore.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  All they learn, of course, is that we're racist, sexist, all those other lies.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  I mean, you turn on the news or any movie, it's all how you would demoralize people and then you learn the chai comms are funding most of it.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  I mean, it's just crazy that they found this many collaborators and it seems to me, if we illustrate this to people, they're going to come out of it and like, come on.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  It's like, it should be so easy to beat this is what I'm saying, but we don't have much time, do we?
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Because China is about to move into a dominant position.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Well, I will tell you until the election two years ago, I think that that we were five years or maybe 10 years at the outside from a tipping point.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  And what I mean by that tipping point is that the world, the geo strategic table would tilt so far in the direction of China that we would never be able to reverse it.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  Now, of course, we have a chance, maybe our last chance to turn things around to keep China.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  No, no, I totally agree. And so the average leftist when all Trump has done is pragmatically try to help everybody and like tried to even parlay with this evil.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  I just cannot believe they're working as their own interest and don't get how incredible this last chance is.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Yeah, when you read the Chinese press, as I do, you see that the global times and the people's daily and the other Chinese newspapers in their criticism of Trump seem to repeat a lot of the things that the leftists in the United States say about.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Our president. So it's almost as if there's this unholy alliance between American progressives and leftists on the one hand.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  And of course, the Chinese Communist Party on the other who really aren't. Look, let's be clear. These are communists in the sense of to everybody, according to their need and from everybody, according to their ability.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  These are fascists. These are people who want to dominate who love power above everything else and who want to dominate, not just the poor downtrodden.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Oh, yeah, talk about that. How many inner party members are there and what's their average wealth? I mean, these are fabulously rich communists.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, these are. This is the wealthiest Communist Party in the world and 90 million members of the Chinese Communist Party.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  And if you want to get ahead in China, you have to join the Communist Party. And once you join the Communist Party, you're basically free to do anything you want.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  They have, for example, in Chinese cities, when the local city government runs a little short of cash, they will invent a new tax.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  And then the Communist Party members will go from door to door to businesses saying, you owe us another thousand dollars and just collect the money on the spot.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Most much of it winds up in their pockets. The best example, though, is the former premier, a fellow named when premier when when Jabal is his full name.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  He came into office only worth only a few million dollars. He left office with 10 years later with $2.3 billion, $2.3 billion in his pocket.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Let's talk about this little princess and how her arrest signals America's surrender is over.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S. What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, powdarko bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro balancing properties.

[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test and those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted,
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  that's all because you are the core listening to InfoWars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it, and that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists. So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  We've got it, we've got it, we've got it.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  So the globalists couldn't defeat the American system and it was too good an example. So the experts are jobs and technology in China and let it buy up our entertainment and everything, so the globalists have a country to run to if they ever lose the war against America or they get indicted.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  And that's really where this is. So Stephen W. Moser, expert on China, lived there many years when it first opened up the West, bully of Asia, bestselling author, big article out, New York Post, how a rest of Chinese princess exposes regime's world domination plot.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Don't politely pause or all jump in. And the eight minutes we have left in this segment, get into how we defeat this, what you think of Trump, what Americans can do and what the stakes are here because this is getting crazy.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Well, the stakes, Alex, couldn't be higher. I mean, this is about the big bazooly. This is about the future of the world. This is about whether or not our children and grandchildren will be forced to learn Chinese and the collected sayings of Chinese president Xi Jinping.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  Because make no mistake, what's happening in China right now with minorities, with the Uighurs, for example, the Turkish minority in the West, where they're being rounded up and sent by a million of them into concentration camps, where they're forbidden to speak their own language,
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  practice their own religion, practice their own culture, they're required to learn Chinese. That's the model that China would use on its neighbors like the Vietnamese, the Cambodians and the rest, once its influence expands.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  So this is for the ballgame. And the reason why the Huawei business is so important is Huawei, which means to serve China, is a Chinese company that has been promoted and subsidized by the Chinese Communist Party for the last few decades in order to dominate high tech,
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  specifically the manufacture of smartphones on the one hand and the manufacture of 5G equipment. 5G is the, of course, fibered to the phone 100 times faster than 4G. It's going to control everything in the future.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  And if you install the 5G switching equipment, which the Chinese company of Huawei wants to do around the world, then you can turn those switches on and you can turn those switches off. And I had to laugh the other day, the Italians were trying to convince the Italians of all people to rip out all of the Huawei equipment that they've installed in Italy.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  And the director of telecommunications in Italy said this, he said, but we like Huawei because it's so cheap and it's so flexible. Well, the reason it's cheap is it's subsidized by the Chinese Communist Party. Of course, it's cheap because it's spy equipment.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  The reason it's flexible, Alex, is because it can be reprogrammed remotely. Well, isn't that convenient? The Chinese Communist Party through Huawei, once it installs this 5G equipment, can reprogram it remotely to do exactly what Beijing wants.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  That's why this stuff is so dangerous. It's going to control everything in the future, the driverless cars, the freight trains, the power plants, and of course, weapons systems.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  This is beyond something like the Terminator movie. This is the Communist Chinese dominant because, like you said, they'll sell it not at cost at a loss. As the heart of their global move, a Trojan horse, here's basically free 5G.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  Just pay for the basic cost, but we control it and then the Chinese government is already dominant in rural America. They've already put it in or already begging Trump. Don't make us take it out. We want the Chai-Kong 5G.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  Well, it's 30%, 40% cheaper than Cisco systems or the other manufacturers of 5G equipment because it's paid for in large part by the Chinese Communist Party for their own purposes of control, spying, and espionage.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  They've got literal slaves putting this crap together. Then they ship it over. Their technicians come over that are operatives. I can't believe we've even allowed this to happen.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Well, we've gotten pretty far down this road. Finally, though, we have an administration with people in the administration, like the trade and industry council head Peter Navarro, who understands that China literally wants to kill us.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Peter wrote a few years ago a book called Death by China, which people may have heard of, about how Chinese products can be dangerous to us. Bicycles that break down when you ride them and kill their owners, things like that.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  But the 5G stuff is much more dangerous. It would be not just individual death by China, but it would be the death of our civilization.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Because think about all of a sudden the train stop running, the car stop running, the power plant shut down, the lights go off, your cell phone doesn't work, everything stops.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And China says, in order for us to turn the lights back on again, you're going to have to demobilize. You're going to have to build down your military. You're going to have to hand us the Western Pacific.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  That's what we're talking about. We're talking about the end game here. A century ago, the important things were controlling strategic choke points, like the Panama Canal, like the Straits of Malacca, where the British built Singapore to control entry and egress from the Pacific end of the Indian Ocean.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Today, those strategic choke points are going to be controlled by 5G equipment. And we don't want that equipment to be made in China.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Now, we've gotten pretty far down this road. We're having to go in, I understand, and rip out computer motherboards from many of our military facilities because we haven't paid enough attention to the fact that anything made in China of a high-tech nature is going to have a backdoor, a trapdoor, is going to have a chimp embedded in it so that the Chinese can use it remotely to collect information.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  That's not just me talking. I mean, the FBI Director Christopher Wray earlier this year said that Huawei equipment could be used in a malicious way to modify and steal information to conduct undetected espionage that we wouldn't even find out about until months or years later.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  So we now know that this is a problem. We're now finally taking action, but we couldn't take action fast enough. And we've got to bring the world along with us because the United States can't stand alone in this. We have to have Australia, New Zealand, the English-speaking countries with us.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  I think they are on board. We have to get places like South Korea and Japan to join with us as well. Because if they're using 5G, if our allies are using 5G equipment, we really can't be allied with them in the future because information flows.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  Sure, everything's being intercepted. It's like when we had the Nazi Ultra Code, and of course they didn't know during World War II, that's how we were able to beat them. This is crazy and it's all admitted.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  When the Chinese people want freedom, China's very weak if we simply stand up to them. And that's why I'm encouraging leftists and others out there who have this moronic hatred of America. China doesn't care about you. America is full of good people on average, and we need to stand against the
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  big corporate elite that have bet on China. They're the real traders that set China up to do this, and they're lust to defeat the American experiment.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  I know in my gut, we're going to beat the globalists in the Chai Kongs. I'm not a vindictive person, but justice needs to be done. Those of you that actively serve this, there's a lot of you out there who are globalists who serve the Chai Kong operation, you're going to have to pay for what you've done.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  So I'm just encouraging everybody now, stop now. Don't be part of this and realize the alarms already been pulled, the alarms already been set, and the resistance has already been triggered, and I don't think in the end the globalists are going to win.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  What do you think, Stephen?
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  I think we still control our own destiny here, and certainly the Trump terrorists have done exactly what they were supposed to do. They have raised the cost for the Chinese Communist Party. They have brought the Chinese Communist Party to the negotiating table, and I think we're going to see the trade
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  depths with China shrink rapidly over the next couple of years. If not, the terrorists are going to go up to 25%, and I'll tell you what that means. That means that Apple, which now makes things in China, will be making things in Vietnam.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  We'll talk to you soon. We salute you.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  We'll see you soon.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership. That's the globalist only hope.

[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Music plays
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. We're here live. Don't forget the War Room with Owen Schreuer.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  Weekdays, 3 o'clock Central. David Knight doing a great job. David Knight showing 8 a.m. every morning from the InfoWars News Center. The most lied about, the most demonized, the most attacked broadcast in the world because we're over the target.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Well, somebody that has been saying that the economy was going to start going down because of too much debt and all the rest of it's Peter Schiff of EuroPAC.com and he doesn't need an introduction. We're going to go to him in just a moment and get his take on this rollercoaster stock market that already lost this year's gains and where he sees all of this going here in a moment.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  I'm not plugged yet today, but I'm going to now. Listeners have really supported the broadcast and I appreciate that in the face of the Democratic Party established for trying to shut us down.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  And so we're having year-end closeout sales that are the biggest sales we've ever had been run the last month. Storewide free shipping, double-patriot points set a 5%-10% your next order. Storewide free shipping, as I said, 50-75% off and a free gift with every order.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  It was free t-shirt, but 20,000 t-shirts later, we're out of t-shirts in large and extra large. So we have to stop that now. So you will get something of comparable value, a bottle of colloidal silver, a bottle of brain force.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I mean, there's a lot of cool free gifts that we're putting in each order, but regardless, you're funding MFullWarStore.com. You're funding an operation that, yeah, we saw a lot of this at cost to clear out the warehouse.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  You've seen the Soros Group. You've seen Hillary, the Democrats. Shane, he still got merchant accounts. Yeah, we had six. They got us down to one. We got a couple backups now in contracts, but this is a war to shut us down.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  So my model is this. About two months ago, I said, we're selling everything at cost or lower, clear the warehouse out, get operating funds in, and I'm going to move back to sponsorship, which is the next two weeks.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  We're going to announce three new sponsors that don't care if they get death threats or bomb threats by the Democrats. And so put that in your pipe.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  And it may have an increased funding. We'll just keep the merchant accounts and sell our own products, but we got a bunch of big sponsors coming online. So praise God for that. The point is, support MFullWarStore today.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  We have very close to selling out a lot of products. We've sold out a lot of products. Still some of our best sellers are there, whether it's X2, X3, Brainforce, MFullWarStore.com.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  And a lot of these deals, we lose money on, but we're not paying inventory tax. And it's a big, you know, you know what, to the globalists that we're able to fund ourselves into the new year.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  And they're taking Michael Savage off the air. He's not supposed to talk about it or he'll lose his contract and get sued, but I can talk about it.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  And they're, they're taking, you know, everybody off the air. It's every day. It's some new top person taking off.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  Gavin McGinnis, the list goes on and on, all getting ready to try to take the president out. You can argue about his policies all day long. The point is, he's really pissed off the establishment.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  But Peter Schiff of EuroPack.com manages billions. Of course, he was former chief advisor to Ron Paul and his dad's a famous patriot or was a famous patriot who I was friends with.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  But he joins us today to, you know, I guess to this horn, he's made a lot of predictions and he's been saying that this whole gravy train that we've seen the last two years is coming to an end.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  And, well, we're on the knife's edge, right? I think we've already already kind of gone down the roller coaster, haven't we?
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  You know, I'm watching history happen.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Yeah, you know, I don't really want to tube my horn so much as soundly alarm and guess, you know, I've been saying this since Trump was inaugurated.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  But, you know, he inherited that big fat, ugly bubble. And the problem was he owns it now because unfortunately he called, he called it a boom and claimed it credit for it, but he's going to own the bust.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Remember that what he inherited from Obama was a disaster. I mean, that's why Trump was elected because the recovery was phony. It was all engineered by cheap money and zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  That prevented the economy from going through a badly needed restructuring.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  It allowed the government to run enormous deficits under Obama without pushing interest rates up. And it pushed up the value of stocks in real estate so people could feel wealthier even though they weren't.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  And all of that, those assets collateralized all sorts of debt. We borrowed a lot of money during that time because of these inflated real estate prices and stock prices.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  And then Trump walks in and he kind of, you know, adds air to the bubble by cutting taxes by but letting government spending continue to grow.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  So we had more debt. We postponed the bursting of that bubble. So instead of it bursting, you know, early in his administration, now it's going to burst halfway through.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  And that means that the air is going to come out for the next two years and we're going to be in a worse recession than the great recession when Trump is up for reelection.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  And that's going to be very difficult. You know, the last president to run for reelection during a recession with Jimmy Carter.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  And that didn't work out well for Carter, but it worked out well for the nation because we got Ronald Reagan.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Well, this time we're going to get the opposite of Ronald Reagan. We're going to end up with a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren type socialist as president in 2020 with the full support of a socialist Congress.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  So I think we have some dark days ahead, unfortunately.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Well, by the way, I wasn't being mean when I said toot your horn. I was tooting your horn for you that you were accurate. But listen, I know Trump's view.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  I've read his books about this. If we're in a global debt bubble acceleration and the big banks were giving the debt to themselves, you know, the free money themselves.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Trump's like, we got to grow away out of this. We got to get some industry back. I'm damned if I have the bubble go. I'm damned if I don't.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  I should at least try to direct the bubble to the people.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  He basically said that. And then here comes the Federal Reserve with policy that you would agree with back when Obama was there, they should have raised rates, but they didn't.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  So then he raises it clearly politically on Trump and then that signals the bubble imploding. I mean, if we're going to have the bubble implode, I mean, I think that's Trump's argument.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  Why not let it expand some more? So what about the argument that clearly the Federal Reserve has been targeting Trump politically or disagree with that?
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Well, I don't think the president has a lot of fans at the Federal Reserve, but I don't know that those guys are smart enough to know how to target them.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  But, you know, I actually think that had the Fed not raised rates, it would be worse right now because the only reason the dollar hasn't imploded is because the Fed is raising rates.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And because people believe they're going to continue to raise rates.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Now, I don't. I do believe that before, you know, Trump has finished with this term, rates will be back at zero.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  And the Federal Reserve is going to be doing quantitative easing all over again, except it's going to backfire because it's not going to reflate asset bubbles.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  It's going to throw gasoline on the inflation. So you're predicting that we're about to do 2008 repeat again?
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  Well, it's not going to be an exact repeat because in 2008, the dollar went up. This time, I think it's going to be a dollar crisis.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  Oh, yeah, you did predict that, too. The dollar's been going down. You were on like six months ago and said that.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  And the dollar hasn't really gone anywhere, but it's been going sideways because people still believe that the economy is much stronger than it is and that the Fed is going to be able to deliver more rate hikes.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  But, you know, we haven't had economic growth really under Trump. We've just spent more borrowed money.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  You know, Trump likes to talk about how we're having a resurgence in manufacturing, but we're not.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  The manufacturing numbers are terrible. The trade deficits under Trump are bigger than they've ever been.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  We have a record.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  But at least he's been trying to do something. Well, let's get to that next segment.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Let me ask you this, Peter, chef of your Pacific capital, EuroPak.com.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  The nightmare scenario, though, we're going to break, talk about it. I agree with you that if Hillary wouldn't have stolen it from Bernie, even though I hate Bernie and his policies, he would probably have beaten Trump.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  America's going that way. Look at Cortez as a bellwether. That woman is an idiot and she wanted a landslide.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  So I agree with you that if we don't do something right now, we're going to end up with basically communist in 2020.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  So start getting into that because I think that's that's scary.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's communism, you know, we're, you know, socialism, communism is a form of socialism.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  I don't know that it's going to get that dire. But yeah, I mean, that's where we're headed.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  I think Bernie getting elected or Alexander Cortez or Elizabeth Warren, I mean, they're basically communists.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Like Hugo Chavez called himself a socialist. And then once he got full power, he was a communist.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Yeah. I mean, look, they're socialists. I mean, communism, fascism, they're all forms of socialism.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  It's basically a belief that, you know, that the free market doesn't work and that the government should do everything.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And clearly that's where the heart of the Democratic Party is right now, and we're moving in that direction.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  And that's why I'm afraid that Trump is going to get blamed this crisis that's going to happen.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  Trump didn't cause it. Right.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  No, you've been saying that you've been dead on and I wanted you to be wrong. You've been right.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  Let's just say it, leadership's right so far.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  So many of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  That's the globalist only hope.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  So when you support info wars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at info wars store.com,
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  you are literally not just supporting info wars and free speech and standing and defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  But you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  If you order products at info wars store.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Every order gets a free t-shirt. Every order gets free shipping.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. I salute you all. Now please take action at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population down.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  X3, now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity,
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  Listening to info wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying, 2018 has been insane, 2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  So there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  Alright, Peter Schiff of EuroPak.com, Billions Under Management, you know I'm all over CNBC, you name it, has made a lot of accurate predictions.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  He's been talking about the debt and what's happening in the dollar and all the rest of it.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  And so continuing then, what do you expect to see next?
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  What do you think Trump should do versus what's been happening?
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  And you're elaborating on Trump getting the blame for the process that was already going on.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  The Federal Reserve at first kind of secretary men and said maybe things are going to grow, then they said they weren't.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  And then they said it would never grow, it passed 3%.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  It did, that kind of made people get more exuberant.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  What's really going on and what's coming next?
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  First of all, I've got a few things in common with you.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  CNBC banned me about two years ago, so I haven't been on there in a long time.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  So I have a hard time getting on the mainstream.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  What got you banned?
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  He used to be all over the place.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  The last time I was supposed to be on was a couple of years ago, I was scheduled to be on with Rick Santelli, who used to invite me on quite a bit.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  And then I got canceled last minute and haven't been invited on since.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  And Rick had no idea why I got canceled, but that was my last scheduled appearance.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  I get on Fox Business every once in a while, but I mean, I'm not on CNN anymore.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  I'm not on Bloomberg.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  They banned me.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  They were the first to probably ban me eight, nine years ago after I was on almost every week before the financial crisis.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  So they don't like my opinion getting out there.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  But let me just get back to what we're talking about with Trump.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  Because Trump claimed credit for the boom and said he did it with his policies and he made America great again,
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  because of that, when this whole thing comes crashing down in the second half of his term, he has made it so easy for the Democrats to blame him.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  I mean, this is going to be easier than it was blaming Bush for the 2008 crisis.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  That's what made it so easy for Obama to beat John McCain.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Well, it's going to be even easier for whoever the Democrats nominate to beat Trump when we are in a massive recession,
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  and they're going to blame it on tax cuts, on deregulation, on everything that Trump did is going to get blamed.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  What Trump should have done when he was first elected, instead of trying to be popular
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  and trying to make it easy, he should have basically delivered the bad news.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  And basically said, look, we've had eight years of a phony economy.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  In fact, it began long before Obama.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  We have to deflate this bubble.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  We're going to have to go through a protracted recession to get our economic house in order.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  If we want to make America great again, here's what we need to do.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  We need to shrink government.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  We need to cut government spending.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  We need to rein in entitlements.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  We need to cut regulations so we can produce and save.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  We need higher interest rates.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  The stock market is going to come down.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  The real estate market is going to come down.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  But if we want to produce again and export and do all these things that we did when we were great, we just have what we need to do.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  We need to swallow this bitter-tasting medicine.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  But Trump didn't want any part of that.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  He became a big cheerleader for everything he criticized.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  All of a sudden, he wanted more cheap money.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  He wanted higher stock prices.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  He wanted more spending.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  He just wanted to keep the bubble going before he got out of dodge.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  And he wanted to claim credit for the bubble.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  The problem is, he's not going to get out of dodge.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  But let's stop right there.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  While he's there.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  Let's stop right there, though.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  I mean, the bubble wasn't getting to the people before.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  They couldn't get above 3%.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Trump and the exuberance and getting some industry back in America first did get a lot of people excited.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  And so it did inflate the bubble way bigger than they thought, which I think kind of scared the Federal Reserve.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I mean, let's give him some credit.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  He sure the hell pumped that bubble up.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  I don't want to give somebody credit for pumping a bubble.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  I want credit for letting the bubble deflate.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  Bubbles are a problem.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  They distort the economy.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  They can feel good just like drugs.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  But I don't want to encourage somebody to become a heroin addict because it feels good.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Sure, let me be honest.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  I mean, I'm sure you offered this, too.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  Let me be conservative.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  I could have made the last six, seven years $300 million, literally going with all the Bitcoin people and everything else.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  I know what people got paid.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  I had him offering me a million a month real companies just two years ago.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  And I never endorse it because I thought at the end of the day it was going to be like the tulip, you know, fiasco in the Netherlands a couple hundred years ago.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  I'm not saying crypto isn't real.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  I'm not saying digital currencies aren't okay.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  I said it was bad news.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  I think marijuana stocks long term are a total bubble because everybody and their dogs involved in it.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  And so people say, oh, I get offered all this money to promote marijuana stocks.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  I'm not doing it.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  So I mean, I get what you're saying.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  I don't like bubbles either.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  I'm just saying at least you could smoke marijuana.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  You can't do anything with Bitcoin or any of these cryptocurrencies.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  So they're going to zero.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Some of these pot stocks will survive.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  But yeah, most of them are probably way overvalued because people don't understand how much competition is actually going to be in this market.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  When the big tobacco companies are finally getting involved.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  But you know, yeah, I applaud the fact that you resisted the temptation to subject your audience to a Ponzi scheme.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  I'm sure a lot of people in the crypto universe wanted to get you pumping all those coins so they can dump them on your audience.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  And it's good for you that you didn't fall for that because a lot of people are going to be left on the back.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  I was a sophisticated like you were eight, nine years ago.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  He called me said, hey, you're not just promoting some news letter.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  It's a whole stock deal.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  So I had to learn like, oh, I'm not just promoting a newsletter.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  So when it got to Bitcoin, I'm like, and I was kind of what it hit.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Like the biggest thing in the world bigger than JP Morgan, bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  And I'm like, was I wrong?
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  But then it just went last December straight down and I can sit back and tell my audience.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  Now I did not tell you to do it.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Did I?
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  And but sometimes I go, man, could assure fun at the company with 300 million bucks.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:39.880]  but I probably go to prison.
[1:53:39.880 --> 1:53:41.720]  Yeah, and you know, we're not finished going down.
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:44.160]  I mean, people made money if they got in early,
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:47.220]  but of course those gains are gonna equal the losses
[1:53:47.220 --> 1:53:48.880]  by all the people who got in late.
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:50.640]  And by the time they were trying to pump,
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:52.320]  pay you to pump it, it was late.
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:54.120]  They weren't trying to get you to pump Bitcoin
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:56.720]  when it was a dollar or $5 or $10.
[1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:59.240]  No, they were begging me to do it starting two years ago
[1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:00.080]  and then into its peak.
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:02.040]  It was like, just take it, it's a million.
[1:54:02.040 --> 1:54:03.560]  Just come on, it's a great deal.
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:04.840]  I had like movie stars calling me and stuff.
[1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:06.040]  Yeah, bubbles.
[1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:07.700]  Yeah, look, they always end badly,
[1:54:07.700 --> 1:54:11.560]  but Bitcoin is just a microcosm for the whole United States.
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:14.640]  Our whole economy is a gigantic bubble.
[1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:17.160]  And you know, had Hillary Clinton won,
[1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:19.920]  I don't think the Fed ever would have raised rates again.
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:23.040]  They raised rates only one time before Trump was elected.
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:24.520]  Sure, so that's my question.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:27.280]  So they clearly did something different because it was Trump.
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:32.040]  No, because Trump enabled them to get in a few more hikes
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:33.800]  by blowing more air into the bubble.
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:36.240]  And you talk about the 3% GDP growth.
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:38.320]  We only got that for a couple of quarters.
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:42.920]  I'm not even sure if we're gonna be at 3% for all of 2018.
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:45.240]  We didn't get it for 2017,
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.960]  but whatever the GDP ends up being this year,
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:49.640]  this is gonna be the high watermark.
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:50.480]  We're going down.
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:53.680]  We're probably gonna be in a recession in GDP next year.
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:54.520]  And we're not gonna get out of it.
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:55.600]  That's my next question.
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:57.400]  A lot of economists are saying
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:54:58.840]  20% reduction bare minimum,
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:02.800]  some are saying 50% and they're protecting great,
[1:55:02.800 --> 1:55:05.200]  mainstream news, and I'm not saying that's right then
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:08.600]  because they lie so much, a great depression scenario.
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:10.400]  Well, the Great Depression is gonna happen
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:12.600]  after the Democrats get in in 2020.
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:15.240]  I mean, you know, because I guess the good news is
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:16.920]  they're gonna screw it up even more.
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:18.480]  I mean, if you want to call that good news
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:21.040]  because we might have a shot of taking back the country
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:22.520]  in 2024.
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:26.760]  But, you know, Hoover was in office
[1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:28.420]  when the depression started,
[1:55:28.420 --> 1:55:30.320]  but it really didn't become a depression
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:32.640]  until Roosevelt made it a depression
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:35.920]  by basically taking all the failed policies of Hoover
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:37.200]  and expanding them.
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:39.560]  And so I think when the Democrats take over
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:41.120]  this massive recession,
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:43.640]  they will turn it into a depression
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:46.520]  except it's going to be an inflationary depression.
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:47.880]  So it's not gonna be a depression
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:49.400]  where stuff gets less expensive
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:53.240]  because that actually makes a depression, you know,
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:54.080]  not as bad.
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:57.360]  So you're predicting stagflation in 2021.
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:00.820]  Except not just stagnation, an actual recession.
[1:56:00.820 --> 1:56:04.080]  I'm talking about big inflation and recession
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:06.160]  at the same time, not just slow growth.
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:07.000]  Does that ever happen before?
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:08.240]  A real contraction.
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:09.280]  Well, you know, I don't know.
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:11.920]  In the 1970s, I don't think the economy
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:13.120]  was actually contracting.
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:15.000]  I think it was still going up.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:16.920]  But, you know, a lot of it has to do with
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:19.080]  the way they calculate inflation.
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:20.520]  So it's probably happened,
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:23.560]  but the government hasn't officially acknowledged it
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:25.040]  because of the way they score it.
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:26.520]  But I think that this time,
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:29.120]  even the government numbers are gonna show
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:30.160]  a contracting economy.
[1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:31.400]  Let me ask you this then.
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:33.560]  What are you investing in?
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:36.080]  Well, look, I haven't changed my strategy.
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:37.640]  I've been investing the same way.
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:40.800]  To me, it's amazing that this bubble has gone on this big.
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:42.920]  And again, had Trump not been elected,
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:44.800]  it would have popped two years ago.
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:47.280]  And I think the dollar would already be falling.
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:48.680]  Gold would already be taken off
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:50.960]  because the Fed would already be back in zero.
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:53.040]  They'd already be doing quantitative easing.
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:55.360]  So I think people should be getting out of the dollar
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:57.200]  before the bottom drops out,
[1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:00.200]  getting out of overpriced U.S. stocks and bonds,
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:04.000]  getting into better valued assets outside the United States.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  There are better valued companies.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:06.680]  Sure, I mean, does gold only go up
[1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:08.480]  or other commodities go up?
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:09.720]  Well, I think all the commodities
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:10.760]  are ultimately gonna go up.
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:12.520]  I think gold's gonna go up the most.
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:14.720]  So I think you're gonna see a deflation in that.
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:17.100]  I think commodity prices will fall
[1:57:17.100 --> 1:57:20.400]  in terms of real money, which is gold and silver.
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:22.440]  But I think prices are gonna rise
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:25.040]  in terms of, you know, all these paper substitutes,
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:26.480]  like dollars or even your own.
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:28.000]  I know you gotta go, but it's a two-minute break.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:28.840]  If you'll do five more minutes,
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:30.000]  I wanna get back into Bitcoin
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:31.720]  because I'm not a rocket scientist
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:33.640]  like you managing billions of dollars.
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:35.240]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist.
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:36.240]  Just have that common sense.
[1:57:36.240 --> 1:57:37.080]  No, I know.
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:38.040]  So I wanna hear about Bitcoin
[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:39.360]  because I agree with you.
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:40.200]  Not just Bitcoin.
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:41.040]  And people are really pissed
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:42.080]  when I do the second death threats.
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:44.040]  I think it's gonna go to zero.
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:46.640]  I mean, I just, let's come back in two minutes
[1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:47.480]  and talk about that.
[1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:49.200]  The globalists are trying to set up
[1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:52.800]  a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:54.160]  If there's any opposition,
[1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:56.280]  if there's any independent media
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:57:59.480]  that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes,
[1:57:59.480 --> 1:58:01.640]  that can call BS, it's game over.
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:03.720]  But if you look at everybody else,
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:05.880]  like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh
[1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:07.560]  and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity,
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:10.000]  they are all beholded to the networks they're on
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:11.800]  that can be targeted.
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:14.280]  There's only two groups in the U.S.,
[1:58:14.280 --> 1:58:17.680]  Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com
[1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:19.640]  that are truly independent.
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:20.960]  And of course, there are two of the dominant
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:22.800]  media forces in the world.
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:24.200]  It really is amazing.
[1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:26.920]  That's why as we close out 2018,
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:29.000]  I wanna just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.920]  we're all in and how far we've come together.
[1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:32.440]  Just remind you that you are the power,
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:36.440]  you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:39.960]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com,
[1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:41.080]  christenpudda.com.
[1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:42.760]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:44.400]  no one else will.
[1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:45.760]  We're all in each other's hands.
[1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:47.360]  God bless you all and thank you.
[1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:50.960]  You deserve a deep restful sleep
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:53.680]  with knockout by Infowars Life.

[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:09.880]  and achieve proper sleep.

[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:16.000]  but with the rapid speed of life,
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.240]  we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:46.920]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[1:59:46.920 --> 1:59:49.920]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:53.920 --> 1:59:56.920]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:59:56.920 --> 2:00:01.920]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:03.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:05.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:07.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:07.920 --> 2:00:09.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:11.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:13.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:15.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:18.920]  Little fish.
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:20.920]  As we begin the third hour here today
[2:00:20.920 --> 2:00:22.920]  on The Alex Jones Show, Mike Adams filling in.
[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:27.920]  Thank you for joining us on December 27th, 2018.
[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:33.920]  I want to remind you that I am not your entertainment.
[2:00:33.920 --> 2:00:35.920]  Alex Jones is not your entertainment.
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:40.920]  We are not here so that you can just listen to something
[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:42.920]  that affirms your current beliefs,
[2:00:42.920 --> 2:00:45.920]  although that's great.
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:49.920]  That can help support your paradigm of the world
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:51.920]  and we live in the real world.
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:53.920]  We live in the world of cause and effect.
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:55.920]  But that's not why we are here.
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:00:57.920]  We are here to give you information
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:00.920]  that can spur you to take action.
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:02.920]  Action is crucial.
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:06.920]  If you are listening to this show every day
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:08.920]  and you're nodding your head in agreement
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:10.920]  and you're going, yeah, that's right.
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:12.920]  I feel that's what I'm thinking too.
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:14.920]  Yeah, the world is going crazy.
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:16.920]  Look at this crazy stuff.
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:18.920]  They want migrants to come in and overthrow America.
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:21.920]  Look at the craziness with the Fed raising interest rates
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:23.920]  trying to crash the stock market
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:25.920]  and the Liberals celebrating it.
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:27.920]  Look at the craziness.
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  A 11-year-old boy dancing in a gay bar,
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:33.920]  like a trans, I don't know, it's too sick.
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:35.920]  I don't even want to talk about that.
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:37.920]  But we're not just here to point out
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:39.920]  these crazy and insane things that are happening in the world.
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:42.920]  And you shouldn't be, if I could offer this suggestion,
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  you shouldn't be listening to this show just to get agreement.
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:47.920]  You should be taking action.
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:49.920]  You need to do things right now, I believe.
[2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:53.920]  Because times are changing so rapidly,
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:55.920]  there will come a day very soon
[2:01:55.920 --> 2:01:57.920]  where you won't be able to do things
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:00.920]  like get information online.
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:02.920]  You know, if that EMP attack comes
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:04.920]  that I talked about in the previous segment,
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:06.920]  you won't be able to go to infowars.com.
[2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:09.920]  You won't be able to hear this show on your mobile phone.
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:11.920]  You won't be able to go online
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:15.920]  and look up the firearms disassembly manual
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:17.920]  for your rifle.
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:19.920]  Because you'll have no connectivity.
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:21.920]  You won't be able to go to the grocery store
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:24.920]  and stock up on butter because all the butter will be gone.
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:26.920]  You won't be able to buy a water filter.
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.920]  Amazon won't be able to deliver to your house.
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:32.920]  UPS won't be functioning.
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.920]  Heck, UPS barely functions on a good day.
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:38.920]  None of the carriers will be able to deliver anything.
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:41.920]  Fuel will not be delivered to your local gas station.
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:45.920]  How are you going to function in that scenario
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:47.920]  if you are not prepared in advance,
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.920]  including the information side of this?
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:53.920]  So here's what you need to do.
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:55.920]  I think, it's just a suggestion,
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  I think you should go through infowars.com.
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:01.920]  Maybe some info wars writers can do this,
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:04.920]  but put together like an index of the most practical,
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.920]  important articles on infowars.com for 2018.
[2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:10.920]  Maybe I'll do this on natural news as well.
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:13.920]  To say download and print these articles.
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:16.920]  Here's 100 articles you need to download and print.
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:19.920]  Well, just hit print from your browser,
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:22.920]  but you get my point because if things go bad,
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:24.920]  you won't be able to access those articles.
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:26.920]  No search engine will function.
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:28.920]  No social media will function.
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:30.920]  No mobile devices will function.
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:32.920]  Cell towers won't function and so on.
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:35.920]  And nuclear power plants that go into meltdown at the same time,
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:38.920]  believe me, it's going to be such chaos nationwide.
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:41.920]  If you're anywhere near a city, it's going to become a death trap.
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:43.920]  You need to have a bug out plan.
[2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:46.920]  You need to have a bug out vehicle that can survive an EMP.
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:48.920]  You need to have a bug out bag.
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:51.920]  You need to have things that are EMP proof in there
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:54.920]  like a compass, like that ballistics calculator I mentioned.
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:56.920]  You need to have things that can function
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:03:59.920]  even following these worst case scenarios.
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:03.920]  If you don't take action and get prepared with those things,
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:05.920]  I mean, get iodine, get vitamin C,
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  cover your nutritional needs as well.
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:09.920]  Get storable food.
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:11.920]  Get a water filter that's a hand-pumped water filter.
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:14.920]  You know, catadine is a good brand as well.
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:16.920]  And the gravity filters out there,
[2:04:16.920 --> 2:04:18.920]  InfoWars stores got some as well.
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:22.920]  Get this stuff now and it will serve you for a lifetime
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:25.920]  because we are not here to serve as your entertainment.
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:28.920]  I don't take two hours out of my day to just entertain you.
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:31.920]  I'm here to help you save yourself
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:33.920]  because I know what's coming.
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:34.920]  Alex sees it.
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:35.920]  We know what's coming.
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:37.920]  We're always way ahead of the curve on this
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:39.920]  and we're warning you now.
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:44.920]  Get prepared because it's going to be political chaos,
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:46.920]  possibly civil war chaos,
[2:04:46.920 --> 2:04:49.920]  possibly international war in the years ahead.
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:52.920]  Be ready or you'll get caught with your pants down on this.
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:55.920]  Much more straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:04:55.920 --> 2:04:59.920]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut
[2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:02.920]  with prebiotic fiber by InfoWars Life.
[2:05:02.920 --> 2:05:04.920]  Help the good bacteria thrive
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:07.920]  and support overall digestive health
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:10.920]  with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber,
[2:05:10.920 --> 2:05:13.920]  a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia,
[2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:15.920]  fruit and flax fiber.
[2:05:15.920 --> 2:05:18.920]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber
[2:05:18.920 --> 2:05:21.920]  that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:24.920]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients
[2:05:24.920 --> 2:05:27.920]  and even support your immune system.
[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:29.920]  InfoWars Life's cutting-edge formula
[2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:32.920]  only brings you the highest quality, organic
[2:05:32.920 --> 2:05:34.920]  and clinically studied ingredients.
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:36.920]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up
[2:05:36.920 --> 2:05:38.920]  only at the beginning of the colon,

[2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:16.920]  Socialists have taken over the Democrat Party
[2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:20.920]  and they're pushing for a so-called green new deal
[2:06:20.920 --> 2:06:22.920]  in Washington D.C.
[2:06:22.920 --> 2:06:24.920]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:26.920]  is one of those who's pushing for this.
[2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:28.920]  The green new deal, of course,
[2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:30.920]  modeled after the new deal
[2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:32.920]  that was a massive expansion of government,
[2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:35.920]  created, I believe, the Social Security Administration
[2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:38.920]  that confiscates your wealth and then waste it
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:41.920]  and will probably never pay off
[2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:43.920]  many people working today.
[2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:47.920]  The green new deal is a promise
[2:06:47.920 --> 2:06:52.920]  to basically destroy the fossil fuel economy
[2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:55.920]  that is currently powering the United States.
[2:06:55.920 --> 2:06:58.920]  And let me say for the record,
[2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:01.920]  my name is Mike Adams, I'm here on the Alex Jones show today
[2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:03.920]  for the record.
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:06.920]  I know that I and the infowars organization
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:09.920]  agree with this, that this green new deal
[2:07:09.920 --> 2:07:12.920]  would be the end of America as we know it.
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:15.920]  It would turn America into Venezuela.
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:17.920]  And here's why.
[2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:20.920]  The fossil fuel economy is,
[2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:22.920]  under Trump, by the way,
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:24.920]  fossil fuel economy has expanded
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:28.920]  to the point where we now are a net exporter of fuel.
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:31.920]  In essence, we are energy independent now
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:33.920]  for the first time in over a decade.
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:36.920]  Even as Obama tried to destroy fossil fuels
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:38.920]  and shut down coal-fired power plants,
[2:07:38.920 --> 2:07:42.920]  President Trump has brought back oil exploration
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:45.920]  and he's brought back clean coal in America
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:48.920]  and he has enabled us to be more energy independent,
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:50.920]  which by the way is huge
[2:07:50.920 --> 2:07:52.920]  in terms of supporting our economic growth
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:56.920]  and insulating us from issues of geopolitics,
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:59.920]  issues in the Middle East, oil embargoes
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:01.920]  or oil supply restrictions or oil pricing
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:04.920]  from countries that are enemies of the United States.
[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:08.920]  So Trump has, in effect, become America's best friend.
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:10.920]  That's why he's hated by the globalists
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:12.920]  because they hate America.
[2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:14.920]  They hate energy independence.
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:17.920]  But this economy is only possible
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:19.920]  because of the amount of work
[2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:22.920]  that is condensed into, let's say,
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:25.920]  a gallon of gasoline or a gallon of diesel fuel.
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:31.920]  And I have news for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:35.920]  Ms. Cortez, there are no tractors that run on batteries.
[2:08:35.920 --> 2:08:39.920]  Now, I understand that her IQ is too far gone
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:41.920]  to understand these complex concepts.
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:44.920]  But there are no tractors that grow food
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:47.920]  and harvest food and plant seeds that run on batteries.
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:50.920]  There are not commercial airliners that run on batteries.
[2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:53.920]  You can have all the green energy in the world.
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:08:55.920]  You can have all the solar panels
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:57.920]  and all the wind turbines, everything in the world.
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:01.920]  But if you don't have some kind of quantum leak revolution
[2:09:01.920 --> 2:09:05.920]  in battery storage, there's not energy density
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:08.920]  to power long-haul trucks on the highways
[2:09:08.920 --> 2:09:11.920]  to deliver all the goods and services and deliver the fuel.
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  And tractors and agricultural equipment,
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:16.920]  they don't run on batteries.
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:17.920]  They run on diesel.
[2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  They run on petroleum. They run on fossil fuels.
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:22.920]  And it's astonishing to me
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:25.920]  that these socialist liberals in Washington, D.C.,
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:28.920]  they are so incredibly brain-dead.
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:29.920]  They are...
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:31.920]  And I don't mean this as an insult.
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:33.920]  I mean this as a medical diagnosis when I say
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:35.920]  they are cognitively retarded.
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:38.920]  They are incapable of understanding
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:42.920]  the most basic principles of science and energy
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:44.920]  and energy storage
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:48.920]  and why diesel fuel powers the biggest machines,
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:54.920]  construction equipment, cranes, excavators, skid steers, dump trucks.
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.920]  The machines that power our infrastructure
[2:09:56.920 --> 2:09:58.920]  are powered by fossil fuels.
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:09:59.920]  Why?
[2:09:59.920 --> 2:10:01.920]  Because fossil fuels have the energy density
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:03.920]  that's necessary to run those motors
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:05.920]  and run the hydraulic systems
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:08.920]  that are necessary for all that to exist.
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:12.920]  Now, the Green New Deal would collapse America's economy
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:14.920]  because the Green New Deal
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:17.920]  is trying to destroy the fossil fuel system
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:21.920]  and get us over to so-called clean green energy
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:23.920]  in some number of years,
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:25.920]  but it's a fairy tale.
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:28.920]  And by the way, by the way in all of this,
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:31.920]  fossil fuels release carbon
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:33.920]  that's trapped under the ground
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:37.920]  carbon that the plants of the world need to grow.
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:40.920]  Plants use carbon, carbon dioxide.
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:42.920]  It's the number one most important nutrient
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:45.920]  for all plant life on our planet.
[2:10:45.920 --> 2:10:47.920]  Food crops need carbon.
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:49.920]  Forests need carbon.
[2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:51.920]  Reforestation is only possible
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:54.920]  because of rising levels of carbon dioxide.
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:57.920]  The more carbon dioxide we have in the atmosphere,
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:00.920]  it's a blessing to the regaining of the Earth.
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:02.920]  If we want to have a Green New Deal,
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.920]  it should be raising the carbon dioxide levels
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:06.920]  because that would make the planet more green,
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:09.920]  more wet, more lush, we'd have more rain forests.
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  The science on this is absolutely clear.
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:15.920]  Higher levels of CO2 are called a greenhouse effect
[2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:18.920]  because a greenhouse is where you grow plants.
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:20.920]  CO2 is good for the planet
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  and actually burning fossil fuels
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:24.920]  releases carbon that's trapped underground
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:27.920]  that actually is a nutrient for plant life.
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:30.920]  It allows third world countries to grow more food more easily.
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  You have more efficient crop production
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:35.920]  and food, agricultural food production.
[2:11:35.920 --> 2:11:38.920]  You have more efficient of reforestation
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:40.920]  and ecological diversity.
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:42.920]  When you have all these rainforests of the world
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:44.920]  that produce natural medicines
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:46.920]  and molecules of interest to scientists
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:49.920]  for natural cures and medical research,
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:52.920]  that's only possible because of carbon dioxide.
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:55.920]  And it's fossil fuels that release the carbon dioxide
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  that has been sequestered under the ground.
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.920]  So, in effect, this is absolutely true
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:02.920]  to say that burning fossil fuels
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:05.920]  provides nutrients for plants.
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:07.920]  It's absolutely true.
[2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  You'd have to be completely ignorant of science
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  to understand that.
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.920]  Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide.
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:17.920]  Photosynthesis is the metabolic energy of all plant life
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:20.920]  as we know it on this planet.
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:24.920]  Food crops, rain forests, even marine ecosystems,
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:27.920]  the seagrass and the sea algae,
[2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:30.920]  and microorganisms in the ocean
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:33.920]  are all dependent on sunlight
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:35.920]  in order to engage in photosynthesis,
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:37.920]  and they produce oxygen.
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:39.920]  The plants produce oxygen as a byproduct,
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:41.920]  the oxygen that you and I breathe.
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:42.920]  So, think about this.
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:44.920]  We burn fossil fuels.
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:46.920]  It releases CO2 into the atmosphere,
[2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:48.920]  which makes plants thrive.
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:50.920]  More plants can grow more food more quickly
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:52.920]  and release more oxygen.
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  It raises the level of oxygen in the atmosphere
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:56.920]  to support human life.
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:12:59.920]  No wonder the globalists hate fossil fuels.
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:01.920]  They don't want to release the carbon.
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:03.920]  They want to keep it trapped underground.
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:05.920]  They don't want food crops to grow.
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:08.920]  They don't want independence in third-world countries.
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:11.920]  They want countries to be trapped in poverty.
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:13.920]  They don't want higher levels of oxygen in the atmosphere.
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:16.920]  They don't want humans even to be able to breathe.
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:19.920]  This is why they're rolling out the global dimming experiments
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:23.920]  to pollute the atmosphere, to shut down photosynthesis.
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:25.920]  This is why they're doing it.
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:27.920]  The Green New Deal.
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:29.920]  If the socialists manage to push this,
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:31.920]  it will collapse plant life.
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:33.920]  It will collapse food production.
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.920]  It will lower oxygen in the atmosphere.
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:37.920]  It will destroy the U.S. economy.
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:40.920]  It will lead to mass starvation, disease, and destitution,
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:43.920]  which is exactly what Democrats want,
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:46.920]  because those are the kind of countries they like to rule over.
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  Look at North Korea.
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:50.920]  Look at Mexico.
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  Look at Cuba.
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:54.920]  Left-wing fascist, socialist, communist despots.
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:56.920]  What kind of countries do they like to rule over?
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:58.920]  Countries where you have impoverished masses.
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:01.920]  People who are disarmed and starving to death
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:03.920]  and have no money left
[2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:05.920]  because it's all been wiped out by inflation.
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:07.920]  Look at Venezuela today.
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:09.920]  Everybody turned in their guns many years ago,
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:11.920]  and now they can't fight back.
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:14.920]  This is the Democrat plan to thrust you into poverty,
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:16.920]  throw you into starvation,
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:18.920]  cause mass disease and destitution
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:20.920]  and dependence on big government,
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:23.920]  all while expanding the size of government
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:26.920]  to an extent that we've never seen in human history.
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:30.920]  This green new deal from Ocasio-Cortez,
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:31.920]  this is the plan.
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:34.920]  This is the suicide pact for America.
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  It would shut off fossil fuels.
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:39.920]  It would shut off the economic opportunities that those create.
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:42.920]  It would destroy farming, destroy agriculture.
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:44.920]  The food supply would collapse.
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:48.920]  It would destroy the economy as we know it today.
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:50.920]  No wonder Democrats love this plan.
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:53.920]  No wonder that they are rooting for it.
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:55.920]  It would bankrupt the economy,
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:14:57.920]  and it would guarantee government jobs for everyone, by the way.
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:14:58.920]  Oh, really?
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:00.920]  Just what we need.
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:02.920]  Half the country working for the government.
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:03.920]  Doing what?
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:07.920]  Oh, fudging more climate change science studies
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:09.920]  that are rooted in total nonsense.
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:12.920]  I mean, what jobs would they even give people?
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:15.920]  Do we need bigger government in this country?
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:18.920]  Do we need to collapse the fuel economy?
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:21.920]  Do we need fossil fuels gone to the point
[2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:24.920]  where no one can run agriculture anymore?
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:26.920]  That's what Democrats want.
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:30.920]  It's just to give you an idea of how dangerous these socialists really are.
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:33.920]  Their ideas are the worst ideas in the world.
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:35.920]  They are the dumbest people in the world.
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:37.920]  They are dangerous to this country,
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:40.920]  and they hate America and want to overrun our borders,
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:43.920]  collapse everything that's working today.
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:45.920]  They are destroyers of worlds,
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  and they want to destroy the United States of America next.
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:52.920]  Infowars is one of the very few outlets telling the truth about this.

[2:20:21.920 --> 2:20:27.320]  You know, Trump signed the Farm Bill into law, it takes effect January 1st.
[2:20:27.320 --> 2:20:33.520]  And hemp, industrial hemp, has been legalized from a federal level all across America.
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:34.520]  This is a huge victory.
[2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:43.640]  This is the ending of the prohibition of growing cannabis in the form of low THC hemp.
[2:20:43.640 --> 2:20:47.800]  By the way, thanks for joining me, Mike Adams here, filling in for Alex Jones on this third
[2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:48.800]  hour today.
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:53.680]  I'm going to give you some details about this hemp legalization move and why it is such
[2:20:53.680 --> 2:20:55.000]  a huge deal.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:21:00.200]  But let me preface it by saying, first of all, I believe it is wrong for any government
[2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:04.680]  to claim that a natural plant like that is illegal in the first place.
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:11.200]  So as much as we celebrate the ending of prohibition, we should all be condemning the prohibition
[2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:14.800]  that has been in place for decades.
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:18.680]  How does a government have the right to criminalize a plant that grows like a weed?
[2:21:18.680 --> 2:21:24.720]  It literally is a weed in farms all across America, it grows on its own.
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:30.200]  And by the way, the nutrients, the molecules that it produces, the cannabinoids are not
[2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:36.920]  only compatible with human physiology, they are molecules that your body creates itself
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:37.920]  to some extent.
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:42.920]  Did you know that if you eat omega-3 fatty acids, which are the healthy oils from fish
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:49.160]  oils or chia seeds or flax seeds and so on, your body actually generates a certain amount
[2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:51.800]  of cannabidiol itself.
[2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:56.680]  So your body makes this chemical, and yet the government has criminalized a plant that
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:21:58.920]  also makes it out in the wild.
[2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:00.680]  See, that's wrong to begin with.
[2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:06.880]  So yeah, we celebrate the decriminalization or the ending of prohibition of this plant
[2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:09.000]  for agricultural use.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:17.400]  But we have to remember, we are still suffering as food slaves under a tyrannical big government
[2:22:17.400 --> 2:22:20.440]  regime that never should have had that power in the first place.
[2:22:20.440 --> 2:22:22.160]  So always keep that in mind.
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:26.160]  The DEA is unconstitutional, the FDA is unconstitutional.
[2:22:26.160 --> 2:22:29.960]  All these government agencies are unconstitutional, they have way too much power.
[2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:32.920]  They need all the power and needs to be stripped from them.
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:36.440]  How can they write their own law without it being approved by Congress?
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:37.940]  That's the problem.
[2:22:37.940 --> 2:22:43.680]  And that needs to be corrected, by the way, I mean, from ATF to the CDC, you name it.
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:49.240]  These government regulatory agencies, EPA, the Environmental Pollution Agency, they
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:51.040]  have way too much power.
[2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:57.200]  But getting to the specifics of the hemp legalization, Farm Bill Law was pushed by Senator
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:02.400]  Mitch McConnell, which is interesting given that he's the senator of Kentucky, I believe,
[2:23:02.400 --> 2:23:07.000]  and Kentucky happens to be a place to grow a lot of cannabis, doesn't it?
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:13.880]  I mean, that whole region grew hemp for, you know, hundreds of years before it was outlawed
[2:23:13.880 --> 2:23:16.120]  and it can grow it again.
[2:23:16.120 --> 2:23:19.280]  So he's also up for reelection in 2020.
[2:23:19.280 --> 2:23:25.040]  So he did this, I believe, as a political move to help get votes so that he can stay
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:29.480]  in the Senate and, you know, to get the people at home to vote for him because now they could
[2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:31.240]  grow industrial hemp.
[2:23:31.240 --> 2:23:36.040]  But here's what the law actually says, and here's what you need to know.
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:39.600]  You can't just grow hemp anywhere in the country.
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:43.060]  You have to still be licensed by the USDA now.
[2:23:43.060 --> 2:23:47.760]  So they've taken industrial hemp, which by the way, let me back up, industrial hemp
[2:23:47.760 --> 2:23:48.760]  is cannabis.
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:51.520]  It's just cannabis with a low THC level.
[2:23:51.520 --> 2:23:55.320]  The federal government defines that as less than 0.3 percent THC.
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:24:01.720]  So you can have high CBD, which is non-psychoactive and low THC.
[2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:04.640]  That's defined as hemp, even though it's still cannabis.
[2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:08.360]  It's just a different variety of cannabis that has a different chemical composition.
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:10.800]  But you can't just go out and start growing it everywhere.
[2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:14.760]  The government still wants to license it, but the licensing has been moved away from
[2:24:14.760 --> 2:24:18.800]  the DEA and it's now under the USDA.
[2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:22.640]  So it's an agricultural crop starting January 1st.
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:27.220]  Importantly, it also means that farmers can grow this industrial hemp and they can get
[2:24:27.220 --> 2:24:32.060]  crop insurance because it's treated as a normal crop, just like growing soybeans or corn
[2:24:32.060 --> 2:24:33.800]  or wheat.
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:39.080]  Importantly, you don't have to spray hemp with glyphosate, by the way, so it will be
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:41.480]  glyphosate free.
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:46.800]  Whatever you get out of that crop, hemp seeds, hemp oils, the hemp extracts, hemp fiber,
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:50.400]  it will all be glyphosate free because you don't spray it.
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:53.680]  You would kill it if you sprayed it with glyphosate.
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:25:00.880]  Also importantly, the FDA still asserts that it has the right to criminalize CBD that comes
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:04.920]  from this hemp even if you grow it in a way that's licensed by the USDA.
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:07.920]  Now, I'm going to repeat that because this could be confusing.
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:11.640]  I know CBD is a very popular product and it should be.
[2:25:11.640 --> 2:25:14.560]  CBD is, it's amazing.
[2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:20.840]  In the things that it helps your body do, CBD is, it's truly a miracle molecule if there
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:22.400]  ever was one.
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:27.840]  It has so many uses throughout your body and people who take CBD supplements report extraordinary
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:28.840]  effects.
[2:25:28.840 --> 2:25:31.680]  The thing is, the FDA doesn't like that to exist.
[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:34.680]  So the FDA has invoked a rule.
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:38.720]  And listen to this for a second because it's so insane, you won't even believe this.
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:46.200]  The FDA says that CBD is illegal to sell as a supplement because there's a small pharmaceutical
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:51.760]  company somewhere that's studying CBD for possible approval as a prescription drug at
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:53.880]  some future date.
[2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:57.920]  And that, according to the FDA, makes CBD supplements illegal.
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:02.680]  Now, I almost got to say that again, because you hear that and you're going, what?
[2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:04.160]  What are you talking about?
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:05.160]  Yeah.
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:09.840]  The FDA says that even if there's a natural molecule, if there's some drug company studying
[2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:15.400]  that molecule for a possible prescription drug in the future, that that molecule becomes
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:20.160]  illegal even if it's existed throughout all of human history.
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:25.480]  In other words, by the same logic, the FDA could say, well, vitamin C is now illegal
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:30.480]  because there's some drug company that's studying vitamin C as a drug, like an anti-cancer
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:35.520]  drug or something because vitamin C does so many amazing things in your body as well.
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:37.380]  This is the FDA's logic.
[2:26:37.380 --> 2:26:39.920]  This has never been approved by Congress.
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:42.000]  This is not approved by the Trump administration.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:47.840]  This insanity by the FDA, but the FDA is asserting this under its own rule saying that it can
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:53.960]  block the sales of CBD supplements, that it can criminalize them, that it can attack and
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:27:01.040]  shut down companies that advertise CBD supplements, and that's why companies that are selling
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:06.640]  CBD products are now switching to saying that they are hemp extracts.
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:08.160]  They don't advertise the CBD.
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:15.480]  They are naturally high levels of CBD and other cannabinoids.
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:18.800]  That's simply part of what the plant is.
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:22.600]  That's the language that you're seeing now in the supplements market to try to evade
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:26.200]  or avoid the FDA insanity.
[2:27:26.200 --> 2:27:33.680]  Now, hopefully, hopefully, this new farm bill law signed by Trump will allow more industrial
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.640]  hemp to be grown nationwide, and it will become so popular that the FDA will have to
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:45.480]  back off of its position and eventually allow CBD supplements to be advertised as CBD supplements.
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:47.720]  This comes back to the big government issue.
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:50.120]  Why does the FDA have this power?
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:55.520]  Why can the FDA criminalize a molecule that your body makes and that is found out in the
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:56.520]  wild?
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:06.000]  Why does the FDA have this dictatorial power to destroy your life and your company just
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:12.680]  because you are using a molecule that, frankly, God blessed us with all across this planet?
[2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:17.720]  This molecule is like medicine from heaven, and it's supposed to be free.
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:20.160]  It's supposed to grow everywhere like weeds.
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:24.800]  It's supposed to be so common, so commonplace that everybody could just go out in their
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:28.360]  backyard and have some natural medicine.
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:32.680]  That's what cannabis is supposed to be, but the government doesn't want you to be able
[2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:39.320]  to take advantage of that medicine because they want you to buy pharmaceuticals and chemotherapy.
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:44.360]  They want you to be licensed and controlled and silenced so that you don't tell the truth
[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:47.840]  about natural medicine that grows everywhere across the country.
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:51.400]  There's the truth about cannabis that you won't hear from the left wing media.
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:29:21.240]  Much more straight ahead, Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:51.080]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:29:51.080 --> 2:30:19.800]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:49.640]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:30:49.640 --> 2:31:18.480]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:48.320]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:31:48.320 --> 2:32:18.160]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:48.000]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:33:01.840]  I'm Mike Adams and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:25.120]  Alright, one of the best New Year's gifts you can give yourself is to manufacture your
[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:31.240]  own legal firearm at home and that's one of the things that I did over the Christmas holiday.
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:37.360]  You can see here there's a lower that is, the reason it's shiny in the center there
[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:41.600]  might be slightly out of focus is because it was drilled out.
[2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:47.160]  It was, I used a ghost gunner and I built this myself and of course it's perfectly
[2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:49.080]  legal to do so.
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:54.120]  My disclaimer for this entire segment is I always encourage you to follow the laws.
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:57.720]  Don't want you to do anything illegal or get yourself in trouble that way.
[2:33:57.720 --> 2:34:01.960]  But I live in Texas and under federal law and Texas law it is legal to manufacture your
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:09.080]  own firearms and so I purchased a ghost gunner from Defense Distributed and it works perfectly
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:10.080]  fine.
[2:34:10.080 --> 2:34:13.720]  You might even be wondering like how does it work on this because this isn't the bare
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:20.880]  aluminum well it turns out you can just kind of dremel away six contact areas on this lower
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:28.120]  and that's where the router bit touches this for conductivity and if you sort of dremel
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:34.600]  away the coating on those six areas then it'll absolutely work even if you've got different
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:39.120]  kinds of coatings on it such as serocote or whatever you're using.
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:43.800]  So this is the segment, this is what's important.
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:50.680]  We are entering a realm now where Democrats are trying to push these red flag gun laws
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:56.960]  where they say that anybody who is reported secretly to a judge can be raided and have
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:01.160]  their firearms confiscated without any due process, no rule of law, nothing.
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:03.400]  You have no right to defend yourself.
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:05.960]  You have no right to argue in your defense.
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:09.920]  You have no right to even present evidence in your defense.
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:10.920]  You have no rights at all.
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:16.040]  This is a total violation of the Second Amendment but just as importantly what Democrats believe
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:22.040]  qualifies you for a red flag gun law is simply wanting to own a firearm.
[2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:27.000]  So according to the definition of the Democrats wanting to own a firearm makes you crazy or
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  makes you dangerous and that's enough to have your guns confiscated.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:33.280]  You see the catch 22 here it's all it's a catch 22.
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:37.760]  It's like if you want to own guns you shouldn't be allowed to own guns.
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:41.040]  The only people that should be allowed to own guns are people who don't want guns because
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:43.600]  they're the only sane people according to Democrats.
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:45.920]  It's kind of like the way they censor conservative speech.
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:50.880]  They say well all conservative speech is hate speech and we have to make our communities
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:53.400]  safe places against hate speech.
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:55.600]  That's the Zuckerberg talk right there.
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:35:58.320]  Have to be safe spaces against hate speech.
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:35:59.800]  Well what is hate speech?
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:02.520]  Well hate speech is anything that we disagree with.
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:05.080]  Hate speech is anything that a conservative says.
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:08.520]  Hate speech is anything that a Trump supporter might utter.
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:12.320]  Hate speech is speech that says that people should make their own guns.
[2:36:12.320 --> 2:36:14.640]  That's hate speech according to the left.
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:19.480]  But I'm here to tell you that manufacturing your own firearm is a great American tradition
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:24.320]  and it is currently legal under most states but I always encourage you to check your state
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:31.040]  laws because I believe in New Jersey and perhaps elsewhere it is now illegal to own a ghost
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:32.720]  gunner machine.
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:35.400]  Now a ghost gunner is not a 3D printer.
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:36.520]  These are not 3D printed.
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:42.720]  These are milled out aluminum blocks and a ghost gunner is a milling machine, a CNC
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:43.720]  milling machine.
[2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:44.720]  It removes material.
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:51.000]  The 3D printers add material and by the way if you ever tried to 3D print an AR-15 lower
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:54.400]  and fire it, it would explode in your face probably.
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:58.920]  So don't try that because the materials aren't strong enough to handle that.
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:01.680]  So you mill it out with aluminum.
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:07.960]  And then you of course add the upper with the barrel and the bolt carrier group and
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:14.200]  the charging handle and you finish the rifle, the buffer spring, all that stuff.
[2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:17.640]  And then you go out and test it, make sure it's working well.
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:22.000]  Now a lot of people wonder do you have to put a serial number on that firearm?
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:27.720]  Opinion varies and I'm not a lawyer so again follow and research your local laws but I've
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:33.080]  researched local laws in Texas and federal laws and it is my opinion after that research
[2:37:33.080 --> 2:37:38.600]  that there is no current federal or state requirement in my area to put a serial number
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:41.360]  on a self-manufactured firearm.
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:47.320]  But if you sell it to somebody or you give it to somebody according to the law, yes it
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:49.880]  has to be serialized at that time.
[2:37:49.880 --> 2:37:51.200]  Why does this matter?
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:58.560]  Well if you don't serialize a firearm then if you manufacture more than one it's hard
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:03.680]  for government confiscation tyrants to know how many you have.
[2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:08.400]  If you're making your own firearms and you serialize them and you have one through ten
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:13.760]  and they find a gun that is number ten, they're going to ask you where are the other nine?
[2:38:13.760 --> 2:38:18.800]  So I say as long as it's legal, don't serialize them.
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:24.440]  Why put on your gun a quantity number of how many you own or if you want to serialize it
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.400]  make up some big long number, one million six hundred twenty nine thousand seven hundred
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:29.400]  and forty two.
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:31.120]  There you go, that's the serial number.
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:36.800]  Let them deal with that, let them ask really you have another one million guns that you
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:37.800]  made?
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:43.080]  Yeah, sure in this closet, they're right there, all million of them because the gun confiscation
[2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:47.040]  tyrants are so stupid they don't even know what numbers mean.
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:52.680]  But the point is when gun confiscation kicks in and believe me the democrats are going
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:57.420]  to push for it, they're going to have more shootings, make no mistake there are more
[2:38:57.420 --> 2:39:01.960]  shootings being planned right now for the purpose of calling for gun confiscation just
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:07.080]  like Operation Fast and Furious under Barack Obama and Eric Holder.
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:12.280]  That was a false flag operation to try to ban guns by letting guns get into the hands
[2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:15.680]  of violent drug dealers and Mexican drug cartels.
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:20.400]  That was the whole plan and isn't it amazing that Eric Holder has never been charged for
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:24.600]  gun running and that Barack Obama has never been charged for that anyway, that happened
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:32.360]  that's true but when they come to confiscate your guns they're going to go by the records.
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:37.080]  So if you purchase the firearm and you went through the FBI background NICS system the
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:41.440]  background check system there is a federal record of your purchase.
[2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:44.560]  Those records will be used to confiscate your guns.
[2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:48.360]  This is what happened in Venezuela the people were told by the government there hey there's
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:53.360]  too much crime and violence in society we need to have a peaceful society everybody
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:56.880]  should give up their guns and the Venezuelan people said yeah that sounds like an awesome
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:39:59.320]  idea let's give up our guns.
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:03.880]  So they give up all their guns and the government for those who didn't give them up the government
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:09.440]  just went door to door based on the records they had and they took the guns and they confiscated
[2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:13.280]  hundreds of thousands of weapons and they arrested thousands of people.
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:17.440]  And then Venezuela had no guns in the hands of citizens but all the guns in the hands
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:23.800]  of the government shortly after that the government decided to declare war on the citizens.
[2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:27.000]  The government said oh we're going to steal all your money we're going to hyperinflate
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.440]  the currency we're going to make it a crime to criticize the government we're going to
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:36.320]  arrest you and basically assassinate you if you criticize the regime and you don't have
[2:40:36.320 --> 2:40:38.640]  any guns to defend yourself with.
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:44.360]  So the Venezuelan people are now starving to death and the women are selling their bodies
[2:40:44.360 --> 2:40:50.320]  for you know meals and people are desperate people are eating zoo animals and their neighbors
[2:40:50.320 --> 2:40:55.240]  pets if any are even remaining at this point they're dumpster diving for food the government
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:41:01.000]  is a dictatorial tyrannical regime and the citizens have no way to defend themselves
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:05.840]  because they gave up their guns they allow the government to confiscate the guns and
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:09.840]  the government was able to do that efficiently because they had the records of who owned
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:15.240]  the firearms this is why you need to have and I say this again with the disclaimer always
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:23.320]  follow your local but you need to have in my opinion at least one firearm that the government
[2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:28.280]  doesn't have a record of through and again you need to accomplish through a legal means
[2:41:28.280 --> 2:41:32.960]  such as we're legal manufacturing your own firearm and it's absolutely important to
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:33.960]  do this.
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:38.880]  You can also have a concealed carry permit in many states you do you go purchase a firearm
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:43.720]  and it doesn't check with the FBI for that firearm there's only a record on a piece
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:51.160]  of paper at your firearms dealer and that is a relatively good situation compared to
[2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:54.680]  having a federal database of your farms.
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:42:01.840]  So government even a government that today is let's say friendly to you may not be friendly
[2:42:01.840 --> 2:42:09.640]  in the future that government may be taken over by a dictator a socialist a fascist at
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:15.000]  some point in the future and if that happens your life may be threatened by that tutorial
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  regime you and other Americans need to have the ability to defend yourself against tyranny
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:27.760]  that is the entire point of the second amendment that's why the founding fathers wrote that
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.640]  into the Bill of Rights so that you could have that right you could have that power
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:38.120]  and if you're not exercising that power to manufacture your own firearms where legal
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:43.880]  then you may be subjected to exactly the same kind of tyranny that is currently destroying
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:44.880]  Venezuela.
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:50.600]  Those are my thoughts on firearms stay with me we'll be back after this break with much
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:58.840]  more the globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:05.200]  above the law if there's any opposition if there's any independent media they can call
[2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:10.760]  the fact that the emperor has no clothes they can call BS it's game over but if you look
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:15.000]  at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:20.840]  Hannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted there's only
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:26.160]  two groups in the U.S. Info Wars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that are truly
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:30.680]  independent and of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world it
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:36.040]  really is amazing that's why as we close out 2018 I want to just remind the listeners of
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:39.600]  the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together just remind you that you

[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:32.760]  immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it and that's why they're
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:39.400]  trying to eradicate you but regardless this fight is intensifying 2018 has been insane
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:45.080]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right

[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:02.240]  view together here i want to invite you to start observing the events that are happening in the
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:09.200]  world around you and looking at them now from the perspective of the war against humanity
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:15.920]  because i believe that as you start really having this overlay this perspective on
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:23.200]  on events that are unfolding the narratives of cnn the attacks on trump the mass poisoning
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:29.120]  of the food supply the the pushing of toxic chemotherapy treatments for people i think
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:34.560]  you'll come to understand that these all have something in common and that is the desire
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:41.360]  to exterminate humanity that's that's really what it is i mean you think look at every action like
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:49.120]  governor jerry brown recently just pardoning violent criminal felons i mean murderers in
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:56.080]  california are being pardoned now so that they won't be deported well why is the governor of
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:49:02.560]  california pardoning violent murderers well because it's all about spreading violence
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:10.320]  to attack good people it's about committing violence against humanity it's a small little piece of a
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:20.400]  much bigger puzzle that's all about how to destroy human lives how to create disease and and desperation
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:26.800]  among the population and everything that you see you start to have a question mark about it
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:32.480]  it's a lot of times you'll see it's a weapon like cancer treatments are a weapon cancer treatments
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:37.920]  cause cancer you know the fluoride in the water supply is a weapon that's scientifically validated
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:45.360]  to lower iqs in children adults and senior citizens the pesticides are a weapon system
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:50.160]  against humanity herbicides cancer causing chemicals these are weapon systems against
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:57.360]  humanity and even gun confiscation is a way to take away your ability to defend yourself the
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:05.760]  illegal invasion of america through the borders this is a way to overthrow first world nations
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:13.600]  and destroy societies that are leading humanity into a brighter future it's all attacks on humanity
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:22.480]  and so i have to say this mass poisoning of the human race it has been underway for a long time
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:28.320]  many years and it is accelerating now and the only way to stop this is to stop the globalists
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:36.880]  i have to emphasize this if we don't successfully stop the globalists then we are going to become
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:46.320]  extinct as a race our time on this planet is looking to be very limited you and i may be
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:52.080]  witnesses to the last chapter of human history at least structured in the way that we understand
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:59.680]  civilization today because the attacks on humanity are proceeding and all of these screaming
[2:50:59.680 --> 2:51:05.280]  babbling leftists who are attacking trump and attacking america what are they in favor of
[2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:10.400]  they're in favor of abortion they're in favor of pushing vaccines and maiming children they're
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:17.200]  in favor of the toxic gmo crops they're they're in favor of polluting the atmosphere they call it
[2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:23.040]  uh what is it stratospheric aerosol injections it's it's terraforming they want to block out
[2:51:23.040 --> 2:51:29.040]  the sun they want to poison the planet they want more air pollution this is their goal
[2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:36.880]  everything that they do is about destroying society it's about destroying human babies
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:42.160]  it's about destroying fertility it's about destroying the very definition of a man and a woman
[2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:49.360]  it's about creating a society where there is no more there are no families there's no sexual
[2:51:49.360 --> 2:51:54.400]  reproduction there are no there's no future for any children or the children of those children
[2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:58.640]  that's if you if you start to look around the world and see it from that point of view you
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:04.480]  will understand what's happening and when when cnn reports oh it's horrible that the troops love
[2:52:04.480 --> 2:52:13.840]  trump why why is cnn doing that because it's an attack on the the security of our nation
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:18.560]  they don't want america to have a military that loves its president they don't want america to
[2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:22.960]  have a border they don't want america to exist at all they are literally trying to destroy this
[2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:28.080]  country and think about the incredible evil of the people that go along with this the so-called
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:33.600]  journalists who are just fake journalists think about the propagandists think about i mean just
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:39.840]  think about the fact that as i'm here with you today for two hours i haven't used a teleprompter
[2:52:39.840 --> 2:52:44.320]  for one second you know i've got some articles printed out i've got a few notes here but i've
[2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:51.360]  delivered this entire show without any teleprompters there isn't a person in the left-wing media who
[2:52:51.360 --> 2:52:57.440]  could even do an hour show without a teleprompter because they're so brain dead they cannot even
[2:52:57.440 --> 2:53:02.560]  tell the difference between facts and fiction they're no longer even journalists they are just
[2:53:02.560 --> 2:53:08.720]  biological puppets they're just talking heads reading scripts and taking drugs and pushing
[2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:15.360]  pharmaceuticals that's all they do they're barely human anymore they are automatons they're biological
[2:53:15.360 --> 2:53:22.240]  robots they do what they're told but that's not the future that you and i want for humanity
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:29.440]  we are not here to just obey and do what we're told we're here to innovate we are here to help
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:35.760]  make humanity better than it is today we're here to create a brighter future for our children to
[2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:42.960]  keep humanity alive to reach for the stars and to expand our knowledge understanding and awareness
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:49.040]  of the world around us and how it works because we are students of cause and effect we are students
[2:53:49.040 --> 2:53:57.440]  of reality and that makes us enemies of the delusion weavers who are trying to control and
[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:03.840]  suppress human consciousness and human minds and they can only do that through deception they can
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:09.120]  only do that by distracting you from reality by taking away your ability to think for yourself
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:16.640]  or to observe reality or to say that one plus one equals two if you can reason if you can engage
[2:54:16.640 --> 2:54:22.640]  in rationality you are the enemy of the establishment the establishment has no use for anyone who can
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:28.160]  think for themselves and as i mentioned earlier the most offensive thing in the world to a globalist
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:34.000]  is a healthy human baby being born alive they can't stand that they want all those babies
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:39.600]  murdered before they're born but the next most offensive thing is a baby that grows up with
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:47.760]  healthy nutrition good parenting a family unit maybe homeschooling or a good school a private
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:54.720]  school maybe some interaction with the christian faith and some teaching of morality and ethics
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:55:01.600]  combined with intelligence and discovery where that child grows up and becomes a free thinking
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:08.080]  adult and that is a huge threat to the globalist a free thinking adult is the second most offensive
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:14.480]  thing to the globalist and it takes courage to be a free thinking adult it takes courage
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:20.960]  to share this video to share this information it takes courage to do what you do and to do what i do
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  but while most people want to be comfortable you and i we want to be effective we want to
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:37.600]  help humanity move forward we don't want humanity trapped and enslaved in this mental cage this
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:46.960]  prison system of dis info and fairy tales and and lgbtp propaganda and indoctrination that is a trap
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:53.920]  for humanity that's mental slavery we don't settle for that that's why we do what we do that's why you

[2:57:55.520 --> 2:58:01.440]  that the emperor has no close they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:06.240]  like michael savage and russia lembaugh and tucker carlson and sean hannity they are all beholded
[2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:13.200]  to the networks they're on they can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and

[3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:01.920]  alex jones supporting the movement which is extremely important to do we are in the fight
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:08.320]  of our lives i gotta tell you that uh of course this year 2018 we saw massive amounts of censorship
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:18.240]  we've seen uh the tyranny the tyrannical oppressive nature of the democratic socialist left against
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:24.480]  the uh conservatives against the truth tellers we've seen so much take place over the course of
[3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:30.720]  over the last 12 months it's really 12 years worth of headlines over the last 12 months
[3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:36.640]  one thing i want to touch on before we get too far into things uh you you want to talk about
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:42.000]  fake news we had seen i want to bring this up because one of the issues is about the iraq war
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:47.840]  um or the iraq the president's in iraq the president's in afghanistan the the trip uh
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:54.240]  by president trump to iraq the leftist socialist leftists especially on twitter just having this
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:02:01.520]  massive meltdown uh saying that essentially saying that they shamed twitter shamed president
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:08.960]  donald trump into traveling to overseas to a war zone to visit the troops now have you heard this
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:15.120]  folks have you heard this it was because of the tweets it was because of the shaming that uh
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:24.480]  was done right well obviously obviously folks any thinking rational sensible human being and dan
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:31.120]  john benjana pointed this out earlier would know that the presidential excursions like this have
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:39.040]  to be planned months in advance months in advance the uh support teams or the uh the advance teams
[3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:46.240]  that go out to carry the president uh the presidential security detail so this was not
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:52.720]  gee i shamed him he's leaving he's he's suddenly going to go overseas now because we've successfully
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:59.280]  shamed him into into going overseas so what a load of crap that's taking place so i want to call
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:04.400]  out these these morons out there in the news and i mean you got to be a moron to believe
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:10.320]  that you actually had the power into shaming the president of the united states to go out
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:21.360]  and to even more moronic is to believe what is being said so with that again look at the facts
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:27.760]  and look at the fake news this of course it might seem obvious to you who if you're tuning
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:32.880]  tuning into this fourth hour into the info wars might seem obvious to you that hey this
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:38.960]  does make sense but media the hollywood the hollywood crowd the activists on twitter they
[3:03:38.960 --> 3:03:42.720]  claim that they claim that they're shaming them well well these presidential trips as i said are
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:50.480]  planned a long time in advance in any rational sensible human being human being with firing
[3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:55.520]  synapses should know this show i'm gonna bring you on i know that we have to uh talk about other
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:01.520]  aspects of of the iraq war and help me out with a help me out with my mouth here go ahead i want to
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:06.320]  say it's good to good to hear you talk and halfway normal again folks as he said he had
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:11.520]  world surgery done and over the holidays and before the holidays we really couldn't talk he
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:16.720]  couldn't talk so sign language a lot of gesturing and whatnot so this is the first actual day that
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:22.080]  i've had a chance to speak with him since that surgery so it's good to see you back up and running
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:26.320]  yeah and uh but there's a whole lot going on definitely want to get into what is going on
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:32.720]  with iraq the people are taking issue with an unannounced visit by the president you know
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:37.280]  stating that they never reached out he never reached out to them but we're gonna talk about
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:41.280]  that and we got some other stuff fake news we get some stuff on christmas the war on christmas
[3:04:41.280 --> 3:04:46.800]  and also on the robert muller investigation we have and this is info wars from your right back

[3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:09.840]  and christianity coming back from the dead and and recognizing it's being persecuted that's all
[3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:14.960]  because you are the core listening to info wars around the world the eyes and ears of liberty
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:22.560]  that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming everybody knows
[3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:28.640]  who studies this that it's christians real christians who tend to be immune to the globalist
[3:05:28.640 --> 3:05:32.720]  brainwashing and and who tend to see it and that's why they're trying to eradicate you
[3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:40.480]  but regardless this fight is intensifying 2018 has been insane 2019 is going to be the big
[3:05:40.480 --> 3:05:46.240]  decision maker and i am so honored to be here with you right beside me not behind us but right

[3:07:30.880 --> 3:07:36.560]  maga hats for the troops who are stationed overseas you even had cnn analyst and former
[3:07:36.560 --> 3:07:41.280]  member of the obama administration john kerby warning the troops having trump having a trump
[3:07:41.280 --> 3:07:48.320]  campaign hat could be breaking military guidelines and this is just all part of their war on christmas
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:53.440]  and the war on trump we talk about the political divide in this country never before in my lifetime
[3:07:53.440 --> 3:07:59.360]  have i ever seen the divide so great and it's not just a divide along party lines if that were the
[3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:04.880]  i mean that would make it a lot different this is a divide along uh president trump and the
[3:08:04.880 --> 3:08:10.480]  constitution and american way of life traditionally versus where they want to take it with this
[3:08:10.480 --> 3:08:16.400]  progressive social communist agenda and we see that the left we see the media we see hollywood
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:21.040]  we see all this is that all these establishment powers that have come against trump that have
[3:08:21.040 --> 3:08:25.840]  come against america that have come against americans we have to understand it's not just the
[3:08:25.840 --> 3:08:31.280]  president that they that they hate the president is where their anger is focused it is the people
[3:08:31.280 --> 3:08:36.960]  who support the president it is the people who believe in his agenda in the ideology of america
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:42.080]  as it was founded and its intentions that they hate and this is not going to go away when the
[3:08:42.080 --> 3:08:47.440]  president leaves office whether in 2020 or 2024 and that's the battle that we need to be focused on
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.520]  and prepared for because as hillary clinton said just a few months ago civility will not be restored
[3:08:53.520 --> 3:08:59.680]  until their political party is in power and she only went halfway what she didn't say was that
[3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:05.440]  civility will be restored when they're back in power and their opposition is no longer a threat
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:10.320]  or a bother to them and that's the war we are fighting and they do it in every which way we
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:15.360]  talked about it here even on this show when david brock in media matters that strategy came out
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:20.240]  against the social media strategy to destroy president trump not sure exact of the exact
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:24.720]  title of that but it laid out the agenda of how they were going to go after the president how
[3:09:24.720 --> 3:09:28.880]  they were going to go after his administration how they were going to attack him through social
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:33.440]  media through the news through the hollywood through the legal system and we see it every
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:41.600]  single day and it is it doesn't they they it's no stopping i i compare it to groundhog day or a
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:45.520]  baby that doesn't get what they want they just whine and whine and whine but babies usually get
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:51.440]  tired and fall asleep these people this evil only increases and the more we give it a foothold
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:56.640]  the more it will take over and we have to fight on those front lines each and every day against it
[3:09:56.640 --> 3:10:01.360]  and however that looks for you each and every individual person is what we have to do and we
[3:10:01.360 --> 3:10:08.240]  cannot cease just like the evil will never cease we cannot stop fighting because the moment we do
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:13.760]  we are giving over to that evil and you know you're in the headlines i gotta tell you joey
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:21.360]  you you are so exactly right and let's always remember the stopgap between the fight by the
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:26.800]  globalists the globalists fighting the american people the stopgap is president trump of course
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:33.120]  he's not part of the establishment he's not part of the political process and it's funny you mentioned
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:41.040]  to the iraq thing the number of people invoking the hatch act that's nothing more than a petty
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:50.160]  so petty because obviously when obama visited the troops he signed anything he signed body
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:56.960]  parts there i mean you know people's soldiers uniforms and arms and it was crazy so for them to
[3:10:56.960 --> 3:11:03.040]  bring this up is disingenuous that's number one the other aspect of this and you hit it too
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:10.560]  this is a constant barrage in my view anything donald trump stands for it's always going to be
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:17.360]  just continued forward in other words it's there and you mentioned even a baby uh falls asleep
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:24.240]  once in a while these people don't and it's funny because last the yesterday i was taking my uh my
[3:11:24.240 --> 3:11:32.640]  rage i shouldn't say range my uh the fact that i i can't talk too well i figured okay i'll start
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:39.920]  writing and i on my twitter account at hagman pi shameless plug there by the way but not really
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:46.480]  uh philly brains and how many people know who philly brains is of course the confidant of
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:54.320]  one of the confidants of hillary clinton he uh he got into this well iraq uh president trump went
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:59.680]  to iraq uh because he was shamed into it as i mentioned earlier well when i brought when i
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:04.640]  told him to put his pants back on and get off my lawn okay uh he blocked me and you know
[3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:10.880]  no the only reason i mentioned that yeah and here's the only reason i mentioned that is is because
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:23.760]  even if uh even if we were to argue the points uh the points um the the the uh facts as they are
[3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:29.040]  they're not going to listen and that's why you said and i'll turn it back to you the
[3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:35.840]  ideological divide is so great it's just i don't you know what what and i'd toss this out i think
[3:12:35.840 --> 3:12:40.480]  we might have done this last time we were on my question to the to the people listening out there
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:46.400]  info wars uh to info wars info wars store.com by the way uh support this endeavor but my my
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:53.200]  question to you folks is this we talk about the possibility of a civil war all right how bad it
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:13:01.280]  could be my question could a could not having a civil war be worse what's worse than what could be
[3:13:01.280 --> 3:13:06.720]  worse than having a civil war perhaps not having one now i'm not wishing and believe me anyone who
[3:13:06.720 --> 3:13:13.120]  would wish a civil war on a country is it would be would be psychotic there's differences in in
[3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:18.000]  war and types of war i mean uh we're we're engaging in a battle right now it doesn't have to be a hot
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:22.560]  war with bullets and missiles that we're saying i mean it's a we're in ideological civil war right
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:28.880]  now and it's playing out um you know every each and every day in the uh in the social media realm
[3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:34.960]  and in pop culture and it is uh seemingly it seems that they're winning and it is because they have
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:38.560]  all the microphones it is because they get all the attention and most importantly it is because
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.880]  they block and censor the opposition and the points of view and to your point about you know you
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:47.920]  can't have a i remember a time when you could have a disagreement with somebody and you could have a
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:53.040]  debate and you there wasn't two sets of facts people would you know come to the understanding
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:13:57.920]  that okay maybe i'm not exactly right but what i see with this that is so dangerous is that
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:01.760]  these people think they know everything and they think they know what's best for everybody else
[3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:06.640]  and it's their way or no way at all and and if you don't agree or subscribe to their way of
[3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:11.680]  thinking you're automatically labeled an enemy you're automatically labeled with an ism you know
[3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:17.680]  racism whatever the the term is of the day trying to shame you into that role and so often we have
[3:14:17.680 --> 3:14:21.440]  seen people um you know how many times have you seen people get so defensive when they're called
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:27.440]  a racist or uh whatever the term is and that has all lost its meaning now and now we're at the point
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:32.960]  where um we can't even have a discussion you can't even agree to disagree it's all or nothing and i've
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:37.360]  seen it change people i talked about this i talk about all the time i have a friend whose mother
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:43.120]  is one of the sweetest ladies ever but she has been brainwashed by msnbc and cnn the most sane
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:46.800]  and normal person otherwise but when you start talking about politics when you start talking
[3:14:46.800 --> 3:14:51.920]  about the president it's like a switch goes off in her head and she thinks he's the most evil person
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:57.280]  to ever you know live on the face of the earth and and nothing he would do could be could be good
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:01.520]  no matter what it was even if it was something she supported and agreed with and that makes no
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:05.520]  sense to me and that shows me that there's a a much bigger component here than just politics this
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:09.840]  is a spiritual battle and this is a spiritual blindness and deception that we are fighting
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:15.680]  against and until we understand that and fight that properly we're not going to make much headway
[3:15:15.680 --> 3:15:22.320]  um especially in and uh when we're dealing with the evil that this earth has uh um you know acquiesced
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:26.960]  to and and even the church we talk about this all the time the church is conforming to the world
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:32.160]  instead of standing its ground and and uh sticking to the gospel and when that happens we are in

[3:20:26.800 --> 3:20:32.560]  27th 2018 edition uh one of the last broadcast of the year we're really running out of time in 2018
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:38.000]  2019 right around the corner and time is just flying by want to mention this real quick uh folks
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:41.920]  if you haven't checked out paul joseph watson's latest video i had a chance to listen to it this
[3:20:41.920 --> 3:20:48.480]  morning and i uh it was really good a very sad story there were a pair of murders there was a
[3:20:48.480 --> 3:20:56.000]  double murder in morocco by it done by islamists and it was an isis style execution by beheading
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:02.560]  and the state tv the state sponsored tv has been censoring uh the coverage of this murder
[3:21:02.560 --> 3:21:10.080]  and refusing to uh place a blame where it belongs on the on islam instead they are uh you know
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:15.200]  censoring it we know that they have hate speech laws over there but the insanity behind this you
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:23.920]  have the the islamic beheading of a female and two murders and you have the government and the tv
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:29.120]  doing what they can to cover up the origins and reasons behind those murders what is happening
[3:21:29.120 --> 3:21:34.480]  in europe this is a reoccurring theme and again go to check out paul joseph watson's video he did a
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:39.760]  great job as he always does in breaking down these issues uh because it's so important this is at the
[3:21:39.760 --> 3:21:44.560]  doorsteps of america too we see the transformation of our society happening in many places around the
[3:21:44.560 --> 3:21:50.000]  country uh from texas to minnesota all over the place we saw just a few weeks ago i don't know if
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:55.040]  we had a chance to talk about it here where there was a judge in minnesota or michigan i believe that
[3:21:55.040 --> 3:22:04.160]  ruled that the uh female uh there you go female general mutilation uh that it was unconstitutional
[3:22:04.160 --> 3:22:11.120]  to uh disallow uh is people of the islamic faith to do that and this is bringing sharia law into
[3:22:11.120 --> 3:22:17.760]  america and becoming sharia compliant so we are not as deep in trouble as europe is but we are
[3:22:17.760 --> 3:22:23.520]  seeing those signs on the door and how long before they decide you know other parts of sharia law
[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:29.040]  are uh should be accepted as part of you know a constitutional type uh system it doesn't make
[3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:35.040]  sense it doesn't make sense at all unless they are wanting to bring that here you know joe the
[3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:43.760]  individual responsible for expunging a lot of that uh islamic uh sharia information jihadist
[3:22:43.760 --> 3:22:49.840]  information from the from the manuals of the fbi robert miller of course and we we know that robert
[3:22:49.840 --> 3:22:56.560]  miller uh is doing nothing except continuing his investigation on president trump against
[3:22:56.560 --> 3:23:01.840]  president trump much to the much to the delight of the democratic socialist here and again it's to
[3:23:01.840 --> 3:23:08.400]  take take our constitutional republic down make no mistake about this and yes sharia and the
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:15.120]  sharia compliant which is antithetical to the constitution is is uh part of a globalist agenda
[3:23:15.120 --> 3:23:21.040]  to rip at our fabric of america but you know uh i i mentioned that real quick yeah go ahead you
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:26.240]  know between james between uh james comey and robert miller uh those two as fbi directors
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:32.720]  they have done so much damage to the fbi when um uh dealing with uh islamic terrorism and
[3:23:32.720 --> 3:23:36.960]  they have uh you know when we looked at robert miller and we hear people saying oh he went
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:41.920]  when the investigation started that he was one of the most uh upstanding you know moral people
[3:23:41.920 --> 3:23:47.920]  the the perfect guy for the job well he's got a laundry list of conflicts of interests of uh of
[3:23:47.920 --> 3:23:53.920]  shady dealings and of um questionable tactics is like what did he did with the fbi scrubbing the fbi
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:59.680]  of um of references to islamic terrorism trying to and this was james comey too and i don't
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:06.480]  understand um you know in today's world why they would do that unless they want it to fester and
[3:24:06.480 --> 3:24:10.880]  grow and they don't i mean we've seen it time and time again isis will play the responsibility
[3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:15.760]  and the the government will say no no no don't worry it's not terrorism it's domestic uh it's
[3:24:15.760 --> 3:24:20.320]  workplace violence like the fordhood shooting and that's when it really started to open my eyes
[3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:26.720]  when the fordhood shooting happened they said it was workplace violence well it makes me think too
[3:24:26.720 --> 3:24:31.600]  about miller we had of course uh folks hagman report dot com that's our website that's our
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:36.400]  home base hagman report live for our show seven to ten weeknights seven to ten p.m eastern time
[3:24:36.400 --> 3:24:44.240]  weeknights uh but we had uh john milkovich on and he's he's the author of this book uh
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:49.680]  robert biller erin boy for the new world order now i don't get paid for talking about this or
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:57.520]  we don't we don't get making any money off this book but he talks about uh the the well
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:25:03.120]  in this book is a report and he's a state senator from uh louisiana i believe 38th district from
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:08.800]  louisiana okay but he writes that there's an epic disconnect between robert miller described by the
[3:25:08.800 --> 3:25:15.680]  mass media and officialdom as model of public propriety as a model of public variety in the
[3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:21.840]  robert miller documented independent researchers a chronic collaborator with career characterized by
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:26.960]  cover-ups corruption and unconscionable conduct an ever-willing instrument of the deep state
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:33.600]  dissimulation and i'll tell you something um and again i'm not uh hawking books here but i'm telling
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:40.960]  you when you look at what miller was tasked to do he is doing it exquisitely so anyone who would
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:47.520]  ever believe in any sense of the word that miller was a white hat or is a white hat is delusional
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:52.480]  but one thing i what wasn't real quick thing uh i don't like it too far off what you were talking
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:58.800]  about uh the hill today this is so critical for people to understand because we we joey you and
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:06.400]  i were following uh the um uh prosecution of general michael flinn well in the hill today real
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:12.480]  quick uh an article by kevin brock and dan bugino mentioned that this morning on his podcast i just
[3:26:12.480 --> 3:26:16.800]  want to mention that right now there are three oddities in fbi handling of flinn interview and
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:23.280]  frankly i did not catch this um and i just want to toss this over to you uh right after this the
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:30.720]  three oddities again this is an article by kevin brock uh writing in the hill um one of the biggest
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:35.520]  issues here and i did not think of this i didn't catch this and i wonder how many people did
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:45.920]  the 302s there were two 302s that were uh done on on flinn one rather contemporaneously or right
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:52.240]  around the time of his january 2017 interview the two agents that interviewing flinn they completed
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:58.000]  a 302 and of course there was an august 302 that the fbi completed now having said that
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:06.960]  what was the basis what was the uh underlying predicate for interviewing flinn in the first
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:14.160]  place it was what kind of investigation it was a counterintelligence investigation and even the um
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:21.200]  um uh and as an aside the washington post has leaked to the washington post by the intelligence
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:29.120]  community about michael flinn the day before his um his interviewer before his interview
[3:27:29.680 --> 3:27:35.760]  or around the time of his interview i should say that there was no indication of any wrongdoing
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:46.560]  uh 302s i guess here's the bottom line in one of the oddities 302s are criminal documents in
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:54.240]  other words documents to record a statement in a criminal investigation not a counterintelligence
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:28:06.560]  investigation so what in the hell were two fbi agents doing creating a 302 on a counterintelligence
[3:28:06.560 --> 3:28:11.120]  investigation unless it was never designed to be a counterintelligence investigation
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:20.080]  and again yeah so think about that yeah think about that and uh folks uh yeah go ahead joe
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:25.680]  you can take a spot just real quick i mean we have not seen i want to see the declassified
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:30.080]  information i want to see i don't know why the documents have not been declassified i don't
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:35.280]  know why uh the president has not decided to just put everything out there you know the fbi talks
[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:39.360]  about protecting sources and methods but they have been what they were weaponized against the
[3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:43.760]  president they were weaponized against his administration and his his campaign and that
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:47.760]  information needs to come out so we understand the full scope of the criminality behind the
[3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:52.480]  obama administration and the weaponization of the intelligence agencies against president

[3:31:06.000 --> 3:31:11.600]  they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and rush
[3:31:11.600 --> 3:31:16.560]  limbaugh and tucker carlson and sean hannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on

[3:33:03.680 --> 3:33:25.840]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with doug hagman
[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:33.520]  doug and joe hagman here from the hagman report filling in for alex jones on this fourth hour
[3:33:33.520 --> 3:33:39.440]  of this thursday edition on this december 27th 2018 we were talking about robert mueller before
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:45.760]  the break here and a number of things that he has been in the news about including the most
[3:33:45.760 --> 3:33:51.120]  important which is the investigation into president trump for russian collusion which has moved well
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:56.720]  beyond any uh collusion now into you know looking at obstruction and anything they can get their
[3:33:56.720 --> 3:34:01.280]  hands on to try to undermine and destroy the president and his reputation and what he has
[3:34:01.280 --> 3:34:04.880]  been able to accomplish and that's one of the things that we have to be grateful for when we
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:12.880]  look back at 2018 and 2017 even 2016 is the fact that every intelligence agency every law enforcement
[3:34:12.880 --> 3:34:17.440]  agency federally at least seemed to be weaponized didn't seem to be it was weaponized against
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:23.360]  president trump and his administration and his campaign first and foremost and he was able to
[3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:29.040]  overcome that i'm not sure that any one man alone could do something like that i think there is much
[3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:37.120]  more at play than just politics there is a spiritual component here that must be recognized and he
[3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:44.000]  continues to have successes even in the face of all these enemies that have been piled up up against
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:49.440]  him and all these agencies that have been weaponized against him he continues to succeed and we can't
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:53.680]  no matter what is going on forget that and we have to be thankful for that because at least
[3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:58.720]  we have that just imagine what it would be like if hillary clinton was president and i i read
[3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:03.760]  something that she tweeted out uh something uh some kind of christmas message um that had a
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:07.760]  picture of her from her time in the white house almost like wishful thinking like she wishes she
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:14.080]  was back there again but robert muhler uh you dad you got into this uh a little bit but there's a
[3:35:14.080 --> 3:35:18.640]  great piece up on the hill julian he calls for muhler to be investigated for destruction of fbi
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:26.720]  evidence now you know we have seen uh what the stroke page messages just just disappear i mean
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:33.920]  no other except for hillary clinton really um in my memory no other evidence in the fbi
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:40.000]  just disappears unless there is somebody who is making it disappear and how convenient for
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:45.840]  these people uh that this evidence just goes by by by how much is robert muhler on the hook
[3:35:45.840 --> 3:35:50.320]  for this i mean he's overseeing this investigation this is his evidence this is his information
[3:35:50.320 --> 3:35:56.720]  right and uh the the inspector general too uh we have to ask what is going on with this but buck
[3:35:56.720 --> 3:36:02.640]  sexton he wrote i'm sorry john solomon wrote this opinion piece up on the hill and he talks about
[3:36:02.640 --> 3:36:07.760]  uh what rude juliani says and he says that it's time for robert muhler to be investigated and
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:12.640]  we've talked about this for a long time um can the president should the president fire robert
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:17.680]  muhler when would be a good time i thought when the attorney general switch was made that in the
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:22.080]  announcement from muhler saying that they were not going to focus on russian collusion that the
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:27.360]  mandate was going to be you know basically anything but that moving forward that was when the president
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:31.520]  should have pulled the trigger now a lot of people don't agree with me they think he should just let
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:34.880]  him stay the course since that they're never gonna find anything that would have already found it
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:40.720]  but obviously uh we see uh dissenting opinions especially even on fox news and judge napolitano
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:44.160]  i haven't really been listening to a lot of what he's been saying lately
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:49.040]  oh and one of the headlines he's been making but yeah he's saying things like you know
[3:36:49.040 --> 3:36:53.200]  trump should was it trump should resign or they're gonna indict his kids and they have
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:37:00.720]  stuff to go after him on and um it just seems like uh everything and everyone it just wants to see
[3:37:00.720 --> 3:37:06.640]  trump fail and as we said earlier the divide in this country seems to be uh along the lines of
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:11.040]  whether you like the president or you don't like the president but it is much deeper than that
[3:37:11.040 --> 3:37:17.040]  but will robert muhler will james comey will any of these people ever be held accountable in any
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:22.320]  way that is uh satisfactory to the american public out there who have been paying attention
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:29.200]  who know the crimes that have been committed by these people so that's my job i i'll just i'll
[3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:36.720]  just chime in here well i still can uh the investigation is the obstruction and if you
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:46.480]  think about this uh huber john huber uh working with um oig horowitz can't testify to an ongoing
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:54.960]  investigation uh comey for example can't testify or uh testify about or provide information about
[3:37:54.960 --> 3:38:01.680]  x y or z because why the investigation is ongoing don't want to compromise an ongoing investigation
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:07.600]  now if that was a legitimate investigation obviously i understand that but the investigation
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:15.520]  is going to keep the obstruction alive in other words uh the end game objective here
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:22.000]  is to keep the muhler investigation going until president trump is out of office and we're at
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:29.440]  what day number i think 590 uh a year six months and i think 12 days of the muhler investigation
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:38.480]  out of what 707 days of the uh like 590 days out of 707 days of the presidency
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:45.360]  so this is the tactic i believe of the muhler investigation and the intent of the muhler
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:51.760]  investigation continue forward until donald trump is either forced out of office or
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:57.040]  something else takes place and i'll tell you something uh roger stone leave well yeah and
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:02.480]  roger stone and alex had a very good piece and i would not i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everyone
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:08.960]  out there um the uh i saw it over the weekend over the holiday weekend where roger stone was
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:15.520]  talking about they're talking with alex and they're talking about um as much as i hate to say this
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:19.600]  the removal from office with prejudice and i think people understand what that means
[3:39:19.600 --> 3:39:26.160]  look um donald trump there's no chaos in in the office there's no chaos in the white house
[3:39:26.160 --> 3:39:31.040]  everything to that everything else is on the people who say that there is that's fake news
[3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:36.160]  well you know what i'll say this there's chaos to the extent that the deep state holdovers the
[3:39:36.160 --> 3:39:41.760]  the obama loyalists the the communist progressives uh to the the extent that they create there's not
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:46.320]  chaos being created by president trump there's chaos being uh being created by the people who
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:52.320]  refuse to allow his agenda to be implemented and we know when we read it uh in in uh i believe it
[3:39:52.320 --> 3:39:58.320]  was uh one of the books when we were in dc when uh the confirmation hearings for um oh my goodness
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:03.760]  the supreme court kavanaugh was going out and the book came out uh by woodward and they talked
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:08.560]  about that the and they said how uh the so many of the workers in the white house uh you know
[3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:12.800]  refused to submit paperwork would hide things so the president didn't see i mean things like that
[3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:17.440]  that's the only chaos that i really see the turnover as far as the personnel does not bother me
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:22.000]  because you can uh have a position and fill with 10 different people but until you get that right
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:25.920]  person in there you you have to get the right person in there you can have that turnover as
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:29.840]  long as you're getting the right people in there so i don't see that as chaos but everything that
[3:40:29.840 --> 3:40:33.600]  the president i mean just look as i mentioned earlier the coverage about the president not
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:38.160]  only going to iraq but cnn they're saying trump is the grinch who stole christmas from the troops
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:45.120]  in iraq cnn does his best to uh dump on trump uh troops trip and then it goes on from there on
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:50.640]  newsbusters i'm just reading headlines here cbs nbc slam trumps visit to troops in iraq uh took
[3:40:50.640 --> 3:40:55.360]  him long enough so some say you know he he didn't go there quick enough others say he should never
[3:40:55.360 --> 3:41:00.320]  be there in the first place how dare he sign maga hats and give him yeah how dare he sign
[3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:04.400]  maga hats and give it to the troops i mean he's the grinch who sold christmas according to the
[3:41:04.400 --> 3:41:09.920]  troops in iraq according to cnn i mean but the troops love him from everything i can see why
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:14.400]  don't they let the troops speak for them cells instead of uh you know always trying to put words
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:19.760]  and feelings in other people's mouths it's just it really is uh irritating and what is the media
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:23.920]  going to do once whenever trump is out of office i mean what are they going to focus on what what
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:28.320]  is their obsession going to be because that's all they can talk about right now and it it it
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:32.800]  forces it puts us in a position where we seem to always be not defending him but you know trying
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:37.280]  to just put the facts out there to say what's right but there's so much more we could be focusing
[3:41:37.280 --> 3:41:42.000]  on it is keeping us or we're keeping us from working on those solutions because we're so
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:46.880]  preoccupied uh dealing with what the networks are putting out that has to change we have to change
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:50.800]  us somehow i think i've gotten the answer for you on this and i was thinking about that too what
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:57.040]  would happen right now if there was a change of power and the democrats were in power at the
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:02.400]  executive level we know that's going to take place and we're really a taste of what you
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:08.000]  to answer your question we're going to get a taste of that in january and it's going to be the they're
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:14.240]  going to extol number one the virtues of things like gun control extol the virtues of uh a similar
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:22.480]  immigration um but not not assimilation but immigration it as well as push the globalist
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:27.840]  agenda so we have to be very careful and be very cautious as well as i heard mike adams earlier
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:35.280]  talking about setting up perhaps well maybe maybe some uh some event or event that will result in
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:40.000]  taking away our second amendment rights certainly we know that they're trying to erode our first

[3:45:05.520 --> 3:45:11.520]  clothes they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and
[3:45:11.520 --> 3:45:16.720]  ruch limbaugh and tucker carlson and shahannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on

[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:23.680]  Doug and Joe Ackman here filling in for the fourth hour on info wars on this thursday
[3:47:23.680 --> 3:47:29.280]  december 27 2018 one of the last broadcasts of the year we covered a lot of ground we still got
[3:47:29.280 --> 3:47:33.840]  a lot to talk about we have this government shutdown that's been ongoing i believe is in
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:39.920]  today's six over the border wall funding we saw the go fund me page the president started
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:45.520]  for the border wall as the american people have been pouring money into it now before i haven't
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:50.000]  seen the the latest update on that i saw a headline i believe yesterday the day before that they
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:54.720]  might have to return the money that you can't really crowdfund for a border wall i'm not sure
[3:47:54.720 --> 3:47:59.040]  about that but there is a lot of stuff going on with with immigration and whatnot that you know
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:03.440]  we were talking about the cnn stuff and the troops in iraq and i don't want to jump around too much
[3:48:03.440 --> 3:48:08.000]  but i just can't get over this the more i'm looking here at different uh head websites
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:15.280]  one of the biggest blowhards in the news business um america hating fake news or jimacosta leads
[3:48:15.280 --> 3:48:21.360]  cnn discussion on how us troops in iraq should be disciplined for meeting with the president
[3:48:23.040 --> 3:48:30.720]  did you hear this jimacosta is talking about how the troops should be punished for meeting
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:36.560]  with the president i mean what kind of world do we live in uh that we see this this kind of craziness
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:41.600]  how does cnn get away with uh saying things like this and continuing to have an audience and the
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:46.240]  people watch just for that shock factor of what idiotic and ridiculous thing they're gonna say
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:51.760]  next i mean they they protect the terrorists they defend the terrorists and they they destroy the
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:57.360]  president they destroy the constitution by a very definition i mean to me when president trump
[3:48:57.360 --> 3:49:05.280]  claims that the fake news media is the enemy of the people there it is right there how how much
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:13.360]  more explanation does one need or how many examples right there alone seriously it's in our front
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:20.240]  to not just our president but to the the men and women serving overseas and across you know i mean
[3:49:20.240 --> 3:49:26.720]  what that what seriously i want to know what in the hell is wrong with that guy in my view that
[3:49:26.720 --> 3:49:37.920]  he's a narcissist my uh i had a i had a great ad he said it would say something like that boy
[3:49:37.920 --> 3:49:44.560]  ain't right that boy just ain't right okay so um i can i can hear the echoes from my childhood that
[3:49:44.560 --> 3:49:49.520]  boy just ain't right meaning this is the friend of mine that i had introduced her to that boy
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:54.400]  just ain't right well acoustic that boy just ain't right i i mean well seriously you talk about the
[3:49:54.400 --> 3:50:02.240]  enemy of the people uh in the fake news hey yeah it's absolutely so i didn't mean to interrupt but
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:07.840]  but you're right in so many things as bad as uh you know all the mainstream media coverages of
[3:50:07.840 --> 3:50:13.920]  trump you don't see the white house correspondence for abc nbc act the way jimma costa acts and it
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:19.520]  is being done intentionally and i believe he's also probably being uh uh celebrated inside
[3:50:19.520 --> 3:50:24.240]  scene and he's probably being uh um you know incentive they're incentivizing and i'm sure he
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:28.560]  probably has got a bump in his paycheck to become the story instead of covering the story
[3:50:28.560 --> 3:50:33.600]  and i love how the interactions between sarah sanders and jimma costa in the press room because
[3:50:33.600 --> 3:50:37.600]  she just destroys him every time and he looks like such an idiot but he doesn't know when to stop
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:42.240]  because he thinks that there is a and i'm sure there is a portion of these uh extreme leftists
[3:50:42.240 --> 3:50:47.680]  out there who just uh you know applaud and and enjoy that that kind of stuff but it is not doing
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:53.360]  any and this is the problem we talked about this before there's no uh working towards solutions
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:57.280]  with these people and should we work towards solutions with these people that's the question
[3:50:57.280 --> 3:51:04.960]  because the in my mind the evil it's evil it's not just politics at this point and if you're a christian
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:11.120]  would you ever uh come to the table and sit down with somebody who wants to you know perform abortions
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:16.880]  no it's not in your blood it's not in your belief system so there is no middle ground um if you
[3:51:16.880 --> 3:51:21.840]  understand what i'm saying and that's the way i feel about some of this stuff in it and we see it in
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:26.400]  in issues like i want to go to the economy we see this volatility in the stock market well obviously
[3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:32.800]  there's a lot of things going on there um but the level of volatility is very alarming and people are
[3:51:32.800 --> 3:51:36.720]  are spooked and they're shocked and they're wondering what's going on but the root of the problem
[3:51:36.720 --> 3:51:41.920]  is not capitalism it's not uh you know the the market it's the uh what has been done to the
[3:51:41.920 --> 3:51:47.520]  free market through the federal reserve system and and the theft of the wealth from the american people
[3:51:47.520 --> 3:51:53.520]  so and how long has alex jones been talking about this folks since i was listening to him
[3:51:53.520 --> 3:52:01.120]  exactly and he's been proven right every single i want to yell and i can't okay i i really want to
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:08.480]  hit this home forcibly but i cannot do that um how many look alex jones has been right right on
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:12.560]  the money and that's why they want to shut him down that's why they want to shut infowars down
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:20.240]  and you get a bunch of uh sniveling snot nose wet behind the ears uh snowflake cry babies
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:25.920]  am i allowed to say that on this show i think that you know take to twitter they take to twitter
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:31.840]  and they you know they applaud of course the banning of infowars they applaud the banning of
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:40.720]  of uh multiple platforms and conservatives they not realizing not having a sense an ounce of any
[3:52:40.720 --> 3:52:47.440]  common sense that they're next that these cheerleaders are for the globalists they're not
[3:52:47.440 --> 3:52:53.920]  any use to anybody including themselves how many people do you see and you know that the
[3:52:53.920 --> 3:53:01.280]  personal attacks that i see against uh infowars alex jones it it's it it saddens me to the extent
[3:53:01.920 --> 3:53:09.280]  that these people don't understand that they are applauding for their own demise my goodness
[3:53:09.280 --> 3:53:15.040]  what it's like i what's wrong with these people go ahead it's like what we see with uh that you
[3:53:15.040 --> 3:53:20.480]  know we see the rise in hate crimes where you see uh you know uh racist graffiti spray painted on a
[3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:27.760]  school or nooses on it always it lately the trend has been these the hate crimes have been committed
[3:53:27.760 --> 3:53:32.720]  by the people they're allegedly targeting it's this uh it's almost like this self-hatred it's
[3:53:32.720 --> 3:53:38.080]  like a the white people who are out there uh you know telling everybody that it's you know you're
[3:53:38.080 --> 3:53:45.280]  wrong to be white it's a self-destructive attitude that is in my opinion evil and it really has um
[3:53:45.840 --> 3:53:50.080]  just completely twisted the minds of these people and you'd think with the rise of technology and
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:53.440]  the increase of information that people would be getting smarter that people would be getting more
[3:53:53.440 --> 3:54:00.560]  efficient and things would be uh you know the truth would be more uh prevalent but and if the
[3:54:00.560 --> 3:54:04.640]  opposite is true and it's not because of the technology it's because of the way people use
[3:54:04.640 --> 3:54:09.040]  the technology it's just like the the gun debate the guns aren't what are killing people it is the
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:12.800]  people who are using the guns that are killing people it's not the technology and the information
[3:54:12.800 --> 3:54:17.120]  that's making people dumber or or more ignorant it is the way that they use the information
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:22.320]  and what's changed though see you brought it up earlier what has changed and this is what people
[3:54:22.320 --> 3:54:28.800]  have to realize uh uh Dennis Prager Prager University was talking about this uh the assault
[3:54:28.800 --> 3:54:37.280]  against uh the the american trinity of course the e pluribus unum liberty and uh uh one nation
[3:54:37.280 --> 3:54:43.280]  under god it's the one nation under god the the the fact that that the morality of this country
[3:54:43.280 --> 3:54:50.000]  the american exceptionalism america by the way is an exceptional country the western culture is
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:59.520]  an exceptional culture we the west we built this country sorry but we did and and the uh
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:04.640]  you have to folks you have to watch the prager university um if you're so inclined the video
[3:55:04.640 --> 3:55:10.800]  on this but he he was right on the money and the the fact that this is a spiritual battle of war
[3:55:10.800 --> 3:55:16.720]  against our faith and and what did what was the uh what did uh was it ben franklin who said a
[3:55:16.720 --> 3:55:21.920]  republican or uh not a republican if you are a republican if you can keep it but uh uh discover
[3:55:21.920 --> 3:55:29.360]  more stuff for a holy uh moral yeah society i mean jennifer senator franklin yes okay but
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:36.480]  but you get the quote so without god and without the idea that there is a an afterlife and a
[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:43.680]  punishment yeah the the atheists out there or the self-proclaimed atheists or or the um the
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:49.040]  the people who don't have the belief system the strong belief system uh they're wholly incapable
[3:55:49.040 --> 3:55:55.360]  of of governance and of accepting this governance go ahead and you know we talk about this a lot
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:56:01.840]  and even on our show we're we're we're christians by faith um at the same time these people uh if
[3:56:01.840 --> 3:56:06.080]  you don't believe in god i have nothing against you but these people take it to a whole new level
[3:56:06.080 --> 3:56:10.160]  where they they don't believe in god yet at the same time they hate him and then they have turned
