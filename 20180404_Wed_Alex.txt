[04:35.760 --> 04:39.880]  are the trailblazers we are the tip of the spear we are going in through and
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.840]  beyond and I love it I wouldn't do it any other way I thank God for this
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.400]  position and I thank God that were the tip of the spear and that's why we're
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.200]  being persecuted attack because we are hurting the globalist and we will go on
[04:52.200 --> 04:57.040]  hurting them until the end I am 1000% committed and I love what's happening
[04:57.040 --> 05:02.360]  yes victory victory victory we need to fund this operation ladies and gentlemen
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.480]  and I make it really easy we went out and looked at what the top new tropics
[05:06.480 --> 05:10.720]  or brain pills are that are healthy for energy stamina mental clarity you name
[05:10.720 --> 05:15.600]  it and we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.720]  out there it's very simple we went out look what is the top what is the best
[05:18.720 --> 05:21.760]  we'll just put even more product in we'll make it better leading competitors
[05:21.760 --> 05:26.600]  but two dollars a product in it sell it for 60 bucks we put $10 in it and sell
[05:26.600 --> 05:31.840]  it for 30 bucks it's $19.95 right now so you get an incredible top-of-the-line
[05:31.840 --> 05:37.520]  new tropic for $19.95 believe me we're selling it for $35 on average we need
[05:37.520 --> 05:40.840]  that 15-20 bucks we make to fund this operation in the face the global threat
[05:40.840 --> 05:45.200]  of it but I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks I want
[05:45.200 --> 05:48.840]  to shell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that
[05:48.840 --> 05:53.280]  haven't tried brain force to try it and find out why it's got 6000 plus five

[06:15.680 --> 06:22.000]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region six Austin Texas transmitting
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  world-wide it's Alex Jones
[06:34.080 --> 06:44.200]  Ford Ford Wednesday April 4th 2018 I'm your host Alex Jones I am going to be
[06:44.200 --> 06:49.320]  traveling to Washington DC next week and I'm going to have a press conference
[06:49.320 --> 06:55.200]  on a whole bunch of really really important issues so that is coming up
[06:55.200 --> 06:58.320]  we guys print me that press release again I had it here but I can't find the
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.440]  stack I'm gonna cover that at the bottom of the hour give you a first look at
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.320]  some of the things we're gonna do to fight the Democrats and Soros and their
[07:07.320 --> 07:12.960]  attempts to overturn the First Amendment which is now it admitted and of course
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.920]  it's in mainline UK news there's no more free speech in the UK there's no more
[07:17.920 --> 07:21.440]  free speech in Europe I mean the governments are saying that there's no
[07:21.440 --> 07:28.120]  more free speech but the people themselves they need to just exercise it
[07:28.120 --> 07:32.680]  and that's how you respond you hang up flyers all over the town at night if
[07:32.680 --> 07:36.240]  you're in a city or country where they've man your free speech you spray paint
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.200]  the water tower I mean I mean this is information warfare this is French
[07:41.200 --> 07:46.640]  resistance type stuff we are entering into that quadrant and so we need to be
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.960]  nonviolent but gloves need to come off now is the time for libertarians
[07:50.960 --> 07:58.840]  Christians and conservatives to get aggressive Google has banned Easter
[07:58.840 --> 08:03.800]  they're delisting it they didn't do a doodle for it they're banning anything
[08:03.800 --> 08:08.880]  pro-america anything free market anything pro-military anything pro-
[08:08.880 --> 08:12.600]  Christian apples doing the same thing banning Easter office calendar
[08:12.600 --> 08:18.240]  celebrating Islam and Hinduism and everything else it's incredible we're
[08:18.240 --> 08:25.080]  going to cover the latest developments with this liberal yoga teacher bunny
[08:25.080 --> 08:33.240]  worshipper Iranian liberal who was mad that her videos were getting demonetized
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.320]  and YouTube is demonetizing as I said everybody but establishment stuff the
[08:38.320 --> 08:41.960]  left at first was like yay the last few years since their conservatives screw
[08:41.960 --> 08:48.080]  them over and then now almost everyone's being censored but a few handful maybe a
[08:48.080 --> 08:53.480]  hundred leftist talk shows who then get force fed to everybody and pushed out
[08:53.480 --> 08:57.440]  because they're anti-american and then they still are monetized but they'll be
[08:57.440 --> 09:03.160]  removed as well so this is the process of how censorship works the globalists
[09:03.160 --> 09:08.080]  don't want anybody having free speech Pelosi lives immediately politicize
[09:08.080 --> 09:14.560]  YouTube shooting to push gun control YouTube shooter said witness I didn't
[09:14.560 --> 09:18.440]  have a gun but I wish I did that videos coming up suspect in YouTube shooting
[09:18.440 --> 09:23.160]  posted rants about the company and of course her father and family warned that
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.280]  they thought she was coming to kill people but nothing was done as usual the
[09:28.280 --> 09:33.680]  San Jose mercury news and others are reporting that YouTube shooter Naseem
[09:33.680 --> 09:38.800]  Agdam's father says he called the police concerned about her anger at the
[09:38.800 --> 09:44.840]  company shooter hated YouTube Iranian animal rights protester 39 well that's
[09:44.840 --> 09:51.120]  the one she got to watch who shot three staff at video giant HQ before killing
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.760]  herself her vendetta against dictatorial site for censoring her videos and not
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.560]  paying her and she looks like a complete whack job I mean just put her on
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.440]  screen I think it's terrible what happened at YouTube and the terrible that
[10:05.440 --> 10:13.160]  happens to employees of Google but this is what happens as Kennedy said what
[10:13.160 --> 10:19.440]  was his famous quote those that make peaceful elections impossible make
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.880]  violent revolution inevitable and just the woman looks like a complete whack
[10:25.880 --> 10:32.440]  job look at her and she's definitely getting attention for her yoga videos
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.520]  now but you know you take artists and you take their material and then you use
[10:37.520 --> 10:42.720]  them to build your organization up YouTube meaning the people and then you
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.000]  censor it and I've seen the videos this is not censorable stuff but they don't
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.320]  want you know let's put some of this on screen this is what they censor is her
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.840]  doing yoga exercises and basic stretching exercises and
[11:00.840 --> 11:08.560]  nasim abc.com nasim sabz.com and you can go there we've gone and looked I mean
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.120]  there's just nothing there to censor and it's terrible that she shot three
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.120]  people there again is or the what the media is calling bizarre Instagram videos
[11:17.120 --> 11:20.560]  of animal rights activists behind YouTube gun rampage we're going to play
[11:20.560 --> 11:27.600]  some of that I I thought that she looks like a man when I first saw the pictures
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.920]  yesterday I thought you know it is is this a transgender person but I guess
[11:31.920 --> 11:38.400]  it is a woman so YouTube finally says employees can talk publicly about the
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.360]  shooting they also gagged them Silicon Valley grapples with security risk at
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.640]  your YouTube shooting if the big issue here is and I have a stack of articles
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.280]  on that that will be getting to is particularly Twitter but also Facebook
[11:53.280 --> 11:57.200]  Google hasn't been as bad that we know of they're bad many other ways have been
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.960]  helping Pakistan and others target people that same that Allah isn't God or
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.400]  Muhammad is in his prophet they call that blasphemy and they come and they
[12:06.400 --> 12:09.400]  arrest you and they kill you I've got the articles right here and Twitter and
[12:09.400 --> 12:15.040]  Facebook and others have been involved in that so how does it feel though for the
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.280]  tech giants and say they're worried about people coming to get them for what
[12:18.280 --> 12:22.480]  they say and do when you're helping people including Communist China round up
[12:22.480 --> 12:26.440]  political dissidents and that's come out with Apple in the news that Apple and
[12:26.440 --> 12:29.760]  others are now working with China to help target their dissidents and Apple's
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.200]  moving its headquarters to China is gonna let the government inside of there
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.720]  to track everything and have the keys to your cloud internet with them because
[12:37.720 --> 12:40.680]  they say well if we're gonna be based here to get tax exemption that's how
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.040]  China counter Trump equalizing corporate taxes with China from 40 to 15% they
[12:45.040 --> 12:48.360]  just said we're going to zero but you got to come here and be state-run and
[12:48.360 --> 12:53.080]  Apple said we're basically already in China will just we're state-run and so
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.520]  here's the big news drum roll please ladies and gentlemen story is on
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.400]  info wars.com I can confirm from Jerome Corsi sources and my other sources in
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.600]  the White House I was told months ago that he's been talking to Peter Thiel and
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.840]  then he's been talking to other folks like Elon Musk and that they are
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.000]  developing a plan with his new 2020 campaign head who was just their tech
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.480]  head who's a great guy as well I'm told to go after leftist monopolies in the
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.320]  internet which is Facebook Twitter Google the Axios thing that Trump loves
[13:27.320 --> 13:32.720]  Facebook is not true he does say oh you know if other people are getting
[13:32.720 --> 13:35.640]  censored that's a problem but at least I'll break through it that's what he
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.840]  says he goes they don't censor me but he's now learning that all these
[13:39.840 --> 13:43.720]  channels that amplify him and that and the channels that carry his speeches are
[13:43.720 --> 13:48.120]  being banned on Facebook he is getting briefed let me just tell Facebook he's
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.880]  been briefed face-to-face by three people I know in the last month that he is
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.080]  being turned down his volume from 11 aka spinal tap down to about a one or maybe
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.720]  a point five it's less than 10% of what it was ahead of the midterms they're

[14:37.760 --> 14:42.320]  friends and getting constant messages that don't mean anything or it just
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.160]  lowers the attention span even more it's meant to fry your dopamine levels and
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.280]  completely enslave you in the words of Facebook executives and Twitter

[20:55.400 --> 20:57.400]  Come on, don't be a villain in that fight.
[20:57.400 --> 20:58.400]  One point at this point.
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.400]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW Globalist George Soros' droppings.
[21:03.400 --> 21:04.400]  Stabilize.
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.400]  Son of George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the new world order, and Michael Moore.
[21:08.400 --> 21:11.400]  Go back to where you came from.
[21:11.400 --> 21:15.400]  We're awake and you're not puttin' us back in the coma.
[21:15.400 --> 21:16.400]  You got that, Jack?
[21:16.400 --> 21:17.400]  You're done.
[21:17.400 --> 21:18.400]  It's over.
[21:18.400 --> 21:19.400]  What?
[21:19.400 --> 21:20.400]  What?
[21:20.400 --> 21:21.400]  Get him back.
[21:21.400 --> 21:22.400]  Get him back.
[21:27.400 --> 21:29.400]  Do you think there was more to this?
[21:31.400 --> 21:32.400]  For sure.
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.400]  I think you did.
[21:33.400 --> 21:37.400]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shares of fully automated environments.
[21:37.400 --> 21:38.400]  Clear.
[21:38.400 --> 21:39.400]  Or what do you think?
[21:44.400 --> 21:47.400]  This is the broadcast that they hate, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:47.400 --> 21:53.400]  This is the transmission that the globalists loathe because we've got their number.
[21:53.400 --> 22:00.400]  Well, the good news is President Trump is meeting with Peter Thiel this week and they're
[22:00.400 --> 22:08.400]  moving ahead with a plan to break up the big telecoms, to break up the big tech companies,
[22:08.400 --> 22:13.400]  to break up all these different institutions that have been censoring and bullying conservative
[22:13.400 --> 22:19.400]  media, but particularly Google and its subsidiary, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[22:19.400 --> 22:23.400]  And they're all on the chopping block.
[22:23.400 --> 22:31.400]  Axios has tried, that's, of course, Politico, kind of sheep dipping, something that sounds
[22:31.400 --> 22:34.400]  independent because they know they're so discredited.
[22:34.400 --> 22:40.400]  Axios, and it's anti-free speech operations, had an article out last week about, oh, he's
[22:40.400 --> 22:45.400]  obsessed with Bezos and he's obsessed with how they get up to $1.50 a piece on every package
[22:45.400 --> 22:51.400]  and how they've got all these special rules that allow them to be basically monopolistic.
[22:51.400 --> 22:53.400]  But it's a lot bigger than just Amazon.
[22:53.400 --> 22:57.400]  It's all of them on the chopping blocks from my sources.
[22:57.400 --> 23:04.400]  And there's a good article from InformationLiberation.com upon Infowars.com and NewsWars.com that
[23:04.400 --> 23:07.400]  breaks it down and then lines up with my sources.
[23:07.400 --> 23:11.400]  In fact, I know, of course, he's got some of the same sources in the winehouse.
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.400]  Mike Adams is here in the next hour and he's got a he's loaded for bear.
[23:15.400 --> 23:18.400]  Roger Stone is coming up host the fourth hour.
[23:18.400 --> 23:21.400]  They were claiming he was in England meeting with Assange when he wasn't.
[23:21.400 --> 23:25.400]  He's released his credit card and bank records and hotel records that when he was in California,
[23:25.400 --> 23:30.400]  it's just crazy now.
[23:30.400 --> 23:33.400]  And then even Politico has to admit that Trump is right.
[23:33.400 --> 23:35.400]  It is the Amazon Washington Post.
[23:35.400 --> 23:41.400]  Oh my gosh, we need Politico now just today to tell us what we told you a couple years ago when he bought it
[23:41.400 --> 23:44.400]  and he ordered him to try to bring down Trump during the election.
[23:44.400 --> 23:51.400]  And then once he got elected and then he got $600 million from the Obama CIA to run the operation.
[23:51.400 --> 23:53.400]  Bezos wouldn't even use his own money.
[23:53.400 --> 23:59.400]  He had to get it from Obama in a government contract when Trump was president-elect.
[23:59.400 --> 24:01.400]  Oh, here's 600 mil for the Washington Post.
[24:01.400 --> 24:08.400]  Extra bring him down and then Bezos is cutting their pay and won't give him bonuses and they love it.
[24:08.400 --> 24:11.400]  They love working for a rich guy that pays no taxes.
[24:11.400 --> 24:14.400]  The left loves Apple paying no taxes.
[24:14.400 --> 24:16.400]  They love the suicide nets.
[24:16.400 --> 24:18.400]  They love the Foxcom laboratories.
[24:18.400 --> 24:19.400]  They love the forced abortion.
[24:19.400 --> 24:20.400]  They love evil.
[24:20.400 --> 24:22.400]  They love being screwed.
[24:22.400 --> 24:26.400]  They're in a cult of losers.
[24:26.400 --> 24:28.400]  They worship him.
[24:28.400 --> 24:37.400]  And he just walks around acting real friendly with his fake goofy laugh.
[24:37.400 --> 24:39.400]  You got to pull up old interviews of Bezos.
[24:39.400 --> 24:42.400]  I'm going to do a video of these because I know he hates this broadcast.
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.400]  He works hard at the Washington Post to have articles almost every week saying,
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.400]  Jones is a snake.
[24:47.400 --> 24:49.400]  Old salesman Jones sells supplements.
[24:49.400 --> 24:50.400]  Supplements are fraudulent.
[24:50.400 --> 24:52.400]  Supplements are bad when Jones sells them,
[24:52.400 --> 24:54.400]  but he's the biggest supplement seller in the world
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.400]  and sells at least 18 of the exact supplements I sell.
[24:58.400 --> 25:00.400]  I just have my label on it.
[25:00.400 --> 25:01.400]  Side issue.
[25:01.400 --> 25:02.400]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[25:02.400 --> 25:04.400]  So here is one announcement.
[25:04.400 --> 25:08.400]  I do want to go ahead and make for everyone.
[25:08.400 --> 25:14.400]  And there's a video breaking it down on info wars.com.
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.400]  Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered Alex Jones to hold press conference
[25:21.400 --> 25:26.400]  against Soros backed lawsuits on Tuesday, April 10th.
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.400]  Alex Jones, myself truly, will make a statement and take questions from the press
[25:31.400 --> 25:37.400]  in Washington, D.C. on the anti free speech lawsuits targeting his First Amendment rights.
[25:37.400 --> 25:41.400]  The National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
[25:41.400 --> 25:48.400]  Zinger room, 9 a.m. Eastern, and it'll go for three hours.
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.400]  I'm also going to broadcast from there and I haven't got around to this,
[25:51.400 --> 25:52.400]  but I'm going to call C-Span and say,
[25:52.400 --> 25:54.400]  don't you think you should also carry this?
[25:54.400 --> 25:56.400]  Everybody should call C-Span right now.
[25:56.400 --> 25:59.400]  The listeners should and say, hey, carry this live streams.
[25:59.400 --> 26:05.400]  The press conference will be available at info wars.com forward slash show to attend the press conference.
[26:05.400 --> 26:16.400]  Press must RSVP via email at we have that linked m e d i a l n t at info wars.com.
[26:16.400 --> 26:23.400]  Again, I don't know why we have such a weird, weird, weird email name for that.
[26:23.400 --> 26:27.400]  I want to change that and then change it in the press release and have you both there.
[26:27.400 --> 26:35.400]  I mean, we could have, like, Super Cajun, Frisalistic, Expealadoscious as the name.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.400]  Make it as hard as possible.
[26:36.400 --> 26:39.400]  That's a, I don't know, media hint.
[26:39.400 --> 26:40.400]  I know, I just want to change it.
[26:40.400 --> 26:41.400]  I just read this here.
[26:41.400 --> 26:42.400]  I don't know where.
[26:42.400 --> 26:43.400]  I'm not mad.
[26:43.400 --> 26:44.400]  I just do this live on air.
[26:44.400 --> 26:46.400]  It's a cockamamie name.
[26:46.400 --> 26:57.400]  Anyways, and then put Alex Jones national press club speech in email subject.
[26:57.400 --> 26:58.400]  Why not?
[26:58.400 --> 26:59.400]  I didn't write this press release.
[26:59.400 --> 27:06.400]  Or alternatively, you can text if you want to be there to 512-9545-225.
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.400]  You will be sent a QR code that will allow you to enter the national press club facility.
[27:11.400 --> 27:13.400]  Access to the event is limited.
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.400]  And there's already over 50 press groups say they want to go.
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.400]  So I'm going to look at all the media that comes in and then decide.
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.400]  I mean, I'm not mad about the, I'm not mad about the email.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.400]  It's just some of these emails.
[27:27.400 --> 27:32.400]  It's like, is it a chain of chimpanzee up to a typewriter and see what it comes up to?
[27:32.400 --> 27:33.400]  Okay.
[27:33.400 --> 27:34.400]  Let's get serious here.
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.400]  Can you guys put the clock back up there for me?
[27:38.400 --> 27:40.400]  Can I have that?
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.400]  Thanks.
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.400]  Because I, I just, we've had this new clock and I still don't have it all memorized and
[27:46.400 --> 27:47.400]  it's really hitting me.
[27:47.400 --> 27:48.400]  It hit me hard.
[27:48.400 --> 27:49.400]  Thank you.
[27:49.400 --> 27:50.400]  I appreciate that.
[27:50.400 --> 27:53.400]  Just briefly here, the globalists are trying to shut us down as you know.
[27:53.400 --> 27:59.400]  And we've got great products at great prices that make the transmission possible.
[27:59.400 --> 28:03.400]  And if you don't support us, George Soros and the globalists and all their attacks will
[28:03.400 --> 28:04.400]  be able to shut us down.
[28:04.400 --> 28:05.400]  It's just that simple.
[28:05.400 --> 28:06.400]  And so they're trying to take our sponsors.
[28:06.400 --> 28:09.400]  They've taken many of them as you know, they're constantly attacking us.
[28:09.400 --> 28:11.400]  They want us off of YouTube.
[28:11.400 --> 28:12.400]  It'd be huge action.
[28:12.400 --> 28:13.400]  Take it.
[28:13.400 --> 28:14.400]  Even keep that up there.
[28:14.400 --> 28:15.400]  Just coming for all your rights.
[28:15.400 --> 28:17.400]  And they see info wars as the very frontline because it is.

[28:45.400 --> 28:47.400]  What I do is I gargle it out, spit it out, brush it.

[31:27.400 --> 31:30.400]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[31:30.400 --> 31:35.400]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[31:35.400 --> 31:38.400]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[31:38.400 --> 31:42.400]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[31:42.400 --> 31:44.400]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[31:44.400 --> 31:48.400]  I love it, nascent iodine is essential survival shield X2.
[31:48.400 --> 31:52.400]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[31:52.400 --> 31:54.400]  iodine survival shield X2.
[31:54.400 --> 31:56.400]  It's got a five star rating.

[33:23.400 --> 33:52.400]  The reason they want to shut us down is because we've got their number.
[33:52.400 --> 33:54.400]  We know the globalist plan.
[33:54.400 --> 33:55.400]  We've read their books.
[33:55.400 --> 33:56.400]  We've read their white papers.
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.400]  We know how their operations are carried out and they thought you were so stupid and the
[34:00.400 --> 34:01.400]  public was so dumb.
[34:01.400 --> 34:07.400]  They have a private corporate world government tax exempt with diplomatic community backed
[34:07.400 --> 34:12.400]  up by the communist Chinese that killed over 80 million people.
[34:12.400 --> 34:15.400]  They say the CIA says it's 65 million.
[34:15.400 --> 34:16.400]  I don't know.
[34:16.400 --> 34:23.400]  The Chinese government says 80 plus million died under the communist revolution of Mao,
[34:23.400 --> 34:26.400]  the great leap forward, the cultural revolution.
[34:26.400 --> 34:31.400]  And then I just walk all over Austin and see UT students with Mao say tongue shirts on
[34:31.400 --> 34:35.400]  and they're not joking around like wearing an old Russian shirt or something.
[34:35.400 --> 34:37.400]  It's just CCP or whatever.
[34:37.400 --> 34:42.400]  And they're into it and they love it and they got tattoos of it and they got smartphones
[34:42.400 --> 34:44.400]  and $100, $200 skinny jeans.
[34:44.400 --> 34:47.400]  And they're getting in nice cars their parents are paid for.
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.400]  And you go, this doesn't ideologically make any sense yet does they want power and they
[34:52.400 --> 34:56.400]  want to direct everybody and they want to kill the Midwest.
[34:56.400 --> 34:59.400]  They don't want to just reorganize things.
[34:59.400 --> 35:01.400]  They want a giant bloodletting.
[35:01.400 --> 35:03.400]  It's their religion.
[35:03.400 --> 35:05.400]  They hate flyover country.
[35:05.400 --> 35:06.400]  They hate bitter clingers.
[35:06.400 --> 35:07.400]  Hillary hates you.
[35:07.400 --> 35:08.400]  They all hate you.
[35:08.400 --> 35:09.400]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[35:09.400 --> 35:13.400]  If you're black, if you're white, if you're Hispanic, if you're Asian, if you're a Christian,
[35:13.400 --> 35:19.400]  if you're a conservative, if you are self-sufficient, if you are not a Satanist, if you are not mentally ill,
[35:19.400 --> 35:26.400]  they want to put you on a forced labor camp and watch you starve to death because it makes them feel powerful.
[35:26.400 --> 35:28.400]  They want to rape your wife.
[35:28.400 --> 35:32.400]  They want, just like in East Germany, if you want to be in the theater or be involved,
[35:32.400 --> 35:34.400]  you've got to have sex with the party officials.
[35:34.400 --> 35:37.400]  They want to be able to kill and rape whoever they want.
[35:37.400 --> 35:44.400]  They want authoritarianism to carry out criminal operations and the raping of your children.
[35:44.400 --> 35:52.400]  Their religion is pedophilia and torturing people to death and starving you to death and murdering you.
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.400]  It's why they're God.
[35:54.400 --> 36:02.400]  Help round up Nazis when he was 14, 15, 16 for his stepfather and help round up thousands and told 60 Minutes.
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.400]  It was the best time of his life and he would do it over again and he's not ashamed.
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.400]  If somebody else didn't do it, he would have done it.
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.400]  And by the way, I've said this and I love everybody.
[36:15.400 --> 36:25.400]  But when we put together two different compilations of that video from that transmission that I've aired before,
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.400]  that they try to take down, we didn't put it out with the parts where he said it was the best time of his life.
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.400]  So I want another version of that and I'm going to air today.
[36:35.400 --> 36:38.400]  It didn't matter what happens, it's going to air.
[36:38.400 --> 36:40.400]  In fact, I'll just air the whole thing.
[36:40.400 --> 36:42.400]  In fact, just get me the entire 60 Minutes.
[36:42.400 --> 36:44.400]  That's what I'll do. I'll air the whole 12-minute segment.
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.400]  I will not be stopped because I get on my knees and beg for something particularly.
[36:50.400 --> 36:53.400]  I don't get it, but I'm not the coma.
[36:53.400 --> 36:55.400]  Got that? I'm not in one.
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.400]  I'm going to stop that Nazi piece of crap and you're going to stop him.
[37:00.400 --> 37:03.400]  And he hates our gods. Well, we're coming for you. You got it?
[37:03.400 --> 37:05.400]  But that's who they worship. You understand?
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.400]  He's their god because he's a killer.
[37:09.400 --> 37:13.400]  They love it. They think it's sharp. They think it's sexy.
[37:13.400 --> 37:17.400]  I've read about they worshiped Zabigniew Brzezinski.
[37:17.400 --> 37:20.400]  Because he manipulated the Cameroos into killing millions.
[37:20.400 --> 37:25.400]  And they just think the more people you've killed, the more power you've got.
[37:25.400 --> 37:30.400]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast and get that clip, so that's the answer.
[37:30.400 --> 37:33.400]  Just got to take action. What's all about?
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.400]  Get out of the coma.
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.400]  Now, that's it.
[37:41.400 --> 37:47.400]  The good news here, ladies and gentlemen,
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.400]  is that, I'll read this article to you, because this is actually happening.
[37:52.400 --> 37:56.400]  And this is the good news, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:56.400 --> 37:58.400]  But you think about all those leftists and people.
[37:58.400 --> 38:01.400]  And now, I've realized this life for years, they like the evil.
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.400]  They know their bosses are evil. They like it.
[38:05.400 --> 38:08.400]  They're talking to some rich kid that's a communist and they're getting in their Jaguar
[38:08.400 --> 38:11.400]  and they go, yeah, Alex, we're going to kill you.
[38:11.400 --> 38:14.400]  We're devil worshipers. Yes, we know communism is devil worship.
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.400]  You think we don't know?
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.400]  And you realize it's just a party of devil worshipers that want to kill everybody.
[38:21.400 --> 38:25.400]  My God, you know how many sports stadiums 80 million people is?
[38:25.400 --> 38:27.400]  Let's just round down from 84 million.
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.400]  The Communist Chinese say Mao killed to 80 million.
[38:30.400 --> 38:33.400]  Let's just round down 4 million.
[38:33.400 --> 38:39.400]  How many sports stadiums of 100,000 people?
[38:39.400 --> 38:42.400]  Think about it, is 80 million.
[38:42.400 --> 38:44.400]  Do your math yourself.
[38:44.400 --> 38:46.400]  You kind of just lose it, don't you?
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.400]  You can't really think of as humans, because it's 80 million.
[38:50.400 --> 38:55.400]  But if it's one person shot at a high school, then they tell you it's all we're all so sad
[38:55.400 --> 38:58.400]  and it's all your fault collectively.
[38:58.400 --> 39:00.400]  Turn your guns in.
[39:00.400 --> 39:02.400]  That's the answer.
[39:02.400 --> 39:04.400]  That's what needs to be done.
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.400]  That's what we're going to do.
[39:09.400 --> 39:11.400]  See how that works?
[39:11.400 --> 39:13.400]  That's how these sickos operate.
[39:13.400 --> 39:14.400]  That's their world.
[39:14.400 --> 39:15.400]  They think you're unconscious.
[39:15.400 --> 39:16.400]  They think you're dumb.
[39:16.400 --> 39:17.400]  They think you're food.
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.400]  They want to have their way with you, and the question is, are you going to let them have their way?
[39:22.400 --> 39:24.400]  I mean, look at Hogg, their god.
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.400]  Of course he's on Reddit, and of course they haven't denied that he's Reddit, because it is.
[39:28.400 --> 39:31.400]  Celebrating mosquitoes killing billions of humans.
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.400]  And we put that out, just like we put it out five years ago, about the stingray systems with the actual documents
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.400]  and how it's around with the state and federal and local and how it's not used to stop crime and all the rest of it.
[39:41.400 --> 39:47.400]  And know now, the Pulitzer Prize winning AP is reporting word for word, but I'm even showing you the documents.
[39:47.400 --> 39:54.400]  That's why they hate us, because they don't control this operation with their bullying and their threats and all the rest of it.
[39:54.400 --> 39:57.400]  They do not do it.
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.400]  They don't control Trump either.
[40:01.400 --> 40:03.400]  As Trump's crime is, he likes women.
[40:03.400 --> 40:04.400]  He's not a pedophile.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.400]  Seriously.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.400]  He doesn't want to hurt you.
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.400]  He doesn't want to see you poor.
[40:07.400 --> 40:11.400]  He wants to run over big, rich, powerful globals.
[40:11.400 --> 40:14.400]  He wants to rub their faces in the mud, because they deserve it.
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.400]  And that's why they hate him, because he can't be bought either, and he can't be bullied, and he can't be intimidated, because he hasn't had his spirit broken.
[40:20.400 --> 40:22.400]  He's not in a coma.
[40:22.400 --> 40:23.400]  Report.
[40:23.400 --> 40:27.400]  Trump to host Peter Thiel to talk regulation of big tech.
[40:27.400 --> 40:36.400]  The dinner, a source close to Thiel said, will be a strategy session on how the president might be able to regulate Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google.
[40:36.400 --> 40:47.400]  The Daily Mail reports Trump is having dinner Tuesday night with his biggest Silicon Valley backer, Peter Thiel.
[40:47.400 --> 40:48.400]  And it just goes on.
[40:48.400 --> 40:55.400]  And I just thought I should point that out, because those meetings have been going on, and those things have been happening, and it is being prepared.
[40:55.400 --> 41:10.400]  And so, all the big tech giants and the rest of them, if you think 30 million lost by Amazon, when Trump just put a few tweets out, or Sarah Sanders made a few statements, or a statement.
[41:10.400 --> 41:20.400]  And if you think 40 plus billion out of Facebook, when the president made some statements, when all that stuff came out, you leftists are stupid, stupid, stupid people.
[41:20.400 --> 41:30.400]  You may be vampiric and predatory, but all the statistics, all the studies around the world show leftist are vampiric, predatory, stupid, dull, fake people that virtue signal all day because they don't have any real virtue.
[41:30.400 --> 41:31.400]  They're completely fake.
[41:31.400 --> 41:37.400]  And they'll sit there and act all nice and sacramonious and everything else, they're a bunch of scum.
[41:37.400 --> 41:45.400]  Grasping, hateful, weak people upset that they're weak, upset that they're particularly fallen, upset that they're stupid, and they want to drag you down with them.
[41:45.400 --> 41:49.400]  It's that simple.
[41:49.400 --> 41:50.400]  And so that's what you have to understand.
[41:50.400 --> 41:52.400]  They want to destroy you.
[41:52.400 --> 41:53.400]  They want to make you poor.
[41:53.400 --> 41:55.400]  They want to destroy you.
[41:55.400 --> 41:57.400]  They destroy countries on purpose.
[41:57.400 --> 41:58.400]  This is what they do.
[41:58.400 --> 42:03.400]  Everywhere they get control because they just want to rape and murder people all day.
[42:03.400 --> 42:10.400]  And when things fully collapse and there's no more infrastructure, then good people don't have a way to fight back and they get to have their way.
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.400]  So once you understand that, then you understand their whole ballgame.
[42:14.400 --> 42:25.400]  Soros wants to do one thing, overthrow countries, destroy good economies, bankrupt people, have them as poor and stoned out of their minds with junkies and needles laying everywhere.
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.400]  Because when you're a demon, that makes him feel good when he glides around amongst the filth and skid row.
[42:31.400 --> 42:40.400]  When he flies over in his private jet and looks down at rotting cities and ugliness and ugly architecture and just steaming wildfires and death and starvation.
[42:40.400 --> 42:45.400]  He just soars above the death like the angel of death just smelling the spiritual stenches.
[42:45.400 --> 42:47.400]  Oh, I feel good now.
[42:47.400 --> 42:49.400]  Oh, I'm just ruining life.
[42:49.400 --> 42:51.400]  Oh, I'm going to pull him down on a pet with me.
[42:51.400 --> 42:55.400]  Oh, God, I love Alastair Crowley.
[42:55.400 --> 43:21.400]  Oh, it's so good.

[44:59.400 --> 45:03.400]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[45:03.400 --> 45:05.400]  Introducing pollen block.
[45:05.400 --> 45:17.400]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[45:17.400 --> 45:26.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.400 --> 45:37.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[45:37.400 --> 45:41.400]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[45:41.400 --> 45:51.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:51.400 --> 45:54.400]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:54.400 --> 46:12.400]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[46:25.400 --> 46:38.400]  To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.400]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[46:42.400 --> 46:53.400]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[46:53.400 --> 46:59.400]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[47:23.400 --> 47:35.400]  Trying to extinct humanity.
[47:35.400 --> 47:41.400]  They're trying to teach us to hate ourselves. They're trying to get us to turn our life force off.
[47:41.400 --> 47:49.400]  And notice when I talk about this, they'll have the right-wing watch and the Soros-funded media matters put up the great truths I state.
[47:49.400 --> 47:56.400]  As if they're the authority and as if they state the great truth and go look at the horrible thing he did, people will go look,
[47:56.400 --> 48:01.400]  Jones said the sunrises, but media matters pointed it out so it must not be true.
[48:01.400 --> 48:07.400]  It's a bizarre appeal to authority as if they're the authority and as if they're giving the marching orders.
[48:07.400 --> 48:18.400]  But they do give the marching orders to CNN, MSNBC and others on how to tell the lies and how to spend the information and how to edit the videos
[48:18.400 --> 48:22.400]  and how to destroy the country, how to bring in the world government.
[48:22.400 --> 48:29.400]  But to just see Trump in that tweet, I meant to have you guys pull it up, where he said, we're not in a trade war.
[48:29.400 --> 48:41.400]  Like the media says, we lost the trade war in the last 40 years being sold out to the Communist Chinese and now the surrender is over.
[48:41.400 --> 48:47.400]  That's what I've been saying for several years. We lost the trade war. These aren't trade wars.
[48:47.400 --> 48:55.400]  If they're stealing 300 billion intellectual property and we got a 450 billion a year, 500 billion deficit, put the math together.
[48:55.400 --> 49:04.400]  That's 800 to 850 billion, not counting the other 400 plus billion globally in trade deficit.
[49:04.400 --> 49:16.400]  So now you're up to a third, you're up to 100, you're up to, I can't even do the math anymore of the giant systematic screw job.
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.400]  This country has been under via these globalist authoritarians.
[49:21.400 --> 49:35.400]  And then people sit there and go, oh, info wars, you know, that's so radical, even mainline conservatives, libertarians, thinking they get some type of brownie point with mainstream media.
[49:35.400 --> 49:40.400]  You guys are followers. You guys are children.
[49:40.400 --> 49:47.400]  I am not trying to win a popularity contest. I'm trying to destroy the New World Order.
[49:47.400 --> 49:53.400]  I'm trying to destroy the globalist. There's the tweet. Total truth out today.
[49:53.400 --> 49:58.400]  We are not in a trade war with China. That war was lost many years ago by foolish or incompetent people.
[49:58.400 --> 50:00.400]  Now they were traders who represented the U.S.
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.400]  And now we have a trade deficit of 500 billion a year with intellectual property theft of another 300 billion.
[50:06.400 --> 50:14.400]  We cannot let this continue. It's really like 1300 billion if you count the other trade deficits together.
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.400]  The whole total is 1300 billion.
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.400]  1300 billion. It's even hard to say numbers like that.
[50:24.400 --> 50:32.400]  1300 billion dollar trade deficit to try to prop up a communist regime when it's not even communist.
[50:32.400 --> 50:40.400]  It's just an oligarchy of mass murderers ruling over people and killing their babies when they catch them hiding to a year old.
[50:40.400 --> 50:50.400]  Killing 70 million little girls at least in the womb, holding political dissidents who've done nothing but call for free speech
[50:50.400 --> 50:58.400]  or who are Christian or who are caught practicing any form of religion.
[50:58.400 --> 51:06.400]  You dead. And the left here is just creamy eyed. Creamy eyed.
[51:06.400 --> 51:12.400]  So you think about how they're in love with that and they've got that look.
[51:12.400 --> 51:15.400]  You know, I was watching video about the cult that was out in Oregon in the 80s.
[51:15.400 --> 51:21.400]  I actually read a book on that. I knew a bodyguard guy in LA that were for some folks who'd actually been with security people there when he was like a teenager.
[51:21.400 --> 51:28.400]  He said, oh, no, it's all true. We were ordered to put rattlesnakes and people's, you know, mailboxes and stuff.
[51:28.400 --> 51:31.400]  That fella's not in the movie, but I've confirmed he was there.
[51:31.400 --> 51:39.400]  And they talk about the look of people that are mind controlled and they've got that, oh, we love our leader. He is the Lord.
[51:39.400 --> 51:45.400]  And then behind the scenes, it's just devil worship and flopping around and all this stuff.
[51:45.400 --> 51:49.400]  And it's the same thing with the left. You finally get into who they are.
[51:49.400 --> 51:55.400]  The faithiest or any of them, they are on their knees possessed.
[51:55.400 --> 52:00.400]  Wild, wild country's most shocking reveals from the sex cults FBI informant.
[52:00.400 --> 52:04.400]  I've talked to people that were inside of it and they say it's worse than what you see in that movie.
[52:04.400 --> 52:09.400]  In fact, the show I've been watching is like a whitewash of this stuff.
[52:09.400 --> 52:13.400]  And all I'm getting at is ladies and gentlemen, is I know how evil the globalist are.
[52:13.400 --> 52:18.400]  Harry on Huffington has been connected to that group as well. I know what they're into. I know how they operate.
[52:18.400 --> 52:23.400]  I've been told when Hollywood that it's worse than I know. Very serious people.
[52:23.400 --> 52:29.400]  And Hollywood promoted crap like that to make it popular.
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.400]  So they got out of hand.
[52:32.400 --> 52:38.400]  So I'm up here running about all this and I get really mad because I know George Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[52:38.400 --> 52:40.400]  He bragged about it.
[52:40.400 --> 52:42.400]  I know he's coming after me in my free speech.
[52:42.400 --> 52:48.400]  I know he's in the WikiLeaks and other documents saying give the Internet to the U.N., censor all conservatives off of it.
[52:48.400 --> 52:53.400]  And his plan still being followed. Obama handed it over and then Trump hasn't gotten it back yet.
[52:53.400 --> 52:56.400]  In fact, it isn't Trump even busting up the trust.
[52:56.400 --> 53:04.400]  It is Trump getting control of the Internet, our Internet back to the U.S.
[53:04.400 --> 53:07.400]  In fact, here's why I was frustrated earlier. I'm not mad at anybody.
[53:07.400 --> 53:09.400]  We've got the whole 12 minutes, 60 minutes piece.
[53:09.400 --> 53:14.400]  And the little promo piece we put together when he was denying he was a Nazi collaborator was admitting he didn't have a problem at all
[53:14.400 --> 53:16.400]  and went out and helped round up Jews.
[53:16.400 --> 53:20.400]  That's not even the key of the interview. It's that he enjoyed it.
[53:20.400 --> 53:23.400]  It was the best time of his life. These are the quotes.
[53:23.400 --> 53:29.400]  And then I got Anderson Cooper and young Turks guy saying I'm making it up.
[53:29.400 --> 53:34.400]  When I have the book he wrote, his dad wrote a book, he has given multiple interviews saying this
[53:34.400 --> 53:36.400]  and they try to keep this interview from getting out there.
[53:36.400 --> 53:42.400]  So let's play that little clip that you guys were able to dig up and let's play the little intro piece that's got Cooper denying it.
[53:42.400 --> 53:46.400]  You've got to watch the whole thing. It's like when he talks about it, he beams.
[53:46.400 --> 53:50.400]  He gets so happy. It was wonderful and I didn't do it somebody else would.
[53:50.400 --> 53:53.400]  I took care of myself. That's what matters.
[53:53.400 --> 53:57.400]  You're looking at a monstrous pig who was known as a criminal that overthrew governments,
[53:57.400 --> 54:02.400]  bankrupted economies all over the world until he brought his money back to the U.S. in the 90s,
[54:02.400 --> 54:07.400]  bought up the Democratic Party with the Clintons and basically took the country over.
[54:07.400 --> 54:12.400]  And he just runs wild. He just does whatever he wants and I'm sick of him. Here it is.
[54:12.400 --> 54:21.400]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted god son.
[54:21.400 --> 54:22.400]  Yes, yes.
[54:22.400 --> 54:27.400]  Went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews to that site.
[54:27.400 --> 54:36.400]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[54:36.400 --> 54:41.400]  Was it difficult? Not at all.
[54:41.400 --> 54:49.400]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.
[54:49.400 --> 54:55.400]  Okay, that's part of it. Good. I know we have a bunch of these clips, but I'm just going to air the whole stinking thing.
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.400]  I think I'm going to start airing it every day. We'll call it the Soros segment and I'll show Cooper saying it doesn't exist.
[55:01.400 --> 55:06.400]  I'll show Sink, who's named after a genocidal maniac group.
[55:06.400 --> 55:12.400]  The young Turks killed a hundred, excuse me, I can't even say the numbers, 1.5 million Christians conservatively.
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.400]  That's all confirmed. He says it doesn't exist and he's named after the murderous group.
[55:17.400 --> 55:20.400]  And he, by the way, wants me off the air and says I'm the worst person in the world.
[55:20.400 --> 55:29.400]  Imagine being that big a sellout and that big a scumbag and the fact that we haven't routed these people easily really makes me feel pathetic.
[55:29.400 --> 55:34.400]  Here's a clip.
[55:34.400 --> 55:53.400]  Of all the financial titans and philanthropists of the 20th century, none are more complex or mysterious than George Soros. Like Carnegie, JP Morgan and the Rockefellers, he amassed billions through ruthless business decisions only to turn around and give away most of his fortune to advance his own personal philosophy.
[55:53.400 --> 56:06.400]  He can move world financial markets simply by voicing an opinion or destabilize a government by buying and selling its currency. He also pledged more aid last year to help people in Russia than the US government did.
[56:06.400 --> 56:11.400]  But now George Soros is worried. He thinks the global economy is coming apart at the scene.
[56:11.400 --> 56:12.400]  Oh, stop right there.
[56:12.400 --> 56:14.400]  The world needs to be protected.
[56:14.400 --> 56:25.400]  We need to do a whole documentary on this. I'm serious and just show how just that interview every two seconds is a lie. Oh, he gives money to Russia to overthrow it on record.
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.400]  He brags about it. He just calls it overthrow if Ukraine tries to overthrow Russia. He calls it philanthropy.
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.400]  Oh, he gives it away. He gives it to his foundation so it's tax exempt.
[56:34.400 --> 56:45.400]  They put hundreds of billions into a foundation. They own and control helicopters, bases, biggest jets, homes, everything tax exempt.
[56:45.400 --> 56:52.400]  And they're philanthropists. They put their money into it. It's so disgusting.
[56:52.400 --> 56:55.400]  By the way, we're not funded by all that. We don't overthrow governments.
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.400]  He stabilizes governments. He's known for overthrowing them. Unbelievable.
[56:59.400 --> 57:06.400]  You want to stop Soros, you want to stop these scumbags, support your local stations, sponsors, become a sponsor and spread the word about the broadcast.
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.400]  Fight them hard. Realize there's a total attack going on here and buy the products at infowarstore.com.

[58:55.400 --> 58:56.400]  It'd take hours.
[58:56.400 --> 59:00.400]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[59:00.400 --> 59:05.400]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[59:05.400 --> 59:09.400]  It's back in stock. The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.

[59:28.400 --> 59:34.400]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[59:34.400 --> 59:35.400]  But you, we couldn't do it.
[59:35.400 --> 59:41.400]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[59:41.400 --> 59:43.400]  but it's other people that aren't awake.
[59:43.400 --> 59:45.400]  It's so essential to spread the word.
[59:45.400 --> 01:00:08.400]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:27.400]  A lot of people picked the wrong team.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.400]  A lot of people bet it on the new world order.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]  They bet it on globalism.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.400]  They bet on corporate crony capitalism using socialism and communism at the grassroots level
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.400]  to enslave and ensnare and dumb down the people.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.400]  And we're not going to get away with it.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:49.400]  Mike Adams at naturalnews.com has been on fire lately.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:57.400]  He is really worried about Hogg and he said weeks before it even came out that he thinks Hogg's the most dangerous person in America
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  and as a globalist operative was no doubt he is one now and very, very dangerous.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.400]  Then we learn he is a anti-human exterminist in his own words.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  So we're going to look at that and take your phone calls and he's going to write a shot then with us for at least an hour and a half
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.400]  because we're going to get into the waterfront here because I blew up the last hour.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.400]  People like that, the ratings go up when I do it but it's not on purpose.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.400]  And I'm not even mad at the grassroots enemies.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.400]  I'm just frustrated I can't wake them up because they're such stooges.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.400]  And then at the same time I know how able to globalist are from their own works.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:39.400]  It's all come out and it's just knowing they're so bad and they're just sitting there plotting against us doing horrible things to the innocent.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:48.400]  Just everywhere they take control they just enslave women, mass murder people and it's just so bizarre.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:57.400]  Now they're out alive in the most radical forms of Islam and we'll talk about the YouTube shooting and all the weirdness there and said that happened.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:06.400]  Peter Thiel meeting with the president to start the operation to try to break up these monopolies and these anti-free speech groups.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.400]  It's so huge as Trump says we're not in a trade war.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.400]  We lost the trade war and now we're fighting back.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.400]  We have like two steel producing facilities left the country and we've been completely deindustrialized.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.400]  That was how the globalists said they would conquer us 50 years ago and they've done it by infiltration and by siphoning off our industry
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:29.400]  and telling us it'd be a great new economic future to have no industry and to have a bunch of drugged out mindless, spoiled rotten brats running around in giant,
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  unskilled third world populations pouring in to be brainwashed to be communist.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:41.400]  So they attacked the middle class as the bankers set off shore, tax exempt, getting rich off taxpayer money, Warren Buffett hundreds of billions,
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:49.400]  the banker bailout, Bezos hundreds and hundreds of billions over the last few decades and tax exemption and get the $1.50 per package.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.400]  They've set $1.48 but it actually on average is $1.50.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.400]  So this is just incredible and you sit there and let this and you go why don't all the top billionaires that are tax exempt,
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.400]  authoritarian, want higher taxes in the middle class and they go shut up racist.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.400]  You know, like, but just have an intellectual debate. No, shut up, shut up, fake news, fake news, fake news.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.400]  They're going to be shut up. You're going to be in prison, you Russian agent.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:22.400]  And I'm just like, you're the globalist agents, you're the minions of the multinational corporations, but they can't understand it.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.400]  They can't get it and it's a cult.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.400]  They are in the delusion that they're in the end club.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.400]  They weren't cool in junior high or high school.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.400]  And so they all want to end up being cool.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.400]  And so the system creates a system where they can be in the cool club.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:56.400]  Now, most of the people that were the coolest in high school on average end up being losers or just moderate level serving serving the the the nerd class like Bezos.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.400]  But that isn't glorifying the nerd class on average.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:10.400]  Because a lot of times that nerd class becomes very, very sadistic, very, very OCD, very, very, very Ash Burgers about their deployment of dominating and overriding people.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:20.400]  And they want to become hyper dominant because they were treated physically as betas, even though mentally you could argue that they were really alphas.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.400]  But they're like twisted alphas because a real alpha wants to build a bigger system for everybody.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.400]  And wants to build a system of competition and celebrate the human continuum.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.400]  Not create a system where they try to make everybody as weak as possible.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:42.400]  So an overclass of brain bugs, you know, can sit there and run the show and, you know, believe their God.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.400]  But still having the deep seated inferiority complex and the hatred of themselves, projected on the general population.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  I'm Alex Jones news wars dot com info wars dot com are the dreaded websites with the dreaded articles and the dreaded videos and Soros wants to stop.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:09.400]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:16.400]  One of them is a powerful pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:26.400]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:32.400]  And we also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:42.400]  But all of these are the very cutting edge top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:48.400]  That is my goal here is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:06:13.400]  When you purchase it and then for store dot com, you know, you are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide from the front lines of the information war.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got really angry in the last hour. It was organic.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:25.400]  Nothing to do with the crew or the show or any of it. I'm just sick of knowing how evil the globalist and their program is.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.400]  And yeah, people are awake. We're taking action. We're fighting back.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:37.400]  But the people really knew how evil the globalist were and what their master plan was people would be in the streets 365 days out of the year.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:47.400]  You would not give any financial support or cultural support to anything leftist. Anything globalist because they are authoritarians and they want to run your life and they're evil.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.400]  Now, they are also not the counterculture. They are the dominant culture.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.400]  Now, Mike Adams is a really smart engineer, best selling author, runs naturalnews.com and dozens of other top sites.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.400]  He also has one of the biggest, most successful labs in the country testing products.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:07.400]  And he's here with us for the next hour and a half at least to break down the waterfront. We just talked during the short break.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.400]  He's got a lot to get into that. I know you're on fire.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:15.400]  And I've known you for, I don't know, 10 years or so and you didn't use to talk like this, but now you do.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.400]  You say, we can feel it. It's a spiritual war. They want to get us. They want to dominate us and they can feel it too.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:29.400]  The residents in the planet, the spirit, whatever it is, is the globalists and their minions are now acting like horror movie zombies at the bottom.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:36.400]  Gremlins above that. And then basically like vampires above that. And I'm not saying actually drink blood, but this is a act of dominance,
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.400]  an act of control, an act of trying to bring us down.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:45.400]  And the good news is, is Peter Thiel and Trump and others are really trying to block this, to try to restart the economy.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:52.400]  As Trump said in a tweet, we're not having a trade war. We're announcing the surrender is over. We lost a trade war in the last 30, 40 years.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.400]  So it's an epic time to be alive. What would you call this period in history, Mike Adams?
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:08.400]  Well, this is the escalation of the spiritual war. This is an all out. I mean, the demonic forces that are trying to destroy life, liberty, abundance, truth, transparency.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:17.400]  It's an all out war. And if I had a mantra for right now, it would be to tell everyone out there, especially the Republicans, stop negotiating with evil.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  Because the left wing has become, it is a cult, like you said. It's a left wing cult. They are out to destroy life.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  These same students that are talking about, oh, guns are killing kids. But they, their only objection to that is that those kids weren't young enough because they love abortion.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400]  They love to murder children in abortion.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:45.400]  And then Hogg, you wrote the best article on it. Hogg is openly on Reddit hating women, hating God and wanting mass death.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.400]  And of course, that's their sack. It's always the same.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.400]  Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, ultimately, look, these people, they're banishing the First Amendment rights of us and many others.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.400]  And I do want to talk about this YouTube shooter if we get a chance because they're just, you got the floor.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:07.400]  You were on fire during that, during that break. I mean, tackling this first, though, specifically to tell people about David Hogg and NBC and what they're doing.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.400]  You want Hogg watch.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:19.400]  Yeah, we launched a website, hoggwatch.com, H-O-G-G, watch.com. And NBC News began trolling it and they rolled out a hit piece.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:27.400]  And their trolls have been badgering and threatening natural news staff and they've been threatening my writers.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:37.400]  And they even tried to take down my nonprofit called the Consumer Wellness Center, not realizing that I am the board of directors of the Consumer Wellness Center.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:45.400]  So they were, they were, they're saying that if we don't take down hoggwatch.com, they're going to destroy the entire business, everything.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.400]  And I just say to these people, you know what? We're standing up to you bullies.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  You try to take away our First Amendment rights or Second Amendment rights, our Fourth Amendment rights.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.400]  You don't think that we have a right to exist.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:03.400]  And I say to you tyrants at NBC News, we are standing up to you bullies because these people like David Hogg, they're used to getting their way.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.400]  They scream and cry and whine in college or high school.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:13.400]  And they cuss at me and they say, seeing in, says take me off the air because I'm critical of Hogg when he's a public figure.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:22.400]  What is it about Hogg? No one is more protected because even Paul Watson, who's from Sheffield, England, they sent a team of reporters from multiple agencies,
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.400]  they're really intelligence operatives, to bang on doors from his high school yearbook to ask people for dirt about Paul.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.400]  Everybody said, no, he was a nice guy. But that's the level of even our writers now.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400]  This is like getting, joining the military to join Info Wars.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:45.400]  It's one step away from us receiving death threats from NBC News fans and trolls who want to take us off the air.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:51.400]  I mean, it's so bad, Alex. I have never, ever seen the media go all out to destroy any voice that's critical of one individual.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:59.400]  And let's be clear, your whole operation has been under the radar, but your media empire is as big as Info Wars.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.400]  Don't say that on the air.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  Well, I mean, here's the thing. That's why they don't know when they're hitting one of your, one of, and it's a good tentacle,
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.400]  one of your tentacles, you've got all these other tentacles, they have no idea.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  They don't get, we're bigger than them in most cases.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  They don't even know that they're attacking this island. They don't understand that there's a huge mountain underneath the water.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  Well, look, that's the truth. I mean, Info Wars is bigger than MSNBC, bigger than the Washington Post in terms of your actual audience.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:30.400]  Our, our media base is bigger than, you know, CNN for sure. No question about it because we have so many different sites.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  One of those sites that we launched is hogwash.com, which has no advertisers, by the way.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  And the NBC News, by the way, I'm talking to you at one in the morning, you're working at one in the morning to put these artists out and fight.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400]  You're on fire.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.400]  Yeah, yeah, it's we're totally dedicated to defending the Second Amendment and defending liberty and freedom.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:54.400]  And most importantly, Alex is standing up for a right to speak. We have a right to criticize someone like David Hogg who wants to take away our liberties.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:03.400]  We have David Hogg says he hopes we all die. He wants billions of mosquitoes for the earth, but he really cares about 16 students and once that's taken off the air.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  But you pointed this out how his message of thanking the death of what he says is billions of people from mosquitoes is saving the environment that is so aligned with the globalist agenda.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.400]  This is exactly what they say as well, that we have to have depopulation, they say.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:24.400]  Plus the thing is, I've never said he was a crisis actor. I said he sings from high level sheet of music.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.400]  Everything coming out of his mouth is a Soros talking point.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:34.400]  And the women's march is 100% fun about Soros and they admit it took over these kids the day after the event on February 15th of this year.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  This is a Soros production.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.400]  So of course the mouth of Soros though a year ago was saying I want to depopulate the earth.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.400]  And notice we broke that last Friday. You pushed it. Everybody talked about it.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.400]  No one, they didn't challenge it. They didn't pick it up because they know it's true.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.400]  The guy that wants to save the children just dreams of billions of dead.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:06.400]  And right now, think about today, the mainstream media has dropped the YouTube shooter story because the shooter turned out to be a farsi speaking left wing animal rights vegan activist.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.400]  All of a sudden doesn't fit their narrative. It's a woman, right? Doesn't fit the narrative.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.400]  They wanted it to be, they were drooling. You saw this yesterday, they were drooling.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.400]  Nancy Pelosi came out within 20 minutes and said it's band guns, it's right wingers, right here.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.400]  They thought, oh, it's going to be NRA, it's going to be a Trump supporter, it's going to be someone, you know what though?
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:28.400]  There is a big issue that we need to cover here that YouTube has put its employees, I believe, in the line of fire.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:35.400]  Because some deranged, twisted individuals like that woman are going to be, they're going to snap.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  They were censored and demonetized and some of them are going to snap and do what she did.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.400]  Even though we never want to see that happen, we don't want harm to come to YouTube employees.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  We do want YouTube regulated. We do want them to stop censorship.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:53.400]  We don't want harm to come to them, but they're ruining the lives of many people who are going to snap from time to time.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400]  And those YouTube-
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.400]  I mean, I wouldn't mess with somebody who looks like that.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  She's very passionate about her belief system. You can tell by her videos. She's very passionate.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.400]  But obviously, obviously she was pushed a little bit too far.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.400]  And the censorship that YouTube-
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  I'm going to say, I think one looks, one looks like that. That's a scary person.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  Well, yeah, sure. Yeah, she is. She's dead now.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.400]  The one shot that she got accurate was the shot to her own head, apparently.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.400]  The rest of the shots, she didn't, apparently no one died at this point, correct?
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400]  Yes.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400]  She's just injured, but not dead.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.400]  Thank God.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.400]  But I would say today, all of these tech giants, they need to be calling security companies.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.400]  They need to be rethinking concealed carry policies.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  Well, we got concealed carry here. We got guys with guns driving around the building.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400]  Yeah, I said hi to them on my way in.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.400]  You're packing right now?
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400]  Yeah, he knew I was carrying, by the way.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.400]  No, you're pulling out.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.400]  No, no, it's all right.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.400]  Well, no, it's America. Go ahead and show us your case.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.400]  No, it's okay. I'll keep it concealed.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]  Show us your clock. We're inside a building. You show us, show us.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  No, it's all right. It's all right.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.400]  But I'll show you.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400]  I'll show you during the break.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400]  How about that?
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  But I do carry concealed here and everywhere else, you know, because it's my legal right to defend myself.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400]  YouTube employees are in the line of fire.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  A hail of bullets come in their way, and they have no means to defend themselves.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.400]  So if you're a YouTube employee, I think you're thinking today,
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:17.400]  what have my employers put me into here where you could be killed by someone that you banned, that you censored,
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.400]  and your employer is not doing anything to protect you?
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.400]  I mean, that's a legitimate question that needs to be asked today.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.400]  And it's not just YouTube, it's Google, it's Facebook, it's Twitter.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.400]  They need to be beefing up security, most importantly, rethinking their gun-free zone policies
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.400]  because gun-free zones don't work.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.400]  Just proved it again yesterday.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400]  So obvious.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.400]  When we return, I want to get into all these other subjects, the censorship,
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.400]  but also arresting preppers in California now.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.400]  We're going to look at it all.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.400]  We're going to open the phones up later as well.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.400]  Got a bunch of Trump clips straight ahead.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:53.400]  And I'm going to be doing a press conference in D.C. coming up next week.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.400]  The details of that are on infowars.com.

[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:32.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:41.400]  We're going to have open phones coming up at the end of this hour into the entire third hour with Mike Adams, the health ranger, naturalnews.com.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:48.400]  But let me tell you, he's got some of the most powerful sites out there, an amazing crew, offices in Asia, offices in the US.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  He's been global for a long time. And the same thing happened to you that happened to me before.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.400]  We were under the radar and they would try to act like we weren't big in an audience. They already knew that.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.400]  Then they started their attack because now they know they can't ignore us.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400]  And of course now they're coming after you worse than ever.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:10.400]  The audience has to understand this. When he says he's bigger than CNN, you look at the numbers.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.400]  Before they changed the Alexa numbers to make it fraudulent, we were thousands of times bigger than MSNBC's website.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:21.400]  They are frauds. They are jokes. This show has millions of listeners an hour confirmed.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.400]  CNN, MSNBC don't have that combined.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.400]  We had 86 million viewers and listeners the week of the election.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  That's double what it usually is. It's usually 40-something million.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:35.400]  With all their censorship, through the last year, we're still at the same level 40-something million a week.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.400]  They actually listen, tune in, or watch us conservatively.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.400]  So despite everything they've thrown at us, we're still the same size.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.400]  Despite all that, it's created a Streisand effect. So now they're filing a lawsuit a week against us.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:56.400]  And even Buzzfeed and even a major publications came out like Daily Beast and quoted lawyers that aren't even my fans going,
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.400]  this is very dangerous for you.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:06.400]  These are 60, 70, 80-page demonization campaigns that talk about separate things that you say Jones did that, by the way, better be true
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.400]  because they're all quoting the defamation outside of court.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.400]  You can file a document and have defamation in it and it's protected.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.400]  That's what they're doing with these suits.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.400]  They put lies in a big report and the media puts it out that it's in a lawsuit.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:23.400]  Now the strategy is just to occupy your time, your energy, and your money. That's the strategy.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.400]  They know they can't win in court. They know that these will be dismissed,
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.400]  but you're going to have to pay a certain amount of money to have them dismissed.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  And they don't even care that there's slap provisions and they'll have to pay the money for the lawsuits at the end of the day.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.400]  They've got unlimited funding to try to just destroy your life.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:43.400]  Now look, I think part of the answer here, you know, Google banned naturalnews.com a year ago for six days.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:48.400]  They made up a BS reason, total nonsense, technical reason, and then they restored it.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400]  YouTube banned my channel, you know, weeks ago.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.400]  They haven't completely banned your channel yet, but they've been interfering with your live broadcasts.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.400]  The answer to this, this de-platforming effort, is to build their own platforms.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.400]  Like, you've got this operation. I've got an operation as well.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.400]  I'm launching real.video, as you know, which is going to carry Infowars channels.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.400]  Right.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.400]  That system is being built to handle a billion video views a month.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.400]  It's a serious effort.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.400]  We're putting, we're committed over a million dollars into that effort.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.400]  We've got over 16,000 people signed up for it right now.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  And by the way, all the guns and firearms companies are coming to us and requesting channels because they're all being banned off YouTube.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  Oh, it's a beautiful, perfect name, everything.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.400]  The answer is to build our own platforms because there's a fragmentation of the internet.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:37.400]  YouTube is turning into a radical left-wing echo chamber, a bubble of fairy tales and delusional thinking.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.400]  And notice, the Facebook is too, and it's tanking their views, tanking their likes, tanking their traffic, and tanking their money.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:47.400]  But they're still committed, even though they lost $40 billion the last month.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.400]  Well, absolutely.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:54.400]  And the reason, see, they would go after your advertisers, but you've got a product base to offer.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.400]  And by the way, this is something I didn't even mention, I was going to mention this,
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:10.400]  but one of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:17.400]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy,
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.400]  they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.400]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product and you've got the neotropics and all these other products.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.400]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.400]  The cobwebs go away and they start being able to see with Clary what's happening in the world.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:40.400]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up and the nutrition to wake them up.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400]  I mean, the brain is a physical organ.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:49.400]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  Here's my problem.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:59.400]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.400]  Now, most people are...
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400]  I miss you.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.400]  Yeah.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.400]  Because then you're just like...
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.400]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.400]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.400]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.400]  And I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.400]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.400]  We went out with the top labs.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.400]  We want the strongest concentrate of it out there.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.400]  And Mike, you didn't...
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.400]  You were going to break your sin.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  You were going to...
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  Because you've tested the products.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.400]  You've studied the products.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.400]  You've looked at the products.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  You were saying that you really like bodies and you think it's a top of the line turmeric product.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.400]  And there's so much research on turmeric.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.400]  It's just incredible.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.400]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.400]  universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400]  This is key.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.400]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  And you have inflammation of the brain.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400]  They call that something down the road.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  They call that something else down the road.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.400]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blalock and other top brain surgeons on and they say it's inflammation in the brain.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.400]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.400]  Now, your product is an extract.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.400]  And we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.400]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.400]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.400]  The heavy metals stay in the root.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.400]  So the turmeric root has lead in it.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.400]  Some lead.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.400]  Well, that's another reason behind that.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.400]  The top lab we ended up using to make this said that they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400]  Because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400]  Exactly.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400]  So the other ones just grind up the root.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.400]  It's got some heavy metal in it.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  You don't want that.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.400]  You want this extract.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.400]  There's another factor.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.400]  We have a microbiology lab.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.400]  So we test everything for E. Coli, Salmonella, and what's called a total plate count test.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:01.400]  Turmeric root, the raw root is one of the worst offenders in terms of total plate count and microbiology because it's grown in the soil.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.400]  When you do the extract, you leave all that behind as well.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.400]  So you end up with a product that is really, really clean and pristine.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.400]  And it concentrates the curcuminoids, which makes it more effective and more easily absorbed.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.400]  You start to absorb it, frankly.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.400]  These are capsules, right?
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.400]  Yes.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:20.400]  I mean, I would say to people, they should open up the capsule, put it in their mouth, and they would begin to...
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.400]  Oh, a tablet?
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.400]  Well, that...
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.400]  Yeah, you can show it.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400]  This is my drink.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.400]  It's powdered.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.400]  It's American in my drink.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.400]  I mean, that's your obsessed with it.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.400]  For five years, I've seen you in here at least every day at launch carrying those when you come over.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.400]  I know.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400]  Here, it's powdered.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.400]  No color.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.400]  No coloring.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  Look how orange it is.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.400]  You should open them up and put them in your mouth.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.400]  That's the most effective and rapid way to do this.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.400]  Because then your saliva helps break it down more.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.400]  And you start to absorb it immediately.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.400]  So...
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.400]  Look how orange that is.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.400]  Well, right.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.400]  The curcuminoids...
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.400]  Most of them are like yellow or white, and they're not even.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.400]  It's just the root.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400]  This is concentrated.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.400]  And a lot of other companies, they'll use, like, carrier junk stuff, like corn, maltodextrin from GMO Corn.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.400]  So they'll mix a little bit of this with, like, 10 times more corn filler, maltodextrin...
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.400]  And no fillers here.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400]  Right.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.400]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.400]  The information to awaken them, and the nutrition.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:16.400]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.400]  Our world is more complex than ever before.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.400]  The information coming at you, the attacks coming at you from multiple vectors are so complex,
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.400]  you need to have adaptogenic capabilities.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  No, it's true.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.400]  I mean, one reason I've been more praised is, I'm doing more of the juices.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.400]  Good job.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.400]  And I'm still doing bad stuff to myself, but I mean, it's helping me.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400]  Problem is, I drink juices, I get craved.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.400]  Like, if I just have juice and work out like this morning, I come in here and my brain works better,
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400]  but I'm bouncing off the walls.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.400]  Hey, if I don't have superfoods, I can't function at the level I'm functioning at.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400]  Yeah, so we're not just here saying, hey, buy this.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.400]  We're doing it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.400]  We are.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400]  I mean, Mike, more than me, and this guy's working 18 hours a day.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.400]  We'll be back with the big news.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:29:21.400]  Please stay with us.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.400]  Dips free at fullycookedbacon.com, fullycookedbacon.com.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:56.400]  Or no tax on my website, danpilla.com.
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.400]  Now it's 50% off.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.400]  That means we've got a 25% markup.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.400]  And we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.400]  Brainforce takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:48.400]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at infohorsalife.com.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.400]  It's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:31:18.400]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infohorsetour.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:24.400]  I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infohorsetour.com.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:31.400]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.400]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.400]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:50.400]  That's infohorsalife.com or triple-A-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:32:10.400]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.400]  I would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.400]  Thank you.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:28.400]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who are big normal toothpaste fans.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:33.400]  The super blue is awesome and thank you so much Alex for the infohorselife products.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.400]  They are quality.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:39.400]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.400]  Absolutely.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:53.400]  And we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:23.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:28.400]  Mother, tell your children not to worry.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.400]  By the way, during the break, Mike is obsessed with tumor because so many other people are.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.400]  He's a leading expert in it.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.400]  And how strong is that that you took?
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.400]  Oh, it's super potent.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.400]  I mean, the taste is still there.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.400]  Alex, I want to taste some of this during the break.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.400]  Look, this is a super food.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.400]  This has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.400]  It's been used in Chinese medicine.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:58.400]  In modern science, if you go on to the National Library of Medicine and you start searching for turmeric or curcumin, which is one of the phytochemicals in it, and you look at the medical research, it's tremendous.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.400]  And we're covering some of this, by the way.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.400]  We got a website, herbs.news, that talks.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.400]  No, wait a minute.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.400]  Turmeric.news, we have a website called turmeric.news, people can read all about it.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.400]  And that's what's in bodies, and it is super, super potent.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400]  We just, we publish all the science on it.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:26.400]  And again, the FDA doesn't want people talking about it, even though folks need to know what's in the mainline science about Alzheimer's.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.400]  What's in the mainline science about the things that are going on with all these neurological disorders with migraines.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.400]  It's all there, and as citizens, we have that free speech.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.400]  If you think about it, you got the cell phone assault.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400]  You have chemical assault.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.400]  Look, yeah, look at those headlines on Turmeric.news.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.400]  Look, I have a massive team.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:49.400]  As you know, we scour over 1,300 academic and science and medicine journals every day.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:57.400]  And we find all the news on Turmeric and blueberries and green tea and CBD oil, you know, hemp extracts.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.400]  And we, by the way, don't get anybody high, it's on record they help with inflammation, help with all sorts of stuff.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.400]  Absolutely.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.400]  But they don't want you to have that.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:10.400]  No, no, the whole system, it's just in the same way that they don't want you to have access to independent information.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:16.400]  They also don't want you to have access to natural medicine, natural cures, foods and spices that are healing.
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:22.400]  You know, the official position of the FDA is that there's no such thing as a food that can prevent any disease, which is absolute nonsense.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.400]  I mean, an orange will cure scurvy.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.400]  Right. Yeah, I mean, and vitamin D cures rickets.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.400]  You know, rickets is a disease of vitamin D deficiency.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.400]  And you'll die without iodine.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.400]  Absolutely. You'll die without calcium.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.400]  You know, you'll die without many of these nutrients.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.400]  Next they're going to say you can't say you must have oxygen to live.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.400]  Right, right. Well, they'll tax you for it like Al Gore for exhaling.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.400]  You know, oh, you breathe in oxygen and you created carbon dioxide.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.400]  You're evil and you need to be depopulated.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.400]  You know, that's their insane opinion.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:59.400]  But look, the point is, you have to, if you're going to be part of this liberty movement of truth and transparency,
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.400]  you've got to be aggressive.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.400]  You've got to be aggressive.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.400]  You've got to be healthy.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.400]  Stop negotiating with evil.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.400]  Don't become a slave of the pharmaceutical cartels.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400]  Get off junk foods, everybody.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.400]  Get off junk foods.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.400]  Get off soda.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.400]  Get off the addictive opioids and the addictive substances.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.400]  Now, you notice how California has required coffee companies to put a cancer warning on coffee.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.400]  It's total nonsense.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.400]  It's absolute nonsense.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.400]  There's so many thousands of studies on coffee and preventing cancer.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:35.400]  Coffee is one of the healthiest sources of liver enhancing phytonutrients in the diet of the typical American.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.400]  And by the way, I mean, the more cutting-edge medical doctors will even tell people what liver problems drink coffee.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:40.400]  Absolutely.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.400]  Coffee.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.400]  Look, coffee has the bitters as they're called in Chinese medicine or other forms of medicine.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.400]  And the liver needs these bitters in order to function correctly.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.400]  Our mainstream food diet has been stripped of all of the medicine.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.400]  People want iceberg lettuce, not the bitter lettuce, which is actually more medicinal.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.400]  Your salad should taste bitter.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400]  That's the medicine.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:09.400]  But coffee brings you that those bitters, as they're called, those alkaloids and other chemicals or phytochemicals that are very, very potent and enhanced liver function.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.400]  But my point, Alex, here is brain function.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:22.400]  You can't process this information about what's happening in our world unless you have very adaptive and very responsive neurological and cognitive function.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.400]  You have to be able to learn, remember information.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:30.400]  The mainstream media, they want to make sure that people can't remember what they just reported yesterday.
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.400]  Well, that's what Gruber always said.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.400]  He said, thank God we made their attention span seven seconds.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.400]  Yes.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400]  And thank God they don't remember anything.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.400]  That's their whole thing is built on that.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.400]  But I've always had a really, really great memory as I've gotten older, it's not photographing anymore.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:48.400]  But as I take the supplements, as I take the body's turmeric, as I remember to take the X2, because there's a lot of stuff you've got to take, a lot of supplements.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.400]  So I remember to do more of the, you know, a green drink just from the local, you know, juice place.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.400]  Then I've got so much more energy.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.400]  I'm so much more focused.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.400]  I feel so much more better, even though I work 18 hours a day.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:06.400]  And they know that if they can convince you you have cancer, which is usually a fraud, the PSA test for prostate cancer for men is an absolute medical hoax.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.400]  It's a complete fraud.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.400]  But if they can scare you into it and they can convince you to start undergoing chemotherapy, the number one side effect of chemotherapy is chemo brain.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.400]  It damages your brain function.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.400]  It also damages your heart and your liver and your kidneys.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.400]  And it causes more cancer.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:28.400]  The minute you undergo chemotherapy, you can no longer process information correctly, which is why, by the way, one of our Supreme Court justice.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.400]  It's blood poison.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400]  It's poison.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.400]  But she underwent chemotherapy, Ginsburg.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:41.400]  And she should not be on the Supreme Court, in my opinion, because she is, she has been cognitively impaired by toxic chemotherapy, which is based on chemical weapons.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.400]  By the way, they're saying she hasn't known who she is for a while.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:50.400]  Yeah, yeah, she needs, she, she's just trying to hang in there so she can keep, you know, the liberal agenda going.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:39:00.400]  But we have people in Congress, people in the Senate, you know, Nancy Pelosi is famous for this Hillary Clinton herself, who are cognitively so impaired, they should be pulled out of public office.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.400]  They are a disservice to our Republic because they, they cannot make decisions in the interest of the people.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:08.400]  They are so brain damaged, they're on mass medications.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:15.400]  There are pharmacies that feed pills to members of Congress and members of the Senate who are practically on chemical life support.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:19.400]  And they're the ones who are voting to take away our guns and take away our rights.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.400]  And they've all got their own, they've all got their own bodyguards.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:35.400]  And what upsets me about all this is that clearly they're mentally ill, but then somebody like Soros, almost nine years old, who is just involved in all these attacks and all this disgusting behavior.
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.400]  Where do you think this fight's going overall?
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.400]  Well, they're, they're in a desperate stage now, Alex.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:47.400]  They are trying to destroy not only our First Amendment and Second Amendment rights, but destroy all of us who are pro-liberty.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:52.400]  By the way, this isn't rhetoric. We're here. This is going on.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:40:01.400]  We are receiving, you know, not just the normal death threats, but the kinds of tactics being used against us now are attempting to completely obliterate our existence.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:11.400]  It's the same thing with Trump. They're knocking on every door of anyone that ever bought a condo, anyone that ever rented a condo, anyone that plays golf at the golf course, harassing everyone, asking questions to everybody,
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:18.400]  asking everybody's bank accounts, dragging everybody. Same thing to us. Same thing to Paul Watson. It's just pure harassment.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:23.400]  Yes, but these are desperate days. Remember that their attempts of censorship come from their position of weakness.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:29.400]  If they were really strong, they wouldn't mind our voices being out there because we would be unconvincing to people.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:36.400]  The reason they're attacking you so much, Alex, is because you are making so much sense that you're awakening people to what's happening.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:42.400]  You are a danger to their agenda. And to some extent, I am as well. And that's why we're being so viciously attacked.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.400]  But we have to recognize that that's from a position of weakness on their part.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:51.400]  No, you're right. And what do you make of Trump meeting with Peter Thiel to begin the plan of who to target, who to break up?
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:59.400]  I mean, they're clearly monopolies. They advertise themselves as utilities. Now that these giant censors, they're helping territorial regimes like China round up their own people.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:04.400]  Twitter, Facebook, all of these groups are just terrible organizations.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.400]  Well, Peter's going to have some really valuable input for President Trump, no doubt on this point.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.400]  And these tech companies have become more powerful than governments.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:19.400]  What I noticed is that the First Amendment was written to protect the right of free speech and religious expression from government oppression.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:27.400]  But it did not encompass corporate attacks on free speech because the Bill of Rights was written at a time when corporations were not more powerful than governments.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.400]  It was government.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.400]  Exactly.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:38.400]  But so now the First Amendment needs to be expanded to include large, dominant corporate run platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and others.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.400]  That's where this needs to go.
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.400]  Well, I mean, it's the way the gay couple didn't get their cake back. So they got $500,000. I think that's extreme.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.400]  But I think if you're running a business, you know, unless something's profane or whatever, you should do it.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:56.400]  But how can they then censor all of us or censor stuff you did up against genocide when they took your videos down and said you can't expose genocide?
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:03.400]  So again, they're a giant platform. They're a giant marketplace. And it's false advertising saying that you're welcome there, but then you're not.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:11.400]  Well, but they are losing so badly. The strategy is going to lose because by deep platforming us, they force us to form our own platforms like I already mentioned.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:15.400]  By attacking us, they energize us. They motivate us.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:22.400]  I have never been more dedicated to protecting liberty, not just for myself, Alex, but for supporting and protecting and providing for other people.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:28.400]  And we're all in this together. So many other sites and people like, oh, good, if info were to get shut down, we'll have more, more, more traffic.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.400]  That doesn't work like that. We're building the liberty movement. When I see somebody else being shut down or blocked, I feel it.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400]  Yes. Like I'm being stabbed. Somebody else is stabbed.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.400]  And I want to help them. We want to give them a voice because they are us.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.400]  That's right.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400]  And these fools don't understand that we the people.
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:48.400]  Exactly. We're not collective as we're individualists, but we are collectively tied together and have to have collective action when we individually know it's the right thing to do.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.400]  And that is the true collective, not the false collective. That's why we will win.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.400]  That's why we'll win. We're the real collective.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.400]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:10.400]  It's mycozx plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract with even bigger, organic, manufacturer and producer scalability.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:20.400]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, mycozx.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.400]  Now it's the other side of the equation. Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.400]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:40.400]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of syracism.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:46.400]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.400]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:56.400]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved mycozx plus now from the Info Wars store.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:00.400]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:07.400]  We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.400]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there. It's very simple.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.400]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best, we'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:23.400]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:31.400]  It's $19.95 right now, so you get an incredible top-of-the-line new tropic for $19.95.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:37.400]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.400]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:48.400]  I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:57.400]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing. M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLive.com, or AAA-253-33139.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:09.400]  I'm so excited. The new product at M4WarsLive.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:17.400]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:29.400]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw of medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.400]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:47.400]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:57.400]  It is amazing. Red pill, now available at M4WarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:04.400]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in M4WarsLive. It'd take hours.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:12.400]  Michael ZX Plus, it now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:20.400]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglinone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:34.400]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids. So you can upload it. And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:41.400]  It's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:49.400]  Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering M4WarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:56.400]  but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:35.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:45.400]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.400]  All right, we're going to open the phones up in the next hour. I want to hear from you on any subject we've raised, any topic you want to raise.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:58.400]  Mike Adams, the HealthRangerNaturalNews.com is here. 877-789-Alex. 877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.400]  And let's do first time callers that they haven't done that in a few weeks. 877-789-Alex.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.400]  I blew up in the first hour quite a bit. It had nothing to do with the crew. I kind of talked about some things there.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:17.400]  Because George Soros makes me so mad that when I see Sink of the Young Turds and they met with the Armenian Genocide group,
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.400]  can't make that up against Christians and I see CNN saying, I'm a liar. I made it up that he was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:32.400]  When he's on CBS saying it, it just shows you there's not anywhere they won't go. They are. They are so low. They are so out of control.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:39.400]  877-789-2539. Now I should start these broadcasts with all the great clips the crew gets that are so amazing.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:46.400]  So I want to start getting to some of these because we've got just so much here to cover.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:55.400]  I want to get into George Ramos says Trump wants to make America white again. Tucker blows him away because it's the left pushing the race-based politics.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.400]  We've got White House says they're about to announce when they're getting the troops out of Syria. That's a big thing that Trump's delivering on.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.400]  We've got the YouTube shooter brothers, his family, warm police, other stand down, a YouTuber witness.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:10.400]  I wish I'd had a gun. Suspect YouTube shooting posted rants. I want to play some of that.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.400]  We've got a bunch of these clips here that are really, really, really, really critical.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:20.400]  But first off, getting to Trump, he's not a dictator. I'm not saying I want him to be a dictator. The media always says that when I say that.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:27.400]  He's having to work with cars for everybody else, but he gave them a reasonable DACA that he said he supported during the campaign of people that have been here decades
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:34.400]  and don't have a criminal record. Yeah, we'll fast track you to citizenship. I'm for that too. A lot of great people.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:42.400]  We've got people that are here legally on student visas from Mexico that work here that now have their degrees and are working here and they do it all legally.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:48.400]  They're great people. They do a great job. Boom. Some of them have been only here a couple of years and are already doing management stuff because they're smart, hardworking people.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:56.400]  Boom, you're in. But if you've had four or five times you've been deported because you're DWI or armed robbery, you're ass didn't come back.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:04.400]  And the next time you come here, you don't get five years in prison. And that's only reasonable. So Mike Adams is here with us breaking all this down.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:12.400]  But notice Trump, for all the fair weather patriots that got so mad at him and culture who likes to, you know, be the guardian of everything and pull stunts.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.400]  And I'm not against her. This is good to have somebody keeping people honest. But with Trump, that's not what's happening.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:23.400]  Now he rejects all DACA because they weren't reasonable. It's going to put troops on the border until the walls built.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:29.400]  So that's the best idea ever, which is exactly what everybody always said is common sense. That's what the military is supposed to be.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:35.400]  So he's talking about having a press conference and a. This is the inside baseball are from a high level white outsource two weeks ago.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.400]  I didn't want to say it at the time. Now I know it's about to come out. I wasn't told, don't talk about it.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:44.400]  But they said, just just just don't even mention the White House till later. Well, now is the time to do it.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:50.400]  And they're going to have this parade and it's going to be celebrating pulling troops out of several countries.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:55.400]  And I can tell you that they're just waiting. Trump's pushing the Pentagon to do it. So we're going to have this parade.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:04.400]  And then we're going to deploy a large portion of those folks and they're going to rotate through so they get time with their family for a few months and then rotate back and forth.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:09.400]  You're going to have rotations and you're going to end up having a permanent military force on the border, which is in the Constitution.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:15.400]  So boom, there it is. Total delivery of what Trump said he would do. China is almost 900 billion.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:20.400]  And I know your wife's from that area. So you're an expert. You have businesses outside China.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.400]  Taiwan, by the way, nothing. Taiwan is China.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:26.400]  But the free area, the real government. Free China.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:31.400]  And so to see Trump doing all this, and we know they're up to 900 billion, if you count the intellectual property a year, they steal.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.400]  He's absolutely on target. As he said, we already surrendered decades ago. The surrender's over.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:43.400]  And it's very reasonable open negotiations. This is tactic where, hey, you know, 50 billion here.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:46.400]  Okay, you're doing it. Stop it. They go, no, they hit back with a bunch of garbage.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.400]  Now he's going to hit back even harder, just like the DACA thing.
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.400]  Trump has a formula. He has a formula. He's a counterpuncher.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:52:00.400]  And he's doing what needs to be done. Protecting the borders is a constitutionally mentioned role of the United States military.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:06.400]  California is destroying our nation from within by allowing illegals to openly cross the border.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:10.400]  They are the drawbridge. They're giving them voting rights.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:16.400]  And then they're voting for California senators and members of Congress who are then dictating federal law to the entire country.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:24.400]  California needs to be, if they're not going to fix up and clean up their voting, they need to be denied all senators and members of Congress as far as I'm concerned.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.400]  Because those are not elected by American people.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:34.400]  We need to start clamping down on this and we need to protect the borders and stop the invasion of America.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400]  And that's what Trump is willing to do.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:41.400]  This is a 21st century war. This is a war. We're in a war.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:47.400]  I'm not saying I'm like military charging machine gun nest, but this is 21st century war where they're going to attack your family.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:51.400]  They're going to attack you. They're going to pour coffee on you. They're going to shoot you sometimes.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:57.400]  The left, if you've not seen, I'm not going to name names, but they all overlapped this media going, Alex Jones' son is a captive.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:01.400]  He's brainwashed. He doesn't need to be on air. We're concerned about it.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:06.400]  They're all for their own young people being anti-gun, but because he's pro-gun, they want him off the air.
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:13.400]  And then they say things like, well, Jones got his start in Sinclair Broadcasting is that whole thing about them scripting things.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:20.400]  But I've never been on one Sinclair station, not one Sinclair station of those TV stations. That is fundamentally lies.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.400]  But that's what the media does. They just push total lies.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:31.400]  How insane is it that they accuse your son of being brainwashed when he is pro-human rights, which is the right of self-defense.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:37.400]  It is a natural divine right. And Rex is pro-human rights. That's the natural state of things.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:43.400]  And then you have David Hogg, who is obviously being practiced and rehearsed in debate tactics.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:49.400]  I wasn't in the room when Rex shot those videos. I was on air. He taped them and they're exactly David Hogg.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:55.400]  They're not feeding him lines, but David Hogg is being fed lines very clearly. It's obvious. You talk about being brainwashed.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:01.400]  Well, Bill Gates says we need to use mosquitoes with pathogens in them to lower population.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:10.400]  He said that at Ted TV, to lower the population growth to zero. Why is Hogg stating an exterminous eugenics statement?
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.400]  Yeah, well, we know why. But hey, there's a caller. First time caller.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:18.400]  We're going to go to him. We're going to start the next hour, but I've got to ask you this. Mike loves the calls. We're going to do it. I promise.
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:27.400]  I've got to ask you this. I promise. Why? Why is the left so desperate? You said you were going to break because we're winning.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:36.400]  They know that the only way they can defeat us is to break our will. And these campaigns that target you and me are actually mental terrorism.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.400]  They are torment campaigns to break your will. They know they can't break your...
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:47.400]  But it's the opposite. I've got so much energy now. I'm so honored to be... I'm not just saying that. They don't get it because they're all selfish people.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.400]  They don't get that this is a real honor.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:57.400]  They think that we are weaklings like they are because that's all they're surrounded with is weak, pathetic people. That's who they are. They're left-wing cult.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:04.400]  They're not used to meeting strength. They're not used to somebody standing up and asserting their right to exist as a conscious human being.
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:14.400]  They're not used to somebody saying, I have the right to defend not only my person, my property, my family, but my country. This republic must be defended and we have that right as well.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:25.400]  They've known that the West has had that spirit particularly strong and that's why they're trying to crush it. They're trying to stamp out that individual spirit that is the fire of the permethean energy of all the technology and everything else.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:30.400]  And it's only a byproduct of that spirit that all human groups have, but it's particularly strong in the West. Why?
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:39.400]  And spiritually, if you give in to the left, you fail the divine test of this life. You fail God. If you give in and you surrender...
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:45.400]  By the way, I've known you for 10 years or longer, 12 years. You didn't used to be this. What was the metamorphosis of you becoming knowing it's spiritual?
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:57.400]  It's a realization that you come to. When you are in the center of these attacks, you begin to see the seething evil and the demonic forces that are targeting you.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:22.400]  Look at this Pope. He is an agent of Satan. I have to say it. I know it's controversial, but he's an agent of Satan. Satan has taken over this Vatican. It hasn't been that way in previous...
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:30.400]  Because they're making their move right now. It's this one. Yes. I mean, look at what he promotes. Destructive, anti-life ideas, anti-liberty.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.400]  You know, liberty is a divine right. God wants you to be free. And he can't help it, even though he'll get destroyed doing it.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:43.400]  He's just recklessly trying to break the church up. And the members were good. The churches had corruption and problems for a long time, obviously.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:53.400]  But the people, on average, were pro-family, pro-God, pro-life. And he's saying, no, no, no, no. Open your borders. Lower your drawbridges. Get rid of your family. Christ is not real. I don't want to hear about Christianity.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:57:02.400]  I don't want to hear about, you know, there is no hell. And it's sitting there attacking the very... If you want to go be an atheist and say there's no hell, that's fine, Pope. But you're not the Pope.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:10.400]  The key is, when you look at some of these people like that, you have to realize they're not fully qualified human beings. They are demons. They all look arranged.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:19.400]  They are demons. They have a look. It's like Brian Skelter and others. And the Pope, they all have this. They do. I mean, what does that look?
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:27.400]  They're not human beings inside anymore. That's the thing. Literally, the soul has been replaced. It's been drained out and replaced.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:33.400]  And you're a scientist. I mean, you're a top engineer. And you should not believe this stuff. But now you've seen it.
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:39.400]  I see it. I see it happening. It is real. The spiritual war is here. No question about it. It's here.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:46.400]  Absolutely, folks. I mean, it is. It is unbelievable. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We'll take your phone calls.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:57.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us in Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:10.400]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the informal war.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:22.400]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year. And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:37.400]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:47.400]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:59:02.400]  InfoWarsLife Brainforce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason. Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:22.400]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have 150%. Then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:37.400]  Brainforce takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge. They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:50.400]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out. InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brainforce Plus and real red pill today.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:57.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:24.400]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:53.400]  There's this Joker face that the globalists make and their minions make. We pull Brian Stelter or pull up Wolf or pull up the Pope.
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:01:02.400]  And when I showed this look where they don't realize how crazy they look, and I can't even make the face exactly, but it's this.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:09.400]  They said, oh my God, you're attacking Jews. And I didn't even think Brian Stelter was Jewish or the Pope's not Jewish.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:14.400]  And they just injected that in on the young Turks and seeing it in everywhere that I was attacking Jews.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:23.400]  Well, Brian Stelter's not even Jewish. I actually looked it up. I didn't think that. That isn't a Jewish look. That's a Jack Nicholson style look.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:29.400]  I mean, it's a look. And it's like people in these cults have that look. You know, it's the subway guy look.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:38.400]  And there's just something predatory. The eyes have it. Absolutely. Webster Hubbell's daughter, Chelsea Clinton has it. Pennywise has it.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:45.400]  I'm not saying Pennywise is Jewish. I thought it was an interdimensional spider. But what do you call that look?
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:57.400]  A demonic to me. I mean, look, it's a predatory look, like you said, but it's someone who knows that they're seething with evil on the inside and they are enjoying it.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.400]  Because that's what they're working for. They're working for evil.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:09.400]  That's why I say as a mantra here, almost stop negotiating with evil. We are not here to get along with these radical left wing evil operators.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.400]  We are here to defeat them.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:17.400]  Exactly. They think when they intimidate us or attack us or do something to us that we're losing, we're getting stronger.
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:23.400]  But the point that I can hardly contain it in the first hour, I'm so angry at them. It's the opposite. I've never felt stronger.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:30.400]  I've never wanted to be anywhere else, but now it's just unbelievable as they turn up the evil against us.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:36.400]  God, the real force in the universe, turns it back up on them and it's like, I don't know how much more of this I can handle.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:43.400]  Well, they've done a deal with the devil, so to speak, and they gain power from their evil and how many other people they destroy.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:51.400]  I mean, look at who promotes those news networks like CNN, pharma companies, big pharma companies that poison people's minds.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:53.400]  Meanwhile, soul killers.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:03.400]  You are here promoting products that enhance nutrition, that clean water, that boosts cognitive function, that prevent issues that people might be dealing with.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:10.400]  Just think about it. What fun CNN is pharmaceutical money based on human lab rat experiments.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:12.400]  That's their main fund or human experimentation.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.400]  And then they demonize us shelling high quality products.
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:17.400]  Exactly. It's so insane.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.400]  By the way, now that Bezos bought up Whole Foods is reported, they're lowering the quality to pure crap.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.400]  Oh, I have no doubt about it. I won't even go near Whole Foods anymore.
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:32.400]  But think about this, you know, a decade ago, who was promoting holistic health and food?
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.400]  It was mostly progressives.
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.400]  And now today, what are they promoting?
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:44.400]  SB 277 in California, State Senator Richard Pan in California, mandatory vaccines inject all the children with these toxic metals.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.400]  We have a letter from the Secretary of Health of California saying, oh, we ran out of the mercury free vaccines for children.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.400]  Shoot them up with the mercury vaccines.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.400]  This is part of the plan, Alex.
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:01.400]  100% causes an autoimmune response and massive swelling in the brain and lowering of IQ.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:04.400]  And we wonder why people are getting Alzheimer's at 30.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:10.400]  Look, we know how to set people free and it comes with nutrition and information.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:11.400]  It's both of those hand in hand.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:15.400]  Well, you know, it was Rob do about two years ago, he goes, Alex, we got to have our own turmeric thing.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:16.400]  Why haven't you done it?
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:17.400]  Yeah.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:23.400]  And he was pointing out, you know, the great product from Yongevity that we have at M4's team.com.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  I'm having one of those moments, but maybe Rob can run in here.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.400]  And so I started taking that and I'm like, wow, this has really helped my allergies.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.400]  Well, we've come with something obviously even stronger, but theirs is great as well.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.400]  And it is just next level.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:40.400]  So I'm going to stop plugging M4store.com bodies is 25% off back in stock and you help fund the first amendment.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.400]  But just try it for yourself.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.400]  Also try our pollen block.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.400]  It's incredible.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:46.400]  Now we're going to come back.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:53.400]  Patrick's calling from Australia wants to defend my son Rex that all these leptis publications are calling for him to be removed from the air.
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.400]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:59.400]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:06.400]  We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:11.400]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best selling formulas out there.
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.400]  It's very simple.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.400]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:16.400]  We'll just put even more product in and we'll make it better.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.400]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for 60 bucks.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.400]  We put $10 in it and sell it for 30 bucks.
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.400]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:30.400]  So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic for $19.95.
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:32.400]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:36.400]  We need that 15, 20 bucks we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:40.400]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.400]  I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:47.400]  And I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.400]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.400]  It's amazing.
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:06:13.400]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com or AAA-2533-139.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:20.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:22.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:36.400]  We're going right to Patrick and Desiree and others that are patiently holding Bam Bam Bam with the amazing Mike Adams.
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.400]  He was on fire four or five years ago.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.400]  He said, listen, I might not want interviews anymore.
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:44.400]  He was on my lab, launched a bunch of websites, launched it, and he just went from one level to even more.
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.400]  And now he's like, I'm ready to come back on.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.400]  And it's like, he's born again hard.
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.400]  He was already hard against the globalist.
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.400]  But it's that full metal jacket term that he definitely has the gear to take on the globalist.
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:56.400]  And it only makes me feel good.
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:59.400]  I have to think about globalists and minions and devil worshipers and these people.
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.400]  They hate anybody else that's smart or strong.
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.400]  It makes them feel weak.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.400]  I feel stronger having Mike Adams.
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.400]  I feel stronger having Donald Trump.
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.400]  I feel strong seeing you.
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:09.400]  I feel strong having Rand Paul.
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:14.400]  I feel strong with Owen Shroyer and David Knight in many cases doing a better show than I do.
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:20.400]  I feel strong knowing GrudgeReport.com is 50 times bigger than Info Wars and the biggest thing in the world.
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.400]  That makes me feel strong at night.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.400]  Doesn't make me feel weak that, oh, he's bigger than me.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.400]  I'm like, thank God there's people stronger.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.400]  Right. I feel exactly the same way.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:32.400]  All of us who are defending liberty, we have to help each other.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:38.400]  We have to recognize the importance of defending each other against these vicious, malicious attacks.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:43.400]  And that's why I've done some of those articles, by the way, on you and some of them.
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.400]  Like the whole atrazine issue.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:50.400]  What you say about atrazine turning frogs gay is actually mainline science.
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:53.400]  It is, I did a whole story of all those studies in your science.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:56.400]  It's widely recognized science.
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:01.400]  People who make fun of you on that, they are making fun of themselves because they are so scientifically illiterate.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:03.400]  But the truth is they know it's real.
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:04.400]  They're there to make a joke.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:06.400]  I notice every time Corbett attacks, it's that.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.400]  And it's all about, oh, no one's changing.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:10.400]  Hogg came out and attacked us.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:11.400]  That's a talking point.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:16.400]  They do not want people to discuss why women are becoming hyper feminized and men are becoming feminized.
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:17.400]  That's right. That's right.
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:20.400]  The metrosexual agenda.
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.400]  It's that they push it as a victory.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.400]  They do.
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:24.400]  They want to destroy men.
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.400]  They want to destroy families.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:27.400]  They want to destroy Christians and others.
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.400]  But I know you want to go to the call.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:30.400]  We're going to do it.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.400]  I'm just cutting this press release out.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:32.400]  I'm going to DC.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.400]  I'll be there Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:36.400]  And we've got some surprises in store for folks.
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:41.400]  I'll leave it at that and pray for us because we have to go into the deepest parts of Mordor.
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:46.400]  And I'm going to be doing some things that I may be able to talk about later where I have to face true evil in person.
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.400]  Okay, so I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:56.400]  But Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered Alex Jones at the whole press conference against Soros backed lawsuits.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:03.400]  And, you know, I can just tell you, I don't turn down these meetings because I learned a lot of stuff previously at meetings.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.400]  With similar people, not this high level.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:12.400]  But if the globalists want to meet with me to talk parlay, I'm going to meet with them.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:16.400]  So I'm just, and I, by the way, I've already told them I'm not coming and I'm not going to make any agreements.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.400]  So, I mean, I'm not just going there for a press conference.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.400]  So pray for us.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:24.400]  This is not something I enjoy doing, but I feel really strong doing it.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:27.400]  Well, Alex, they want to meet with them.
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:32.400]  Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered Alex Jones to hold press.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:34.400]  I just want to look him in the eyes.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:43.400]  Yeah, Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered Alex Jones to hold press conference against Soros backed lawsuits on an Hillary funded lawsuits.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:48.400]  I could add on Tuesday, April 10th, Alex Jones with crew will make a statement and take questions from the press in Washington, DC.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.400]  I'll have some lawyers there on the anti free speech lawsuits targeting his First Amendment rights.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.400]  Some of these are the top lawyers, the First Amendment, the National Press Club in Washington, DC.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:07.400]  Zinger room, 9am, and we'll go for three hours, 529 14th Street, a Northwest 13th floor, Washington, DC, 20045.
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:12.400]  And again, you can call them for any details, 202-662-7500.
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:14.400]  It's press at infowars.com.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.400]  You've got a RSVP to get the code once you're there to get into the press club.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.400]  Alternatively, you can also call 512-954-5225.
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:24.400]  You'll be sent a QR code.
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:27.400]  Now only 200 members of the press can get in.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:30.400]  We've already had, now there's like 100 now, and we're going to go through them.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:39.400]  And we're going to let enemy in, but we're also going to let the daily caller and the free beacon and Washington Times.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.400]  Yeah, a whole bunch of other folks have already called, so they're obviously all going to get in first.
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:47.400]  We're going to let fake media in too, because we want to spar with them and see what they're going to try to do,
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:51.400]  because we're going to be live streaming the whole thing at infowars.com.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:54.400]  So I want to show us, look for that. So that is very exciting.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:56.400]  And I'm just doing that while I'm there.
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:03.400]  I've got to face off with the eye of Mordor on Monday and then also on Wednesday.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:09.400]  But like I said, people say, why in the world before would you meet with some top syndicators who offered you a million a year,
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:12.400]  three million a year, and then 10 million a year to sell out book deals.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.400]  Right before Beck showed up, it was Beck's deal.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.400]  And then they said, you're the one we want you.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.400]  And then there was real contracts.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:21.400]  And I said, no, and over the next two years, it went up to 10 million a year.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.400]  And because they can, they can, you know, see what's going to happen.
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:26.400]  And I didn't take that. We've changed the world and thank God I did.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.400]  It wasn't even a choice because they said, by the way, kid, we're going to control what you say, but it's going to be all right.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:34.400]  You know, great time and live in LA or New York, wherever you want, where you want to live.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:38.400]  And then I have these guys going, look, Jones, I don't get paid 10 million a year.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.400]  Almost no one else does but Limbaugh.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.400]  So this is your deal. We're going to do it.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.400]  And it's, it's, you need to do it right now.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:49.400]  They had like moral clauses in it too, where they would say, Oh, look, you didn't do good with your sponsor.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.400]  You're off the air and you can't work for two years. It was all golden handcuffs.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:54.400]  I can see it was a spider weaving a web for me.
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.400]  But now all this time later, it really feels good to have not sold out.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.400]  Yeah, but they're going to keep trying.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:06.400]  But I know you and being here in person with you and being on a similar battle path.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.400]  You cannot be bought with money.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:11.400]  You are so far beyond that this is a spiritual war.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:12.400]  You're fighting for your soul.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:14.400]  You're fighting for the liberty of our country.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.400]  No one can buy you or me off with money.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:17.400]  Can't happen.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:18.400]  Doesn't matter how big the check is.
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:19.400]  Can't happen.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.400]  They offered you.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.400]  They offered you.
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:25.400]  They offered me, you know, 10 million, which is a pittance now compared to what are.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.400]  That seems to be their ballpark.
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:28.400]  Yeah.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:30.400]  And it's actually, you know, the real deal.
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:31.400]  Real deal.
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:32.400]  Right.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.400]  Well, I didn't know some other folks that they've offered is even more.
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.400]  It's getting crazy.
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:37.400]  Oh yeah. Several years ago.
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.400]  I mean, now they know nothing's for sale, you know, because I'm not selling my soul.
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.400]  I said, why do you want to meet?
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:47.400]  Well, we know you think you don't want to hear this, but you really need to see what we're
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:48.400]  going to show you.
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.400]  Oh yeah.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:50.400]  Really?
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:51.400]  I actually want to see that.
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.400]  What are they going to show you?
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.400]  Like aliens from planet Zorg?
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:58.400]  Is the pope going to be there?
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.400]  Is it going to have inner demons come out and try to shake your hand?
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:02.400]  What's going on?
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:07.400]  I was talking to this one guy, the CIA, and he told me this story when they took him in
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:08.400]  this room.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.400]  Anyways, I'll leave it right there.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.400]  But let's go ahead and go to Patrick in Australia.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.400]  Patrick, you're on the year worldwide.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.400]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.400]  Thanks for calling.
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:18.400]  God bless.
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:19.400]  Go ahead.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:20.400]  Yeah, no worries, mate.
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.400]  Before I talk about Hog v. Jones, I want to talk about your toothpaste.
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:28.400]  I bought 10 tubes in March of last year.
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.400]  I had two taken off me at the airport.
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:35.400]  I gave two away and six tubes still lasted me a year.
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.400]  Now, I know it's hard to get excited about toothpaste, but it is great stuff.
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:42.400]  And, folks, you just at least bought a toothpaste.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.400]  It's amazing.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.400]  It is concentrated.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  There's all these fillers and other toothpaste.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  And we were formulating with the top company, the top company that makes organic in the
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:50.400]  country.
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:53.400]  And they said, well, you're not going to put all product in it and no filler?
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.400]  And so it is really strong.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:57.400]  And sometimes I mix it with another toothpaste and it's so strong.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:00.400]  But the point is, is it really is good with silver and iodine.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:02.400]  So thank you for supporting us, sir.
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:03.400]  No worries.
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.400]  Now, regarding Hog v. Jones, it's literally the archetypal battle that you're always
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:09.400]  talking about.
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:15.400]  It's the chicken neck control freak loser, one of the socialist dictator against the
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  strong Christian athletic pro gun pro responsibility, pro accountability guide,
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:24.400]  because that's what the Liberty movement's about.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:26.400]  You know, it's not for free.
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:28.400]  The cost of Liberty is responsibility.
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:33.400]  And that's to check the leftists don't want to write and let alone cash.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:34.400]  That's a great point.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.400]  I mean, you, those people said online was you look at Rex, he's already six one.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.400]  His arms are almost as big around as I am.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.400]  He punches him.
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.400]  You know, he likes to trade punches sometimes.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.400]  I mean, he wrestles really good.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:48.400]  He's introduced to and I'm like, man, this model might be better than the last model.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.400]  I hope he eclipses me.
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:53.400]  But, but to see the left everywhere, go and get him off the air, take him off.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:54.400]  He Alex brainwashed him.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.400]  We're worried about him.
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:57.400]  Alex works for Sinclair.
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:00.400]  Just all whatever the latest buzz is, they just say it.
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.400]  Yeah.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:02.400]  It's out of control.
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.400]  Insane.
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.400]  I'm impressed with Rex's cognitive grasp of the issues.
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.400]  I mean, he's only 15, right?
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  Yes.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:10.400]  And he's way ahead of his years.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:11.400]  15 and a half.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:17.400]  And he's not being fed lines like David Hogg is obviously rehearsing with debate people.
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:20.400]  And you know, I'm not even going to.
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:22.400]  I'll get in trouble if I keep talking about hog.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.400]  But God, you can't.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.400]  No, I know.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:27.400]  He's a public figure.
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:28.400]  He can tell us to f off Patrick.
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:29.400]  Thank you for the support.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:30.400]  I know it's expensive to ship some to Australia.
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:33.400]  We're trying to do a deal in Australia and in England to make it cheaper in Europe with
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:35.400]  the shipping and over in Australia.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:36.400]  You know, that's a huge market.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:37.400]  We're trying to do that.
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:38.400]  Thank you so much.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:39.400]  And God bless you, Patrick.
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.400]  But the most important thing people can do is not just financially support us.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.400]  It's print up a little cards in full wars.com to Mars is today.
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:49.400]  The most hated name, you know, people, the globalist hate.
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.400]  Well, it's your word of mouth.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:54.400]  They can't stop you or who they fear.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:55.400]  Face it.
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:03.400]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking, the grid could be crippled for days
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.400]  or even decades in the most dire scenarios.
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:10.400]  Visit quantumharvest.net to see our built to last EMP protected solar power systems.

[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:56.400]  Hear that?
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.400]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:24.400]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:56.400]  EMP protected solar power systems for every need and budget.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:22.400]  EMP protected solar power systems for every need and budget.

[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:19.400]  Like Adams is here.
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:26.400]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting EWY. It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:27.400]  It is.
[02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:29.400]  And again, it sounds egomaniac.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:31.400]  The intros come in every time and say it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:33.400]  The radio stations want that for the arbitron ratings.
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:34.400]  That's for radio.
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:38.400]  This is a radio show that morphed into television in the last 20 years.
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:39.400]  And we're here.
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:41.400]  We pioneered this and we're honored.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:42.400]  All of you helped fund this.
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:45.400]  We've got Desiree and Jennifer who disagrees.
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:50.400]  Jeff, Carlos, Kent, Mike, James, but naturalnews.com is your flagship.
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.400]  But you've got your big testing facility.
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  You've got, I'm always looking at these amazing sites with amazing news and links to amazing studies.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:59.400]  And I go, oh, it's Mike Adams.
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:00.400]  Oh, it's Mike Adams.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:03.400]  How many sites do you have?
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:07.400]  We run over 300 different sites on different topics.
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:10.400]  A lot of them are real small, like blueberries.news.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:13.400]  It's a site about blueberry science and nutrition.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:14.400]  Herbs.news?
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:15.400]  Yeah.
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:21.400]  But we also run Liberty.news, Guns.news, Tierney.news, Freedom.
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:23.400]  Lots of themed sites.
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:27.400]  And then we syndicate our own stories to these hundreds of different sites.
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:30.400]  And we have our own journalism team and so on.
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.400]  So we're very, very strong.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:33.400]  By the way, I've done some cracking.
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:36.400]  Just your top 10 sites together is way better than CNN.com.
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.400]  Absolutely.
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.400]  Yeah.
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:39.400]  No question about it.
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:46.400]  But the thing is, you know, we, we have scientific research and medical research on so many of our stories.
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:49.400]  And by the way, I've got a Smith & Wesson Model 10.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.400]  Oh yeah.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:51.400]  There we go.
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:52.400]  Guns.news.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:55.400]  But I've got a Spanish ripoff of it that my grandfather had that he got.
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:57.400]  I guess during like World War II, he brought back.
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:59.400]  And it's just an awesome gun.
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:00.400]  Yeah.
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:01.400]  Yeah.
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:03.400]  Well, we run gear.news, which is all about survival gear.
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:04.400]  And then we run survival.news.
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:05.400]  I could just go on and on.
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:07.400]  Why do they love the Smith & Wesson Model 10?
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:09.400]  Well, it's just simple.
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:11.400]  It doesn't jam because it's not a semi-auto.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:18.400]  And who was, who was that, who was that liberal who said that her bodyguards don't have a semi-auto weapon?
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.400]  Yeah, a bunch of them.
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:21.400]  Who was it?
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:22.400]  Who was it?
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.400]  Oh, Chelsea Handler.
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:24.400]  Yeah.
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:25.400]  What?
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:27.400]  Are all her bodyguards carrying Model 10 revolvers?
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:31.400]  I guess they, they don't even know what, what, what guns are.
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:34.400]  They don't even know how they work, but now we're guilty of gunsplaining.
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.400]  So you see how, how crazy it gets.
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:49.400]  But anyway, our, our job, see, we used to be attacked all the time for saying, oh, we're anti-science because we're talking about turmeric or blueberries or things that can prevent cancer, other foods.
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:55.400]  So we just built a massive team to, to look at all the science and bring it together and back it up.
[02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.400]  Now we are science.news.
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:22:59.400]  We are medicine.news.
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:08.400]  We have the best publication of science backed journal backed evidence to support Ayurvedic medicine.
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:10.400]  You have done well, Lord Veda.
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:11.400]  All these things.
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:12.400]  Yeah.
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:13.400]  See vitamin D right there on science.news today.
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:15.400]  So absolute fact you need that.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:18.400]  People ask why everybody's getting the floater in the winter because you don't have vitamin D.
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:19.400]  Don't get sun.
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:20.400]  Yeah.
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.400]  Vitamin D and zinc can basically prevent the flu in almost every single case.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:28.400]  And by the way, that's mainline science, but no one will tell you because there's no money in that.
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:29.400]  That's right.
[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:30.400]  They want to brain damage you.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:31.400]  We're going to go to calls.
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:32.400]  We're bad.
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:34.400]  Desiree, we're going to Jennifer and Kent and Carlos.
[02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:36.400]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.400]  Go ahead.
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:43.400]  Just wanted to let you know, been listening to you for about six years now.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:51.400]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you for about the first two months I listened to you.
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:58.400]  And now I listen every single day to your full skill that you do.
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:04.400]  And I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:06.400]  I'm a nurse here in California.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:10.400]  I've been a nurse here doing hospice and working with geriatrics over 15 years.
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:16.400]  I see an epidemic of Alzheimer's Parkinson's diabetes, thyroid disease, autoimmune disorder.
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:21.400]  It is just absolutely crazy mental disease.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.400]  My husband has an autoimmune disorder.
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:25.400]  He's had it for over 15 years.
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:26.400]  Sorry for that.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:30.400]  We started using your products and I am amazed at the results.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:33.400]  His pain, he's reduced his opioid use.
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:36.400]  His thyroid medication has went severely down.
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:40.400]  He's almost back to the man that I married.
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:43.400]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:47.400]  I work nights, 12, 14 hours a night, five days a week.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:57.400]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your biopca, true selenium, cell force, immune wall.
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:00.400]  My husband's been immunosuppressant for years.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  He can't go into town without getting sick.
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:05.400]  He doesn't do that anymore.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:10.400]  I'm just here in California fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:14.400]  How they're demonizing my state. I just can't stand it anymore.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:19.400]  You have changed my life and for wars has changed my family's life.
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:25.400]  I've got property and no life zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:28.400]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on.
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.400]  But I need to know what else we can do.
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.400]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:37.400]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:39.400]  I think she should share her testimony.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.400]  But also do pray.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:43.400]  She's on track.
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:45.400]  Absolutely.
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:50.400]  And again, I'm the one that sits there like an enforcer with my children, giving them the products.
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  And then everybody says, why are your children glowing?
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:54.400]  Why do they all look like this?
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.400]  Women come over and say, hey, is this your brother?
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:59.400]  I mean, I have like 20-year-old women come up and start asking my son out.
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.400]  He's 15. He looks like he's 18, especially in person. He looks even older.
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.400]  He doesn't even person. He's a bruiser.
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:06.400]  And it's like, what are you feeding this kid?
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.400]  Well, he's taken a good multivitamin that's not even one of our products we showed.
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.400]  He takes the fruit punch that is ours.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:14.400]  He takes the X2. He takes the vitamin B12.
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  I mean, he takes a lot of the products.
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.400]  And now he's the one that's into them. He does them.
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  My daughters, I still have to push it on them.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  But then I remember when I'm sitting there in the morning, I go, wait, I'm not taking these myself.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.400]  I've got to take them.
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.400]  But when I do take it, it's a whole nother world.
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  I mean, just take fish oil. We don't have our own fish oil yet.
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:30.400]  It's coming out. We've got a really clean one about to come out.
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:33.400]  The point is, I take fish oil. I'm exhausted and it's midnight.
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:37.400]  I'm doing Coast to Coast AM or some other show, or one of the kids doesn't feel well and is up.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.400]  I will eat six fish oils.
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:42.400]  And in 20 minutes, I'm high off of them.
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:45.400]  This is just the end. I mean, it's like, and I don't even have a fish oil yet.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  It's like, this stuff really works, man. It's what we're built to eat.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:50.400]  I mean, I remember as a kid, I'd go, man, I had crazy dreams last night.
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:52.400]  My mom would say, well, yeah, we're at the coast.
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  We just caught fresh fish. You just ate like a pound of mahi mahi, son.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.400]  I mean, the fish oil makes your blood flow much more efficiently.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:02.400]  It's less viscous because of the fish oils.
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:06.400]  And what's happening literally in your body is that as those fish oils are absorbed,
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:09.400]  the blood is getting into cells that have been more stagnant.
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:11.400]  And so you are feeling it. You are seeing it.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:14.400]  But it's also working in your brain as well as other parts of your body.
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:16.400]  Exactly. And again, we don't even have a fish oil yet.
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.400]  I'm just saying it's one of the, I think it's one of the top things.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:19.400]  Absolutely. Yeah.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:21.400]  Just like, I take turmeric, X2 fish oil.
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:24.400]  It's like, I can be depressed every once in a while to hear like my grandmother died.
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:26.400]  I was really depressed for a few days.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  I went, wait a minute, a bunch, and it wasn't, we'll see about it.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:31.400]  I had a bunch of fish oil, took some turmeric just last year,
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.400]  took some extra X2.
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:34.400]  I was like, wow, I feel great. Why didn't I do this?
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:36.400]  Yeah. And it's just amazing to me.
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.400]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:39.400]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.400]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:42.400]  We really appreciate you.
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:43.400]  Keep up the fight.
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:44.400]  We need to take California back.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:45.400]  Thank you, Desiree.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:46.400]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:47.400]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:48.400]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.400]  I was just saying, get that fish oil going.
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:51.400]  I can't find a good one.
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:55.400]  And also my husband wants you to listen to a song by Ice Tea.
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.400]  It's called Shut Up and Be Happy.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.400]  It's about martial law if you've never heard it.
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.400]  Actually, that is in our playlist.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:03.400]  He may have missed it.
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:05.400]  We should come in and play the Ice Tea Martial Law.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:07.400]  We also have a version he did with Dave Mustaine.
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:08.400]  But thank you. We'll do that.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  You were making a point. Go ahead.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.400]  Well, do you have your own acesanthin product yet?
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:13.400]  No.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:14.400]  Acesanthin?
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:15.400]  You need to look into that.
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:16.400]  I've heard of it.
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:20.400]  You talk about an antioxidant that is fat-soluble.
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:23.400]  If you combine it with fish oil, it goes in your body.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:24.400]  Supercharges.
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:27.400]  And it protects your nervous system from oxidative damage.
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:30.400]  You need to get that product because it is the perfect complement
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:31.400]  to everything else that you're doing.
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:33.400]  Acesanthin, it's a microalgae extract.
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:35.400]  It's grown in large ponds.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:38.400]  And it's stress-adaptive.
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:40.400]  You grow it by stressing the microbes
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.400]  and they build the acesanthin to protect themselves from radiation.
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.400]  That's what it is.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:45.400]  Wow.
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:46.400]  Well, help us launch that.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.400]  People can find theirs at HealthRanger.com.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:49.400]  We'll be back.
[02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:56.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:29.400]  Today's Electric Power Grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:32.400]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking,
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:35.400]  the grid could be crippled for days or even decades
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:36.400]  in the most dire scenarios.
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:40.400]  Visit quantumharvest.net to see our built-to-last EMP-protected
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:41.400]  solar power systems.

[02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:59.400]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings
[02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:01.400]  on major third-party sites is because I want products
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:02.400]  I'm going to use for my family.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:03.400]  I take this.
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:04.400]  My family takes this.
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:06.400]  And then it funds the operation with the most
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:08.400]  hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.

[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:13.400]  in our products at infowarslife.com.
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:15.400]  If I ever forget to take them,
[02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:18.400]  like, I'm having noticeable difference.
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:19.400]  I don't feel good.
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:21.400]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones
[02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:23.400]  that was life-changing for me.
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:25.400]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale.
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:28.400]  I had a few bottles at my house,
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:29.400]  and I've been taking it again,
[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:31.400]  hitting the gym once again.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:34.400]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:38.400]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:40.400]  So obviously, the superfemale is amazing.
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:41.400]  I love it.
[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:43.400]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:45.400]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:47.400]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing,
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:49.400]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine,
[02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:50.400]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:52.400]  It's got a five-star rating.

[02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:34.400]  You can also swallow it.
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:37.400]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:39.400]  super high-quality silver,

[02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:51.400]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:53.400]  Again, thank you so much for being part

[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:42.400]  Going to a show
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:44.400]  Hey, some great Australian music right here.
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:48.400]  Play in rock and roll, crank it up.
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:53.400]  Rock and roll, get in rock.

[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:01.400]  Get in took.
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:03.400]  I'm here to tell you.
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:06.400]  It's harder than it looks.
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.400]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:09.400]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.400]  the Health Ranger Mike Adams
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.400]  is here with us.
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:14.400]  I was telling him from inside baseball
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:15.400]  during the break.
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  He had some of his own stories, but
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:18.400]  you look at Hillary.
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:19.400]  You look at Michael Moore.
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:20.400]  You look at the Queen of England.
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:21.400]  You look at the global issue.
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:22.400]  You look at the Rockefellers.
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:24.400]  They look so unhappy, so evil, so twisted.
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:26.400]  They're the losers that are willing
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.400]  to give up their humanity to do things
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:31.400]  other people won't do for total control.
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:33.400]  But they're not the real problem.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.400]  As Lord Acton said and as Benjamin Franklin
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.400]  and Thomas Jefferson all similarly said
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:40.400]  that evil only triumphs because good men
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.400]  and women do nothing.
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.400]  They can't really even say who did the quote
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:46.400]  because there's different variants of it.
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:47.400]  Who do we have to blame?
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:49.400]  Is that we let Nancy Pelosi
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:51.400]  and George Soros rule over us?
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:52.400]  We let them do this?
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:53.400]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.400]  You only lose if you surrender.
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:57.400]  If they break your will,
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:01.400]  you have to concede to be overtaken.
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:03.400]  Like just on this gun issue, Second Amendment,
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:05.400]  if you're willing to stand up
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:07.400]  and defend your right to defend yourself,
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:09.400]  they can't take the guns.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:10.400]  They physically can't get it done.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:11.400]  It can't happen.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:13.400]  They can only take the guns if you surrender.
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:15.400]  If they break your will and you say,
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:18.400]  oh, we're so horrible, all of us gun owners,
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:20.400]  we don't deserve to have guns.
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:22.400]  We should all just be subjected to criminals
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:24.400]  who want to murder, rape and kill us all.
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:26.400]  Then you lose.
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:28.400]  If you stand, you win.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:29.400]  And getting back to the spiritual war
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:31.400]  that we talked about earlier,
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:33.400]  if you think about it, why do we have free will?
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:35.400]  Why are we born as divine beings with free will
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.400]  and consciousness and self-awareness?
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:39.400]  If God wanted us all to be drones
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.400]  and minions and slaves,
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:43.400]  we would never have been born with free will.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.400]  And atheists always say,
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:47.400]  well, God just saved us from all the bad in the world.
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:49.400]  No, God loves us so much that He gave us free will
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:51.400]  so we can choose where we want to be.
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:53.400]  And so many again of these so-called atheists
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:56.400]  and these globalists are all in the occult behind the scenes.
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:58.400]  They believe they have will
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:01.400]  and they're trying to say we don't have will and we're slaves.
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:04.400]  They believe you're not conscious unless you have will,
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:06.400]  but then they're actively from birth
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:08.400]  trying to make sure you never activate your will
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.400]  so that you never discover you have a spirit.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  Because they can break a will,
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:14.400]  but they can't break the spirit
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:16.400]  if you are ever able to make that choice.
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:18.400]  Right, and they know that to defeat you,
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.400]  you have to choose surrender
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.400]  and they try to force you into that form.
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.400]  It's Faust. It is Faust.
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.400]  He is the archetype.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:28.400]  He never thought he could get out of it.
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:30.400]  He never knew that he had free will.
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:33.400]  He got tricked. He could have gotten out right to the end.
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.400]  And you know what the ultimate answer is?
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:37.400]  Souls are bulletproof.
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:39.400]  What we have, our spirit, our soul.
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:41.400]  I'm going to tweet that. Mike Adams, souls are bulletproof.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  Souls are bulletproof.
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:45.400]  What was the other thing you said earlier?
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.400]  You said I'm really pushing. It was very profound.
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:49.400]  I'll never negotiate with evil,
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:51.400]  or stop negotiating with evil.
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:53.400]  The thing is, they can try to destroy your business.
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:55.400]  They can destroy your physical body.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:58.400]  They can destroy it because your flesh is subject to bullets
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:01.400]  or other forms of abuse that they would try to dish out.
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.400]  But your soul is bulletproof.
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.400]  They can never capture your soul
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:07.400]  unless you give it over willfully.
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:09.400]  And that is where you can draw the line.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:12.400]  You can say, my life has lived with purpose.
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:14.400]  And that is incredibly profound.
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:16.400]  I want this to be my quote. I've said it before,
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:18.400]  but I want this tweeted with your tweets.
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:20.400]  You cannot sell your soul.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.400]  You can be conned into believing you sold it.
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:25.400]  But if you truly repent of bad things you've done,
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:27.400]  you will be cleansed. It's metaphysical.
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:29.400]  But you get tricked into going,
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:31.400]  well, you're already screwed.
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:33.400]  You might as well join it and take as many with you as you can.
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:35.400]  That's the big trick of the spirit.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.400]  Whether you believe in God or the devil or not,
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:39.400]  what the globalists do,
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:41.400]  and they believe they're damned.
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:43.400]  They believe it's too far. I want to tell George Soros.
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:45.400]  He's probably already committed to the ultimate sin.
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.400]  He knows the Holy Spirit's real.
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:49.400]  He knows he could have gotten out of this.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.400]  And that's the ultimate sin,
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:53.400]  is saying that you don't want to be reprieved.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  And that you choose evil just because you're a piece of crap.
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:57.400]  But I choose life.
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:59.400]  And think about why did the Pope say there is no hell?
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:01.400]  Reportedly.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:03.400]  Because if there are no repercussions to your actions,
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:05.400]  and these atheists who are globalists,
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:07.400]  they believe there's no soul,
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:09.400]  there's no spirit, there are no repercussions after this life,
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  it gives them the moral justification
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:13.400]  to carry out heinous crimes against humanity,
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:15.400]  heinous narcissism,
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400]  and abuse of others around them
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:19.400]  because they believe there is no hell,
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:21.400]  they're not going to hell, and they believe there is no afterlife,
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:23.400]  so there are no repercussions to their present day actions.
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  In terms of philosophy,
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.400]  what the Pope said, if indeed he said that,
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:29.400]  is so dangerous,
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.400]  and it contradicts
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:33.400]  thousands of years of doctrine
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:35.400]  of the Catholic Church,
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:37.400]  and it is the philosophy
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:39.400]  of those who are destroyers of life,
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  the pro-abortion crowd, the anti-liberty crowd,
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:43.400]  all these people.
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.400]  That's the whole ecumenical movement,
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.400]  is that, oh, this is all figurative,
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:49.400]  but let's expand on that.
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:51.400]  This Pope
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.400]  is a globalist, 100%.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:55.400]  We're going to go back to the phone calls right now,
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:57.400]  but the point you make about
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:38:59.400]  how they don't want any repercussions,
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.400]  they don't want it in this lifetime.
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.400]  What the universe works is,
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.400]  everything is repeated,
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:07.400]  and as you go up,
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:09.400]  the universe isn't an entropy falling apart,
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:11.400]  it's becoming more advanced.
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:13.400]  That's the truth, things are becoming stronger.
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:15.400]  Yes, some things are rotting and falling away,
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:17.400]  but overall, the universe is getting bigger,
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:19.400]  more complex, and
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:21.400]  they know this,
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  and again,
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400]  they are just trying to keep us from transcending
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  their entire system
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.400]  because they're falling, and they choose
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:31.400]  the most important thing that we can do
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:33.400]  is live a life with purpose
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  in defeating evil,
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:37.400]  even if they one day
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  manage to destroy your business,
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.400]  silence your voice, even to destroy
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.400]  your body and murder you,
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.400]  your soul is bulletproof,
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:47.400]  and they can't take your soul unless you give it willfully.
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:51.400]  Is that your quote?
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.400]  I don't know, I'm not quoting anybody else.
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:55.400]  No, it's powerful, no, it's beautiful.
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:57.400]  We know that ideas are bulletproof,
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:59.400]  and we know that there is a bulletproof
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.400]  from the dead, which is a Victor Hugo
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:03.400]  change on what he said,
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:05.400]  that no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:07.400]  But you're right, the soul is bulletproof,
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:09.400]  the truth is bulletproof,
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.400]  and the war is spiritual.
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:13.400]  The war is not physical.
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:15.400]  Your life and my life are inconsequential
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:17.400]  in the greater battle of good
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  versus evil that's taking place.
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:21.400]  Here we are in a small window of time
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.400]  expressing our love
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:25.400]  for God and the divine,
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:27.400]  our love for truth and transparency,
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.400]  and being viciously attacked
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:31.400]  by actual literal demonic forces.
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.400]  And endless lies, things we never said?
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  Of course. Why?
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  Because they know we know who they are.
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.400]  And the only way they get away with those lies
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  is they isolate people from the truth
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  about what we are actually saying.
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.400]  They have to separate,
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  and they have to destroy,
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:49.400]  and they have to suppress.
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:51.400]  These are all tactics of evil, right?
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.400]  Just by their very tactics,
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:55.400]  you know they are evil, they are.
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:57.400]  Exactly, it's their signature, their attack profile,
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.400]  you've seen it before, you know them.
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.400]  And that's the weird thing, it's they're an army,
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.400]  it's not just a culture, it's a spirit,
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:05.400]  it's a look, it's real folks.
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  And they can't get past
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  the style of presentation.
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  You know, your style, it's very aggressive,
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.400]  it's very assertive, and in some ways
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.400]  mine is too, but you're known for that.
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  But the substance of what you're teaching
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.400]  is actually love and light.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  Exactly, but they do it all
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:23.400]  in an NPR fake, but it's pure death.
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:25.400]  Exactly, that's it.
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.400]  On the surface, they look all lovey-dovey
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.400]  and cuddly and cute, but underneath
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.400]  they are demonic, and they're,
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.400]  they love to murder unborn babies.
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.400]  They love to destroy people.
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:37.400]  I look and act foul sometimes,
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.400]  but I feel fair.
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  They look fair, but feel foul.
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:43.400]  Right, and it takes an advanced
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  neurology to be able to judge people
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:47.400]  by the substance of what they're saying,
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.400]  the content of their speech,
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  or their behavior, than their
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  outer appearance, or their skin color.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  You know, think about this. What is diversity
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.400]  on the left? It's a room full of people
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.400]  with different skin color who are absolute
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  100% obedient to the same
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.400]  exact ideas. They call that diversity.
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.400]  That's conformity. That's obedience.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.400]  That's not diversity at all.
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.400]  Diversity is a room full of people who have
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:11.400]  different ideas and different voices
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  and different backgrounds, regardless of who
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.400]  is the black CEO, the diversity
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:17.400]  had, the black lady, beautiful, smart.
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:19.400]  They don't have a room full of European men.
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  They'll have diverse ideas. That's diversity.
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:23.400]  They removed her. Yeah, they attacked her.
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:25.400]  Who is she the head of? I don't remember her name.
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.400]  But that's the point.
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:29.400]  She's got it. She's been around me one word.
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:31.400]  So yeah, diverse ideas,
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:33.400]  diverse voices, exactly what YouTube
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.400]  is trying to stamp out.
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.400]  But that's where real truth comes
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.400]  from, is a diverse
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:41.400]  collection of ideas and voices.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.400]  I promise, Jennifer, you disagree here
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.400]  in the head of the line, then Jeff, Carlos, Kent,
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:47.400]  James, we're going to continue with Mike Adams,
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.400]  infowars.com, newswars.com.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:51.400]  They're trying to block those URLs.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:43:20.400]  They're critical to punch those out.
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:23.400]  They began studying this effect in published
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:25.400]  trials, and decades later,
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:27.400]  we now have the fruit of this research,
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:29.400]  a fast-acting, chewable

[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:37.400]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:39.400]  In fact, current research has found that it
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:41.400]  actually acts by blocking the activity
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:43.400]  of triptase, which is an enzyme that
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:45.400]  amplifies immune and inflammatory
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:47.400]  responses in the body.

[03:30:02.460 --> 03:30:04.400]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:30:04.400 --> 03:30:06.960]  And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[03:30:06.960 --> 03:30:09.440]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[03:30:09.440 --> 03:30:11.520]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:30:11.520 --> 03:30:12.840]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:30:12.840 --> 03:30:14.560]  When bacteria infect your gums,
[03:30:14.560 --> 03:30:15.880]  it can enter your bloodstream,
[03:30:15.880 --> 03:30:17.960]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:30:17.960 --> 03:30:20.200]  That's why the last surgeon general's report
[03:30:20.200 --> 03:30:22.600]  on oral health warns that your oral health
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:24.840]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:34.120]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[03:30:34.120 --> 03:30:37.240]  used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[03:30:37.240 --> 03:30:38.440]  and eliminate bad breath.
[03:30:38.440 --> 03:30:40.360]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue,

[03:31:20.960 --> 03:31:24.480]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[03:31:24.480 --> 03:31:25.320]  That's amazing.
[03:31:25.320 --> 03:31:26.160]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:26.160 --> 03:31:27.760]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[03:31:27.760 --> 03:31:30.120]  I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[03:31:30.120 --> 03:31:33.040]  My morning was fantastic, and I love the guys,

[03:31:58.480 --> 03:32:01.240]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process
[03:32:01.240 --> 03:32:03.400]  and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[03:32:03.400 --> 03:32:06.600]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:32:06.600 --> 03:32:08.680]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion
[03:32:08.680 --> 03:32:10.880]  caused by fermentation of undigested food particles
[03:32:10.880 --> 03:32:11.840]  in the gut.
[03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:14.360]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:32:14.360 --> 03:32:16.160]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes
[03:32:16.160 --> 03:32:18.560]  like those naturally present in the body.

[03:32:25.760 --> 03:32:28.960]  and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[03:32:28.960 --> 03:32:30.960]  Just one pill with every high protein meal
[03:32:30.960 --> 03:32:32.680]  helps increase the bioavailability
[03:32:32.680 --> 03:32:34.560]  and absorption of amino acids,
[03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:37.000]  the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:39.040]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes
[03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:41.560]  to help digest fats and carbohydrates,
[03:32:41.560 --> 03:32:44.200]  so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:32:44.200 --> 03:32:45.560]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:33:31.480 --> 03:33:33.480]  let's go right to the phones.
[03:33:33.480 --> 03:33:36.480]  We have Mike in Oregon calling in.
[03:33:36.480 --> 03:33:39.480]  Mike, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:39.480 --> 03:33:41.480]  What's on your mind?
[03:33:41.480 --> 03:33:42.480]  Yes.
[03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:43.480]  Hi, Roger.
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:47.480]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[03:33:47.480 --> 03:33:52.480]  And I wanted to talk about the FBI
[03:33:52.480 --> 03:33:57.480]  and how I don't know how people think
[03:33:57.480 --> 03:34:01.480]  that they are a good organization
[03:34:01.480 --> 03:34:07.480]  or a lawful organization at all.
[03:34:07.480 --> 03:34:12.480]  I think they're out of control,
[03:34:12.480 --> 03:34:19.480]  and what they're doing with the special counsel,
[03:34:19.480 --> 03:34:22.480]  what they tried to do with the election,
[03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:26.480]  and their involvement in school shooting.
[03:34:26.480 --> 03:34:32.480]  It seems like they're always behind the scenes
[03:34:32.480 --> 03:34:43.480]  at so many subversive activities.
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:47.480]  Well, Mike, first of all, I want to thank you for your call.
[03:34:47.480 --> 03:34:49.480]  A correction here, by the way, for callers.
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:53.480]  The correct number to call us now on the Alex Jones Show
[03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:57.480]  is 877-787-2539.
[03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:02.480]  That's 877-787-2539.
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:05.480]  Let me address Mike's call.
[03:35:05.480 --> 03:35:09.480]  The FBI was originally sent up with a noble intent,
[03:35:09.480 --> 03:35:11.480]  and for many, many years,
[03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:15.480]  they had a reputation for honesty and integrity.
[03:35:15.480 --> 03:35:19.480]  Unfortunately, over time, the FBI has become politicized.
[03:35:19.480 --> 03:35:22.480]  Now to the point where they are entirely politicized,
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:25.480]  and therefore the American people can justly wonder
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:29.480]  whether they are acting as a political organ for the deep state
[03:35:29.480 --> 03:35:34.480]  or whether they are a legitimate, unbiased law enforcement organization.
[03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:40.480]  The text messages of the FBI agent Peter Stroke
[03:35:40.480 --> 03:35:44.480]  and his on-the-payroll girlfriend
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:49.480]  I think open the world's eyes to the incredible abuses
[03:35:49.480 --> 03:35:55.480]  that have gone on at the FBI under both James Comey and Robert Mueller.
[03:35:55.480 --> 03:35:57.480]  What's the answer?
[03:35:57.480 --> 03:36:03.480]  The answer is a top-to-bottom house cleaning at the FBI.
[03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:09.480]  The answer is a new FBI director who is someone who is known to
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:12.480]  and loyal to this president.
[03:36:12.480 --> 03:36:15.480]  I think former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:17.480]  would be an excellent choice.
[03:36:17.480 --> 03:36:21.480]  Someone outside the Washington buddy system.
[03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:24.480]  Someone with a reputation for integrity.
[03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:26.480]  Terrific question, Mike.
[03:36:26.480 --> 03:36:28.480]  Thanks so much for your call.
[03:36:28.480 --> 03:36:33.480]  Let's go now to James in Louisiana, one of my favorite states.
[03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:36.480]  I'm kind of craving some seafood gumbo,
[03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:39.480]  even as we speak, just thinking about it.
[03:36:39.480 --> 03:36:43.480]  But James, what's your question for the Alex Jones show?
[03:36:43.480 --> 03:36:45.480]  Oh, yeah, Mr. Rogers.
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:51.480]  Man, well, really, I'm kind of thinking, well,
[03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:54.480]  I hear Alex talk about it all the time,
[03:36:54.480 --> 03:36:59.480]  multi-directional pincer attacks, you know,
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:02.480]  on whoever and whatnot,
[03:37:02.480 --> 03:37:06.480]  and we're the enemy here, the deep state and all factions.
[03:37:11.480 --> 03:37:14.480]  Well, James, we have a little audio problem here,
[03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:17.480]  so let me address your question.
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:20.480]  Thing that first impressed me about Alex Jones when we met
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:23.480]  for the first time back at the 50th anniversary
[03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:26.480]  of the John F. Kennedy assassination
[03:37:26.480 --> 03:37:29.480]  was his grasp on world history.
[03:37:29.480 --> 03:37:32.480]  Alex Jones is extraordinarily well read.
[03:37:32.480 --> 03:37:35.480]  He understands the history of the deep state.
[03:37:35.480 --> 03:37:39.480]  He understands the long-term plans of the globalists,
[03:37:39.480 --> 03:37:44.480]  but he also has studied history, the Greeks, the Romans,
[03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:48.480]  our own history, the seeds of 1776.
[03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:52.480]  And therefore, he approaches these political issues
[03:37:52.480 --> 03:37:56.480]  in a way that you cannot find them approached at, say, CNN,
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:02.480]  where some 23-year-old reporter has no sense of history
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:06.480]  and does not understand that past is prologue.
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:09.480]  Alex Jones is absolutely right about the corruption
[03:38:09.480 --> 03:38:11.480]  of the deep state.
[03:38:11.480 --> 03:38:14.480]  How can it be that President Barack Obama
[03:38:14.480 --> 03:38:17.480]  and President George W. Bush had the same person
[03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:20.480]  as their Defense Secretary?
[03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:23.480]  How could it be that they had the same person
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:25.480]  as their FBI Director?
[03:38:25.480 --> 03:38:29.480]  Does that make any sense if you have a governing philosophy?
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:32.480]  Then theoretically, you would be appointing men and women
[03:38:32.480 --> 03:38:34.480]  who supported your philosophy,
[03:38:34.480 --> 03:38:37.480]  not the philosophy of your predecessor,
[03:38:37.480 --> 03:38:42.480]  except if the Bushes and the Clintons are, in fact, identical.
[03:38:42.480 --> 03:38:45.480]  If, in fact, their public bickering
[03:38:45.480 --> 03:38:48.480]  and their attempts to sound different
[03:38:48.480 --> 03:38:52.480]  is a kabuki act to put the American people to sleep.
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:57.480]  I've come to the conclusion that the right-left divide
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:01.480]  is a Hegelian device that is used to distract our attention
[03:39:01.480 --> 03:39:04.480]  from the fact that the country has a ruling elite
[03:39:04.480 --> 03:39:06.480]  that isn't really ideological,
[03:39:06.480 --> 03:39:10.480]  other than the fact that they believe in the control of our lives
[03:39:10.480 --> 03:39:12.480]  and access to great wealth.
[03:39:12.480 --> 03:39:17.480]  These are the deep state players that you refer to.
[03:39:17.480 --> 03:39:19.480]  And it doesn't seem to matter
[03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:23.480]  whether Republicans or Democrats win our national elections.
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:28.480]  We continue the policies that have enmeshed us
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:31.480]  in endless foreign wars,
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:34.480]  where our inherent national interests are not clear,
[03:39:34.480 --> 03:39:37.480]  the complete erosion of our civil liberties,
[03:39:37.480 --> 03:39:41.480]  reading our emails, monitoring our phone calls,
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:43.480]  collecting our metadata,
[03:39:43.480 --> 03:39:46.480]  trade policies that have ruined our economy
[03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:49.480]  and sucked the jobs out of America,
[03:39:49.480 --> 03:39:52.480]  immigration policies that have made our streets
[03:39:52.480 --> 03:39:57.480]  and neighborhoods and cities and now even rural areas unsafe.
[03:39:57.480 --> 03:40:01.480]  And economic policies that under Barack Obama
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:04.480]  are economy virtually ground to a halt.
[03:40:04.480 --> 03:40:08.480]  Now, suddenly, one man has stepped forward
[03:40:08.480 --> 03:40:11.480]  who is not part of this broken system,
[03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:15.480]  one man who is not beholden to any special interest,
[03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:19.480]  one man who is not party to the bad decisions
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:22.480]  of the last 30 years.
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:26.480]  And that is what's driving the globalists crazy.
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:29.480]  Donald Trump understands the silent majority.
[03:40:29.480 --> 03:40:32.480]  He understands the people in flyover country.
[03:40:32.480 --> 03:40:35.480]  He understands the average info warrior,
[03:40:35.480 --> 03:40:37.480]  and he is at one with us.
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:39.480]  He's a patriot.
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:41.480]  He loves this country.
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:43.480]  He believes in Americana.
[03:40:43.480 --> 03:40:46.480]  He believes in American exceptionalism.
[03:40:46.480 --> 03:40:48.480]  He believes that this is the greatest nation
[03:40:48.480 --> 03:40:50.480]  in the history of the world,
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:53.480]  and that although we are not perfect,
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:58.480]  we are, as Ronald Reagan would say, a shining city on the hill.
[03:40:58.480 --> 03:41:02.480]  And he understands that there are those around the globe
[03:41:02.480 --> 03:41:05.480]  who would seek to tear us down.
[03:41:05.480 --> 03:41:07.480]  We're going to continue here at Info Wars
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:10.480]  to be a voice against the globalists.
[03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:12.480]  We're going to continue to fight those
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:15.480]  who would seek to censor us off of YouTube
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:18.480]  and off of Facebook and off of Google
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:22.480]  and all of the other important social media platforms
[03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:25.480]  controlled by our friends at Silicon Valley.
[03:41:25.480 --> 03:41:28.480]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:41:28.480 --> 03:41:33.480]  We're going to continue to mock the CNNs and the MSNBCs
[03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:36.480]  when they turn out unmitigated BS
[03:41:36.480 --> 03:41:39.480]  and try to convince you that it's news.
[03:41:39.480 --> 03:41:45.480]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:41:45.480 --> 03:41:48.480]  This is the essence of Info Wars.
[03:41:48.480 --> 03:41:51.480]  This is why your trip to the Info Wars stores
[03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:53.480]  is so vitally important.
[03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:56.480]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists
[03:41:56.480 --> 03:41:59.480]  or multi-billionaires standing in the wings
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:01.480]  writing big checks to Alex Jones
[03:42:01.480 --> 03:42:04.480]  to subsidize our work here at Info Wars.
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:08.480]  We have to depend on the individual Info Warrior,
[03:42:08.480 --> 03:42:11.480]  on men and women out there who believe in freedom,
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:13.480]  who believe in liberty,
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:16.480]  and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[03:42:16.480 --> 03:42:19.480]  You can support us by going to the Info Wars store
[03:42:19.480 --> 03:42:22.480]  and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[03:42:22.480 --> 03:42:26.480]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books,
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:28.480]  and, of course, our Neutro Certicles.
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:30.480]  It's a 360 win.
[03:42:30.480 --> 03:42:33.480]  When you buy the super blue Silver Moon Gargle,
[03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:36.480]  you're helping the fight for freedom.
[03:42:36.480 --> 03:42:38.480]  So please go to the site now.
[03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:50.480]  We need your support.
[03:43:09.480 --> 03:43:12.480]  The best way to do this is to get rid of the dust.
[03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:15.480]  You can use your solar energy production
[03:43:15.480 --> 03:43:17.480]  by supporting mitochondria,
[03:43:17.480 --> 03:43:19.480]  much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:23.480]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[03:43:23.480 --> 03:43:26.480]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:26.480 --> 03:43:29.480]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused
[03:43:29.480 --> 03:43:31.480]  by cellular damage,
[03:43:31.480 --> 03:43:34.480]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:34.480 --> 03:43:37.480]  The antioxidants found in cell force
[03:43:37.480 --> 03:43:41.480]  are these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:43:41.480 --> 03:43:46.480]  Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from Info Wars Life.
[03:43:46.480 --> 03:44:15.480]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[03:44:27.480 --> 03:44:29.480]  designed for maximized effects.
[03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:33.480]  This formula is the platinum standard of multi-vitamin mineral products,
[03:44:33.480 --> 03:44:35.480]  and this part is most important.
[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:39.480]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived
[03:44:39.480 --> 03:44:42.480]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:45.480]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure,
[03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:47.480]  you're finding the tip of the spear in the Info War.
[03:44:47.480 --> 03:44:50.480]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.

[03:45:20.480 --> 03:45:23.480]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my Super Female.
[03:45:23.480 --> 03:45:27.480]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again,
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:29.480]  hitting the gym once again.
[03:45:29.480 --> 03:45:32.480]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good,
[03:45:32.480 --> 03:45:35.480]  and I know my hair's luxurious once again,
[03:45:35.480 --> 03:45:38.480]  so obviously Super Female is amazing, I love it.
[03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:41.480]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:44.480]  Survival Shield X2, if there's one product that I would say is life-changing,
[03:45:44.480 --> 03:45:48.480]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:50.480]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:45:50.480 --> 03:46:19.480]  Then win infowarslife.com.
[03:46:20.480 --> 03:46:23.480]  That means we've got a 25% markup
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:26.480]  and we've got it paired with the real red pill
[03:46:26.480 --> 03:46:28.480]  that takes about seven days to kick in.
[03:46:28.480 --> 03:46:30.480]  Rainforest takes about 30 minutes.
[03:46:30.480 --> 03:46:33.480]  But the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:36.480]  They're both 50% off individually
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:39.480]  or together they're 50% off
[03:46:39.480 --> 03:46:43.480]  and free shipping with the combo at infowarslife.com.
[03:46:43.480 --> 03:46:45.480]  But it's got to end in a couple days
[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:48.480]  because both of these best sellers are about to sell out.
[03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:51.480]  Infowarslife.com to get your Brain Force Plus
[03:46:51.480 --> 03:47:20.480]  and real red pill today.
[03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:23.480]  Welcome back.
[03:47:23.480 --> 03:47:25.480]  A little talking heads there
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:27.480]  to usher us into the next segment.
[03:47:27.480 --> 03:47:29.480]  Let's go right to the phone lines.
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:32.480]  Joshua in Texas has been holding.
[03:47:32.480 --> 03:47:34.480]  Joshua, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:37.480]  Tell us what's on your mind.
[03:47:37.480 --> 03:47:40.480]  Well, I've been hearing a lot about
[03:47:40.480 --> 03:47:43.480]  from Dave Hodges from the Common Central
[03:47:43.480 --> 03:47:46.480]  that there's more movement from Mexico
[03:47:46.480 --> 03:47:52.480]  that it's not just those immigrants on a convoy.
[03:47:52.480 --> 03:47:55.480]  It's multiple convoy that some of them
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:47:57.480]  are coming from El Salvador
[03:47:57.480 --> 03:48:01.480]  who are working with the drug cartels and terrorists
[03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:04.480]  trying to move terrorists through the border.
[03:48:04.480 --> 03:48:06.480]  And they're trying to do a flank
[03:48:06.480 --> 03:48:10.480]  to where they make it seem like people are going to California
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:14.480]  but they're coming towards Texas.
[03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:17.480]  And there was also news of
[03:48:17.480 --> 03:48:22.480]  a military personnel talking about also
[03:48:22.480 --> 03:48:26.480]  convoys coming from Canada.
[03:48:26.480 --> 03:48:28.480]  Well, let me say this, Joshua.
[03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:31.480]  I haven't heard about the Canadian portion of your report
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:33.480]  but interestingly enough,
[03:48:33.480 --> 03:48:35.480]  someone I spoke to this morning at the White House
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:38.480]  told me exactly what you just told me
[03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:42.480]  about this convoy that seems to be moving north.
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:47.480]  And the good news, therefore, is our president knows it.
[03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:51.480]  Therefore, the people in charge of immigration know it.
[03:48:51.480 --> 03:48:54.480]  And the good news even further is that Barack Obama
[03:48:54.480 --> 03:48:56.480]  is no longer president.
[03:48:56.480 --> 03:48:59.480]  So it's a legitimate concern.
[03:48:59.480 --> 03:49:03.480]  The good news is the commander-in-chief is at the helm
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:07.480]  and I think he recognizes exactly what you just said.
[03:49:07.480 --> 03:49:09.480]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:49:09.480 --> 03:49:12.480]  Caitlin has called in.
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:14.480]  Evidently, Caitlin, like me,
[03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:18.480]  is an aficionado of Brain Force Plus.
[03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:21.480]  Caitlin, welcome to the Alice Jones Show.
[03:49:21.480 --> 03:49:23.480]  Hi, thanks.
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:29.480]  So I just wanted to talk a little bit about the Brain Force.
[03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:32.480]  I'm a holistic health coach but about two years ago,
[03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:36.480]  I was in a car accident and suffered a brain injury.
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:40.480]  And my mom's also, like when I was a child,
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:44.480]  had a cyst and a brain cyst removed.
[03:49:44.480 --> 03:49:48.480]  And we have both found such great benefit
[03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:51.480]  from using Brain Force.
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:57.480]  And one of the things that I did want to point out
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:02.480]  that the different natural supplements
[03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:06.480]  that Alex provides on InfoWars,
[03:50:06.480 --> 03:50:08.480]  a lot of times they're referred to as boosting,
[03:50:08.480 --> 03:50:13.480]  but I just want to say that actually anything that's natural
[03:50:13.480 --> 03:50:18.480]  is balancing because sometimes, like with the new immune wall,
[03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:25.480]  if you have lupus, your immune system is already hyperactive
[03:50:25.480 --> 03:50:28.480]  and you don't want to boost it, you need to calm it down.
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:33.480]  The nets or tropics are very balancing.
[03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:36.480]  So if it needs to be boosted, it'll boost your system
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:40.480]  and if it needs to be calmed down, the supplements will calm down your system.
[03:50:40.480 --> 03:50:42.480]  You make an excellent point, Caitlin.
[03:50:42.480 --> 03:50:44.480]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:50:44.480 --> 03:50:47.480]  First of all, when it comes to Brain Force Plus,
[03:50:47.480 --> 03:50:52.480]  you're looking at almost 6,000 satisfied testimonials from customers
[03:50:52.480 --> 03:50:55.480]  and a satisfaction rate.
[03:50:55.480 --> 03:51:03.480]  We rate this at 4.6%, 92% positive reaction to this terrific product.
[03:51:03.480 --> 03:51:08.480]  What I like about it is that at that 4 o'clock point in the day,
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:11.480]  when I start to have my energy slump,
[03:51:11.480 --> 03:51:16.480]  Brain Force Plus gives me mental clarity and energy
[03:51:16.480 --> 03:51:19.480]  to continue working into the evening.
[03:51:19.480 --> 03:51:23.480]  Yet when I finally throw in the towel and go to bed,
[03:51:23.480 --> 03:51:25.480]  some usually around midnight,
[03:51:25.480 --> 03:51:32.480]  I don't feel jacked up or spacey because of a product I took earlier in the evening.
[03:51:32.480 --> 03:51:38.480]  I'm able to sleep and that's without the terrific sleep product
[03:51:38.480 --> 03:51:40.480]  that we also have on the website,
[03:51:40.480 --> 03:51:45.480]  which I have used at times of high stress or extensive travel.
[03:51:45.480 --> 03:51:51.480]  So I appreciate your endorsement for what probably is my favorite product
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:51:53.480]  at the Infowars Store.
[03:51:53.480 --> 03:51:56.480]  And I remind our listeners, again,
[03:51:56.480 --> 03:52:02.480]  that we are totally and completely financed by listener and viewer patrons
[03:52:02.480 --> 03:52:04.480]  at the Infowars Store.
[03:52:04.480 --> 03:52:06.480]  This is how we function.
[03:52:06.480 --> 03:52:10.480]  We don't have one big corporate sponsor that says to Alex Jones,
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:13.480]  oh, you can cover that, but you can't cover this,
[03:52:13.480 --> 03:52:16.480]  and you can say that, but you can't say this.
[03:52:16.480 --> 03:52:20.480]  No, Alex Jones goes wherever the facts take him.
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:23.480]  We here at Infowars go wherever the facts take us.
[03:52:23.480 --> 03:52:28.480]  We have no corporate sensor sponsors standing in the wings
[03:52:28.480 --> 03:52:31.480]  telling us what we can cover and what we can't.
[03:52:31.480 --> 03:52:34.480]  That's due to the independence of Infowars,
[03:52:34.480 --> 03:52:38.480]  and that independence is based on the fact that we are only beholden
[03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:42.480]  to literally hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers
[03:52:42.480 --> 03:52:45.480]  who have bought our products online.
[03:52:45.480 --> 03:52:47.480]  Now moving back to the phone,
[03:52:47.480 --> 03:52:50.480]  let's go to Franklin in the District of Columbia.
[03:52:50.480 --> 03:52:53.480]  Franklin, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:52:53.480 --> 03:52:56.480]  Tell us what's on your mind.
[03:52:56.480 --> 03:52:57.480]  Well, thank you, Roger.
[03:52:57.480 --> 03:52:59.480]  It's good to talk to you.
[03:52:59.480 --> 03:53:02.480]  My question for you is, can someone get word to the president
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:04.480]  that he needs to stop begging Mitch McConnell
[03:53:04.480 --> 03:53:07.480]  to do something about the fake filibuster in the Senate?
[03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:10.480]  He needs, as a co-equal branch of government,
[03:53:10.480 --> 03:53:12.480]  the president has standing up, I think,
[03:53:12.480 --> 03:53:17.480]  to sue the Senate to change the rules unconstitutional.
[03:53:17.480 --> 03:53:21.480]  Now that's an interesting question that you pose, Franklin.
[03:53:21.480 --> 03:53:26.480]  I would probably defer to my good friend, Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[03:53:26.480 --> 03:53:30.480]  who I think is one of the leading constitutional
[03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:33.480]  and legal scholars in the country on questions like this.
[03:53:33.480 --> 03:53:35.480]  I'm not knowledgeable enough to tell you
[03:53:35.480 --> 03:53:38.480]  whether the president has that standing.
[03:53:38.480 --> 03:53:40.480]  But I can tell you this.
[03:53:40.480 --> 03:53:43.480]  It's time to do away with the filibuster rule.
[03:53:43.480 --> 03:53:45.480]  It's time to go to a straight majority.
[03:53:45.480 --> 03:53:49.480]  We have finally done so in the selection of some judges.
[03:53:49.480 --> 03:53:55.480]  We need to end the ability of a crazed left-wing libtard minority
[03:53:55.480 --> 03:53:59.480]  led by Chuck Schumer, the handmaiden of Google
[03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:02.480]  and the Silicon Valley Left,
[03:54:02.480 --> 03:54:06.480]  to hamstring this president on important questions
[03:54:06.480 --> 03:54:09.480]  and important appointments.
[03:54:09.480 --> 03:54:11.480]  While we're at it,
[03:54:11.480 --> 03:54:14.480]  I want to register an objection to the holdup
[03:54:14.480 --> 03:54:17.480]  in the appointment of Rick Grinnell
[03:54:17.480 --> 03:54:21.480]  as President Trump's ambassador to Germany.
[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:25.480]  Rick Grinnell's nomination languishes in the Senate
[03:54:25.480 --> 03:54:29.480]  because Mitch McConnell has not pushed it forward.
[03:54:29.480 --> 03:54:32.480]  Rick Grinnell, who was the UN spokesman
[03:54:32.480 --> 03:54:35.480]  under President George W. Bush,
[03:54:35.480 --> 03:54:39.480]  was one of the most articulate and effective campaigners
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:41.480]  for candidate Donald Trump.
[03:54:41.480 --> 03:54:45.480]  He came out early for Trump and he stood his ground
[03:54:45.480 --> 03:54:51.480]  serving as a voluntary defender and advocate for Donald Trump.
[03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:55.480]  The appointment of Rick Grinnell is an excellent appointment.
[03:54:55.480 --> 03:54:57.480]  It is a perfect appointment
[03:54:57.480 --> 03:55:01.480]  and it's time for Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate
[03:55:01.480 --> 03:55:03.480]  to drive that appointment home.
[03:55:03.480 --> 03:55:07.480]  Thank you so much for your call, Franklin.
[03:55:07.480 --> 03:55:14.480]  We are in the midst of an absolute fake news deluge, folks.
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:21.480]  You can't go to MSNBC or CNN or New York Magazine
[03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:24.480]  or any of the other fake news outlets
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:27.480]  without seeing them in high dungeon
[03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:30.480]  over the question of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange,
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:33.480]  and Russian collusion.
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:37.480]  This is nothing but a pathetic attempt to reinflate
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:41.480]  a failed narrative that no one cares about.
[03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:45.480]  The greatest fight in the country today is over censorship
[03:55:45.480 --> 03:55:49.480]  because the 2018 elections and the 2020 elections
[03:55:49.480 --> 03:55:53.480]  hinge on the ability to have a free, open, vibrant,
[03:55:53.480 --> 03:55:58.480]  and robust alternative media based on the Internet.
[03:55:58.480 --> 03:56:02.480]  Without that, in all kinder, the chances of Republican
[03:56:02.480 --> 03:56:06.480]  or conservative success in the next two federal elections
[03:56:06.480 --> 03:56:09.480]  are very, very thin.
[03:56:09.480 --> 03:56:11.480]  You see, the Democrats have figured out
[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:14.480]  that they cannot win with the electorate
[03:56:14.480 --> 03:56:17.480]  configured as it currently is.
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:21.480]  So they hope to flood our electorate with illegals
[03:56:21.480 --> 03:56:24.480]  who they will then legalize and register to vote.
[03:56:24.480 --> 03:56:28.480]  At the same time, they censor our voices
[03:56:28.480 --> 03:56:31.480]  within the larger construct of the election.
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:36.480]  Now, it may be true that they will never have the nerve
[03:56:36.480 --> 03:56:40.480]  to actually censor the commander in chief himself,
[03:56:40.480 --> 03:56:42.480]  but perhaps not.
[03:56:42.480 --> 03:56:47.480]  But when they censor us, when they censor info wars,
[03:56:47.480 --> 03:56:52.480]  when they censor Alex Jones, when they censor Owen Schreuer,
[03:56:52.480 --> 03:56:55.480]  when they censor yours truly,
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:56:59.480]  they're turning down the volume on Donald Trump's supporters,
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:03.480]  which is an important piece of the Republican effort
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:08.480]  to win the House and the Senate again in 2018
[03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:11.480]  and then hold on to the White House in 2020.
[03:57:11.480 --> 03:57:14.480]  The demographics are in our favor.
[03:57:14.480 --> 03:57:16.480]  The economy is in our favor.
[03:57:16.480 --> 03:57:19.480]  The direction of America is in our favor.
[03:57:19.480 --> 03:57:23.480]  The only way they can stop us is by strangling our First Amendment.
[03:57:23.480 --> 03:57:26.480]  To why we need to go to the info wars store now,
[03:57:26.480 --> 03:57:30.480]  send a generous contribution or buy one of these great products
[03:57:30.480 --> 03:57:33.480]  to help gird us for the fight ahead.
[03:57:33.480 --> 03:57:34.480]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:57:34.480 --> 03:58:00.480]  Thanks for joining us on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:04.480 --> 03:58:11.480]  Thanks for joining us on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:34.480 --> 03:58:39.480]  Discover the power of Survival Shield X2 and BioChew Selenium
[03:58:39.480 --> 03:58:43.480]  at infowarslife.com.
[03:58:43.480 --> 03:58:47.480]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products,
[03:58:47.480 --> 03:58:49.480]  we have an info wars life.
[03:58:49.480 --> 03:58:50.480]  They take hours.
[03:58:50.480 --> 03:58:52.480]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:58:52.480 --> 03:58:53.480]  It's stronger.
[03:58:53.480 --> 03:58:55.480]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:55.480 --> 03:58:58.480]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:58:58.480 --> 03:58:59.480]  It's back in stock.
[03:58:59.480 --> 03:59:02.480]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:59:02.480 --> 03:59:04.480]  It's got the preglonone.
[03:59:04.480 --> 03:59:06.480]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:59:06.480 --> 03:59:09.480]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[03:59:09.480 --> 03:59:10.480]  So you can upload it.
[03:59:10.480 --> 03:59:14.480]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver
[03:59:14.480 --> 03:59:19.480]  and iodine 4-5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[03:59:19.480 --> 03:59:20.480]  That's a spray you do.

[03:59:35.480 --> 03:59:37.480]  but it's other people that aren't awake,
[03:59:37.480 --> 03:59:39.480]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:59:39.480 --> 03:59:51.480]  And thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
