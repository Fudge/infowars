[00:00:02.822 --> 00:00:09.464]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.005]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.886]  That's right, it goes on and on, on and on and on.
[00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:17.946]  Ladies and gentlemen, another week we're kicking off.
[00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:19.247]  Monday, the 5th day of December.
[00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:23.630]  2016 will be here for the next four hours live.
[00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.157]  I am back in the saddle recharged and like a wild raging bull out of the gates promoting liberty and freedom worldwide.
[00:00:31.157 --> 00:00:34.180]  Another devastating blow against the New World Order.
[00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:37.207]  I call it an implosion.
[00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:38.448]  It's incredible.
[00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:47.275]  Italy votes to begin basically the pullout from the European Union with a big no vote on letting the EU take over every facet of their government.
[00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:51.318]  The EU responded by saying they're forming an EU army that will simply occupy nations.
[00:00:52.662 --> 00:00:55.843]  You cannot make that level of information up.
[00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:58.184]  This is just so insane.
[00:00:58.184 --> 00:01:05.266]  We also have the latest on the recount with Jill Stein as the public completely turns against her when they learn it's only against Trump.
[00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:12.329]  We've also had the stock market surging to all-time highs because of the Trump effect.
[00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.570]  And a very powerful video that Rob Dewey put together on that front.
[00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.012]  But before we go any further, I want to get to a Chris Wallace piece.
[00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:27.964]  Where he destroys Jill Stein on a recount scam, here it is.
[00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:29.925]  You're doing precisely that right now.
[00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:35.527]  Aren't you doing exactly what Hillary Clinton called horrifying?
[00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:39.849]  I am not here to help Hillary Clinton or to express her point of view.
[00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:53.375]  In my view, the recount should have happened in the Democratic primary as well, where there were also very suspicious results, where voters appeared to be stripped from the rolls in Brooklyn, where hundreds of thousands of votes went uncounted in California.
[00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:55.556]  This is not about Democrats.
[00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:56.877]  It's not about helping Republicans.
[00:01:56.877 --> 00:01:57.537]  I didn't ask you that.
[00:01:57.537 --> 00:02:07.303]  I thought the question I asked you, Dr. Scott, I asked you why not accept the results of the election because what you're doing is exactly what Hillary Clinton said was horrifying.
[00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:18.739]  I'm not, I don't care what Hillary Clinton thinks about this and I don't care, I care what the voters think about this, not what the politicians or the pundits or the party operatives think about this.
[00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:32.611]  This is about responding to the American voters who are standing up and saying we deserve an election system that we can trust and that is accurate, that is secure against hacking, against human error, against machine error and that in which
[00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:35.494]  Okay, the full Jill Stein clips up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:42.302]  As usual, Mark Dice, InfoWars.com analyst, InfoWars.com contributor, had a great breakdown.
[00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:54.384]  Jill, the recount con artist, Stein, has canceled her recount effort in Pennsylvania, saying she didn't want to pay the $1 million bond that was required to initiate it.
[00:02:54.384 --> 00:03:02.685]  This despite raising $7 million, which she claimed was going to go to the recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
[00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:10.787]  Trump's margin of victory in Pennsylvania was almost 50,000 votes, and all experts say that a recount would only sway a count by about 500.
[00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:26.915]  One of the reasons that zero experts are taking this recount seriously, and even the liberal waste of cyberspace website, The Washington Post, The Washington Compost asks, why are people giving Jill Stein millions of dollars for an election recount?
[00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:31.938]  The recount is going on in Wisconsin, so let's have a look and see how that's coming along.
[00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:35.540]  The first day netted Hillary Clinton one extra vote.
[00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:39.919]  First returns from Wisconsin's recount.
[00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.820]  Net Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.402]  One vote.
[00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:48.585]  The totals from day two are in, so let's have a look and see how that's coming along.
[00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:52.107]  Well, Hillary Clinton has gained three votes.
[00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.249]  Donald Trump has gained six.
[00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:58.972]  So that is a net gain of Donald Trump for three votes after day two.
[00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:07.138]  So Joe Stein's pathetic attempt to try to steal these three states away from Donald Trump and hand them to Hillary Clinton has so far handed Donald Trump three extra votes.
[00:04:07.298 --> 00:04:15.121]  The recount in Wisconsin cost over $3 million, which the money came from these suckers that Jill Stein duped into handing her the money.
[00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:22.584]  And so, so far, that's over a million dollars they paid for each vote to then go to Donald Trump.
[00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:32.466]  When speaking to Alan Combs, Jill Stein let it slip that, quote, the three states that we chose, including Michigan, that only now just declared its winner, this was not a partisan choice.
[00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:39.967]  This was zooming in on the states that have the markings of being the most vulnerable to hacking because they had thin margins.
[00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:46.888]  They went the opposite way of what was expected, and they had some kind of voting system vulnerability.
[00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:51.649]  Apparently, Jill Stein didn't get the memo that the mainstream media and the polling agencies were wrong about
[00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:52.950]  Pretty much everything.
[00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.372]  Alright, the full video is again at Infowars.com and MarkDice.com.
[00:04:57.372 --> 00:05:00.053]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:11.299]  Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice just slapped Colorado's largest Sheriff's Department last month with a $10,000 fine and ordered them to take steps to correct their discriminatory hiring practices.
[00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:13.640]  The illegal act the Sheriff's Department committed, you ask?
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.881]  Well, they hired only U.S.
[00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:15.321]  citizens.
[00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:19.986]  Now, in a summary of the settlement on the DOJ's website, they said that insisting on U.S.
[00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:27.335]  citizenship violates an anti-discrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that forbids employers from hiring only U.S.
[00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:29.697]  citizens except in cases where it's mandated by law.
[00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:35.520]  The Denver Sheriff's Department maintains that it's committed to treating all people fairly with dignity and respect.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.442]  They're, of course, cleaning up their practices now, and they vowed not to do it again.
[00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:45.164]  More than 40 states have rules in place keeping law enforcement agencies from hiring non-citizens.
[00:05:45.164 --> 00:05:56.049]  Only Colorado, Louisiana, Maine, and Vermont, as well as West Virginia, have no such statewide restriction, which means that Colorado is a target for the DOJ if they continue to hire only U.S.
[00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:56.749]  citizens.
[00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.110]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.853]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:04.994]  Charlie Daniels.
[00:06:04.994 --> 00:06:06.855]  He's always loved America.
[00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:08.657]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:11.499]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.662]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[00:06:15.662 --> 00:06:16.983]  Individual rights.
[00:06:16.983 --> 00:06:19.645]  Well, let's take a back seat to the collective.
[00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.567]  Well, you know what this expo's going to be, don't you?
[00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:23.188]  There's going to be coming in a few guns.
[00:06:23.188 --> 00:06:23.989]  Oh, yeah.
[00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:25.570]  I tell you, it ain't going to sit well down my way.
[00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.072]  At all.
[00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:28.113]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[00:06:28.113 --> 00:06:30.336]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:31.478]  It's time to ride, boys.
[00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:33.200]  We need a thousand Paul Reveres.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.529]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.392]  And beef was for supper.
[00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:44.575]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:46.457]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[00:06:46.457 --> 00:06:48.098]  DVDs now available.
[00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:52.803]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:06:52.803 --> 00:06:56.187]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:06:56.187 --> 00:06:58.509]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[00:06:58.509 --> 00:06:59.310]  Let's fix it.
[00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:07.374]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:20.580]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:33.404]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:39.366]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:07:49.152 --> 00:08:06.743]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:07.404]  Big Brother.
[00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:11.178]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:14.199]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:16.119]  You want answers?
[00:08:16.119 --> 00:08:18.020]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:24.342]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.084 --> 00:08:52.156]  Well, the head of Ford, Mr. Ford, came out Saturday and said, officially, we're not just going to keep one Ford plant in Kentucky that was building SUVs.
[00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:58.181]  We're looking at bringing more plants back to the United States if President Trump works with us.
[00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:18.472]  The response of Sarah Palin and some of the other supposed conservatives, and I'm not attacking Sarah Palin, I'm just shocked by it, but I really shouldn't be, was to put out tweets and make comments that what we're witnessing is crony capitalism and that Donald Trump is selling us out.
[00:09:18.472 --> 00:09:19.874]  Ann Coulter said the same thing.
[00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:31.215]  Ann Coulter says so much that's true, so much that's accurate, then she'll say, the Japanese ought to pay us, radiation's good for you.
[00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:36.737]  They may be targeting radiation to kill a tumor, but general radiation kills all your cells.
[00:09:36.737 --> 00:09:38.278]  But she said that about Fukushima.
[00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:40.659]  I don't want to sit here and bash her.
[00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:46.641]  But sometimes I think she just says really wild, incendiary things for the headlines.
[00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:47.722]  People say, well don't you do that?
[00:09:47.722 --> 00:09:50.243]  No, I cover incendiary things that are happening.
[00:09:51.838 --> 00:09:53.919]  And it gets headlines because it should.
[00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:57.601]  There's plenty of real stuff out there, but I digress.
[00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:08.247]  Sarah Palin came out and said, I guess they're real happy in Indiana that Carrier's staying, and I'm glad for you, but this is crony capitalism.
[00:10:08.247 --> 00:10:09.748]  Well, he said he was going to fight.
[00:10:09.748 --> 00:10:15.371]  I'm going to explain something to everybody.
[00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:19.433]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to tell you why I'm supporting Trump and where I think things are going.
[00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:20.334]  I'm going to really lay it out.
[00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:24.177]  Very important.
[00:10:24.177 --> 00:10:26.898]  But first off, I want to just say this now.
[00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:40.385]  If China has a corporate tax, depending on which year it is, it changes 10 to 15 points lower than ours.
[00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:48.770]  And if China has a currency 30 to 40 points below ours, depending on, again, what day of the week it is, but 30 to 40 points lower than ours.
[00:10:51.374 --> 00:11:05.947]  And if they have no environmental standards, and slave labor wages, and 16 to 18 hour work days, with no benefits, how do we compete with that?
[00:11:05.947 --> 00:11:18.838]  Now the mainline libertarian think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation and others, that claim they're conservative, claim they're libertarian, they'll tell you, oh well free trade just means we're totally wide open and we don't care what you do.
[00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:27.287]  You can have 100% tariff on us, we've got zero on you.
[00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:33.772]  And then they don't complain when we have our coal power plants shut down, which gives us cheap electricity, and then China builds new ones.
[00:11:33.772 --> 00:11:47.041]  They don't point out that it's totally rigged at a 90 degree angle against us.
[00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:47.361]  Totally.
[00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:53.056]  And it's done by design.
[00:11:53.056 --> 00:12:01.937]  If Trump lowers our corporate tax to the global average, he's only made us on a level playing field.
[00:12:01.937 --> 00:12:07.418]  If he goes five points below, which he's pushing for, you can argue it's a trade war.
[00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:07.918]  So what?
[00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:12.659]  We've been getting the short end of the stick for 50 years.
[00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:18.260]  The media's been telling us how to dress and what to eat and what to do and how to talk for 50, 60 years.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.100]  We've had enough of it!
[00:12:21.383 --> 00:12:23.524]  Oh, the Chinese might have a trade war.
[00:12:23.524 --> 00:12:23.925]  Do it!
[00:12:23.925 --> 00:12:25.265]  We're already under a trade war.
[00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:26.906]  What do you think?
[00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:28.547]  80% of our factories closing.
[00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:30.709]  And now our service industry falling apart.
[00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.189]  And our mining disappearing.
[00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:33.270]  And rare earth minerals.
[00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:33.790]  The U.S.
[00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.233]  has less than 1% of global rare earth mineral extraction.
[00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:40.815]  30 years ago, we had more than half.
[00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:44.777]  We're under economic sabotage!
[00:12:44.777 --> 00:12:48.099]  Let's come into the next segment with Beastie Boys Sabotage.
[00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:51.123]  It's sabotage!
[00:12:51.123 --> 00:12:59.545]  It's sabotage 101 writ large on the wall in flaming frickin' numbers.
[00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:06.348]  But there is this whole fake libertarian right-wing, you know, think tank deal that the left's been right about.
[00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:07.908]  Their answer is just tax them out of oblivion.
[00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:09.509]  No, make them come here.
[00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:10.829]  Or make some of them come here.
[00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:23.933]  I mean, I'm not saying I'll take crumbs, but they're like, oh, well he'll never, we'll never retain our greatness, the Chinese said last week, the Communists, and our own media, you know, echoing Obama, oh, you got some magic wand?
[00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:24.574]  What you gonna do?
[00:13:24.574 --> 00:13:27.135]  On and on and on.
[00:13:30.782 --> 00:13:35.044]  And then you read the Heritage Foundation and all these other groups and they're just like, it's terrible.
[00:13:35.044 --> 00:13:36.805]  It'll hurt globalization.
[00:13:36.805 --> 00:13:46.491]  It'll hurt big mega banks that broker one-sided deals and whose families control the big factories in China and India and Mexico so they can all consolidate wealth while we collapse.
[00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:53.575]  And in the end, they're holding all the wealth and we're putting 200 square foot coffin apartments that cost more than 1,000 foot apartments?
[00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.256]  No!
[00:13:55.256 --> 00:13:58.017]  We're done.
[00:13:58.017 --> 00:13:59.058]  We understand what's happening.
[00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:07.149]  We're being put into economic bondage to control us and they even write textbooks admitting it.
[00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:08.389]  That's what's so crazy.
[00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.030]  That's why my job is so frustrating.
[00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.191]  This is not my opinion.
[00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:14.733]  I've been saying that for 20 plus years.
[00:14:14.733 --> 00:14:16.434]  People finally are getting it though.
[00:14:16.434 --> 00:14:25.479]  I should be more optimistic because this show creates the global talking points more than anybody else for the resistance to the global corporate system.
[00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:27.340]  So I ought to be thanking God every millisecond.
[00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:33.440]  But with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:40.185]  We can't be like the mainstream corporate news that's been caught producing all the fake corporate news and getting talking orders from the establishment.
[00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:48.892]  As we become the new dominant media, that means you out there with a Facebook page or a local radio host or whoever you are, we have to have the highest standards.
[00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:55.353]  The media can take what we do out of context here and there.
[00:14:55.353 --> 00:15:04.979]  Nobody's perfect, but we have very good standards compared to the globalists.
[00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:14.104]  Now, China has come out and says that Trump is now clear that Taiwan is not a sovereign, independent nation, that they've, quote, reached out to him.
[00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:17.747]  And we'll see what Trump actually comes out and says, but that's what Conway's saying.
[00:15:17.747 --> 00:15:21.089]  We also have Trump coming out and saying, I took a call from the new elected first woman
[00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:26.063]  President in Taiwan, who's a nationalist.
[00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:28.385]  We sell him $2 billion of weapons a year.
[00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:29.806]  I'll talk to whoever I want.
[00:15:29.806 --> 00:15:33.290]  And the State Department called it a diplomatic, you know, fiasco and all this.
[00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:39.115]  No, our president shouldn't be kept slaves of the bureaucracy and the diplomatic corps.
[00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:44.881]  It's time to have a real president, and I think it's very, very refreshing.
[00:15:44.881 --> 00:15:46.182]  And I shot the video yesterday.
[00:15:47.793 --> 00:15:50.555]  Trump refuses to bow to Chinese Communist threats.
[00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:52.476]  Re-establishes ties with Taiwan.
[00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:54.177]  Excuse me, Saturday.
[00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:58.060]  That's exactly what Gingrich came out and said today.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.821]  China is literally running Hollywood to a great extent.
[00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:03.943]  China is lecturing all of us like we're 5 years old.
[00:16:03.943 --> 00:16:05.004]  It's got to stop.
[00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:06.685]  And I'm not against the Chinese people.
[00:16:06.685 --> 00:16:08.086]  I want them to be free.
[00:16:08.086 --> 00:16:10.388]  They're the most enslaved people in history.
[00:16:10.388 --> 00:16:12.989]  Their government's killed over 100 million of them.
[00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:14.230]  The Chinese government admits it.
[00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.932]  80 plus under mouths of tongue.
[00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.158]  From 49 to the time he died in the 70s.
[00:16:24.158 --> 00:16:26.441]  Trump refuses to bow to Chinese Communist.
[00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:28.685]  Very powerful viral video.
[00:16:28.685 --> 00:16:30.888]  Ford willing to work with Trump and policies are right.
[00:16:30.888 --> 00:16:33.112]  CEO says so.
[00:16:33.112 --> 00:16:34.294]  Carrier's already staying.
[00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:40.620]  Ford's already got one plant that was scheduled to move to Mexico next year staying.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.263]  And the head of Ford says, listen, you cut corporate tax, then I can afford to be here.
[00:16:46.263 --> 00:16:50.305]  Why wouldn't I go to Mexico with a lower corporate tax?
[00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:51.005]  We can't compete.
[00:16:51.005 --> 00:16:52.406]  Everybody else is going down there.
[00:16:52.406 --> 00:16:54.807]  Ford's tried to stay here unlike other people.
[00:16:54.807 --> 00:16:57.948]  Ford has the best record of trying to stay in the United States.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.522]  Dodge is owned by Fiat.
[00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:05.643]  Great products, by the way.
[00:17:05.643 --> 00:17:12.531]  At least they got some factories here, but... I gotta say, since Dodge got taken over by Fiat, the cars have gotten better.
[00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.134]  Ferrari parts, you name it.
[00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:17.777]  The point is that a lot of stuff is going on.
[00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:21.301]  A lot of things are happening.
[00:17:21.301 --> 00:17:21.421]  And...
[00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:34.102]  I've said this hundreds of times, I'm going to say it again, I'm going to talk about it at the bottom of the hour in detail, and I talked about this in the Washington Post had an article last week saying, Reitbart and Infowars could make big trouble for Trump.
[00:17:34.102 --> 00:17:35.704]  That was the headline.
[00:17:35.704 --> 00:17:42.471]  Saying if he doesn't deliver 100% whatever we want, or the most radical libertarian base in their words, that we're all going to turn against Trump.
[00:17:45.285 --> 00:17:48.446]  They want to cut us off from him so we don't have influence.
[00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:54.829]  They want to get him cut off from the populist, anti-globalist base that just took over Italy.
[00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:56.470]  That's taking over the UK.
[00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.351]  That's taking over France.
[00:17:59.351 --> 00:18:04.774]  Leading in the polls in France, Marine Le Pen, nationalist.
[00:18:04.774 --> 00:18:08.355]  Just won the presidency, Donald Trump, nationalist, anti-globalist.
[00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:10.276]  Americanism, not globalism.
[00:18:10.276 --> 00:18:12.877]  The UK just starting to pull out of the EU with Brexit.
[00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:14.518]  Russia pulled out first a decade ago.
[00:18:16.249 --> 00:18:22.846]  Italy just had a no vote to have the EU come in and run their entire government and micromanage every facet of their country.
[00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:27.792]  Catalonia is pulling out.
[00:18:27.792 --> 00:18:34.157]  Every EU country has referendums scheduled this year and next year to pull out of the European Union.
[00:18:34.157 --> 00:18:35.298]  They're on fire.
[00:18:35.298 --> 00:18:41.102]  Their tyrannical, unelected system that's above the law is falling apart in front of our eyes.
[00:18:41.102 --> 00:18:48.668]  We're seeing devastating victories for nationalists all over the world, except in Austria, which has been proven to engage in fraud.
[00:18:48.668 --> 00:18:51.930]  The polls keep showing that nationalists are going to win, but they keep losing.
[00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.832]  Now, it's the reverse in Italy.
[00:18:54.878 --> 00:19:03.428]  In Italy again, 15 point polls showed the Prime Minister wanting to hand what was left of their sovereignty over the unelected Brussels bureaucrats.
[00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:10.974]  It showed 15 points in the average national poll that they were going to lose, and that he was going to win, and that he was going to win.
[00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:17.658]  Magically, they lost in a landslide, and their media is flabbergasted and says they don't know how this could happen.
[00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:20.860]  Same story over and over again, just like here.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.363]  They had 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 points, depending on the poll.
[00:19:26.363 --> 00:19:28.104]  It says it in the methodology.
[00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:29.184]  People say, how did you know this?
[00:19:29.184 --> 00:19:30.445]  It's in the frickin' methodology!
[00:19:31.749 --> 00:19:40.256]  You go read, you're adding on average 15 points to a Hillary poll, she's gonna be ahead!
[00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:49.022]  But when Trump had 20 point lead out of the convention, they had to start adding 30, 40, 50 points just to have her 20 points ahead, to reverse reality.
[00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.504]  People knew it was a fraud, they didn't buy it.
[00:19:51.504 --> 00:19:53.706]  They didn't go, I guess I'll vote for her to bet on a winner.
[00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:55.607]  They did the right thing and they lost.
[00:19:55.607 --> 00:19:57.529]  And it's happening worldwide.
[00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.870]  Liberty is rising!
[00:20:00.507 --> 00:20:05.289]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:11.171]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:20:11.171 --> 00:20:17.673]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:20:17.673 --> 00:20:21.714]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.681]  It's not if, but when.

[00:22:59.048 --> 00:23:01.789]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:07.692]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.

[00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:06.060]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:23.228]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:29.210]  It is sabotage, ladies and gentlemen, to have China be able to have all the dirty coal plants they want.
[00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.251]  We can't even have clean ones.
[00:24:31.587 --> 00:24:34.909]  So they can have electricity three times cheaper than ours.
[00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:38.211]  They can have a corporate tax 10 to 15 points lower than ours.
[00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:41.573]  A currency 30 to 40 points lower than ours.
[00:24:41.573 --> 00:24:44.955]  No environmental standards.
[00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:45.715]  No insurance.
[00:24:45.715 --> 00:24:46.656]  No workers comp.
[00:24:46.656 --> 00:24:49.558]  No regulations.
[00:24:49.558 --> 00:24:51.779]  No globalist pressure to clean up.
[00:24:51.779 --> 00:24:55.301]  Designed to de-industrialize us and they've done it.
[00:24:55.301 --> 00:24:56.942]  So they could dictate terms of our surrender.
[00:24:59.226 --> 00:25:08.611]  Meanwhile, Trump comes out and says, you know, with the carrier deal, I said we're going to really try to pass a corporate tax cut so you don't move to Mexico.
[00:25:08.611 --> 00:25:17.436]  But in lieu of that, we're going to try to get the local city, which I guess hadn't thought to do this, to give you some tax incentives to stay.
[00:25:17.436 --> 00:25:19.657]  Oh my gosh, it's crony capitalism.
[00:25:19.657 --> 00:25:20.137]  No, it's not.
[00:25:20.137 --> 00:25:22.499]  It's called having jobs.
[00:25:22.499 --> 00:25:25.941]  The big corporations already wrote it where they don't pay taxes and they left.
[00:25:26.764 --> 00:25:33.466]  They wrote laws here and push for high regulations and taxes, so there's no competition for them here.
[00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:35.387]  They shut down their competition here.
[00:25:35.387 --> 00:25:42.109]  They go to China that has one-sided deals, four elites to set up monopolies, and they take over.
[00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:46.750]  David Rockefeller's grandfather said it best.
[00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.931]  Competition is a sin.
[00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:50.231]  We have to create monopolies.
[00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:55.833]  We must ban competition through government-sponsored and controlled combines.
[00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:56.413]  That's a quote.
[00:25:59.428 --> 00:26:07.815]  Combines, or a group of monopolies, working synergistically together to screw the little guy.
[00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:10.257]  You know the railroad comes to town?
[00:26:10.257 --> 00:26:11.137]  They're building a railroad.
[00:26:11.137 --> 00:26:17.903]  They want to take your property you've had for 50 years that your daddy, you know, went out west to get.
[00:26:17.903 --> 00:26:18.723]  You put in wells.
[00:26:18.723 --> 00:26:20.585]  You built some houses.
[00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:22.386]  Railroad shows up with men with guns.
[00:26:22.386 --> 00:26:26.890]  They say, listen here, you gonna sell that for pennies on the dollar or you gonna die, boy.
[00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:34.048]  Didn't sell, they just say, everybody saw he drew for his gun.
[00:26:34.048 --> 00:26:35.570]  You see all those in the old western movies?
[00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.255]  That's because that happened thousands of times that are admitted.
[00:26:40.255 --> 00:26:45.622]  Where townspeople from Colorado to Texas to Indiana to you name it, up all over the west to California.
[00:26:47.793 --> 00:26:54.776]  would have to get together in armed groups and defend themselves from the railroad men as they were called.
[00:26:54.776 --> 00:27:04.300]  And a railroad truck would pull up and 50 guys would ride off on their horses with their guns and they'd start killing people.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.200]  And the U.S.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.043]  Marshals wouldn't go after them because the big old railroad men had bought off the federal government.
[00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:13.706]  But you know what?
[00:27:13.706 --> 00:27:16.247]  The railroad men ended up getting their ass kicked all over the country.
[00:27:16.247 --> 00:27:22.250]  And by the 1890s and such, that stopped.
[00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.432]  So people better grow up and realize what we're facing.
[00:27:25.432 --> 00:27:27.633]  A bunch of mafias muscling in.
[00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:29.934]  And here comes Trump.
[00:27:29.934 --> 00:27:34.616]  We're going to play a video called the Trump Effect when we come back.
[00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:37.578]  Here comes Trump.
[00:27:37.578 --> 00:27:39.879]  And he says, we're going to cut our tax even with China.
[00:27:41.254 --> 00:27:45.157]  And they have to control fake media, go, oh, he wants rich people to pay no taxes.
[00:27:45.157 --> 00:27:47.558]  The rich people wrote it to move it.
[00:27:47.558 --> 00:27:54.282]  Warren Buffett, all the big rich globalists are openly lobbying to keep that tax high.
[00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:56.324]  Because they set it up that way.
[00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:03.348]  You know how much General Electric pays on average year, internationally?
[00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:03.648]  Zero.
[00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:06.470]  You know how much Google pays on average globally?
[00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.211]  Three percent.
[00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:09.812]  Because they do so much business back in the West, they have to pay some.
[00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:11.773]  You know what Apple pays?
[00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:12.434]  Zero.
[00:28:12.434 --> 00:28:14.995]  Google it!
[00:28:14.995 --> 00:28:19.197]  Everybody knows this!
[00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:23.280]  And this is how they operate, because they don't want an economy here, but already Apple under pressure.
[00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:29.274]  Because they've hit the peak where now their sales are plummeting because people don't have money to buy their products anymore.
[00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:32.556]  So now they're saying, oh, maybe we will have some stuff assembled here.
[00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:35.478]  I'm not saying I'll take crumbs, but that's how things begin.
[00:28:35.478 --> 00:28:37.619]  It's how you get a beachhead.
[00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:39.581]  But we're not getting crumbs with Trump.
[00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:43.703]  Ford says they'll move it all back.
[00:28:43.703 --> 00:28:44.484]  Ford in a statement.
[00:28:45.916 --> 00:29:08.767]  Mr. Ford, I love how it's still family-owned, came out and said, I will move it all back if you just simply have a level playing field, and you cut the corporate tax, and you allow us to have infrastructure, and you don't gouge the hell out of us, and you have reasonable bureaucracies, not total harassment.
[00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:11.468]  So that's a big deal, folks, and that's why
[00:29:12.588 --> 00:29:15.171]  You see the demonization of Trump taking place now.
[00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:17.934]  I want to come back and play this video, the Trump Effect.
[00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:19.115]  It's very powerful.
[00:29:19.115 --> 00:29:27.064]  And then I want to get into different philosophies on whether you should support Trump or not support Trump and these appointments, some of which are troubling.
[00:29:27.064 --> 00:29:29.387]  I'm going to just give you my mind on the subject.
[00:29:31.092 --> 00:29:33.973]  And then we can open the phones up if you'd like and you can give me your take on it.
[00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:44.198]  And then separately, the really incredibly positive news, another death blow against globalism with what's happened with Italy voting to not let the EU take over their country.
[00:29:44.198 --> 00:29:45.498]  This is so big.
[00:29:45.498 --> 00:29:49.280]  Cause for celebration!
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.681]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:53.202]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.202 --> 00:29:55.883]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:01.630]  First Brexit, then Trump.
[00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.271]  Is Italy next for the West's, quote, populist movement, as The Guardian puts it?
[00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:12.114]  Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after losing a crucial reform referendum.
[00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:23.418]  A global political earthquake is underway where decidedly people are standing up in westernized nations and taking back their countries from rogue globalist, its latest victim, globalist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
[00:30:23.558 --> 00:30:31.063]  Who has announced that he will resign after suffering a humiliating defeat in a referendum, throwing the country and the Eurozone into utter confusion.
[00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:34.105]  Now he says that the experience of my government ends here.
[00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:41.769]  Renzi said in a televised address to the nation yesterday that the results show his yes camp was well on track to losing the referendum.
[00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:45.411]  Now, as he quits, arguably Hollande and Merkel are next.
[00:30:45.411 --> 00:30:49.414]  This comes after MPs and Senators representing the Five Star Movement
[00:30:49.554 --> 00:30:56.642]  Launched by Beth A. Grillo, decided to get 4 million signatures they needed to take back their country and launch a referendum.
[00:30:56.642 --> 00:30:58.944]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:00.662]  Hey everyone!
[00:31:00.662 --> 00:31:06.787]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.787 --> 00:31:08.869]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:08.869 --> 00:31:19.158]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.158 --> 00:31:25.123]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.523 --> 00:31:25.943]  We're good to go!
[00:31:40.674 --> 00:31:40.974]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.662 --> 00:32:02.304]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[00:32:02.304 --> 00:32:04.466]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:13.294]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[00:32:13.294 --> 00:32:15.816]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[00:32:15.816 --> 00:32:21.221]  It's mobile, to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[00:32:21.661 --> 00:32:25.403]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[00:32:25.403 --> 00:32:28.825]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:29.846]  A true innovation.
[00:32:29.846 --> 00:32:31.927]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:32:31.927 --> 00:32:33.648]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[00:32:33.648 --> 00:32:36.169]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:40.351]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[00:32:40.351 --> 00:32:42.452]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:42.452 --> 00:32:44.494]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:44.494 --> 00:32:45.274]  And check this out.

[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.929]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:23.929 --> 00:33:27.734]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:30.457]  Talk show host, creator of Vice News.
[00:33:31.914 --> 00:33:33.495]  Advice itself.
[00:33:33.495 --> 00:33:35.136]  Gavin McInnes, always a great guest.
[00:33:35.136 --> 00:33:37.317]  He'll join us for about 30-40 minutes.
[00:33:37.317 --> 00:33:43.079]  In the second hour today, always a big enemy of political correctness, really entertaining.
[00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:44.200]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:57.446]  And then we have Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Group, who has sources inside the NYPD that days and weeks before stuff broke, he was breaking down the fact that the NYPD was investigating sex trafficking.
[00:33:58.146 --> 00:34:05.630]  We have Eric Prince, formerly of Blackwater, saying, currently an ex-Z or whatever new name it's got, with a lot of their intel saying that is indeed what's going on.
[00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:16.877]  We know about the Lolita Express, and Epstein, Epstein and Bill Clinton, and these Islamic sheiks and people that are known pedophiles that they were traveling with, and of course,
[00:34:18.134 --> 00:34:19.455]  Mr. Epstein was convicted
[00:34:35.945 --> 00:34:47.636]  He's out running around saying there's nothing in the Podesta emails, it's insane, there's no such thing as organized child trafficking basically, even though they know full well that's not the case.
[00:34:47.636 --> 00:34:55.263]  And then putting out fake news saying we are the creators or the progenitors of the Pizzagate controversy.
[00:34:56.204 --> 00:35:00.846]  Pizza is in FBI files as code word for sex.
[00:35:00.846 --> 00:35:09.649]  Then people picked up on some pizza place in DC and Reddit and Facebook posters have claimed that that's the headquarters.
[00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:11.890]  We've said be very careful.
[00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:18.392]  Folks shouldn't just pick out this or that out of the thousands of emails and claim that something's going on.
[00:35:18.392 --> 00:35:19.432]  Folks have investigated it.
[00:35:19.432 --> 00:35:23.134]  There is some weird stuff there, but I don't think you can prove it one way or the other.
[00:35:23.874 --> 00:35:28.395]  And I've always pointed out, we're one of the biggest media organizations in the world now.
[00:35:28.395 --> 00:35:30.335]  We have to be very, very careful.
[00:35:30.335 --> 00:35:37.997]  And so I've got videos I've shot on this, saying everybody should investigate it, but not jump to conclusions, that are getting 30% down votes.
[00:35:37.997 --> 00:35:39.518]  That never happens.
[00:35:39.518 --> 00:35:42.458]  Saying, oh, you're covering up Pizzagate now.
[00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:45.639]  No, I had CNN yesterday and today say that I'm behind it all.
[00:35:47.878 --> 00:35:51.501]  Just like they say that I say Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma City.
[00:35:51.501 --> 00:35:53.283]  I never said any such thing.
[00:35:53.283 --> 00:35:56.105]  Or just like they say that I'm quote deeply racist.
[00:35:56.105 --> 00:35:57.486]  This is what they do.
[00:35:57.486 --> 00:36:00.289]  It's why they're discredited.
[00:36:00.289 --> 00:36:07.455]  But at the same time, we're the big outlet that gets blamed for everything everybody else does.
[00:36:07.455 --> 00:36:13.160]  And quite frankly, with the cover-ups of Jimmy Savelle and the cover-ups of all this other garbage,
[00:36:14.332 --> 00:36:25.096]  And all the pedophile scandals at major universities and what's going on in other major institutions and the media cover-up and the government cover-up of it.
[00:36:25.096 --> 00:36:33.219]  I know why the public's so freaked out because the cover-ups and the pedophilia are so prolific and so institutionalized.
[00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:39.522]  But when I saw media three weeks ago only focus on a couple pizza places in D.C.
[00:36:41.314 --> 00:36:46.919]  I said, is that a honeypot to distract us onto one small area and not look at the greater picture?
[00:36:46.919 --> 00:36:51.223]  Then try to discredit that and throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[00:36:52.133 --> 00:36:54.335]  And sure enough, that's what's going on.
[00:36:54.335 --> 00:36:55.496]  That's what's unfolding.
[00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:57.077]  I'm not passing judgment.
[00:36:57.077 --> 00:36:58.898]  I'm not saying one way or the other.
[00:36:58.898 --> 00:37:00.340]  The emails are bizarre.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.561]  The statements are bizarre.
[00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:03.082]  The art is bizarre.
[00:37:03.082 --> 00:37:04.763]  The spirit cooking is bizarre.
[00:37:04.763 --> 00:37:05.984]  It is satanic.
[00:37:05.984 --> 00:37:07.105]  It is a ritual.
[00:37:07.105 --> 00:37:08.546]  The lady admits it.
[00:37:08.546 --> 00:37:10.568]  But it's New York, D.C., L.A.
[00:37:10.568 --> 00:37:15.031]  It's thousands of names.
[00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:16.613]  I can't figure it out.
[00:37:16.613 --> 00:37:20.196]  And so the issue here is we need to continue to investigate
[00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:39.138]  The larger child trafficking networks themselves and what happened at Penn State and what happened at other major institutions that's now been swept under the rug and asked why our mainstream media covered it up for so long before it finally began to come out.
[00:37:39.138 --> 00:37:42.401]  That's the bigger story here.
[00:37:42.401 --> 00:37:48.386]  And we've been there day one exposing what happened at the Catholic Church and what happened at the Vatican and what happened at Penn State.
[00:37:50.506 --> 00:37:59.255]  And I've been proud to do that, but we've done it with real research, and real guests, and real analysis, and not speculation.
[00:37:59.255 --> 00:38:03.500]  That's why they hate InfoWars so much, because we're so researched, we're so on target.
[00:38:06.789 --> 00:38:09.411]  And that's why they want to say we're fake news.
[00:38:09.411 --> 00:38:10.992]  Because we're hurting them so bad.
[00:38:10.992 --> 00:38:12.213]  They're the fake news.
[00:38:12.213 --> 00:38:12.853]  Caught lying.
[00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:14.234]  Caught being run by the White House.
[00:38:14.234 --> 00:38:16.655]  Caught having the Communist Chinese tell them what to say and what to do.
[00:38:16.655 --> 00:38:24.380]  The Communist Chinese have gotten so arrogant, they were there again in the Wall Street Journal last week, telling everyone, shut down your fake news.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.661]  Go after your new press.
[00:38:25.661 --> 00:38:27.262]  Go after your independent press.
[00:38:27.262 --> 00:38:28.443]  Have state-run media.
[00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:29.864]  Join with us.
[00:38:29.864 --> 00:38:34.287]  The whole globalist world is struggling from the EU to the Communist Chinese.
[00:38:36.032 --> 00:38:49.400]  To the criminals in the UK that run that government to a great extent to suppress the nationalistic insurrection worldwide that is trying to throw off the criminal organizations that have hijacked our nations.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:56.344]  And you cannot deny the pedophile thread that runs through all of these governments as a system of compromise and control.
[00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:24.472]  So because CNN has attacked us, and because different organizations have tried to misrepresent what we're saying and what we're doing, I'm going to now start cutting reports that go into Savelle, and Prince Charles, and Boys Town, and Penn State, and the Vatican, and the underage cowboys at the White House, hundreds of times, that's mainstream news articles, and the CIA and the Finders case.
[00:39:26.138 --> 00:39:30.779]  And I'm gonna go show everybody the admitted, real, confirmed pedophilia.
[00:39:30.779 --> 00:39:34.521]  And Salon Magazine saying pedophilia's not a problem.
[00:39:34.521 --> 00:39:39.722]  And other publications coming out saying incest is good.
[00:39:39.722 --> 00:39:44.424]  The truth is, there's a very sick underbelly here.
[00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:54.487]  But just because it's going on, we can't become like the mainstream media on witch hunts and sit there and just say, well this looks like evidence, so they're guilty of all this.
[00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:02.503]  Because we have huge, big issues to deal with.
[00:40:02.503 --> 00:40:08.164]  I will say, the stuff in the Podesta emails hurt my soul.
[00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:16.226]  So I do have somewhat of a subconscious revulsion to reporting on this and covering it.
[00:40:16.226 --> 00:40:20.187]  But CNN and others have miscalculated yet again.
[00:40:20.187 --> 00:40:23.468]  They want to double down, misrepresent what we say and what we do,
[00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:31.395]  I'm going to take control of the investigation into this, and I'm going to cover it.
[00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:36.318]  And I'm going to burrow into it, and I'm going to interview people on both sides.
[00:40:36.318 --> 00:40:43.423]  And what you gotta watch out for is, too, these groups will recruit outsiders to come in who think they're innocent.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:51.542]  Then those people will be abused in the media, and then they'll become the poster children for what the government and the globalists are up to.
[00:40:51.542 --> 00:41:03.545]  But it's come out from the Secret Service, it's come out from the NYPD, that child trafficking is going on, and that's what Eric Prince would not come out of nowhere and say that if he didn't have major evidence.
[00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:04.345]  And he got into that.
[00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:06.366]  Say what you want about Blackwater.
[00:41:07.392 --> 00:41:09.033]  A week before the election.
[00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.693]  Because that's what law enforcement's telling us.
[00:41:10.693 --> 00:41:12.014]  It's what he's being told.
[00:41:12.014 --> 00:41:13.354]  This is very serious.
[00:41:13.354 --> 00:41:15.535]  And they've been told to shut it down.
[00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:16.455]  We're covering it.
[00:41:16.455 --> 00:41:24.738]  We're the ones trying to look at and cover the overall phenomenon from every perspective of what's really happening.
[00:41:24.738 --> 00:41:26.879]  Because my job is to find the truth.
[00:41:26.879 --> 00:41:30.300]  My job is to really discover what's actually going on and happening.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.782]  Not be delusional like the left and say everybody's a racist that doesn't support Obamacare.
[00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:38.772]  Everybody that owns a gun wants to kill innocent people.
[00:41:38.772 --> 00:41:41.514]  We can't stoop to their control level.
[00:41:41.514 --> 00:41:47.719]  We have to really seek out the truth and go where it leads us.
[00:41:47.719 --> 00:41:51.763]  Fake news delivers real gunman to pizzeria caught up in alt-right conspiracy theory.
[00:41:51.763 --> 00:41:53.004]  First they said he came with a gun.
[00:41:53.004 --> 00:41:55.646]  Now he supposedly shot things up.
[00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.968]  But nobody was hurt.
[00:41:57.968 --> 00:42:02.132]  So now you see everybody's victims.
[00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:14.755]  And again, I was saying this three weeks ago, why is everyone out of tens of thousands of emails focusing on a couple, mentioning going to eat pizza and meeting somewhere that's a known Democratic Party thing for fundraising?
[00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:19.278]  Sounds completely illegitimate.
[00:42:19.278 --> 00:42:21.600]  So I hear that and I go, what's being reported?
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.942]  And I go, oh, they got weird stuff on the walls and
[00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:31.515]  You know, the people that are involved with it are tweeting all this really bizarre stuff that I'm not even going to mention on air.
[00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:37.580]  I go, okay, and then they got rock stars there that are singing weird songs talking about preferences being children.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:45.588]  I'm like, whoa, this looks really bad, but I'm not ready to just say everybody involved is doing something bad, or who knows, maybe it's just people trying to be trendy.
[00:42:45.588 --> 00:42:51.773]  I mean, Marilyn Manson sings songs about smells like children and killing kids, trying to sound like he's radical.
[00:42:52.854 --> 00:42:53.795]  Evil.
[00:42:53.795 --> 00:42:55.495]  Is he really those things he says he is?
[00:42:55.495 --> 00:42:56.616]  I don't know.
[00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:57.676]  I can't pass judgment.
[00:42:57.676 --> 00:43:00.618]  I can say I don't like his music.
[00:43:00.618 --> 00:43:03.499]  I don't like talking about hurting kids.
[00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:05.480]  But that's how people try to get shocking.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:11.963]  On the internet, some of the hottest porn for a decade, I've never seen it but I've been told about it, it's been in the news, is hurting puppies and kittens.
[00:43:11.963 --> 00:43:16.184]  Super good looking women stomping on little kittens.
[00:43:16.184 --> 00:43:19.726]  And it goes from just kicking a kitten to actually killing a kitten.
[00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:29.130]  Now, I didn't believe that existed 10 years ago, until I saw reputable news reporting on it.
[00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.132]  And I personally can't watch it.
[00:43:31.132 --> 00:43:41.360]  I can't watch battlefield footage of a little kid's lower mandible blown off and their tongue out, flopping around as they scream for mommy with their lower mandible blown off.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.341]  I've seen that.
[00:43:42.341 --> 00:43:44.062]  I have nightmares about it to this day.
[00:43:44.062 --> 00:43:50.528]  So I get why people don't look at all this, but here's the deal.
[00:43:52.443 --> 00:44:07.489]  I don't like being accused of things I'm not involved in, and I'm not going to sit here and just haphazardly run around and attack people and come to final conclusions without there being absolute bonafide evidence up one side and down the other.
[00:44:07.489 --> 00:44:20.795]  That's my position on the whole thing, but I'm going to codify larger reports and just get into all the admitted stuff that's going on, that focusing on some nebulous place without the total proof is a distraction.
[00:44:22.398 --> 00:44:25.701]  Folks can't understand that, they can't understand anything.
[00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:31.765]  Briefly, they're now in, it is a new limited edition Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt.
[00:44:31.765 --> 00:44:37.229]  It is a goblin design that myself and one of the great graphics people collaborated on.
[00:44:37.229 --> 00:44:46.176]  It is George Soros as a goblin, and there's a circle around him, you know, an X through him, saying Deport Soros on the bottom.
[00:44:46.176 --> 00:44:48.157]  Above it it says Info Wars established 1996.
[00:44:53.052 --> 00:45:01.535]  Now, on the front it says Hillary for Prison 2017, and on the right hand shoulder in white it says Infowars.com.
[00:45:01.535 --> 00:45:03.476]  I think it's the best design yet.
[00:45:03.476 --> 00:45:05.937]  It is a limited edition of the shirt.
[00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:12.702]  And the profit we make off of it helps fund this operation, so we need your support now more than ever.
[00:45:12.702 --> 00:45:20.624]  Hillary for prison 2017, great way to celebrate the fact that we defeated her in the polls and the court of public opinion, but we're not done yet.
[00:45:20.624 --> 00:45:30.766]  Now it's time to keep pushing for her to be indicted or for Trump to call for investigations of the foundation, which Conway has said is still on the table.
[00:45:30.766 --> 00:45:32.586]  And let me tell you, it is still on the table.
[00:45:33.246 --> 00:45:39.630]  And Hillary being involved in this recount, breaking her deal with Trump, puts it back on the table big time.
[00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.551]  So get that shirt.
[00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:44.514]  Also, we have new specials running at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:44.514 --> 00:45:45.855]  This is how we have reporters.
[00:45:45.855 --> 00:45:47.496]  This is how we have camera crew and editors.
[00:45:47.496 --> 00:45:57.963]  This is how we've grown and expanded, and that is my sincere goal, is to hire six, seven more reporters, five, six more camera people and editors, and a couple more investigative journalists and fact checkers.
[00:45:59.793 --> 00:46:05.001]  We've got a big news organization, and for myself and Rob Duda to be the main fact-checkers around here is exhausting.
[00:46:05.001 --> 00:46:08.186]  I'm fact-checking stuff at midnight.
[00:46:08.186 --> 00:46:09.268]  So we're trying our best here.
[00:46:12.827 --> 00:46:14.888]  We have a mega special live now.
[00:46:14.888 --> 00:46:17.370]  You can get DNA Force for 25% off.
[00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:26.416]  This is our flagship product with the BioPQQ with over 100 plus documented studies on what it does to take the toxins out of your cells.
[00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:28.897]  It's been known to just do amazing things.
[00:46:28.897 --> 00:46:31.559]  Nerve growth factor.
[00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:34.181]  This is sold as a drug in Europe, just the BioPQQ alone.
[00:46:35.607 --> 00:46:42.694]  The CoQ10 digestive enzymes, powerful herbs, and many other high-quality ingredients that fuse together to be the ultimate product.
[00:46:42.694 --> 00:46:48.119]  Similar stuff sold in clinics for $200, $300, $400, $500.
[00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:52.683]  It's a fraction of that, ladies and gentlemen, because we only market up, I don't know, it's on discount, like 60%.
[00:46:55.427 --> 00:47:04.349]  It's available now at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:17.493]  There's also the all-new Brain Force Plus has arrived, 20% more in each bottle and the ingredients are even stronger, so it's more than 20%, just 20% more in each container, but it's also been made even stronger.
[00:47:19.292 --> 00:47:21.595]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix is back.
[00:47:21.595 --> 00:47:23.057]  It had been sold out.
[00:47:23.057 --> 00:47:27.523]  It's all the top minerals, all the top vitamins, the enzymes, the amino acids.
[00:47:27.523 --> 00:47:28.585]  So you upload it.
[00:47:28.585 --> 00:47:29.807]  Tastes great.
[00:47:29.807 --> 00:47:31.048]  Totally natural, organic.
[00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:35.454]  Great way to get your kids to get their multivitamin and actually absorb it.
[00:47:35.454 --> 00:47:36.155]  Info Wars.
[00:47:37.489 --> 00:47:40.753]  Life.com takes you right to the supplement page.
[00:47:40.753 --> 00:47:45.038]  Infowarstore.com again is the larger umbrella site.

[00:48:00.813 --> 00:48:07.136]  Infowars, life.com, infowarsstore.com, or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:48:07.136 --> 00:48:11.558]  And it is your purchase of the products now more than ever.
[00:48:11.558 --> 00:48:14.679]  I mean, listen, I'm not bragging when I say this.
[00:48:14.679 --> 00:48:15.620]  In fact, I don't like to do it.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.440]  It's not my nature.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.982]  I really assess the numbers.
[00:48:19.982 --> 00:48:21.543]  I sent a detailed report.
[00:48:21.543 --> 00:48:23.604]  The only reason I mentioned that is we compiled it.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.941]  Uh, to President Trump just last week.
[00:48:26.941 --> 00:48:28.661]  I know he read it and received it.
[00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:36.683]  Showing that, on average, our actual listeners to the show, people that watch or listen every week, is over 40 million.
[00:48:36.683 --> 00:48:39.844]  It was 85 million conservatively during election week.
[00:48:39.844 --> 00:48:46.846]  But our new floor, our new basement, is over 40 million viewers and listeners a week.
[00:48:46.846 --> 00:48:50.686]  Um, and that's just on our platforms that we can register and track.
[00:48:50.686 --> 00:48:51.627]  That is seismic.
[00:48:51.627 --> 00:48:52.487]  That is gorgantuan.
[00:48:54.165 --> 00:48:55.506]  And it's because you're spreading the word.
[00:48:55.506 --> 00:48:56.806]  You're sending out the video links.
[00:48:56.806 --> 00:48:58.227]  You're sending out the podcast links.
[00:48:58.227 --> 00:49:01.588]  You're sending out to friends and family the free links to get the free versions of our apps.
[00:49:01.588 --> 00:49:04.089]  The old app, the new app, they're both excellent.
[00:49:04.089 --> 00:49:04.990]  You're taking action.
[00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.030]  You're praying for us.
[00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.231]  You're supporting us.
[00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:08.231]  You're buying the products.
[00:49:08.231 --> 00:49:11.192]  It's a 360 win because we're then fighting for you.
[00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:13.773]  We're fighting for ourselves as well.
[00:49:13.773 --> 00:49:14.594]  It's all symbiotic.
[00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:17.127]  A 360 win.
[00:49:17.127 --> 00:49:19.448]  And so we couldn't do any of this without you.
[00:49:19.448 --> 00:49:22.230]  So I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:32.977]  And obviously now, you see us attacked by CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, CBS News, I mean Broadcast News, saying Alex Jones is fake.
[00:49:32.977 --> 00:49:36.379]  Alex Jones, then they say things we didn't say, or things out of context.
[00:49:36.379 --> 00:49:38.940]  Well that's okay.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.161]  Because we're big.
[00:49:40.161 --> 00:49:44.524]  And people can come hear what we actually said, not what they twisted and said we said.
[00:49:45.728 --> 00:49:53.254]  They were saying that it was a 15 point lead for Italy to stay in the Euro, and that it was going to be a big victory.
[00:49:53.254 --> 00:49:55.676]  Because all the polls showed 15 points or more.
[00:49:55.676 --> 00:49:58.278]  They lost by almost 15 points.
[00:49:58.278 --> 00:50:04.303]  That means that they were skewing the polls by close to 30%.
[00:50:04.303 --> 00:50:05.804]  It's the same tactic everywhere, folks.
[00:50:07.552 --> 00:50:12.313]  I said last week, I believe Italy will say no on total EU takeover.
[00:50:12.313 --> 00:50:14.233]  It's the beginning of them pulling out.
[00:50:14.233 --> 00:50:16.514]  Just like I said, I believe Brexit will pass.
[00:50:16.514 --> 00:50:21.575]  Just like I said, I believe Donald Trump will be elected, because I know the sentiment on the street.
[00:50:21.575 --> 00:50:26.455]  Now let's go to this report.
[00:50:26.455 --> 00:50:28.376]  The Trump effect, I'm going to upload this.
[00:50:28.376 --> 00:50:30.816]  This is a shorter version of a longer one we put out last week.
[00:50:30.816 --> 00:50:32.797]  It needs to go viral, but here it is premiered.
[00:50:32.797 --> 00:50:34.857]  The Trump effect, extremely powerful.
[00:50:37.286 --> 00:50:56.659]  We're not going to let them just take our companies out, fire everybody.
[00:50:56.659 --> 00:50:59.280]  These are people with Carrier for many, many years.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.402]  We're not going to let it happen.
[00:51:01.402 --> 00:51:02.883]  He's going to bring all these jobs back.
[00:51:03.837 --> 00:51:05.238]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[00:51:05.238 --> 00:51:06.498]  What are you going to do?
[00:51:06.498 --> 00:51:12.661]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[00:51:12.661 --> 00:51:13.741]  I tell you that.
[00:51:13.741 --> 00:51:17.803]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[00:51:17.803 --> 00:51:20.504]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:51:20.504 --> 00:51:25.906]  I mean, if he can come here and save these 1,400 jobs here tomorrow, I'll gladly vote for him again.
[00:51:25.906 --> 00:51:27.247]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:51:28.357 --> 00:51:29.838]  Late tonight, CNBC broke news.
[00:51:29.838 --> 00:51:34.700]  Trump is heading to Indianapolis this Thursday to announce a deal that would apparently save 1,000 jobs.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:43.243]  Carrier confirming that report, tweeting out late tonight, we are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump and, this is key, VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy.
[00:51:43.243 --> 00:51:44.123]  More details soon.
[00:51:44.123 --> 00:51:45.804]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:50.826]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[00:51:50.826 --> 00:51:55.250]  And more importantly, I heard Mike saying about what happened today in Indiana.
[00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.812]  We're going to do that all over the country.
[00:51:56.812 --> 00:52:00.295]  We're going to do it all over.
[00:52:00.295 --> 00:52:01.236]  Carrier, thank you Carrier.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:08.804]  Ford just announced they're doubling down, they're going to build much more in Mexico.
[00:52:08.804 --> 00:52:11.887]  We can't allow it to happen anymore.
[00:52:11.887 --> 00:52:15.130]  We're not going to allow it to happen anymore.
[00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.473]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:52:17.473 --> 00:52:22.998]  President-elect Donald Trump taking credit for keeping a Ford auto plant here in the United States.
[00:52:22.998 --> 00:52:27.963]  He hit the motor company hard on the campaign trail, criticizing Ford for shipping jobs to Mexico.
[00:52:28.303 --> 00:52:40.487]  Now, Ford Chairman Bill Ford is extending an olive branch, calling Trump this week to let him know that the automaker is shelving a plan to move production of one of its vehicles from Kentucky to Mexico.
[00:52:40.487 --> 00:52:45.069]  It used to be the cars were made in Flint, right?
[00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:48.190]  And you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
[00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:54.832]  Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint, Michigan.
[00:52:54.832 --> 00:52:56.613]  You know that, right?
[00:52:56.613 --> 00:52:57.393]  What a difference.
[00:53:00.674 --> 00:53:05.198]  He just says, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[00:53:05.198 --> 00:53:07.560]  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:10.623]  Will the iPhone labels soon say made in America?
[00:53:10.623 --> 00:53:17.029]  Well, according to one report, opportunities to move production over to the states from China are actually being explored.
[00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:27.198]  If you see the new Trump administration come in and actually overhaul the corporate tax code, do things like spur infrastructure investment in the states, could that make this more feasible?
[00:53:27.478 --> 00:53:32.480]  And maybe they start by building an assembly plant and just shipping parts here.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.682]  That could lend to some of the manufacturing coming over here.
[00:53:35.682 --> 00:53:43.706]  And if Apple can jumpstart some of that and get some of this going, sure, I think it would be very reasonable for other companies to say, we like to say made in the U.S.
[00:53:43.706 --> 00:53:44.066]  as well.
[00:53:47.165 --> 00:53:48.785]  I have my Trump hedge on.
[00:53:48.785 --> 00:53:53.867]  In the event Donald wins, I have no doubt in my mind the market tanks.
[00:53:53.867 --> 00:54:00.308]  One analyst said markets were reacting like the four horsemen of the apocalypse just rode out of Trump Tower.
[00:54:00.308 --> 00:54:04.049]  What do you make of what we saw last night and really now what we're seeing today?
[00:54:04.049 --> 00:54:07.770]  A huge market rally after Trump is elected president.
[00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:12.012]  The stock market has rallied, reaching new heights at each close.
[00:54:12.012 --> 00:54:16.814]  By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 255 points.
[00:54:16.814 --> 00:54:21.376]  The Mexican peso plunged more than 13% against the dollar in chaotic trading.
[00:54:21.376 --> 00:54:24.878]  Trump's proposed policies are considered deeply negative for the country.
[00:54:25.498 --> 00:54:26.898]  We're going to win with strength.
[00:54:26.898 --> 00:54:28.499]  We're going to win with health.
[00:54:28.499 --> 00:54:30.400]  We're going to win at so many levels.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.140]  We're going to win, win, win.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.041]  You're going to get so tired of winning.
[00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:38.342]  You're going to say, Mr. President, please, we don't want to win anymore.
[00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:39.022]  It's too much.
[00:54:39.022 --> 00:54:40.743]  And I'm going to say, I'm sorry.
[00:54:40.743 --> 00:54:45.484]  We're going to keep winning because we're going to make America great again.
[00:54:45.484 --> 00:54:46.424]  I love you.
[00:54:46.424 --> 00:54:48.125]  Thank you.
[00:54:48.125 --> 00:54:51.846]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:54:51.846 --> 00:54:52.426]  Americanism, not globalism.
[00:54:55.268 --> 00:54:59.412]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:54:59.412 --> 00:55:01.594]  And look at DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:55:01.594 --> 00:55:07.779]  CNBC and other publications linked up on the site.
[00:55:07.779 --> 00:55:09.281]  Mark it up 50 points.
[00:55:09.281 --> 00:55:12.544]  Hits all time high today.
[00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:22.743]  Now, that's kind of scary because the stock market is overvalued and things, but that's the exuberance, because the world knows now that we're in a pro-growth system.
[00:55:22.743 --> 00:55:32.506]  Under globalism, it is a negative growth or zero growth system, and only selected combines, this is on record, are allowed to operate.
[00:55:32.506 --> 00:55:34.106]  Everybody else has to shrink.
[00:55:34.106 --> 00:55:35.067]  This is announcing.
[00:55:35.067 --> 00:55:39.588]  That's why smaller Wall Street firms, medium size, and even big independent ones,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:52.111]  Didn't really support Trump, but now they are because they realize that this is going to help the average entrepreneur, the average startup company.
[00:55:52.111 --> 00:56:00.960]  I love how they spin it though, because stocks surged around the world on Italy, not going under total EU control.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.901]  Look how they spun it at CNBC.
[00:56:04.534 --> 00:56:09.556]  Stocks shrug off Italian referendum as energy leads, Dow jumps to record high.
[00:56:09.556 --> 00:56:19.521]  But I've got a stack of articles here admitting that it's positive because the Euro is seen pushing austerity and higher taxes and more regulation.
[00:56:19.521 --> 00:56:29.646]  They massively increased Greece's taxes the last four years and they defaulted two more times and everything fell apart, which lets the globalists come in and buy it up to pennies on the dollar.
[00:56:29.646 --> 00:56:31.327]  They want an implosion economy.
[00:56:32.677 --> 00:56:35.798]  But you hear, oh, Italy's not going to raise taxes, oh, the U.S.
[00:56:35.798 --> 00:56:36.998]  is going to cut taxes.
[00:56:36.998 --> 00:56:37.479]  Boom!
[00:56:37.479 --> 00:56:39.299]  What happens?
[00:56:39.299 --> 00:56:40.139]  It races up.
[00:56:40.139 --> 00:56:50.643]  And if Trump just holds taxes the same, excuse me, cuts taxes, but holds spending to the same, we will bring in more tax receipts and pay down the debt.
[00:56:50.643 --> 00:56:57.065]  The word is, though, Trump's got a hatchet ready, and it's getting ready to kill a bunch of agencies and a bunch of sub-agencies.
[00:56:57.065 --> 00:56:59.326]  And I'm sorry to folks that work for those agencies.
[00:57:00.578 --> 00:57:02.199]  You've been out of control in many cases.
[00:57:02.199 --> 00:57:03.319]  The government's too big.
[00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:08.882]  The whole thing's gonna die if we don't do this.
[00:57:08.882 --> 00:57:09.022]  U.S.
[00:57:09.022 --> 00:57:15.745]  equities kicked off the week trading higher on Monday, unfazed by a key vote in Italy, which led Prime Minister resignation.
[00:57:15.745 --> 00:57:18.626]  It's a celebration of that!
[00:57:18.626 --> 00:57:22.008]  Just like Trump's a celebration of that!
[00:57:22.008 --> 00:57:23.969]  But again, I have the video here.
[00:57:23.969 --> 00:57:25.869]  CNN correspondent.
[00:57:25.869 --> 00:57:26.670]  Italy, no vote.
[00:57:27.862 --> 00:57:29.542]  Slaughtered the opposition.
[00:57:29.542 --> 00:57:34.724]  The polls were tipped about 15 towards the globalist agenda, leaving the pundits shocked.
[00:57:34.724 --> 00:57:37.344]  When I come back in the next segment, I'm going to play that clip.
[00:57:37.344 --> 00:57:38.865]  And then Gavin McInnes is joining us.
[00:57:38.865 --> 00:57:43.086]  But, oh my gosh, the polls showed she was going to win by 15 points.
[00:57:43.086 --> 00:57:43.686]  She lost.
[00:57:43.686 --> 00:57:45.186]  The polls showed he was going to.
[00:57:45.186 --> 00:57:49.287]  If they add more than 15, it gets a little suspicious.
[00:57:50.623 --> 00:57:52.084]  So they kind of leave it at that as their max.
[00:57:52.084 --> 00:57:53.244]  But CNN's gone higher.
[00:57:53.244 --> 00:58:00.127]  They've added 48% before to their phone poll to Hillary to have her winning by 68%.
[00:58:00.127 --> 00:58:03.429]  Take 48 out of that and what's left.
[00:58:03.429 --> 00:58:04.849]  Really means she's winning by 20-something.
[00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:05.830]  No, she's losing.
[00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:07.470]  She's at 20, he's at 60.
[00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:10.412]  They invert reality.
[00:58:10.412 --> 00:58:11.132]  So there you go.
[00:58:11.132 --> 00:58:14.273]  Italy votes against EU takeover as globalism implodes.
[00:58:14.273 --> 00:58:14.894]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:16.078 --> 00:58:17.139]  Send that video out to folks.
[00:58:17.139 --> 00:58:17.960]  It's important.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.961]  Just because you know this, your neighbors don't.
[00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:21.102]  Breaking!
[00:58:21.102 --> 00:58:25.325]  Italy's Prime Minister says he will resign following referendum.
[00:58:25.325 --> 00:58:26.747]  Dow jumps 100 points.
[00:58:26.747 --> 00:58:28.528]  The record highs at the Italian referendum.
[00:58:28.528 --> 00:58:29.809]  Financials lead.
[00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:30.690]  CNBC.
[00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.832]  That's the original article, but they changed it.
[00:58:32.832 --> 00:58:35.454]  Yeah, it's the same guy.
[00:58:35.454 --> 00:58:35.834]  Look at this!
[00:58:35.834 --> 00:58:36.514]  Look at this!
[00:58:36.514 --> 00:58:36.875]  Look at this!
[00:58:36.875 --> 00:58:44.201]  When we come back, they changed it to be more pessimistic because it wasn't anti... It wasn't... It was too reality-based.
[00:58:44.201 --> 00:58:45.662]  It had to be anti-nationalist.
[00:58:47.674 --> 00:58:50.095]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:50.095 --> 00:58:56.838]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:59:46.574 --> 00:59:52.076]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:59:52.076 --> 00:59:54.737]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.585 --> 01:00:04.067]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:09.551]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:00:09.551 --> 01:00:15.615]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:18.557]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.557 --> 01:00:22.880]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.382]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[01:00:25.382 --> 01:00:26.643]  I found the judge is never blind.
[01:00:27.608 --> 01:00:32.431]  Let me tell you, I've experienced Providence big time.
[01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:35.413]  I've seen it.
[01:00:35.413 --> 01:00:38.475]  Yeah, they took my saddle in Houston.
[01:00:38.475 --> 01:00:41.497]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:00:41.497 --> 01:00:45.919]  Lost my wife and girlfriend somewhere along the way, but it just made me stronger.
[01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:51.042]  Up from San Antone!
[01:00:56.371 --> 01:01:03.093]  Everything that I got.
[01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:12.715]  Nobody's gotta dime.
[01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:16.736]  That's poetry because no matter how much money you have, you really don't have anything.
[01:01:16.736 --> 01:01:18.736]  What matters is what you stand for.
[01:01:18.736 --> 01:01:20.897]  What you build and what you pass on.
[01:01:24.532 --> 01:01:29.113]  All right, the wonderful South Texan, George Strait, bringing us in.
[01:01:29.113 --> 01:01:30.693]  Let's get into some really serious news now.
[01:01:30.693 --> 01:01:35.334]  A lot of times I'll be here looking at the stacks of news going over and I'll see a news story.
[01:01:35.334 --> 01:01:41.215]  I'd clicked on Drudge hours ago and read the CNBC article.
[01:01:41.215 --> 01:01:42.876]  And I was thinking, man, that's a different headline.
[01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:43.856]  I've got to look in my stack.
[01:01:43.856 --> 01:01:44.936]  I think they changed it.
[01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:46.016]  And sure enough, they did.
[01:01:46.016 --> 01:01:47.717]  I can show TV viewers this.
[01:01:47.717 --> 01:01:49.097]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[01:01:50.546 --> 01:01:54.308]  So, you go to DrudgeReport.com to find the article, and you click on it.
[01:01:54.308 --> 01:01:59.231]  Stocks shrug off Italian referendum as energy leads.
[01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:02.673]  Dow jumps to record high.
[01:02:02.673 --> 01:02:05.695]  And I went, wait a minute.
[01:02:05.695 --> 01:02:16.662]  Their actual headline earlier was the fact that stocks had jumped 100 points to record highs after Italian referendum.
[01:02:18.117 --> 01:02:19.798]  Financials lead, U.S.
[01:02:19.798 --> 01:02:26.361]  equities unfazed by key Italian vote.
[01:02:26.361 --> 01:02:33.484]  And then later, it gets changed to stock shrug off Italian referendum as energy leans down, jumps to record high.
[01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:37.846]  Now, it was Matt, one of the producers, said, oh Alex, look at the sidebar.
[01:02:37.846 --> 01:02:39.447]  We'll put that on screen for TV viewers.
[01:02:39.447 --> 01:02:40.407]  It's worse than that.
[01:02:40.407 --> 01:02:41.648]  Every headline they can,
[01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:45.116]  of their most popular is attacking Trump.
[01:02:45.116 --> 01:02:49.079]  Amazon just revealed a new plan for revolutionizing how people buy groceries.
[01:02:49.079 --> 01:02:55.303]  Under that, Trump on collision course with China after insulting Beijing twice in 72 hours.
[01:02:55.303 --> 01:03:01.307]  Well, I mean, they tell Obama, they tell Obama, get off the, you know, back of the plane and scream at him.
[01:03:01.307 --> 01:03:03.508]  I mean, talk about disrespect.
[01:03:03.508 --> 01:03:05.769]  Number three, Trump effect.
[01:03:05.769 --> 01:03:11.293]  That house you got for $16,000, more expensive since he won.
[01:03:15.143 --> 01:03:18.288]  I'm sorry, popping my ear again, Matt?
[01:03:18.288 --> 01:03:19.930]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:20.351]  Oh, thanks.
[01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:21.412]  I'm doing it from a distance here.
[01:03:21.412 --> 01:03:22.394]  My eyes aren't as good as they used to be.
[01:03:22.394 --> 01:03:24.617]  Were you on air just now?
[01:03:24.617 --> 01:03:25.639]  I got a rule.
[01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:28.082]  I really want you guys to be on air, even when you're correcting me.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:37.804]  Because I'm teleprompter free, and that's fine, and nobody's telling me what to do, but you guys are in there when I read something wrong from across the room, so just, it's okay.
[01:03:37.804 --> 01:03:39.825]  Now, let's put it back on screen.
[01:03:39.825 --> 01:03:50.850]  So, I noticed this morning when I was looking for videos for the show on CNBC, it was actually, I'll scroll down here for you guys, on screen.
[01:03:53.431 --> 01:04:02.780]  What you were talking about, stocks shrug off, Italian referendum is energy leads, the changed headline is number five down there on the bottom right hand side of the screen.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:08.065]  And like you said, all of these headlines right here, they're taking a lot of the successes of the Trump
[01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.968]  Yeah, they're spinning it against him.
[01:04:11.968 --> 01:04:17.812]  He says just three stocks are responsible for almost half of the Dow's huge one-month rally.
[01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.293]  There's another one, Trump Effect.
[01:04:19.293 --> 01:04:23.216]  That house you want got $16,000 more expensive since he won.
[01:04:23.216 --> 01:04:25.337]  Well, I thought people want housing prices to go up.
[01:04:25.337 --> 01:04:28.960]  Trump on collision course with China after insulting Beijing.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.341]  It's all attack pieces.
[01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:34.604]  People ask, why are we all these pro-Trump stories or just stories about Trump?
[01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.906]  Because it's about the global revolution against the new world order, Matt.
[01:04:39.352 --> 01:04:44.076]  Yeah, you know, I think this is just a sign of things to come.
[01:04:44.076 --> 01:04:49.300]  I think that Trump is going to be kind of at war with the media here for the foreseeable future.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.001]  I totally agree.
[01:04:50.001 --> 01:04:51.742]  If you thought it was bad before, get ready.
[01:04:51.742 --> 01:04:57.206]  Gavin McInnes, the comedian, the media mogul, the funny guy, is coming up straight ahead.
[01:04:57.206 --> 01:04:57.627]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:11.255]  Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice just slapped Colorado's largest Sheriff's Department last month with a $10,000 fine and ordered them to take steps to correct their discriminatory hiring practices.
[01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:13.597]  The illegal act the Sheriff's Department committed, you ask?
[01:05:13.597 --> 01:05:14.839]  Well, they hired only U.S.
[01:05:14.839 --> 01:05:15.219]  citizens.
[01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:19.924]  Now, in a summary of the settlement on the DOJ's website, they said that insisting on U.S.
[01:05:19.924 --> 01:05:27.273]  citizenship violates an anti-discrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that forbids employers from hiring only U.S.
[01:05:27.273 --> 01:05:29.635]  citizens except in cases where it's mandated by law.
[01:05:30.316 --> 01:05:35.458]  The Denver Sheriff's Department maintains that it's committed to treating all people fairly with dignity and respect.
[01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:39.380]  They're, of course, cleaning up their practices now, and they vowed not to do it again.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:45.102]  More than 40 states have rules in place keeping law enforcement agencies from hiring non-citizens.
[01:05:45.102 --> 01:05:55.987]  Only Colorado, Louisiana, Maine, and Vermont, as well as West Virginia, have no such statewide restriction, which means that Colorado is a target for the DOJ if they continue to hire only U.S.
[01:05:55.987 --> 01:05:56.687]  citizens.
[01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:59.028]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:59.804 --> 01:06:03.006]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:03.006 --> 01:06:07.089]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:09.751]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:12.573]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:06:12.573 --> 01:06:17.777]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:06:18.357 --> 01:06:24.522]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:25.983]  God was in school.
[01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.865]  Morality had a future.
[01:06:27.865 --> 01:06:30.787]  And then the beef was for supper.
[01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:33.369]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:06:33.749 --> 01:06:34.910]  We're the solution.
[01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:35.851]  Americans.
[01:06:35.851 --> 01:06:37.412]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:06:37.412 --> 01:06:42.816]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:42.816 --> 01:06:44.537]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:46.038]  DVDs now available.
[01:06:46.038 --> 01:06:49.961]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:49.961 --> 01:06:52.803]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[01:06:52.803 --> 01:06:55.585]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:06:55.585 --> 01:06:58.247]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.108]  Let's fix it.
[01:06:59.708 --> 01:07:07.976]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:07:07.976 --> 01:07:09.197]  A 360 win.
[01:07:09.197 --> 01:07:15.763]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:07:15.763 --> 01:07:23.290]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:28.754]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:34.859]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:34.859 --> 01:07:42.645]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:42.645 --> 01:07:49.870]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:50.671]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:07:50.811 --> 01:07:53.252]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:53.252 --> 01:07:55.413]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:55.413 --> 01:08:03.397]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:03.397 --> 01:08:11.141]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:34.562 --> 01:08:40.364]  Well, joining us about 45 after or so is Gavin McGinnis, who is just hilarious.
[01:08:40.364 --> 01:08:52.128]  He's a comedian, he's in major movies, he founded Vice, which then got sold off to HBO, and he is somebody exposing this incredible insanity of social justice warriors.
[01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:58.110]  Now, since he was on a few weeks ago, right after the election, I guess almost a month ago now, he was on about two days after
[01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:11.959]  It's getting so crazy, it's like some form of performance art, where a woman shows up at a university dressed like Trump, so everyone starts screaming like body snatchers that have discovered you're a human.
[01:09:11.959 --> 01:09:19.604]  Or, you know, you see that a university finds out that a professor met with Trump, so the students all get together and say, fire them!
[01:09:19.604 --> 01:09:24.087]  They're auditioning to work in some Maoist youth camp.
[01:09:24.087 --> 01:09:29.251]  And then, the level of anti-white stuff going on.
[01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:37.102]  That you see in the news every day with a straight face, just saying inherently, white people are bad.
[01:09:37.102 --> 01:09:41.925]  It is the purest racism the world's ever seen, but it's run by the elites.
[01:09:41.925 --> 01:09:46.089]  And I wanted to ask Gavin, who was very, very happy when we had him on the day after the election.
[01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:47.910]  In fact, he said he hadn't slept.
[01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.712]  He had a beer in hand.
[01:09:49.712 --> 01:09:51.473]  Can't blame him.
[01:09:51.473 --> 01:09:53.114]  And he was saying, look, celebrate.
[01:09:53.114 --> 01:09:54.475]  And I am celebrating.
[01:09:54.475 --> 01:09:55.316]  Great things are happening.
[01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:58.659]  But the media's only intensified what they were doing.
[01:09:59.534 --> 01:10:01.697]  They're only getting more shrill.
[01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:09.488]  They were caught lying about polls, being run by the White House and Hillary, caught basically demonizing the American people.
[01:10:09.488 --> 01:10:10.489]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:10:10.489 --> 01:10:12.712]  They want to keep us desperate and sad and alone.
[01:10:12.712 --> 01:10:14.535]  I mean, this is really villainous stuff.
[01:10:15.882 --> 01:10:18.383]  This is organized crime at the top.
[01:10:18.383 --> 01:10:24.646]  So how do you reach through to their minions, who are useful idiots, and are basically, in my view, in a cult?
[01:10:24.646 --> 01:10:34.671]  They've been brainwashed into this victimization cult, where you don't get a better job, or a better house, or write a better book, or have better friends, or even go help people as a missionary.
[01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:39.194]  No, you just sit around bitching all day with your worthless college degree.
[01:10:39.194 --> 01:10:40.975]  So I want to ask Gavin McInnes, who's a smart guy,
[01:10:41.815 --> 01:10:47.179]  Where he sees this going, or if he agrees with me, that they're only intensifying the insanity.
[01:10:47.179 --> 01:10:49.481]  They get caught being the fake news.
[01:10:49.481 --> 01:10:58.247]  They now list thousands of sites, in some cases from unknown sources that the Washington Post runs with, to say that we're fake.
[01:10:58.247 --> 01:11:01.650]  Google starts delisting InfoWars.com.
[01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:07.995]  They're having CNN, MSNBC attack pieces every day against us, misrepresenting what we've said, what we've done.
[01:11:09.309 --> 01:11:17.171]  Is this a smart tactic, or is the definition of mental illness doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results?
[01:11:17.171 --> 01:11:22.333]  And if this is a miscalculation by them, which I think clearly it is, where does it go next?
[01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:25.634]  I mean, we've clearly, Gavin, seen the death of the mainstream media.
[01:11:25.634 --> 01:11:34.816]  Now Obama tells Rolling Stone, we're going to have state-run media, and the State Department's going to run domestic info wars.
[01:11:34.816 --> 01:11:36.877]  Well, sorry, we're 20 years ahead of them.
[01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:37.977]  Gavin, what do you think's happening?
[01:11:38.905 --> 01:11:40.066]  I mean, it is scary.
[01:11:40.066 --> 01:11:46.034]  If I'm in a good mood, if it's before lunch, I laugh at them and watch them desperately try to catch up to reality.
[01:11:46.034 --> 01:11:57.448]  If I'm in a bad mood, I get a little nervous because I look at the canary in the coal mine in Britain and Canada with the BBC and the CBC and you see that the state-run media is effective.
[01:11:57.848 --> 01:12:06.514]  I mean, you talk to a Canadian citizen today and they think Justin Trudeau, their Zoolander Prime Minister, is doing a great job and is very intelligent.
[01:12:06.514 --> 01:12:14.279]  And you talk to a lot of Brits, not the majority, but you talk to a lot of Brits and they go, oh, Brexit was a catastrophe, we are a racist country.
[01:12:14.279 --> 01:12:22.344]  And you realize, wow, this propaganda really does chip away at someone's ability to rationally think for themselves.
[01:12:22.344 --> 01:12:27.308]  But the beauty of the American phenomenon right now, as Paul Joseph Watson keeps pointing out,
[01:12:27.888 --> 01:12:29.850]  Our numbers have gone through the roof.
[01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:32.132]  We won the election.
[01:12:32.132 --> 01:12:34.415]  We are the ones who had the right answers.
[01:12:34.415 --> 01:12:41.982]  And I think the left, after all these lies, the liberals who are watching it went, eh, you guys have been wrong on a lot of stuff.
[01:12:41.982 --> 01:12:45.466]  I'm going to look up and see if Trump actually said that.
[01:12:45.466 --> 01:12:49.490]  And once you start, once you open that Pandora's box, there's no coming back.
[01:12:50.603 --> 01:12:51.483]  It is a paradox.
[01:12:51.483 --> 01:12:54.204]  I mean, I think Trump is basically only delivering.
[01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.525]  I meant to get into it last hour, but I guess here's a good place to raise it.
[01:12:56.525 --> 01:12:58.206]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:12:58.206 --> 01:13:05.648]  Even the Washington Post came out last week and said, you know, Infowars and Breitbart will be Trump's biggest problem because if he doesn't 100% deliver, they're going to turn on him.
[01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:10.090]  They're salivating that the new populist movement is going to turn on Trump.
[01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:10.990]  No, we're not.
[01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:12.311]  We don't expect him to be perfect.
[01:13:13.071 --> 01:13:21.935]  But at the same time, we need to keep his feet to the fire and give him support so that we're his base, so that this avalanche of awakening only continues.
[01:13:21.935 --> 01:13:23.596]  But this whole Soros line that...
[01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:26.300]  Trump has betrayed us.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:32.962]  It kind of fits into the whole social justice warrior mentality that we can't ever win, we can't ever actually have a success.
[01:13:32.962 --> 01:13:34.623]  He's already brought Carrier back.
[01:13:34.623 --> 01:13:36.023]  Ford's already coming back.
[01:13:36.023 --> 01:13:38.264]  Apple says, okay, we're looking at coming back.
[01:13:38.264 --> 01:13:39.665]  The stock market's exploding.
[01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.026]  He's standing up to the Communist Chinese and their arrogance.
[01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:43.666]  I mean, all I'm seeing is him deliver.
[01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:45.927]  Is he hiring a bunch of former insiders?
[01:13:45.927 --> 01:13:48.128]  Well, who do you think knows how to run the frickin' ship?
[01:13:48.128 --> 01:13:52.310]  If I'd bought a submarine, I'd hire a submarine captain that had run the damn thing before.
[01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:55.192]  Well, that guy wants work for this bad government.
[01:13:55.192 --> 01:13:57.994]  All I care about is he does what I tell him to do.
[01:13:57.994 --> 01:14:01.457]  Now, we'll see if he goes sideways, but your take on that?
[01:14:01.457 --> 01:14:06.641]  Well, aren't they conceding, by the way, that Infowars and Breitbart are incredibly powerful?
[01:14:06.641 --> 01:14:09.023]  They accidentally do this all the time.
[01:14:09.023 --> 01:14:12.766]  They go out on an attack, and they end up giving you all this credibility.
[01:14:12.766 --> 01:14:17.349]  And I remember you said once, you said, if Trump betrays us, we're going to drag him out of the White House by his heels.
[01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:24.832]  MSNBC, CNN, all these other media sources, they thought they had the power to do that.
[01:14:24.832 --> 01:14:30.134]  They thought they had the power to build a wall around the White House and keep Trump out, and they failed.
[01:14:30.134 --> 01:14:32.535]  And now, God, they're such sore losers.
[01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.196]  We're just watching them flail and fail.
[01:14:35.196 --> 01:14:36.597]  I mean, my team is the Mets.
[01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:38.037]  We didn't get into the World Series.
[01:14:38.037 --> 01:14:44.540]  The idea of still bitching about it weeks after that and demanding a recount and demanding that the Cubs
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.442]  You know, watch some of the footage or some of the pitches.
[01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:50.003]  It's just downright embarrassing.
[01:14:50.003 --> 01:14:52.064]  And you're seeing this with the entire left.
[01:14:52.064 --> 01:14:53.805]  Like, look at celebrities.
[01:14:53.805 --> 01:15:00.589]  Captain America running around with his shirt that says, you know, dumb idiotistan or whatever his shirt said.
[01:15:00.589 --> 01:15:02.711]  Just sore losing because...
[01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:04.952]  They've all been in a bubble.
[01:15:04.952 --> 01:15:07.653]  The mainstream media thought they controlled the world.
[01:15:07.653 --> 01:15:10.915]  The celebrities thought people revered them and cared about their opinion.
[01:15:10.915 --> 01:15:12.755]  And they just got a slap in the face.
[01:15:12.755 --> 01:15:14.716]  And you and I get slapped in the face all the time.
[01:15:14.716 --> 01:15:18.598]  So we just go, pshh, and we get mad at ourselves for leaving ourselves open in that slap.
[01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:19.699]  They just go, ahhhh!
[01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:22.080]  What the hell was that?
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.920]  That guy slapped police!
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:34.845]  I saw a woman on the internet recently, this fat Latina woman, and she was saying, I just walked by a Trump table and a man shook his fist at me and the police didn't do anything.
[01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:38.206]  And you go, first of all, could you be more delicate?
[01:15:38.206 --> 01:15:44.209]  And secondly, what kind of Nazi state do you want to live in, where people get arrested for going, oh!
[01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:47.670]  Well, also, I bet she didn't tell the rest of the story.
[01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:49.711]  I bet she shot her mouth off at the Trump person.
[01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:50.851]  Yes.
[01:15:50.851 --> 01:15:52.652]  Well, she claims she just rolled her eyes.
[01:15:52.652 --> 01:15:56.876]  But yeah, she started a fight and he contained himself and that's the best they can do.
[01:15:56.876 --> 01:16:00.560]  And then they just start purporting all these fake hate crimes.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.162]  Have you ever seen more badly drawn swastikas in your life?
[01:16:03.162 --> 01:16:07.326]  Oh, they're always like backwards and look like a three-year-old lobotomy patient did it.
[01:16:07.326 --> 01:16:07.527]  I mean...
[01:16:09.057 --> 01:16:10.619]  Hey, liberals, it's very simple.
[01:16:10.619 --> 01:16:15.784]  You start with an S, and then you do the other S lying on its back, okay?
[01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:20.248]  You know, it's not two things going down, and you don't just draw right angles until you're done.
[01:16:20.248 --> 01:16:22.030]  That's not how it works.
[01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:24.112]  Oh, and here's the crazy part.
[01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:24.652]  The cops...
[01:16:25.273 --> 01:16:32.375]  Not that the cops are perfect, but the cops in almost every case go and interview who first reports it, and it turns out they get caught and have to admit it.
[01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:43.499]  Almost every black church that's burned, almost every KKK cross, almost every dorm swastika, it turns out to be liberals that just wanted attention.
[01:16:43.499 --> 01:16:47.120]  They have built this narrative on racism and evil white men.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.521]  Anything bad about America is because of that.
[01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:56.354]  Now, the problem with that demand is if you don't have the supply, you have to start conjuring it up.
[01:16:56.354 --> 01:17:01.418]  So they say that Klansmen are galloping through universities on their horses and throwing nooses everywhere.
[01:17:01.418 --> 01:17:04.401]  That isn't happening, so their narrative starts to crumble.
[01:17:04.401 --> 01:17:06.602]  So what do you do to maintain the narrative?
[01:17:06.602 --> 01:17:10.085]  You censor information and stop the truth coming out.
[01:17:10.085 --> 01:17:13.007]  That's what all the commies did and it works great.
[01:17:13.007 --> 01:17:14.609]  And the second thing you have to do is
[01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:16.669]  Make fake hate crimes!
[01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:17.890]  Not enough Klansmen around?
[01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:19.130]  Put on your own hood!
[01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:21.130]  Make sure we don't see your black hands, by the way.
[01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:24.191]  And then go gallop around yourself, going, I'm in the Klan!
[01:17:24.191 --> 01:17:25.331]  I'm running America!
[01:17:25.331 --> 01:17:26.491]  Woo-hoo!
[01:17:26.491 --> 01:17:32.773]  Well, that's my next point, is even when my dad was a kid in East Texas, the Klan were known as the buck-toothed moron idiots.
[01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:34.653]  The most uncool people were in.
[01:17:34.653 --> 01:17:36.153]  But there were some when he was growing up.
[01:17:36.153 --> 01:17:41.114]  Now, it's like, literally, white trash on welfare with one tooth.
[01:17:41.114 --> 01:17:42.955]  Literally, they can hardly talk.
[01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:47.821]  And then they act like it's just this epidemic of KKK running around.
[01:17:47.821 --> 01:17:48.882]  And what are their crimes?
[01:17:48.882 --> 01:17:50.004]  What have they done?
[01:17:50.004 --> 01:17:53.048]  I mean, if we're going to be so scared of a group, I'd like to see their effects.
[01:17:53.048 --> 01:17:56.773]  Coke dealers have a much more dangerous track record.
[01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.696]  Oh, they cause people to go rob folks to get more money.
[01:17:59.196 --> 01:17:59.577]  Exactly.
[01:17:59.577 --> 01:18:05.924]  People who street race, people who have illegal street races, probably have a way higher body count than the Klan.
[01:18:05.924 --> 01:18:09.608]  But for some reason, we're focused on this thing from a hundred years ago.
[01:18:09.608 --> 01:18:14.754]  And by the way, liberals, if you want to play this game, you're going to have a lot more skeletons in your closet.
[01:18:14.754 --> 01:18:16.155]  See, that's the thing they always do, too.
[01:18:16.155 --> 01:18:17.577]  They go, alright, we hate the Klan.
[01:18:17.577 --> 01:18:18.698]  David Duke.
[01:18:18.698 --> 01:18:20.420]  Trump didn't disavow David Duke fast enough.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.040]  All right, we can play that game.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.161]  Let's bring up Robert Byrd.
[01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:25.361]  Let's show Hillary kissing Robert Byrd.
[01:18:25.361 --> 01:18:29.242]  Oh, I want anyone who's ever hurt a trans person to instantly go to jail.
[01:18:29.242 --> 01:18:32.262]  Okay, well you're going to have a lot of blacks and Hispanics in jail.
[01:18:32.262 --> 01:18:36.783]  They keep going for this bad guy, and they keep getting deeper and deeper in the weeds.
[01:18:36.783 --> 01:18:37.704]  So let me ask you this.
[01:18:37.704 --> 01:18:39.204]  What do you think their next level is?
[01:18:39.204 --> 01:18:43.445]  Because we're confident, we're dominating, you're dominating hearts and minds.
[01:18:43.445 --> 01:18:49.266]  We just love freedom, classical libertarians, classical liberals, whatever you want to call us, just pro-freedom people.
[01:18:50.202 --> 01:18:52.504]  But they're saying arrest climate change deniers.
[01:18:52.504 --> 01:18:54.305]  They're saying arrest Alex Jones.
[01:18:54.305 --> 01:18:55.166]  He's calling for violence.
[01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:56.206]  Never done it.
[01:18:56.206 --> 01:18:57.688]  They're now misrepresenting.
[01:18:57.688 --> 01:18:59.729]  They're saying we want a Bureau of Control.
[01:18:59.729 --> 01:19:04.032]  But as you said, we're euphoric, but at the same time, they mean business.
[01:19:04.032 --> 01:19:05.313]  They've been successful before.
[01:19:05.313 --> 01:19:07.495]  What do you think is coming next?
[01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.950]  You're right.
[01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:10.111]  There should be trepidation.
[01:19:10.111 --> 01:19:12.413]  We can't rest on our laurels.
[01:19:12.413 --> 01:19:13.894]  But we won.
[01:19:13.894 --> 01:19:19.337]  And the trouble with previous to November 9th was these social justice warriors would get someone fired.
[01:19:19.337 --> 01:19:22.800]  And by the way, I'm not just talking about a few blue-haired freaks at a college.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.922]  I'm talking about HR at every place you've ever worked.
[01:19:25.922 --> 01:19:28.383]  I'm talking about women in the fire department.
[01:19:28.383 --> 01:19:32.746]  I'm talking about women getting to be able to skip the pull-ups requirement for the Marines.
[01:19:32.746 --> 01:19:34.748]  It's everywhere, this crap.
[01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:45.280]  And the problem with it before was, you go to the very, very, very top, and there'd be Obama saying, we have to make NASA support Muslims' contribution to mathematics.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.862]  And I think the Redskins should change their name.
[01:19:47.862 --> 01:19:50.926]  So he would justify all their erratic behavior.
[01:19:50.926 --> 01:19:53.329]  Now, we have a tough guy.
[01:19:54.429 --> 01:19:58.411]  The bully, the jock from school going, yeah, yeah, we're not doing that.
[01:19:58.411 --> 01:20:02.873]  And so once the top, you know, doesn't agree with them, they lose their foundation.
[01:20:02.873 --> 01:20:09.316]  And by the way, watching all these mainstream media things flounder, trying to attack us and trying to shut us down, their numbers are...
[01:20:09.616 --> 01:20:32.312]  Pathetic their numbers you get Anderson Cooper having numbers like 200,000 people in demo I mean you and I would both consider that a horrible flop we're in the millions and I love it when when Paul Watson puts up his numbers and then Attaches it to a rejection from a mainstream media source because they want our numbers so bad and we got these numbers by being honest which they are not physically capable of
[01:20:32.532 --> 01:20:45.922]  I remember, I got into talk radio when I was 22, on the weekend, it got good ratings, they put me on weeknights, and after about two years, I had 200,000 listeners, if you count out the city, and then surrounding areas.
[01:20:45.922 --> 01:20:52.086]  So the demo came in, they said, this is unbelievable, and they said, over your two hours at night, you're now having 200,000 listeners.
[01:20:52.086 --> 01:20:54.828]  So that was unheard of, it was the top ratings in the city.
[01:20:54.828 --> 01:20:56.490]  Then the politicos came in and tried to shut me down.
[01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:59.331]  But that should have told them something then.
[01:20:59.331 --> 01:21:00.171]  Let's explain that.
[01:21:00.171 --> 01:21:04.893]  Alex Jones at 22 had 200,000 listeners at any one night.
[01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:10.374]  People in New York City, folks, with 18 million people or whatever it is, there are some shows with a million listeners a night.
[01:21:10.374 --> 01:21:11.075]  Imagine that.
[01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:13.075]  There are shows like that all over the country.
[01:21:13.075 --> 01:21:17.917]  Imagine the delusion with Anderson Cooper, 200,000 viewers.
[01:21:17.917 --> 01:21:20.258]  All over the world, maybe a half million.
[01:21:20.258 --> 01:21:23.199]  It's a joke, but they still sit up there.
[01:21:23.199 --> 01:21:23.779]  Do you think
[01:21:24.119 --> 01:21:28.043]  They realize they're a total facade or are they still delusional?
[01:21:28.043 --> 01:21:29.685]  Gavin McInnes is our guest.
[01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:33.269]  That's a great question and I wonder that myself, especially with celebrities.
[01:21:33.269 --> 01:21:38.835]  I look at them in the newsstand going to get their Starbucks and I think, do you know how much I'm laughing at you?
[01:21:38.835 --> 01:21:45.002]  Do you know how much we're laughing at George Clooney with his hand on his head going, Trump's not gonna win.
[01:21:45.202 --> 01:21:50.044]  We're not going to be hatred, there's not going to be divisiveness, that's not what America's about.
[01:21:50.044 --> 01:21:52.285]  Do you know how comical you seem to me now?
[01:21:52.285 --> 01:21:56.627]  And they really are, they're like the monarchy, all these academics.
[01:21:56.627 --> 01:21:59.428]  Trump, you didn't stutter enough.
[01:21:59.428 --> 01:22:03.390]  Trump's not, hold on let me read my notes.
[01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:06.251]  Trump's not going to win, we don't put up with that racism.
[01:22:06.251 --> 01:22:08.472]  I'm bored of having to explain this to you, it's so boring.
[01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:10.794]  He's not going to win.
[01:22:10.794 --> 01:22:14.657]  I'll explain it one more time to you pedants, but it's incredibly simple.
[01:22:14.657 --> 01:22:16.318]  He's not going to win.
[01:22:16.318 --> 01:22:18.219]  And the monarchy's been shut off.
[01:22:18.219 --> 01:22:20.981]  We've all said, you want to charge us this for the salt tax?
[01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:22.042]  Actually, you know what?
[01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:25.765]  We're going to have our own little barter system over here, and we're not going to go through you.
[01:22:25.765 --> 01:22:29.407]  And you see this with YouTube stars, too, and comedy and everything else.
[01:22:29.407 --> 01:22:30.848]  They've just gone, you know what?
[01:22:30.848 --> 01:22:36.673]  You've hogged the infrastructure for so long that we built our own roads, and we don't need you anymore.
[01:22:36.673 --> 01:22:39.515]  And they come back pleading, and telling them no is just
[01:22:39.935 --> 01:22:40.995]  So where do they go next though?
[01:22:40.995 --> 01:22:47.138]  Because this is the perfect storm to have dying dinosaur media, dying corrupt corporate run monopoly government.
[01:22:47.138 --> 01:22:51.159]  Italy, you know, just voted to say no to the EU taking control of their government.
[01:22:51.159 --> 01:22:53.140]  The first step towards getting out.
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:58.762]  Everywhere this is happening and they just, again, they just respond even more cultishly.
[01:22:58.762 --> 01:23:03.063]  If acting like this got them towards total rejection, what does it do then?
[01:23:03.063 --> 01:23:04.124]  Send them into overdrive?
[01:23:05.134 --> 01:23:07.636]  I mean, I've seen this happen to the magazine industry.
[01:23:07.636 --> 01:23:12.138]  The prices were too high for ads.
[01:23:12.138 --> 01:23:14.820]  The information got too easy to get elsewhere.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.620]  I watched it die.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:16.941]  We watched Tower Records die.
[01:23:16.941 --> 01:23:18.362]  We watched Vinyl die.
[01:23:18.362 --> 01:23:20.884]  We're watching mainstream media die.
[01:23:20.884 --> 01:23:23.465]  And it is beautiful.
[01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:27.648]  It's like going to see someone who killed your family in the death penalty.
[01:23:27.648 --> 01:23:31.290]  I'm just watching every electrical volt go through their blood and just going,
[01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:39.716]  I was at Project Veritas' Christmas party, and everyone there had a Nigel Farage grin that was ear-to-ear.
[01:23:39.716 --> 01:23:42.879]  They were all high, naturally.
[01:23:42.879 --> 01:23:44.800]  There was a massive dance floor.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.042]  You've never seen an office party with a dance floor before.
[01:23:47.042 --> 01:23:48.243]  Everyone was dancing.
[01:23:48.243 --> 01:23:53.366]  James O'Keefe was floating about six inches off the ground, just, hey man, how's it going?
[01:23:53.366 --> 01:23:54.968]  Grab a drink, enjoy yourself.
[01:23:54.968 --> 01:23:56.629]  I mean, it is sweet victory.
[01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:57.149]  That's another thing.
[01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:59.351]  You go to liberal parties, you go to liberal parties.
[01:23:59.651 --> 01:24:00.794]  They're super uptight.
[01:24:00.794 --> 01:24:02.077]  They're super scared.
[01:24:02.077 --> 01:24:03.840]  Everybody's in little nerd groups.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.192]  Really what it is, is nerds took over, said they were cool, and then told us we all had to bow down to them.
[01:24:09.926 --> 01:24:10.746]  Yeah.
[01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:13.988]  I like at those parties too when there's a black guy there, because they all mob him.
[01:24:13.988 --> 01:24:17.370]  Because they hate that they don't have enough black friends.
[01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:18.931]  And black people don't like them.
[01:24:18.931 --> 01:24:23.373]  It really is a sad state of affairs, seeing these people try to enjoy themselves.
[01:24:23.373 --> 01:24:29.056]  And I feel like we've been trained with so much austerity that we enjoy the attrition.
[01:24:29.056 --> 01:24:30.177]  We like a good fight.
[01:24:30.177 --> 01:24:33.839]  So we can disagree with you, you can fight, we're happy to debate, you can get in there.
[01:24:33.839 --> 01:24:39.502]  I saw the Young Turks were talking about you crashing their show and they said, the police
[01:24:39.622 --> 01:24:39.862]  That's
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.663]  Where there's literally 300, 400 people or groups crammed in with little studios.
[01:25:03.663 --> 01:25:05.504]  They're in the middle of the hall.
[01:25:05.504 --> 01:25:06.245]  I'm walking by.
[01:25:06.245 --> 01:25:07.986]  Their producers are waving me over.
[01:25:07.986 --> 01:25:09.727]  I'm like at a Chinese buffet.
[01:25:09.727 --> 01:25:11.528]  I could eat and vomit for the rest of my life.
[01:25:11.528 --> 01:25:12.409]  More media.
[01:25:12.409 --> 01:25:13.990]  I go to like six, seven interviews.
[01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:15.110]  I'm telling Roger Stone, let's go.
[01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.591]  He goes, no, let's do 10 more down here.
[01:25:16.591 --> 01:25:17.652]  I see him.
[01:25:17.652 --> 01:25:18.933]  I go, let me jump up here and say hi.
[01:25:19.753 --> 01:25:24.175]  So I jump up and say hi, because they'd already invited me on, and they frickin' flip out.
[01:25:24.175 --> 01:25:30.078]  But then, as soon as they see Roger Stone 20 feet away, they go, he's trying to take over.
[01:25:30.078 --> 01:25:33.120]  And if you look at him, they go, you're not coming on Roger Stone, Roger Stones.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.961]  I wouldn't frickin' come on your show.
[01:25:34.961 --> 01:25:36.282]  I mean, the point is, it's like these...
[01:25:37.162 --> 01:25:45.610]  It's like the ugly girl in school, I'm not trying to be mean, but I've noticed that, what is it with ugly girls when I was in high school that would always tell their ex-boyfriend that you hit on them when you didn't?
[01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:47.552]  It's like some drama.
[01:25:47.552 --> 01:25:59.785]  So Chink, or whatever his name is, is like up there like Jabba the Hutt, and then Kasparian runs over and screams, get out of here you fat effer, when she's the one that basically says, arrest fat shamers.
[01:26:00.478 --> 01:26:01.779]  Yeah, and they spat on you, too.
[01:26:01.779 --> 01:26:05.560]  They were spitting on you, complaining that you were assaulting them.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.562]  It really is pathetic, and it really is fun to watch them.
[01:26:08.562 --> 01:26:15.485]  In fact, we call it young Turks porn, watching that election footage of them slowly collapse when they realize.
[01:26:15.485 --> 01:26:19.166]  And there's a great part, too, where he goes, everybody was supporting her!
[01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:20.027]  Everybody!
[01:26:20.027 --> 01:26:23.628]  The media, Jay-Z, Beyonce, and he goes, what happened?
[01:26:23.628 --> 01:26:27.430]  And you go, clearly your idea of everybody is a nobody.
[01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:43.339]  You know, and they get the carrier jobs comp, a thousand jobs, the retort is, well, they're going to lose those jobs soon anyway, and automization is going to be replaced 85% of jobs, and then he takes the call from Taiwan, and they go, he's starting a war with China!
[01:26:43.339 --> 01:26:47.041]  He went to meet the president of Taiwan!
[01:26:47.041 --> 01:26:50.843]  No he didn't, and if we did start a war with China, we would destroy them, by the way.
[01:26:50.843 --> 01:26:53.945]  Pat Buchanan's run the numbers on this very beautifully long ago.
[01:26:54.605 --> 01:26:55.325]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:55.325 --> 01:26:57.846]  I mean, China is teetering on the edge of collapse.
[01:26:57.846 --> 01:27:01.788]  They have something like 7,000 riots a month that they admit.
[01:27:01.788 --> 01:27:06.130]  They have the most corrupt ruling elite living in total opulence while they feed on their people.
[01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:15.855]  And then, did you see a few weeks ago where the Chinese communists were in the news, in the Wall Street Journal, in the New York Times, saying, you better shut down fake news, we own your debt.
[01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:20.837]  We're now being dictated to by this tottering empire of corruption?
[01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:22.777]  Well, that worked with North Korea.
[01:27:22.777 --> 01:27:26.719]  Remember the interview, that movie with James Franco?
[01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:34.782]  Anonymous email that someone assumed came from North Korea made us shut down the theaters and ban the movie.
[01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.162]  It was only available on demand.
[01:27:36.162 --> 01:27:37.523]  That was a couple years ago.
[01:27:37.523 --> 01:27:39.503]  And that was Obama's America.
[01:27:39.503 --> 01:27:40.904]  Capitulation.
[01:27:40.904 --> 01:27:42.604]  No, we're not doing that anymore.
[01:27:42.604 --> 01:27:47.126]  If we got that threat today and it was signed from North Korea, Trump would make sure that
[01:27:47.486 --> 01:27:53.550]  This movie was shown in every theater in the country, and we had armed guards there to make sure everyone was safe.
[01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:57.152]  We need to defend our rights for free speech, because we tried it their way.
[01:27:57.152 --> 01:28:02.236]  We tried it the left's way, and it reeked of Stalinism, and that is more oppression and less freedom.
[01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:06.178]  And by the way, when we have less freedom, they're the ones who get screwed first.
[01:28:06.178 --> 01:28:08.440]  You and I can survive any environment.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.663]  It's the wimps that are going to be crushed when they institute their own beloved fascism.
[01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:17.070]  compoundmedia.com hosts his own daily show.
[01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:18.612]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest.
[01:28:18.612 --> 01:28:21.456]  We're going to come back and I'm going to ask him what he's looking at.
[01:28:21.456 --> 01:28:25.661]  You know, the famous question I ask, what's on your radar?
[01:28:25.661 --> 01:28:26.582]  What are you looking at?
[01:28:26.582 --> 01:28:28.824]  What do you think is most important right now?
[01:28:28.824 --> 01:28:32.889]  Instead of myself here asking the questions, I want to hit a few other tidbits like Kaepernick
[01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:42.314]  Who has this horrible record in the NFL, he's a spoiled rotten brat, he makes hundreds of millions of dollars, and then he's running around saying, you know, I like Cuba because they're not racist.
[01:28:42.314 --> 01:28:45.175]  Does he have any idea how racist the Caribbean is towards black people?
[01:28:45.175 --> 01:28:47.036]  I mean, it's more racist than we are now.
[01:28:47.036 --> 01:28:52.879]  And I'm not bashing the Caribbean nations or Latin America, just the utter ignorance of this jackass that's coming up.
[01:28:52.879 --> 01:28:56.660]  But first, we have a new limited edition t-shirt.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:00.142]  You meet like-minded people, you flaunt it in their face, you wake people up.
[01:29:00.142 --> 01:29:00.982]  Hillary for prison 2017.
[01:29:02.848 --> 01:29:05.310]  On the right arm, InfoWars.com has spread the word.
[01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:06.652]  Meet like-minded people.
[01:29:06.652 --> 01:29:07.572]  Support your broadcast.
[01:29:07.572 --> 01:29:09.734]  But on the back, this is new.
[01:29:09.734 --> 01:29:12.957]  A goblin design I came up with with the graphics folks.
[01:29:12.957 --> 01:29:14.399]  Uh, let's just say Alex Jones inspired.
[01:29:14.399 --> 01:29:17.401]  InfoWars established 1996 on the top.
[01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:21.005]  Deport Soros to the bottom with him as a goblin with a big cross through it.
[01:29:22.284 --> 01:29:25.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great shirt to wear in support of this broadcast.
[01:29:25.805 --> 01:29:30.587]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:29:30.587 --> 01:29:32.408]  No reviews yet, it just came out a few days ago.
[01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:38.050]  But the other shirts had five star reviews and was the dominant t-shirt of this year so far.
[01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:39.751]  This is limited edition.
[01:29:39.751 --> 01:29:41.892]  We need your support now more than ever.
[01:29:41.892 --> 01:29:44.013]  And hell, where do you get bigger bang for your buck?
[01:29:44.013 --> 01:29:45.934]  We are savaging these dirt bags.
[01:29:45.934 --> 01:29:46.434]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.099 --> 01:29:52.105]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.105 --> 01:29:55.711]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.581]  First Brexit, then Trump.
[01:30:01.581 --> 01:30:06.225]  Is Italy next for the West's, quote, populist movement, as The Guardian puts it?
[01:30:06.225 --> 01:30:12.069]  Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after losing a crucial reform referendum.
[01:30:12.069 --> 01:30:23.338]  A global political earthquake is underway where decidedly people are standing up in westernized nations and taking back their countries from rogue globalist, its latest victim, globalist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
[01:30:23.558 --> 01:30:31.025]  Who has announced that he will resign after suffering a humiliating defeat in a referendum, throwing the country and the Eurozone into utter confusion.
[01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:34.068]  Now he says that the experience of my government ends here.
[01:30:34.068 --> 01:30:41.735]  Renzi said in a televised address to The Nation yesterday that the results show his yes camp was well on track to losing the referendum.
[01:30:41.735 --> 01:30:45.378]  Now, as he quits, arguably Hollande and Merkel are next.
[01:30:45.378 --> 01:30:49.362]  This comes after MPs and Senators representing the Five Star Movement
[01:30:49.502 --> 01:30:56.597]  Launched by Beth A. Grillo, decided to get 4 million signatures they needed to take back their country and launch a referendum.
[01:30:56.597 --> 01:30:58.922]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfantWars.com
[01:30:59.813 --> 01:31:06.358]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:31:06.358 --> 01:31:09.600]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:15.164]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:31:15.164 --> 01:31:21.288]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:31:21.288 --> 01:31:24.571]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:31:24.571 --> 01:31:26.032]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:31:26.232 --> 01:31:30.533]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:31:30.533 --> 01:31:33.474]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:31:33.474 --> 01:31:35.135]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:31:35.135 --> 01:31:38.576]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:41.176]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:31:41.176 --> 01:31:42.237]  It's in powder form.
[01:31:42.237 --> 01:31:45.118]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:31:45.118 --> 01:31:46.258]  I take this.
[01:31:46.258 --> 01:31:47.638]  This is the product that I take.
[01:31:47.638 --> 01:31:49.599]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:31:50.439 --> 01:31:52.360]  We fight the global, we fight the new world order.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:59.683]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.683 --> 01:32:04.165]  We have the new product at Infowarslive.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:04.165 --> 01:32:15.090]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:20.294]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:20.294 --> 01:32:22.876]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:32:22.876 --> 01:32:24.598]  It helps detoxify.
[01:32:24.598 --> 01:32:27.480]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:32.244]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:32.244 --> 01:32:38.529]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:38.529 --> 01:32:43.833]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:43.833 --> 01:32:44.594]  I'm taking it now.
[01:32:44.974 --> 01:32:45.775]  We're good to go.
[01:33:16.887 --> 01:33:22.393]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:22.393 --> 01:33:27.098]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:48.988]  A lot of people, and I make this point every time I have other talk show hosts on, say, why do you have other talk show hosts on?
[01:33:48.988 --> 01:33:52.311]  Other talk radio slash TV folks don't do that.
[01:33:52.311 --> 01:33:54.733]  Especially in your same genre.
[01:33:54.733 --> 01:33:59.137]  Because I don't look at demographics, I'm not in a genre, I'm trying to change the world.
[01:33:59.137 --> 01:34:03.541]  CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, every time I've been interviewed by them they say,
[01:34:04.602 --> 01:34:06.886]  Don't you understand what you say is discrediting?
[01:34:06.886 --> 01:34:08.568]  It's not in the mainstream.
[01:34:08.568 --> 01:34:15.177]  I'm not trying to be mainstream where we're bent over a barrel by the Communist Chinese and they tell us what movies we can have.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:20.561]  I don't want to be in the place where our border is totally wide open and you let people with leprosy in.
[01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:23.342]  Might as well at least treat them.
[01:34:23.342 --> 01:34:31.385]  I don't want to be in your mainstream where the word mother and father, they're teaching kindergartners, is bad because somebody else might not have one.
[01:34:31.385 --> 01:34:34.546]  I don't want to live in your basket case, fruitcake land.
[01:34:35.677 --> 01:34:45.404]  Where foreign banks have robbed the country so they've got a rearguard action of just turning people into middle midgets, basket cases, so they never figured out how they were screwed over.
[01:34:45.404 --> 01:34:49.086]  Because that's what this is, is psychological warfare.
[01:34:49.086 --> 01:34:51.368]  I'm not trying to go back either.
[01:34:51.368 --> 01:34:57.452]  The Renaissance, 1776, came out of the Magna Carta and the Gutenberg Press and everything we see today.
[01:34:57.452 --> 01:34:59.313]  I want more of that.
[01:34:59.313 --> 01:35:00.454]  I want to go forward.
[01:35:01.786 --> 01:35:14.172]  When they say, oh, the 1776 Declaration of Independence, that I'm totally independent, that as long as I'm not hurting somebody, no government leader, no religious leader can say I've got to follow their cult?
[01:35:14.172 --> 01:35:18.274]  This is the cutting edge of true liberalism.
[01:35:18.274 --> 01:35:23.557]  But I don't use that term because the modern liberal is, like Ab McInnes said, is like a Stalinistic freak.
[01:35:23.557 --> 01:35:24.017]  And by the way,
[01:35:25.233 --> 01:35:39.302]  When you read the Communist Manifesto, and you read Das Kapital, and you read what they set up as commissars of the Soviet Union over the next 50 years, it is word for word, political correctness comes from Russia.
[01:35:39.302 --> 01:35:45.165]  The stuff they did in Mao's China, they're literally following in here.
[01:35:45.165 --> 01:35:47.567]  So Gavin McInnes is our guest, but get this straight.
[01:35:49.116 --> 01:35:51.278]  I'm trying to shock people with the truth.
[01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:53.741]  I'm trying to shake people out of their catatonic state.
[01:35:53.741 --> 01:35:55.643]  I'm trying to change the world.
[01:35:55.643 --> 01:36:02.911]  And a lot of folks go, well, we're supposed to be patriots that sit out in the woods getting our guns ready for civil war, not ever succeeding.
[01:36:02.911 --> 01:36:05.354]  And if Trump succeeds, it means he sold out.
[01:36:06.454 --> 01:36:09.497]  Liberty in the last 300 years keeps succeeding.
[01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:11.519]  That's what this is all about.
[01:36:11.519 --> 01:36:18.546]  What we're promoting is prosperity and choice and private property and do what you want as long as you don't hurt somebody.
[01:36:18.546 --> 01:36:23.411]  That's really sexy compared to what these people are selling.
[01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:24.912]  They're unlistable.
[01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:30.678]  The lecturing, the word control, NPR is like a Jim Jones brainwashing cult.
[01:36:31.969 --> 01:36:35.532]  No emotion to just soothe you into oblivion.
[01:36:35.532 --> 01:36:36.373]  Evan McGinnis?
[01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:37.574]  Can't stop watching him.
[01:36:37.574 --> 01:36:38.594]  Watch him on the treadmill.
[01:36:38.594 --> 01:36:41.417]  Watch him, you know, listen to him when I'm out jogging or whatever.
[01:36:41.417 --> 01:36:43.018]  If you can call it jogging.
[01:36:43.018 --> 01:36:44.739]  And then my son listens to it as well.
[01:36:44.739 --> 01:36:46.261]  And it's addictive.
[01:36:46.261 --> 01:36:47.221]  Because it's real.
[01:36:47.221 --> 01:36:47.962]  It's unscripted.
[01:36:47.962 --> 01:36:48.843]  I saw a rant you did.
[01:36:49.952 --> 01:36:59.617]  A Thanksgiving rant, if you could repeat that here, I didn't tell you I was going to do this, where you laid out statistics, I'm well aware of them, they're very accurate, where whites are some of the most unupwardly mobile people ever now.
[01:36:59.617 --> 01:37:15.945]  A lot of them are living off family wealth, they're a total joke, but then there's this cosmology that whites are like these brainiac demons, and the average white person I know, quite frankly, is the most liberal, brainwashed, sad excuse for a person you can imagine, with their thumb up, you know what,
[01:37:16.425 --> 01:37:23.188]  Going around moral justice, you know, signaling, virtue signaling to everybody, like a mental patient.
[01:37:23.188 --> 01:37:26.129]  And then I'm hearing these masterminds are doing something.
[01:37:26.129 --> 01:37:28.249]  So it's just crazy.
[01:37:28.249 --> 01:37:29.690]  If you could repeat that, Rand, it'd be great.
[01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:35.072]  But separately, other points you'd like to add in the next six, seven minutes, we have left with Gavin McInnis of Compound Media.
[01:37:35.677 --> 01:37:39.078]  Well, their whole ethos is based on power.
[01:37:39.078 --> 01:37:55.485]  So, we had a coach recently, they were playing rap music in the gym and in the change rooms and he, I don't know if we can swear on your show, but he comes in and he goes, I don't want to hear that music with n-word this and n-word that, but he used the actual expletive, and I hate that kind of music and I don't want to hear it in here.
[01:37:55.485 --> 01:37:58.527]  He gets fired for using that word.
[01:37:58.527 --> 01:38:01.148]  He gets fired for saying, don't use the n-word.
[01:38:01.148 --> 01:38:01.308]  Yeah.
[01:38:03.861 --> 01:38:13.788]  I mean, I heard about in Germany, I heard that if you want to make stickers that have no swastika, like it's a swastika crossed out, you can't make them because you have to make the swastika first to cross it out.
[01:38:13.788 --> 01:38:15.669]  So no, that's illegal.
[01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:18.090]  And so that's the kind of parameters we have.
[01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.732]  That's the guidelines we have to abide by.
[01:38:20.732 --> 01:38:27.397]  But then everyone else, you know, every rap song, every... I had a teacher, a buddy of mine, he teaches troubled kids out in Bushwick in East New York.
[01:38:27.397 --> 01:38:29.218]  He told them he doesn't want them saying that word.
[01:38:29.218 --> 01:38:31.019]  They didn't even know it was a bad word.
[01:38:31.019 --> 01:38:32.040]  To them, it's a word like the.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.081]  Or something.
[01:38:33.081 --> 01:38:35.824]  So they would change it to neighbor and ninja.
[01:38:35.824 --> 01:38:39.568]  Anyway, the reason that we have these different roles is because it's about power.
[01:38:39.568 --> 01:38:42.972]  So we're the only ones that can be racist because we're the ones in power.
[01:38:42.972 --> 01:38:45.695]  And you go, OK, so it's about power and wealth.
[01:38:45.695 --> 01:38:46.216]  Is that it?
[01:38:46.216 --> 01:38:48.658]  We're the exception because we're the powerful and the wealthy.
[01:38:48.658 --> 01:38:49.479]  But we're not.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.423]  We're number 16 down on the chart.
[01:38:53.423 --> 01:39:00.749]  You've got Lebanese Americans, African, American Africans like Kenyans are making more money than whites.
[01:39:00.749 --> 01:39:02.770]  Because they don't have chips on their shoulders.
[01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.653]  I'll tell you, it's super refreshing to actually be around a lot of Africans from Africa.
[01:39:06.653 --> 01:39:07.414]  They're just outgoing.
[01:39:07.414 --> 01:39:08.095]  They got business.
[01:39:08.095 --> 01:39:09.095]  They got things to do.
[01:39:09.095 --> 01:39:10.176]  They want to do things.
[01:39:10.176 --> 01:39:11.678]  They don't have fricking chips on their shoulders.
[01:39:12.378 --> 01:39:15.802]  The only thing I don't like about people from Africa is they're racist.
[01:39:15.802 --> 01:39:16.884]  They hate black people.
[01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:19.847]  And they're like, you cannot go around black people.
[01:39:19.847 --> 01:39:21.089]  They will kill you.
[01:39:21.089 --> 01:39:22.771]  They are dangerous, crazy people.
[01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:28.077]  And you go, I don't like when you talk that way around my fellow African Americans, American African.
[01:39:28.077 --> 01:39:29.199]  I consider it quite rude.
[01:39:29.659 --> 01:39:35.962]  But the whole idea of, you don't know what it's like to get into an elevator and see all these old ladies grab their purse because they think you're going to rob them.
[01:39:35.962 --> 01:39:40.585]  And I go, nor does a Chinese person, nor does a Japanese person.
[01:39:40.585 --> 01:39:51.591]  You understand that we're not at the top anymore and your whole paradigm of powerful people can take endless abuse means you have to go abuse these Lebanese Americans because they're the ones kicking ass and taking it.
[01:39:51.591 --> 01:39:54.092]  You know, in the death of the West, Pat Buchanan said it beautifully.
[01:39:54.092 --> 01:39:57.174]  He said, you know, the West didn't start slavery, it ended it.
[01:39:57.774 --> 01:40:00.536]  And we had a balance sheet of zero after the Civil War.
[01:40:00.536 --> 01:40:02.038]  We're done with capitulation.
[01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:05.480]  We're done with hearing complaints about the past.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.943]  We're not unique anymore when it comes to victimhood.
[01:40:08.943 --> 01:40:09.724]  You had a bad life.
[01:40:09.724 --> 01:40:11.045]  The Irish had a bad life.
[01:40:11.045 --> 01:40:12.346]  Stop whining.
[01:40:12.346 --> 01:40:13.747]  Trump is here now.
[01:40:13.747 --> 01:40:14.968]  Daddy's home.
[01:40:14.968 --> 01:40:16.449]  And you have to do your homework.
[01:40:19.181 --> 01:40:23.163]  Now, speaking of Chinese-Americans, people say, oh, are you anti-Asians?
[01:40:23.163 --> 01:40:24.303]  You don't like the Communist Chinese.
[01:40:24.303 --> 01:40:25.984]  No, they're oppressed by them.
[01:40:25.984 --> 01:40:32.347]  But I was reading, even CNN had the statistics last year that the majority of people coming to the U.S.
[01:40:32.347 --> 01:40:34.788]  now are not even Mexican.
[01:40:34.788 --> 01:40:36.909]  It's Chinese women are now the biggest group.
[01:40:38.021 --> 01:40:41.142]  And they come here, and it's middle class or wealthy Chinese.
[01:40:41.142 --> 01:40:41.322]  Yeah.
[01:40:41.322 --> 01:40:44.043]  Why wouldn't you want $20,000, $30,000 free birth?
[01:40:44.043 --> 01:40:45.623]  Now you've got a kid that's a U.S.
[01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:46.403]  citizen.
[01:40:46.403 --> 01:40:48.504]  Now you've got a way to get all those benefits.
[01:40:48.504 --> 01:40:50.164]  Well, why would rich Chinese want that?
[01:40:50.164 --> 01:40:51.845]  Because that's why they're rich.
[01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:56.306]  Why wouldn't you come here and get a $30,000 free benefit and have your baby for free?
[01:40:56.306 --> 01:40:57.566]  Because we can't be racist.
[01:40:57.566 --> 01:40:59.047]  I mean, you know, you're Asian.
[01:40:59.047 --> 01:40:59.687]  So there it is.
[01:40:59.687 --> 01:41:00.687]  Chinese flock to the U.S.
[01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:02.027]  to give birth to U.S.
[01:41:02.027 --> 01:41:04.148]  citizens, and then we pay for it.
[01:41:04.988 --> 01:41:05.088]  $20,000 to $80,000.
[01:41:05.088 --> 01:41:08.229]  See, I said $30,000 being conservative.
[01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:09.490]  That says $20,000 to $80,000.
[01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:12.290]  So the average is like, you know, $40,000 or more.
[01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:13.491]  Think about this.
[01:41:13.491 --> 01:41:16.072]  This is, I mean, this is suicide.
[01:41:16.072 --> 01:41:16.932]  This is crazy.
[01:41:16.932 --> 01:41:18.833]  I can't go to China and have a free baby.
[01:41:18.833 --> 01:41:20.533]  No, no, you can't.
[01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:23.054]  I think you need $50,000 cash to leave China.
[01:41:23.054 --> 01:41:26.915]  And these women are getting on these planes when they're eight and a half, nine months pregnant.
[01:41:26.915 --> 01:41:32.317]  If anything should stop this stupid anchor baby rule, it's the way the Chinese are abusing it.
[01:41:32.657 --> 01:41:34.078]  But you know what I was thinking about this weekend?
[01:41:34.078 --> 01:41:55.553]  I was putting up Christmas decorations, busting my ass, and I've got three kids, and I get shit from, so I get trouble from far right, alt-righters, they go, oh, you work for a Jew, and you, you race mix, and then you get trouble from the far left, where they go, I feel sorry for your daughter, you're such a sexist, and I'm thinking, in both cases, these outliers, they're not putting up Christmas decorations.
[01:41:56.093 --> 01:42:18.418]  And the beauty of the modern West post-Trump is, I don't want to hear from you unless you're breeding Western children, unless you're putting up Christmas decorations, unless you care, and we can do the Hanukkah too, as long as you are part of the Judeo-Christian equation, you're making babies, and you're here with the rest of us participating, then I want to hear from you.
[01:42:18.418 --> 01:42:19.519]  Your vote matters.
[01:42:19.519 --> 01:42:25.060]  The rest of you on the fringes, alone, single, playing video games, not breeding, not
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.381]  Not being part of the American experience?
[01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:29.362]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:42:29.362 --> 01:42:33.223]  We're done with your whining, and that is both extremes on the political spectrum.
[01:42:33.223 --> 01:42:34.744]  Well, I was about to break that down.
[01:42:34.744 --> 01:42:47.210]  Misery loves company, and I'm sorry, people demographically that are unhappy, most of them are white women, they waited until 45, they didn't have kids, they're totally freaked out, and they totally then double down and submit to the state.
[01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:49.831]  And, like, make the state their husband.
[01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:56.595]  And so if the state's more powerful, they live vicariously through it, even though the state, overall, really isn't even helping them.
[01:42:56.595 --> 01:43:06.962]  And I think that's why they're so upset, is they realize their god, the state, didn't deliver them their next messiah, Hillary Rodham Clinton, you know, stumbling around like a zombie.
[01:43:06.962 --> 01:43:08.743]  And let me ask you this.
[01:43:08.743 --> 01:43:09.663]  I live in Austin, Texas.
[01:43:09.663 --> 01:43:10.424]  It's a blue state.
[01:43:11.304 --> 01:43:17.009]  I've had major problems with Republicans as well, but they've been a lot more tolerant, you know, back when I was anti-George Bush for all the wars.
[01:43:17.009 --> 01:43:18.771]  I was just a libertarian.
[01:43:18.771 --> 01:43:22.093]  I have had Democrats follow me out of restaurants and show me their gun.
[01:43:22.093 --> 01:43:23.575]  And this happened in front of witnesses.
[01:43:23.575 --> 01:43:24.756]  People said, why don't you pull your camera out?
[01:43:24.756 --> 01:43:26.077]  The guy's showing me a gun.
[01:43:26.077 --> 01:43:28.739]  And then by the time I was getting ready, he walked around the corner.
[01:43:28.739 --> 01:43:30.240]  People walk up and yell at me.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.902]  Once was caught on tape because I was recording.
[01:43:31.902 --> 01:43:33.843]  They go, F you Alex Jones.
[01:43:33.843 --> 01:43:35.205]  And man, they see me now.
[01:43:36.403 --> 01:43:50.766]  And then I've had people that are my friends who then say have a wife, in one case, and they say, sorry, you know, we got invited to your holiday party or to your pre-Thanksgiving party.
[01:43:50.766 --> 01:43:52.767]  We can't come because you support Trump.
[01:43:52.767 --> 01:43:54.847]  I'm like, thank you.
[01:43:54.847 --> 01:43:57.228]  Don't let the door hit you on your ass.
[01:43:57.228 --> 01:43:58.748]  I was just being nice.
[01:43:58.748 --> 01:44:00.349]  But I mean, this is like a cult.
[01:44:00.349 --> 01:44:04.710]  Again, cults always demand you break ties with anybody who isn't in the cult.
[01:44:05.563 --> 01:44:08.545]  And you know what else coats do is they punish you when you leave.
[01:44:08.545 --> 01:44:17.331]  And that's what we get with that movie, uh, The Red Pill, where this feminist goes out to crush this men's rights group and mocks them for all their stupid arguments.
[01:44:17.331 --> 01:44:18.391]  She debates them.
[01:44:18.391 --> 01:44:20.613]  She goes, these are actually really good points.
[01:44:21.113 --> 01:44:23.114]  And then she becomes red-pilled.
[01:44:23.114 --> 01:44:25.115]  So now the feminists are out to get her.
[01:44:25.115 --> 01:44:27.356]  We've got this guy, Julie S. Lalonde.
[01:44:27.356 --> 01:44:29.097]  I'm starting to name names, by the way.
[01:44:29.097 --> 01:44:31.838]  We need to identify these saboteurs.
[01:44:31.838 --> 01:44:33.079]  She's shutting down this theater.
[01:44:33.079 --> 01:44:35.460]  They just shut it down in Ottawa at the Mayfair Theater.
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:42.023]  Because Julie has decided that she has to punish her fellow feminist Scientologists for flying the coop.
[01:44:42.623 --> 01:44:45.346]  And isn't it funny, by the way, that we're the fascists, right?
[01:44:45.346 --> 01:44:50.231]  We're the ones who have to have our homes named in a trust so they can't find our homes.
[01:44:50.231 --> 01:44:52.553]  We're the ones who have to have a gun under the bed.
[01:44:52.553 --> 01:44:54.535]  We're the ones who have to have a gun in another room.
[01:44:54.535 --> 01:45:00.201]  We're the ones who are losing friends because we dared to violate the thought policing.
[01:45:00.201 --> 01:45:03.425]  And you go, you sure sound like the fascists to me because I've never
[01:45:03.865 --> 01:45:05.027]  I haven't done that to anyone.
[01:45:05.027 --> 01:45:06.849]  I don't want to know where my enemies live.
[01:45:06.849 --> 01:45:08.392]  I don't want to harass their children.
[01:45:08.392 --> 01:45:16.123]  But you look at Dana Lash's Instagram feed, and every picture of her kids is carefully hidden, because these bastards are psychotic!
[01:45:16.826 --> 01:45:35.280]  And by the way, I don't want to have to get into all this, but we now, I have to have full-time security because these people are so serious, they're so real, they're so dedicated, and then to see the left, you know, gotta have your house in a trust, whole same, you know, same nine yards, gotta cover your kids, because they're so fascist, they're so mentally ill, and
[01:45:36.201 --> 01:46:00.965]  They're allied with the most radical forms of Islam that throw gay people off buildings, murder women, sexually mutilate them, won't let them drive cars, and our government's backing the Saudi Arabian Wahhabist version worldwide, and you bring it up to them, and they scream, you're an Islamophobe, and I go out to these anti-Trump rallies, and it's a bunch of Islamicists foaming at the mouth against America.
[01:46:00.965 --> 01:46:03.326]  It's incredible how much they hate this country.
[01:46:03.326 --> 01:46:04.766]  What happened to the so-called left?
[01:46:06.881 --> 01:46:11.925]  They became, you know, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely, and they became dictators.
[01:46:11.925 --> 01:46:14.988]  They became fascists because they got too much power.
[01:46:14.988 --> 01:46:20.172]  And if you want to know who's in power, by the way, a great litmus test is to see who you can't make fun of.
[01:46:20.172 --> 01:46:22.314]  You want to make fun of, you want to do piss Christ?
[01:46:22.314 --> 01:46:24.416]  You want to put Jesus in urine?
[01:46:24.416 --> 01:46:25.216]  No problem.
[01:46:25.216 --> 01:46:27.378]  You want to make the Virgin Mary out of elephant dung?
[01:46:27.378 --> 01:46:32.062]  Well, we're not going to be nuts about it, but you can still put that in a taxpayer-funded museum.
[01:46:32.062 --> 01:46:33.063]  You mock feminists?
[01:46:33.303 --> 01:46:35.125]  Well, your movie's going to be shut down.
[01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:36.666]  You mock Muhammad?
[01:46:36.666 --> 01:46:42.791]  We're going to send guys there to shoot Pamela Geller because you dared to question Islam.
[01:46:42.791 --> 01:46:47.355]  So, and by the way, justice was beautifully meted out there in that particular instance.
[01:46:47.355 --> 01:46:54.922]  But the moral of the story here is you guys are blind with power and I can prove it because I'm not allowed to make fun of you.
[01:46:56.428 --> 01:47:00.012]  In the three minutes we've got left, Gavin, first thanks for coming on the broadcast.
[01:47:00.012 --> 01:47:01.533]  Thanks for having me.
[01:47:01.533 --> 01:47:08.340]  I'm excited to see people only getting more excited now that Trump got in, not going back to sleep like used to happen when a Republican got elected.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.401]  This is so exciting.
[01:47:09.401 --> 01:47:15.067]  I think it's key to continue to support Trump, to wait and see what he actually does with these appointments.
[01:47:15.067 --> 01:47:16.509]  I think if some of the appointments are bad,
[01:47:18.516 --> 01:47:22.819]  Knowing his management style, he's going to fire them if they don't carry out his will.
[01:47:22.819 --> 01:47:24.861]  I think it's probably a smart strategy.
[01:47:24.861 --> 01:47:27.403]  Just look at how the elite are attacking him.
[01:47:27.403 --> 01:47:28.664]  Look at the demonization.
[01:47:28.664 --> 01:47:31.867]  Look at how he's actually delivering on Americanism, not globalism.
[01:47:31.867 --> 01:47:34.169]  I mean, this guy is light years better than Hillary.
[01:47:34.169 --> 01:47:36.010]  I don't believe in a lesser of two evils.
[01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:44.157]  But in the case of Trump, I do see this vitriol forming out there that, oh my God, we got betrayed again when the guy's still 45 days out of office.
[01:47:45.718 --> 01:47:47.040]  Yeah, it is crazy, isn't it?
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.942]  Look, we've always been fighting fascists.
[01:47:48.942 --> 01:47:51.905]  When I was a punk rock teenager, I was fighting Nazi skinheads.
[01:47:51.905 --> 01:47:53.686]  We've always been at war, and we've been running.
[01:47:53.686 --> 01:47:58.551]  The only difference in the past eight years has been we were getting bullets from behind us.
[01:47:58.551 --> 01:48:06.540]  So we're out there fighting, and we look back and we see, pshew, pshew, and we've got neocons and republicans and even some paleoconservatives shooting at us.
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:08.921]  Now, Trump has our back.
[01:48:08.921 --> 01:48:10.542]  Now, we just yelled out, cover me!
[01:48:10.542 --> 01:48:15.064]  And the bullets are going in the same direction as us on either side, and we can really focus on it.
[01:48:15.064 --> 01:48:17.585]  So, I had some good times gloating.
[01:48:17.585 --> 01:48:19.386]  I'm really enjoying the revenge.
[01:48:19.386 --> 01:48:27.830]  But the big picture here is, we're fighting the fascists, we're fighting the censors, we're fighting the people who are out to extinguish our freedoms, and someone has our back.
[01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:30.552]  That's a totally different way to fight, and it's a great way to win.
[01:48:31.232 --> 01:48:31.772]  That's right.
[01:48:31.772 --> 01:48:38.955]  And again, I said this three weeks ago, they're going to try to cut Trump's base out by saying he's not 100% delivering even before he gets into office.
[01:48:38.955 --> 01:48:44.537]  And the Washington Post last week admitted that and said our strategy is to cut their base away from him.
[01:48:44.537 --> 01:48:45.538]  Good luck.
[01:48:45.538 --> 01:48:47.298]  They think we're so stupid.
[01:48:47.298 --> 01:48:49.419]  They talk to us like we're dumb.
[01:48:49.419 --> 01:48:51.060]  It's their constituents that are stupid.
[01:48:51.755 --> 01:48:54.536]  Yeah, and they use these same old games too.
[01:48:54.536 --> 01:48:55.797]  Tucker Carlson is great.
[01:48:55.797 --> 01:48:57.637]  His new show, I call it Tucker Porn.
[01:48:57.637 --> 01:49:00.138]  And you just watch him destroy liberals.
[01:49:00.138 --> 01:49:06.461]  And they say things like they had this black guy on who was calling the murder of the Somali terrorist racist.
[01:49:06.461 --> 01:49:10.402]  And he goes, yeah, but aren't you a suspected white supremacist?
[01:49:10.402 --> 01:49:11.563]  And you can see Tucker just go,
[01:49:12.523 --> 01:49:15.025]  With his face saying, no, we're not doing that.
[01:49:15.025 --> 01:49:18.107]  You said that word so much you diluted it now to nothing.
[01:49:18.107 --> 01:49:20.008]  So all your old tropes are dead.
[01:49:20.008 --> 01:49:21.589]  All your old tricks are done.
[01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:26.412]  You're just... Oh, I love how you'll bring the race thing up like they've got the ultimate weapon and they've got you.
[01:49:26.412 --> 01:49:28.593]  Like, aren't you a white supremacist?
[01:49:28.593 --> 01:49:30.835]  And I'm like, yeah, and I'm an Easter Bunny too.
[01:49:30.835 --> 01:49:32.316]  Don't you get it, moron?
[01:49:32.316 --> 01:49:33.777]  You're the one bringing race into things.
[01:49:34.517 --> 01:49:35.478]  It's their death now.
[01:49:35.478 --> 01:49:36.318]  It really is.
[01:49:36.318 --> 01:49:39.001]  And their other big trick, by the way, is what about your children?
[01:49:39.001 --> 01:49:40.962]  What if your son was blah blah blah?
[01:49:40.962 --> 01:49:44.245]  What if someone, what if your mother was raped or something?
[01:49:44.245 --> 01:49:46.646]  They try to make you irrational by bringing your family into it.
[01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.688]  You just go, we're not doing that anymore.
[01:49:48.688 --> 01:49:52.131]  I'm not playing your stupid games because you lost.
[01:49:52.131 --> 01:49:55.053]  You know, I remember I was a young man and this girl, Rosanna Saracino,
[01:49:55.433 --> 01:49:58.414]  She dumped me and I was drunk, lying asleep on the kitchen floor.
[01:49:58.414 --> 01:49:59.334]  I couldn't get over it.
[01:49:59.334 --> 01:50:04.256]  My friend Pat Bannister just picked me up by the lapels and she goes, he goes, it's over.
[01:50:04.256 --> 01:50:05.417]  It's over.
[01:50:05.417 --> 01:50:06.277]  It's over.
[01:50:06.277 --> 01:50:07.978]  He said it about 20 times.
[01:50:07.978 --> 01:50:12.079]  And I feel like we just have to grab half of America and go, you lost.
[01:50:12.079 --> 01:50:13.460]  You lost.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.781]  You lost.
[01:50:15.781 --> 01:50:16.341]  Wake up.
[01:50:17.478 --> 01:50:26.344]  I totally agree with you, and if you look at it, I'm not a person to gloat and rub faces in it, but in their little false world, it's all about them gloating and having triumph over us.
[01:50:26.344 --> 01:50:36.270]  So it's important to explain, you have no power, you're a joke, you're not real intellectuals, you're basically frauds, and so get with the program and stop being such dumbasses.
[01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:37.952]  Yeah, we'll be here waiting for you when you're ready.
[01:50:38.837 --> 01:50:40.999]  All right, Gavin McGinnis is our guest.
[01:50:40.999 --> 01:50:42.161]  He's going to leave us now.
[01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:44.223]  You can find more at compoundmedia.com.
[01:50:44.223 --> 01:50:47.927]  And it feels so good to know we're in this war to overthrow these tyrants.
[01:50:47.927 --> 01:50:52.732]  And I'm glad we're right beside each other on those front lines with a Trump covering us.
[01:50:52.732 --> 01:50:53.213]  We'll be back.
[01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.554]  Thank you so much, Gavin.
[01:50:54.554 --> 01:50:54.915]  Cheers.
[01:50:54.915 --> 01:50:55.876]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:55.876 --> 01:50:56.517]  We'll be back, folks.
[01:51:00.734 --> 01:51:03.297]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[01:51:03.297 --> 01:51:05.399]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:51:05.399 --> 01:51:13.928]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:51:13.928 --> 01:51:16.371]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[01:51:16.371 --> 01:51:17.072]  It's mobile.
[01:51:17.072 --> 01:51:21.617]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:51:22.037 --> 01:51:25.660]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:28.982]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:29.963]  A true innovation.
[01:51:29.963 --> 01:51:31.984]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:51:31.984 --> 01:51:33.646]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[01:51:33.646 --> 01:51:36.047]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:51:36.047 --> 01:51:40.150]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[01:51:40.150 --> 01:51:42.172]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[01:51:42.172 --> 01:51:44.173]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[01:51:59.728 --> 01:52:01.490]  Good evening, TV.
[01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:03.692]  My name is Charlie Sayles.
[01:52:03.692 --> 01:52:07.956]  I'm coming at you from FetalRecords.com.
[01:52:07.956 --> 01:52:10.298]  Now, we've got a great Christmas album coming at you.
[01:52:11.255 --> 01:52:12.796]  I'm not the only one, aren't I?
[01:52:12.796 --> 01:52:18.457]  There's many others giving you different decades of styles and feels of the Christmas spirit.
[01:52:18.457 --> 01:52:26.700]  Now again, channelrecords.com, Charlie Simms, and have a Merry Christmas.
[01:52:29.611 --> 01:52:32.952]  Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier for two years?
[01:52:32.952 --> 01:52:38.533]  What if there were no contracts, no activation fees, no tracking, tracing, or draconian gimmicks?
[01:52:38.533 --> 01:52:41.494]  All on America's largest 4G LTE networks.

[01:52:51.656 --> 01:52:52.116]  Spell P-I-X.
[01:52:52.116 --> 01:52:52.876]  PixWireless.com.
[01:53:00.114 --> 01:53:01.596]  My name is Liam, I'm 41.
[01:53:01.596 --> 01:53:04.459]  I've been using One World Way for two and a half years now.
[01:53:04.459 --> 01:53:16.671]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago, and since that time I've been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting or just normal activities with my children without having severe back pain.
[01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:22.778]  Since I've started using One World Way, I've been able to walk more, engage in activities with my children, and have less lower back pain.
[01:53:23.238 --> 01:53:27.660]  One World Whey has helped me regain back my strength, confidence, and have a healthier life.
[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:33.502]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds, my A1c dropped two points, and I have more energy now.
[01:53:33.502 --> 01:53:36.143]  One World Whey has helped me regain back my life.
[01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:42.945]  The results for clients on One World Whey have surpassed the results for most any other supplements as well as all other whey protein powders.
[01:53:42.945 --> 01:53:45.746]  One World Whey is non-denatured and frequency encoded.
[01:53:45.746 --> 01:53:50.508]  We believe the frequency encoding increases your body's production of glutathione and energy production.
[01:53:50.508 --> 01:53:50.808]  Call 888-
[01:53:51.609 --> 01:53:51.909]  We're good.
[01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:29.478]  Coming up, Doug Hagman is going to be joining us about preparations for civil unrest that we know the globalists have been trying to prepare before and during the inauguration of Trump.
[01:54:29.478 --> 01:54:31.179]  Is it 45 days out now?
[01:54:31.179 --> 01:54:33.700]  I need to actually check the calendar.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:37.603]  So we're watching all of that unfold right now.
[01:54:37.603 --> 01:54:42.366]  45 days, if my memory serves correct.
[01:54:42.366 --> 01:54:43.407]  Also, we're going to look at
[01:54:44.212 --> 01:54:47.954]  But the media has turned into Pizzagate.
[01:54:47.954 --> 01:54:55.837]  We just called it the WikiLeaks and all the weird child stuff that was in there, and law enforcement believes that there's some things going on there with children.
[01:54:55.837 --> 01:55:02.920]  Everybody then in mainstream media began to focus on one little area of Reddit talking about some pizza parlor.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:09.283]  And then we looked at it, and now the media has turned it into this big deal saying that we are the progenitors, the creators of it.
[01:55:09.283 --> 01:55:09.943]  It's just not true.
[01:55:11.874 --> 01:55:13.275]  This is just standard what they do.
[01:55:13.275 --> 01:55:15.597]  It's why they have no viewers, why they have no listeners.
[01:55:15.597 --> 01:55:24.926]  But I've got a lawyer coming on who was reportedly in the pizza place, Comet Pizza yesterday, when some guy came in with a gun and reportedly fired off the shotgun or something.
[01:55:24.926 --> 01:55:26.707]  Nobody was hurt.
[01:55:26.707 --> 01:55:29.470]  And he's been on CNN saying it's my fault.
[01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:31.632]  And, you know, it just gets old.
[01:55:31.632 --> 01:55:34.154]  I'm getting criticized all over the Internet for three weeks.
[01:55:34.154 --> 01:55:35.255]  I'm covering up pizza games.
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.420]  Okay?
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:39.381]  And CNN knows that full well.
[01:55:39.381 --> 01:55:45.543]  I'm not covering up Pizzagate, and I'm not behind Pizzagate.
[01:55:45.543 --> 01:55:49.084]  Julian Assange released the tens of thousands of Podesta emails.
[01:55:49.084 --> 01:55:49.964]  Tens of thousands.
[01:55:49.964 --> 01:55:54.786]  And a whole bunch of them have got some really creepy stuff in them, like, We'll be meeting you at the farmhouse.
[01:55:54.786 --> 01:55:57.527]  We'll have three children, six, seven, and eight.
[01:55:57.527 --> 01:55:58.727]  They're very pleasing.
[01:55:58.727 --> 01:56:01.468]  They'll be in the hot tub, waiting for your entertainment.
[01:56:02.338 --> 01:56:03.560]  That's not the pizza place.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:06.083]  That's some farmhouse out in the middle of New York.
[01:56:06.083 --> 01:56:08.525]  I mean, it's weird, okay?
[01:56:08.525 --> 01:56:12.490]  I spent days reading thousands of these damn things.
[01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:14.272]  I can't do it anymore.
[01:56:14.272 --> 01:56:15.674]  No one's looking into that, though.
[01:56:17.202 --> 01:56:29.192]  It's all just obsessing on ping pong pizza because three weeks ago, CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post picked that as the fake news paradigm.
[01:56:29.192 --> 01:56:35.737]  You've got all this whole world, this whole world of the Podesta emails and super bombshell stuff there.
[01:56:35.737 --> 01:56:39.360]  Paper play, money laundering, I mean, it's bad.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.120]  How do you kill that?
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.183]  You focus on one little spot to get everyone looking at ping pong pizza.
[01:56:44.183 --> 01:56:46.045]  I don't know what's going on at ping pong pizza.
[01:56:48.151 --> 01:56:50.693]  The guy may just have really bad taste in art.
[01:56:50.693 --> 01:56:52.795]  Because let me tell you, it's Creepville.
[01:56:52.795 --> 01:56:58.579]  And there's some creepy people, maybe they just have rock guys that play songs and talk about their preference being children.
[01:56:58.579 --> 01:56:59.860]  There's video of that!
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:00.861]  Before all this happened.
[01:57:00.861 --> 01:57:02.182]  I get why folks are flipping out.
[01:57:02.182 --> 01:57:03.323]  And people are pissed!
[01:57:03.323 --> 01:57:07.226]  And they've seen the child sex cover-up all over the world.
[01:57:07.226 --> 01:57:08.107]  I'm telling you though...
[01:57:09.448 --> 01:57:18.430]  That I was told by David Icke like 15 years ago that Jimmy Savelle was slitting kids' throats in front of Prime Ministers at a torture dungeon and that most of the BBC at high levels are pedophiles.
[01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:20.871]  I said, David, you can't say that on my show.
[01:57:20.871 --> 01:57:21.651]  David was proven right.
[01:57:21.651 --> 01:57:24.952]  It all came out later.
[01:57:24.952 --> 01:57:27.212]  I think he's credible.
[01:57:27.212 --> 01:57:28.412]  He believes what he's saying.
[01:57:28.412 --> 01:57:29.873]  I think he's a good guy.
[01:57:29.873 --> 01:57:31.893]  I don't know if I can buy into all of it.
[01:57:31.893 --> 01:57:33.954]  The point is that he was proven right.
[01:57:33.954 --> 01:57:35.414]  We should get David Icke back on.
[01:57:38.723 --> 01:57:41.465]  All I know is this stuff's crazy.
[01:57:41.465 --> 01:57:44.907]  So, I've got a real media operation here.
[01:57:44.907 --> 01:57:51.871]  And I just can't sit here and definitively, that's what freaks me out about some of the listeners, is that I'm saying we don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:57:51.871 --> 01:57:55.873]  Pizzagate is real in that there's something weird going on.
[01:57:55.873 --> 01:57:57.174]  But Pizzagate's bigger than that.
[01:57:57.174 --> 01:58:03.337]  The FBI says that pizza and things is used as code words in pedophilia and trafficking kids.
[01:58:03.337 --> 01:58:06.239]  That doesn't mean if you have a pizza place, you're involved.
[01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:07.760]  I ate pizza yesterday.
[01:58:09.690 --> 01:58:12.539]  It doesn't mean that.
[01:58:12.539 --> 01:58:13.963]  Because something's a triangle.
[01:58:14.989 --> 01:58:25.834]  In pedophilia symbols, a big triangle, a little triangle, meaning big man, little boy, doesn't mean that somebody at a pizza place has triangles, and that means that it's kids, because that's the symbol of pizza.
[01:58:25.834 --> 01:58:27.575]  But I see where all this is going.
[01:58:27.575 --> 01:58:33.717]  We've got the lawyer who was there and saw the guy come in and shoot things, who thinks it's all my fault joining us.
[01:58:33.717 --> 01:58:37.319]  So I look forward to that, and he'll be on with us with Doug Hagman.
[01:58:37.319 --> 01:58:37.979]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:37.979 --> 01:58:42.221]  Stay with us, and don't forget, 25% off on DNA Force, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:42.221 --> 01:58:43.722]  We need your support and your prayers.
[01:58:50.075 --> 01:58:52.737]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[01:58:52.737 --> 01:58:54.899]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:58:54.899 --> 01:59:00.623]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:59:00.623 --> 01:59:03.705]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:59:03.705 --> 01:59:06.227]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[01:59:06.227 --> 01:59:06.947]  It's mobile.
[01:59:06.947 --> 01:59:11.651]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:59:12.091 --> 01:59:15.813]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[01:59:15.813 --> 01:59:19.234]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:59:19.234 --> 01:59:20.255]  A true innovation.
[01:59:20.255 --> 01:59:22.356]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:59:22.356 --> 01:59:24.056]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:26.597]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:59:26.597 --> 01:59:30.759]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[01:59:30.759 --> 01:59:32.880]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:34.901]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[02:00:09.497 --> 02:00:11.098]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.098 --> 02:00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.721]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.721 --> 02:00:25.690]  Alright, Doug Hagman joining us coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:25.690 --> 02:00:33.716]  I want to just pull back and get into the really exciting news that another country has voted against EU expansion of powers.
[02:00:35.643 --> 02:00:38.445]  The five-star movement that just came out of nowhere three years ago.
[02:00:38.445 --> 02:00:39.105]  It's populist.
[02:00:39.105 --> 02:00:41.147]  It's anti-New World Order.
[02:00:41.147 --> 02:00:46.590]  Members of the organization, leaders of it, are anti-Bilderberg, anti-New World Order.
[02:00:46.590 --> 02:00:49.472]  Very exciting.
[02:00:49.472 --> 02:01:01.680]  We've also seen big victories taking place where we see referendums being established in 25 other EU countries.
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.741]  That's every EU member.
[02:01:04.898 --> 02:01:12.780]  And we see what happened with Trump, and what happened with Brexit, what's happened with Russia, what's happened with Iceland, what's happening with Catalonia and Spain.
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.621]  It's all going the same direction.
[02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:17.801]  Brazil's trying to get out of globalism.
[02:01:17.801 --> 02:01:22.863]  Foreign banks running your country, getting you into debt by design, controlling your nation.
[02:01:22.863 --> 02:01:30.084]  The IMF and World Bank documents got leaked in 2002, the year Joseph Stiglitz left.
[02:01:30.084 --> 02:01:31.725]  He says he didn't leak them, we've interviewed him twice.
[02:01:33.004 --> 02:01:34.945]  And it said, this is our plan.
[02:01:34.945 --> 02:01:37.427]  We've done it in the third world.
[02:01:37.427 --> 02:01:40.188]  Now we're going to do it in the first world.
[02:01:40.188 --> 02:01:45.091]  So the planet is waking up to who is screwing everyone over.
[02:01:45.091 --> 02:01:54.197]  Meanwhile, the Dow jumped 100 points to record highs after Italian referendum.
[02:01:54.197 --> 02:01:54.717]  CNBC.
[02:01:59.366 --> 02:02:03.908]  Now, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has an article on Infowars.com asking if the sky is blue.
[02:02:03.908 --> 02:02:04.669]  He says, is the U.S.
[02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:08.711]  government behind fake news media attacks on Trump?
[02:02:08.711 --> 02:02:09.972]  They admit it's the State Department.
[02:02:09.972 --> 02:02:16.795]  They admit it's the White House coordinating and Obama out saying, call all media that disagrees with us, fake news.
[02:02:16.795 --> 02:02:22.078]  What do you expect them to do when everything they did got discredited in the election?
[02:02:23.424 --> 02:02:26.206]  They were shown to be lies and frauds.
[02:02:26.206 --> 02:02:30.908]  That's why we have to keep pushing the fact that they said Hillary was invincible.
[02:02:30.908 --> 02:02:40.974]  And they said, you know, that they weren't involved with Hillary, but they got caught basically running her campaign and giving her all the intel and the questions.
[02:02:40.974 --> 02:02:45.616]  And now that they've had this historic loss, they're only intensifying what they're doing.
[02:02:45.616 --> 02:02:48.318]  In fact, here's a clip.
[02:02:48.318 --> 02:02:51.940]  Pelosi pressed on ghastly Democratic losses.
[02:02:53.123 --> 02:02:54.384]  Since 2008.
[02:02:54.384 --> 02:02:57.365]  They're the ones saying it was the end of the Republican Party.
[02:02:57.365 --> 02:03:01.526]  That the Republican Party was going to go extinct.
[02:03:01.526 --> 02:03:04.908]  That it was all over.
[02:03:04.908 --> 02:03:11.770]  And now it's not just the Republican Party establishment that's going extinct, it's the Democrats in whole.
[02:03:11.770 --> 02:03:16.772]  As populism surges, as the people discover how things really work.
[02:03:16.772 --> 02:03:18.593]  We're going to go out to break with this clip.
[02:03:18.593 --> 02:03:20.934]  Pelosi pressed on ghastly Democratic losses.
[02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:25.431]  Since 2008, the numbers are ghastly for Democrats.
[02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:27.332]  In Senate, Democrats are down 10%.
[02:03:27.332 --> 02:03:28.452]  In the House, down 19.3%.
[02:03:28.452 --> 02:03:31.313]  And in Governors, 35%.
[02:03:31.313 --> 02:03:35.735]  The Democrats are getting clobbered at every level over multiple elections.
[02:03:35.735 --> 02:03:37.356]  That seems like a real crisis for the party.
[02:03:37.356 --> 02:03:39.396]  Well, I've been forgetting that we went up so high.
[02:03:41.797 --> 02:03:44.719]  In 2006 and 2008.
[02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:48.201]  And let me just put that in perspective.
[02:03:48.201 --> 02:03:53.064]  When President Clinton was elected, the Republicans came in big in the next election.
[02:03:53.064 --> 02:03:58.367]  When President Bush was president, we came in big in the subsequent election.
[02:03:58.367 --> 02:04:02.910]  When President Obama became president, the Republicans came in big in the next election.
[02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:08.013]  I guess my question is, the Republicans reacted to their losses with a big revolution and a change.
[02:04:08.013 --> 02:04:10.775]  They have a very new president at the top of their party now.
[02:04:10.775 --> 02:04:22.102]  You have somebody like Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack saying that the Democratic Party is like a tree that, quote, looks healthy on the outside but is in the throes of a slow and long-term demise.
[02:04:23.883 --> 02:04:25.264]  I mean, this is the bizarre crone.
[02:04:45.967 --> 02:04:48.288]  That these idiots re-elected after total defeat.
[02:04:48.288 --> 02:04:49.948]  It shows they're not doing anything new.
[02:04:49.948 --> 02:04:55.250]  They're just letting the same old technicians run the same old lies over and over again.
[02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:59.951]  This is great news for the Liberty Movement.
[02:04:59.951 --> 02:05:11.195]  Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice just slapped Colorado's largest Sheriff's Department last month with a $10,000 fine and ordered them to take steps to correct their discriminatory hiring practices.
[02:05:11.195 --> 02:05:13.535]  The illegal act the Sheriff's Department committed, you ask?
[02:05:13.535 --> 02:05:14.776]  Well, they hired only U.S.
[02:05:14.776 --> 02:05:15.216]  citizens.
[02:05:15.336 --> 02:05:19.881]  Now, in a summary of the settlement on the DOJ's website, they said that insisting on U.S.
[02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:27.229]  citizenship violates an anti-discrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that forbids employers from hiring only U.S.
[02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:29.592]  citizens except in cases where it's mandated by law.
[02:05:30.333 --> 02:05:35.415]  The Denver Sheriff's Department maintains that it's committed to treating all people fairly with dignity and respect.
[02:05:35.415 --> 02:05:39.336]  They're, of course, cleaning up their practices now, and they vowed not to do it again.
[02:05:39.336 --> 02:05:45.058]  More than 40 states have rules in place keeping law enforcement agencies from hiring non-citizens.
[02:05:45.058 --> 02:05:55.961]  Only Colorado, Louisiana, Maine, and Vermont, as well as West Virginia, have no such statewide restriction, which means that Colorado is a target for the DOJ if they continue to hire only U.S.
[02:05:55.961 --> 02:05:56.641]  citizens.
[02:05:56.641 --> 02:05:59.002]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:59.762 --> 02:06:03.803]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[02:06:03.803 --> 02:06:04.924]  Charlie Daniels.
[02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:06.784]  He's always loved America.
[02:06:06.784 --> 02:06:08.585]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[02:06:08.585 --> 02:06:11.426]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[02:06:11.426 --> 02:06:15.587]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[02:06:15.587 --> 02:06:19.569]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[02:06:19.569 --> 02:06:21.490]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:23.110]  There's gonna be a command for your gun.
[02:06:23.110 --> 02:06:23.430]  Oh, yeah.
[02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:25.471]  I'll tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[02:06:26.031 --> 02:06:26.992]  At all.
[02:06:26.992 --> 02:06:28.053]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[02:06:28.053 --> 02:06:30.275]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:06:30.275 --> 02:06:31.416]  It's time to ride, boys.
[02:06:31.416 --> 02:06:33.417]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[02:06:33.417 --> 02:06:39.462]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[02:06:39.462 --> 02:06:41.324]  And beef was for supper.
[02:06:42.045 --> 02:06:44.508]  Revelation, dawn of global government.

[02:08:10.433 --> 02:08:17.815]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.815 --> 02:08:25.356]  Sharif Shilmi, a immigration lawyer out of DC, will be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:25.356 --> 02:08:32.558]  And if Hagman wants to ride shotgun and pop in here and there, he's welcome to, but I'm going to focus in on this interview.
[02:08:34.076 --> 02:08:35.397]  Because it's important.
[02:08:35.397 --> 02:08:37.638]  He agreed to come on in the last 30 minutes of this hour.
[02:08:37.638 --> 02:08:42.941]  He was reportedly inside the building at Comet Pizza in DC.
[02:08:42.941 --> 02:08:45.883]  It was listed in the Podesta emails as a place they were doing fundraisers.
[02:08:48.522 --> 02:08:57.267]  And he reportedly saw this man walk in with a shotgun and then shoot a few times into the wall, saying he was looking for the secret tunnels, the pedophilia and the rest of it.
[02:08:57.267 --> 02:08:59.668]  And then he's gone on CNN and said, it's my fault.
[02:08:59.668 --> 02:09:02.089]  He said on Twitter, it's my fault.
[02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:06.011]  Even though I've always said I don't know about Comet Pizza.
[02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:07.032]  There's some word anomalies there.
[02:09:07.032 --> 02:09:12.855]  I'm talking about the general thousands of emails, the stuff happening from California to Hawaii to New York.
[02:09:13.735 --> 02:09:18.076]  And law enforcement has said there's evidence of sex trafficking going on there.
[02:09:18.076 --> 02:09:19.816]  Epstein's involved.
[02:09:19.816 --> 02:09:22.757]  Member of the Lolita Express.
[02:09:22.757 --> 02:09:24.117]  I mean, this stuff's widespread.
[02:09:24.117 --> 02:09:26.477]  This is real stuff going on.
[02:09:26.477 --> 02:09:31.618]  And the media, though, focused three weeks ago in on Comet Pizza.
[02:09:31.618 --> 02:09:33.018]  And only that.
[02:09:33.018 --> 02:09:34.238]  And I said, we got to be careful.
[02:09:34.238 --> 02:09:36.979]  Folks are distracting from all the other stuff.
[02:09:36.979 --> 02:09:39.419]  Well, there I am trying to have some reason.
[02:09:39.419 --> 02:09:41.220]  So I get the blame for the whole story.
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:42.140]  He's going to be joining us.
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:42.620]  And I want to get
[02:09:43.769 --> 02:09:45.430]  Doug Hagman's take on that.
[02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:52.673]  In a moment, and I shot a larger video on it last night, Pizzagate is a diversion from the greater crimes in Podesta and WikiLeaks.
[02:09:52.673 --> 02:09:57.115]  That we expose the pedophile sex crimes that have been confirmed going on around the country.
[02:09:57.115 --> 02:09:59.136]  And some of the detractors say, oh, I'm covering it up.
[02:09:59.136 --> 02:10:00.656]  No.
[02:10:00.656 --> 02:10:07.559]  It's a tactic to divert people down a rabbit hole.
[02:10:07.559 --> 02:10:09.520]  And I'm saying it should all be investigated.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.521]  And we've been investigating.
[02:10:11.323 --> 02:10:15.845]  But overall, the stock market's way up.
[02:10:15.845 --> 02:10:20.108]  Italy just voted to stop EU expansion, another victory against globalism.
[02:10:20.108 --> 02:10:21.649]  Trump's standing up against Communist China.
[02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:23.570]  Really positive things are happening.
[02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:27.732]  Trump's people have said, no, he does plan to have folks go after Hillary once he gets in.
[02:10:27.732 --> 02:10:29.773]  That's still 45 days out.
[02:10:29.773 --> 02:10:33.375]  But the death blow against globalism is so intense, but they're desperate.
[02:10:33.375 --> 02:10:39.639]  So what are they going to try in the time being, is the larger question.
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:46.988]  Because yes, positive things are happening, but we're far from out of the woods right now, in my humble view.
[02:10:46.988 --> 02:10:49.051]  Will they try to destabilize things ahead of the election?
[02:10:49.051 --> 02:10:52.896]  They're already trying this recount only with states Trump won.
[02:10:52.896 --> 02:10:58.483]  They're already doubling and tripling money to Black Lives Matter to get ready for the fomentation of riots.
[02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:04.054]  So this is a critical time to be alive right now.
[02:11:04.054 --> 02:11:16.649]  I want to cover the destabilization first, but then talk to Mr. Hagman about his New York police contacts and others about what's really in the 600,000 plus emails, not just what was in the WikiLeaks and where that may be going.
[02:11:16.649 --> 02:11:18.711]  So quite a lot to talk about.
[02:11:18.711 --> 02:11:19.612]  Mr. Hagman, of course.
[02:11:20.453 --> 02:11:32.684]  HagmanReport.com and I'm not going to go into his Fortune 500 clients and how he trains law enforcement agencies and works for the Department of Justice, FBI, you name it, I'll just stop right there.
[02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:39.890]  But he joins us, he's the author of Tactical Surveillance and again he hosts the Hagman Report, HagmanReport.com.
[02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:40.931]  Doug, good to have you back on.
[02:11:40.931 --> 02:11:41.932]  I threw out a lot of stuff there.
[02:11:41.932 --> 02:11:43.173]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:46.110]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me back on.
[02:11:46.110 --> 02:11:59.775]  You know, I suppose with the incident that took place yesterday over the weekend at Coma Pizza, I think it probably would be good to let people know that this is not just about Coma Pizza or not about Coma Pizza.
[02:11:59.775 --> 02:12:04.117]  The allegations that are contained therein are just that, allegations, they're suspicions.
[02:12:05.958 --> 02:12:24.173]  I really think, Alex, that what we're seeing here is just the fake news meme being applied to this entire satanic ritual abuse operation and pedophile operation, alleged pedophile operation, that is.
[02:12:26.294 --> 02:12:33.857]  So I would really caution people not to get tunnel vision on any one place, any one person, any one incident.
[02:12:33.857 --> 02:12:40.879]  Look at this as like a large crime scene with subordinate crime scenes built in everywhere else.
[02:12:40.879 --> 02:12:43.000]  But we can get into anything.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.802]  You had mentioned earlier about the... You just crystallized it unlike anybody else.
[02:12:46.802 --> 02:12:48.082]  That's it.
[02:12:48.082 --> 02:12:49.663]  I mean, this is a larger crime scene.
[02:12:49.663 --> 02:12:50.263]  Let's break it down.
[02:12:51.308 --> 02:12:54.430]  Well, exactly, that's just it.
[02:12:54.430 --> 02:13:09.179]  We know that child abuse, pedophilia, call boy rings, call girl rings, we know that these activities have existed inside and outside of the Beltway for decades.
[02:13:09.179 --> 02:13:11.861]  You go back to the Franklin scandal, you go back even further.
[02:13:12.621 --> 02:13:35.334]  We know now, of course, in 1997 it was written in Insight in the News Magazine at the APEC meeting in Seattle, Washington in 1993 that they had the Department of State furnished young underage boys, male prostitutes that is, to the visiting dignitaries from the Asian Pacific countries.
[02:13:35.334 --> 02:13:37.115]  That has been reported as fact.
[02:13:37.795 --> 02:13:56.294]  And that again, that goes back to the August 29, 1997 edition of Insight in the News as reported by the author of that publication who did the investigation where the FBI was caught bugging the rooms and conducting physical and electronic surveillance of the members of that particular meeting.
[02:13:58.476 --> 02:14:11.865]  The fact that this does not occur, or the fact that the meme is, or the objective is to put this in a post-truth category, which is, by the way, Oxford Dictionary's 2016 Word of the Year.
[02:14:11.865 --> 02:14:22.152]  It's a compound word, post-truth, meaning that everything that we're seeing right now is driven by emotion and speculation as opposed to fact, which is just totally incorrect, but it plays into the fake news operational guidelines.
[02:14:23.154 --> 02:14:35.958]  But all of that said, we have to be cognizant of the fact that this is larger than even what the citizen journalists are reporting.
[02:14:35.958 --> 02:14:42.420]  This involves high-level officials, dignitaries, ambassadors, all across the world.
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:50.142]  And it's interesting that this came out initially from the October 3rd beginning of the Podesta data dumps on October 3rd of 2016.
[02:14:52.585 --> 02:15:05.054]  In earnest with respect to the different coding in the languages which which the FBI by the way Alex knew about I've attended the training courses Where the FBI?
[02:15:05.054 --> 02:15:21.765]  Recognizes for example the pedophilia recognizes even to some extent satanic ritual abuse, but not They just don't have a matrix or a metric for it a grid for it Which is why I should say that that some of the smaller departments and even the media
[02:15:22.705 --> 02:15:27.407]  They don't want to talk about this because they don't believe it exists because they don't understand it.
[02:15:27.407 --> 02:15:29.868]  They don't have a metric for it.
[02:15:29.868 --> 02:15:40.952]  They'll understand a serial killer like Jeffrey Dahmer, but they won't understand the satanic aspect of Jeffrey Dahmer, which there was a huge satanic aspect of that.
[02:15:40.952 --> 02:15:42.373]  So all of this combined.
[02:15:42.373 --> 02:15:43.813]  I said all that just to say this.
[02:15:43.813 --> 02:15:47.715]  I think we have to be careful with our tunnel vision.
[02:15:47.715 --> 02:15:51.156]  We have to be careful not to zero in on any one place, person, location.
[02:15:52.182 --> 02:16:03.448]  And we have to look at this as a larger in the larger sense and with a large wide-angle lens because we are going to be connecting a lot of dots over the next couple of weeks.
[02:16:03.448 --> 02:16:09.471]  And the only other thing I want to mention is this is not in any way shape or form fake news.
[02:16:09.531 --> 02:16:20.193]  There are elements of fake and false aspects to this story that were, I believe, were deliberately planted and have been exploited to create the illusion.
[02:16:20.193 --> 02:16:20.714]  Exactly.
[02:16:20.714 --> 02:16:30.476]  If a giant network is being exposed, the classic move is to then put this info out there, have people pick up on it, have the mainstream media only focus on one
[02:16:31.863 --> 02:16:44.874]  Little area in DC and then distract from the fact that we've got Washington Post, New York Times, Washington Times, Associated Press headlines with whole underage callboy networks caught in Barney Frank's house.
[02:16:44.874 --> 02:16:48.618]  Barney Frank then went on the house floor and said, you better watch it.
[02:16:49.537 --> 02:16:54.763]  Because if you come after me, I'm going to bring everybody down that's involved in this chamber.
[02:16:54.763 --> 02:17:03.134]  And then we have some of the people now in the Podesta emails, best buddies with Dennis Hastert, who is running a whole pedophile network and procuring the boys.
[02:17:03.134 --> 02:17:05.156]  And so we look at Penn State, all of it.
[02:17:05.156 --> 02:17:08.460]  Their CNN now has really bitten off more than they can chew.
[02:17:09.437 --> 02:17:14.418]  Because they're out saying it's fake news to claim there's organized pedophilia.
[02:17:14.418 --> 02:17:20.799]  Well, that's like saying the Catholic Church didn't get caught, or the Vatican didn't get caught, or Penn State didn't get caught, or the Franklin cover-up.
[02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:22.419]  This is real stuff.
[02:17:22.419 --> 02:17:36.642]  And their stonewalling isn't going to work by taking Reddit posts, and then saying I said it, or my reporters said it, when all we did, when it was a top news story, and Reddit banned it, was cover what people were saying.
[02:17:38.018 --> 02:17:53.926]  Yeah, and that's very interesting what you said there, Alex, because I do believe that we as a collective in the media, and I consider us media investigative journalists, it's interesting because we have to be very careful.
[02:17:53.926 --> 02:18:06.813]  We are being accused of creating this, a lot of this information, when in fact we're reporting on what was posted on a forum or on a particular website.
[02:18:07.213 --> 02:18:16.763]  And what CNN three weeks ago and the New York Times and Washington Post cherry-picked to make the fake news so everyone would then go focus on that.
[02:18:16.763 --> 02:18:18.805]  They were leading people around by their noses.
[02:18:19.744 --> 02:18:21.406]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:21.406 --> 02:18:34.718]  And you know, one thing I found interesting with this, and I was talking with an investigator early this morning about this, is the fact that a lot of this began and still exists in the circumstantial evidence realm, or in the realm of circumstantial evidence.
[02:18:34.718 --> 02:18:41.505]  And in my experience as an investigator and looking at different criminal acts and crimes, you know, circumstantial evidence is
[02:18:42.717 --> 02:18:54.785]  The most difficult type of evidence to manufacture if you were going to go out and perhaps frame someone or at least or even call something false or fake.
[02:18:54.785 --> 02:19:05.092]  If there's circumstantial evidence to support or substantiate a particular crime, a lot of weight should be put into that because, again, it's difficult to manufacture as opposed to planting, we'll say, physical evidence.
[02:19:05.652 --> 02:19:12.936]  Which is easily manufactured or, you know, with the digital age now, creating a picture or altering a photograph.
[02:19:12.936 --> 02:19:16.978]  So that's the other factor, too, that we have to take a look at.
[02:19:16.978 --> 02:19:22.621]  But most importantly, the pedophilia that exists inside and outside the beltway.
[02:19:22.621 --> 02:19:23.341]  We know this.
[02:19:23.341 --> 02:19:23.921]  We know.
[02:19:23.921 --> 02:19:24.922]  There's no argument.
[02:19:25.322 --> 02:19:25.983]  Yeah.
[02:19:25.983 --> 02:19:29.266]  So CNN, though, is trying to say there's no such thing exists.
[02:19:29.266 --> 02:19:31.588]  They say there's nothing in the Podesta emails.
[02:19:31.588 --> 02:19:32.449]  What do you mean?
[02:19:32.449 --> 02:19:33.891]  It's Weiner.
[02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:41.879]  It's connections to the island, the Lolita Express, Epstein, all of this.
[02:19:41.879 --> 02:19:44.501]  And they're just saying using ping pong pizza.
[02:19:45.362 --> 02:19:48.625]  As the gateway, everything else in the world is fake.
[02:19:48.625 --> 02:19:52.168]  I'm waiting for CNN to say a Catholic priest never molested a little boy.
[02:19:52.168 --> 02:19:53.149]  I'm serious.
[02:19:53.149 --> 02:19:55.912]  I'm expecting Anderson Cooper to come out and say that's the case.
[02:19:55.912 --> 02:19:59.275]  We'll be right back to ask what other investigators have told Hagman recently.
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:01.901]  KD Armor raised the standard.
[02:20:01.901 --> 02:20:07.383]  Finally, AR500 steel core body armor that comfortably conforms to the chest and torso.

[02:24:09.189 --> 02:24:14.092]  Now, Sharif Shilmi, who is a lawyer, is going to be joining us.
[02:24:14.092 --> 02:24:17.354]  He was in the Comet Pizza place in D.C.
[02:24:17.354 --> 02:24:23.538]  yesterday when reportedly a guy came in with a shotgun and didn't shoot people, reportedly shot something.
[02:24:23.538 --> 02:24:26.600]  The press hasn't been clear, so I want to ask him what he witnessed.
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:30.682]  I found out about it because I was going to bed last night after I'd even shot a video about all this.
[02:24:32.662 --> 02:24:35.004]  My cousin, you know, sent it and said, hey, you just did a video on this.
[02:24:35.004 --> 02:24:40.707]  This guy says he was in there and says he thinks you're partially to blame.
[02:24:40.707 --> 02:24:46.731]  No, I'm not, because we're covering what Reddit and everybody said, and I've said people should be careful about it.
[02:24:46.731 --> 02:24:51.134]  And so for three weeks, they've been saying I'm covering it up.
[02:24:51.134 --> 02:24:58.138]  But we'll get his take on it, because, again, I think the whole thing is a distraction from what Doug Hagman was talking about earlier.
[02:24:58.138 --> 02:25:01.060]  CNN's trying to imply that Penn State didn't happen.
[02:25:02.722 --> 02:25:06.023]  They're trying to imply that the Catholic Church hasn't been caught doing all this.
[02:25:06.023 --> 02:25:19.485]  I love the mainstream media saying we're the fake media, Doug Hagman, when they're the ones that lied us into the Iraq War, lied us into all these other wars, into the Syria situation, into everything else that's going on that have been caught over and over again.
[02:25:19.485 --> 02:25:23.906]  It's all about the fake news narrative applying to us things we didn't really say.
[02:25:23.906 --> 02:25:27.587]  They take rumors off the internet, one of the biggest stories out there, we cover it.
[02:25:27.587 --> 02:25:28.967]  We cover real examples.
[02:25:29.827 --> 02:25:33.930]  I tweeted out last night about the Haitian situation and kids being kidnapped and stuff.
[02:25:33.930 --> 02:25:35.351]  That's mainstream news.
[02:25:35.351 --> 02:25:43.157]  But I use the term Pizzagate to use a term out there to take people off the diversion of ping pong pizza onto the real stuff we're looking at.
[02:25:43.157 --> 02:25:49.802]  Your take on that and then continuing, you say you've talked to more of your NYPD and federal law enforcement sources.
[02:25:49.802 --> 02:25:51.824]  Of course, Eric Prince has come out.
[02:25:51.824 --> 02:25:53.625]  He's got major intelligence sources.
[02:25:53.625 --> 02:25:57.688]  He says the Clintons are connected to child trafficking and the WikiLeaks and more.
[02:25:57.688 --> 02:25:59.190]  Well, I mean, look at Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:00.810]  Look at Lolita Express.
[02:26:00.810 --> 02:26:01.831]  Look at Pedophile Island.
[02:26:01.831 --> 02:26:03.872]  I mean, this stuff's going on.
[02:26:03.872 --> 02:26:10.954]  I've said watch out, folks, and don't sit there just because innocent people are mixed into these thousands of emails and then randomly blame them.
[02:26:10.954 --> 02:26:13.335]  And it's mainstream media a month ago.
[02:26:14.394 --> 02:26:19.861]  Three weeks ago, that began to focus on ping pong off Reddit, then we were forced to cover it.
[02:26:19.861 --> 02:26:21.443]  And then now, we're supposedly behind it.
[02:26:21.443 --> 02:26:28.713]  We're going to go back with all of it, sure, by the complete timeline, to continue to expose CNN as dirtbag liars.
[02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:31.277]  Now, Doug, you're going to ride shotgun with us, but Mr.
[02:26:33.039 --> 02:26:35.922]  Well, Sharif's coming on in a second, and I look forward to speaking to him.
[02:26:35.922 --> 02:26:42.370]  I'm glad nothing bad happened to him or his family, and I'm glad he can be a non-partisan witness to what happened.
[02:26:42.370 --> 02:26:44.433]  But expanding on this, what have your sources told you?
[02:26:45.543 --> 02:26:50.388]  Well, really, it's all about the Clinton Foundation at the epicenter of everything.
[02:26:50.388 --> 02:26:52.150]  That's according to my sources.
[02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:53.852]  Just to be clear, Alex, you didn't say that.
[02:26:53.852 --> 02:27:03.582]  My sources, the police sources, who were at the periphery of the Wiener... It's the Clintons in New York, not what's going on at Ping Pong Pizza.
[02:27:04.318 --> 02:27:06.540]  Oh, right, right.
[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:08.662]  They're at the epicenter of all of this.
[02:27:08.662 --> 02:27:11.365]  Everything else is at the periphery or in its orbit.
[02:27:11.365 --> 02:27:27.601]  And back to what you were saying earlier, what better way, by the way, to invoke a censorship of the real news than to create a situation or to cause public outrage, to have somebody go up, perhaps, or to have something, well, what happened yesterday.
[02:27:28.161 --> 02:27:38.710]  What better way to cause or create a situation of censorship than to... And you've got pedophiles from the Catholic Church to Penn State, all over the world, on their heels right now as this stuff comes out.
[02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:43.374]  That then can turn it all, by going after red herring, turn them all into pathetic little victims.
[02:27:43.894 --> 02:27:45.535]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:45.535 --> 02:27:54.180]  But, you know, going back to what my source said, look at what they found, the 650,000 emails on the computer.
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:59.343]  And that's, again, I want to remind everyone, that's why they took the router as well.
[02:27:59.343 --> 02:28:07.747]  They took the router from the Wiener residence as well for verification of some matters that relate to exactly what we're talking about.
[02:28:07.747 --> 02:28:11.630]  I'm not sure how far I can go out with that explanation except
[02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:13.811]  Except to say that.
[02:28:13.811 --> 02:28:33.785]  So, yeah, what was found on the electronic devices at the Wiener household, allegedly, as was told to me, including but not limited to the Clinton Foundation, this is where the focus is at, and it's larger than any pizza, Pizzagate, pizza shop, pizza person, pizza whatever.
[02:28:33.785 --> 02:28:35.867]  Really, that's, again, that's at the
[02:28:36.147 --> 02:28:44.238]  Let's be clear, the whole pizza thing came up originally because in the law enforcement annals, pizza sometimes uses a code word for different types of children.
[02:28:44.238 --> 02:28:50.506]  That doesn't mean if I had pizza last night, or they have fundraisers at a pizza place, that that's necessarily going on.
[02:28:50.506 --> 02:28:51.187]  Exactly.
[02:28:51.187 --> 02:28:51.768]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:52.228 --> 02:29:14.109]  And again, you know, this ties right into the 2016 Word of the Year, Oxford Dictionary, Post Truth, which is what they're trying to sell the American public on the fact that only the approved journalist sources of information, the Washington Post and those the Washington Post allows, really has the correct news.
[02:29:14.730 --> 02:29:34.548]  They're caught in a massive hoax about the election, they're caught in all the lies about wars, they're caught about all the other countless lies, about everything you can imagine, from Bisping and Olay to, you know, you name it, and then their answer is just say everything else is fake, shut down the independent new media because it's bigger than us, because, you know, they're hurting innocent people.
[02:29:34.548 --> 02:29:39.432]  Meanwhile, stop investigating pedophilia, it doesn't exist anywhere, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:29:39.432 --> 02:29:41.494]  I mean, I'm looking for CNN to come out and say the Catholic Church
[02:29:41.894 --> 02:29:45.760]  You know, I've never covered up sex abuse because that's basically what this is reached.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:48.945]  This is a PSYOP and we're going to defeat this PSYOP like all the rest.
[02:29:48.945 --> 02:29:49.366]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.366 --> 02:29:50.728]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.728 --> 02:29:53.272]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.272 --> 02:29:55.957]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.946 --> 02:30:01.527]  First Brexit, then Trump.
[02:30:01.527 --> 02:30:06.171]  Is Italy next for the West's, quote, populist movement, as The Guardian puts it?
[02:30:06.171 --> 02:30:12.015]  Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after losing a crucial reform referendum.
[02:30:12.015 --> 02:30:23.324]  A global political earthquake is underway where decidedly people are standing up in westernized nations and taking back their countries from rogue globalist, its latest victim, globalist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
[02:30:23.524 --> 02:30:30.946]  He was announced that he will resign after suffering a humiliating defeat in a referendum, throwing the country and the Eurozone into utter confusion.
[02:30:30.946 --> 02:30:34.007]  Now, he says that the experience of my government ends here.
[02:30:34.007 --> 02:30:41.669]  Renzi said in a televised address to The Nation yesterday that the results show his yes camp was well on track to losing the referendum.
[02:30:41.669 --> 02:30:45.310]  Now, as he quits, arguably Hollande and Merkel are next.
[02:30:45.310 --> 02:30:49.311]  This comes after MPs and Senators representing the Five Star Movement
[02:30:49.451 --> 02:30:56.536]  Launched by Beth A. Grillo, decided to get 4 million signatures they needed to take back their country and launch a referendum.
[02:30:56.536 --> 02:30:58.858]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.

[02:31:59.710 --> 02:32:02.351]  I want to tell you about a brand-new off-the-grid product.
[02:32:02.351 --> 02:32:04.511]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[02:32:04.511 --> 02:32:13.334]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[02:32:13.334 --> 02:32:15.854]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.

[02:32:29.899 --> 02:32:31.979]  I have never seen anything like this.

[02:33:07.770 --> 02:33:12.131]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:12.131 --> 02:33:17.833]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:18.853 --> 02:33:21.815]  Now, Sharif Silme is a lawyer.
[02:33:21.815 --> 02:33:23.696]  Got a long bio here.
[02:33:23.696 --> 02:33:27.679]  It's P-E-R-A-L-L-Y law.com.
[02:33:27.679 --> 02:33:31.601]  Twitter is twitter.com forward slash bayreef.
[02:33:31.601 --> 02:33:34.483]  And goes over his long bio here.
[02:33:34.483 --> 02:33:36.405]  I would mainly glean from this.
[02:33:37.605 --> 02:33:42.010]  Uh, that he's an immigration lawyer but also kind of a foreign intellectual properties lawyer or something.
[02:33:42.010 --> 02:33:53.161]  And we try to reach out to people when they're in a story, especially if we're in the story, and you've got Daily Beast, you've got BBC, you've got just that I've seen, Politico, a bunch of others.
[02:33:53.161 --> 02:33:54.302]  I've read several of them.
[02:33:55.243 --> 02:34:05.667]  Sitting here, quoting him, mainly, and it's also on his Twitter, that the big thing was saying Roger Stone, and then I saw another one, Paul Watson, another tweet, not his.
[02:34:05.667 --> 02:34:08.348]  Roger Stone said the word Pizzagate that I know of.
[02:34:08.348 --> 02:34:14.410]  But the point here is, is that this started, I guess, like three, four weeks ago, and people are saying, why aren't you covering this?
[02:34:14.410 --> 02:34:19.892]  So I go and look at it, and it's overall about the whole story of what's in the Podesta emails.
[02:34:19.892 --> 02:34:21.493]  I'm going to tell you, there's some creepy stuff in there.
[02:34:22.213 --> 02:34:22.393]  Yes.
[02:34:37.697 --> 02:34:40.239]  I'm sure innocuously with his wife and three kids.
[02:34:40.239 --> 02:34:41.820]  And in comes this guy, reportedly.
[02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:42.760]  So he was a witness.
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:44.241]  That's the real reason I want to get him on.
[02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:45.902]  I appreciate him coming on.
[02:34:45.902 --> 02:34:49.345]  Usually folks, if they're already mad at you or sensitive about you, they won't come on.
[02:34:49.345 --> 02:34:50.845]  Especially liberals.
[02:34:50.845 --> 02:34:52.827]  They just won't come on.
[02:34:52.827 --> 02:34:54.088]  I want people to come on.
[02:34:54.088 --> 02:34:56.929]  I want to be able to discuss this stuff with them.
[02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:59.571]  Because I want the truth to come out.
[02:34:59.571 --> 02:35:00.892]  I don't want to believe this stuff.
[02:35:00.892 --> 02:35:04.995]  But if you tune into CNN, they actually say that, oh, Jones is just making it up.
[02:35:04.995 --> 02:35:06.496]  There's stuff in the Podesta emails.
[02:35:06.496 --> 02:35:06.896]  Period.
[02:35:08.191 --> 02:35:11.533]  No, you've got serious people, serious law enforcement.
[02:35:11.533 --> 02:35:18.898]  I mean, there's emails in there, we can put some of them on screen, where it's like, we'll meet at the farmhouse and have the three children ready for entertainment in the hot tub.
[02:35:20.706 --> 02:35:26.768]  I mean, you can read thousands of these, and so then the internet just goes wild.
[02:35:26.768 --> 02:35:41.174]  But it's because of the crazy excesses, the Catholic Church, Penn State, all the things that have come out, all the pedophilia that's come out, Salon promoting pedophilia, incest being promoted in mainstream media, that the public begins to get hysterical.
[02:35:41.174 --> 02:35:43.255]  So there is a danger of a Salem Witch Trial here.
[02:35:43.255 --> 02:35:45.296]  The thing is, I'm not presiding over it.
[02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:48.478]  Alright, but look at Jimmy Savelle, look at the Royal Family.
[02:35:48.478 --> 02:35:52.742]  They now admit in the London Telegraph that it goes to the top of the government.
[02:35:52.742 --> 02:35:55.144]  And it's quote, national security now.
[02:35:55.144 --> 02:36:07.414]  Jimmy Savelle had the highest access to the Royal Family above MI6 and MI5 and they found torture chambers, dungeons, admissions of raping kids, dead kids.
[02:36:07.414 --> 02:36:10.917]  Okay, so, this is all going on, this is happening.
[02:36:12.424 --> 02:36:17.228]  And so absolutely, I don't want to walk into some pizza place and then the guy comes in with a gun.
[02:36:17.228 --> 02:36:20.451]  I'm very glad nothing happened to Sharif.
[02:36:20.451 --> 02:36:22.532]  So I want to let him now have his take on things.
[02:36:22.532 --> 02:36:35.903]  And while he's on with us for TV viewers, I'm going to put on screen major DC newspapers with the headlines about underage cowboy rings at the White House, Barney Frank running a cowboy ring out of his townhouse, C-SPAN clips.
[02:36:35.903 --> 02:36:37.945]  I've got CBS News clips.
[02:36:37.945 --> 02:36:40.206]  I've got the CIA finders documents.
[02:36:41.167 --> 02:36:42.668]  I've got everything.
[02:36:42.668 --> 02:36:45.291]  The UN doing it, it's just a worldwide epidemic.
[02:36:45.291 --> 02:36:51.956]  So what's happening here is, the implication by CNN is, it isn't happening period, anywhere.
[02:36:51.956 --> 02:36:54.439]  Nothing's happening anywhere.
[02:36:54.439 --> 02:36:57.841]  They say that, I'm literally just making up these Podesta emails.
[02:36:57.841 --> 02:36:58.082]  Okay?
[02:36:59.505 --> 02:37:00.765]  So, let's be clear.
[02:37:00.765 --> 02:37:02.846]  I'm not saying anything's going on at Ping Pong Pizza.
[02:37:02.846 --> 02:37:07.288]  The FBI and some of their manuals talks about pizza and pizza toppings being code words.
[02:37:07.288 --> 02:37:09.028]  Well, I ate pizza yesterday.
[02:37:09.028 --> 02:37:10.229]  Doesn't mean I'm involved in that.
[02:37:10.229 --> 02:37:15.310]  So, my issue here is, and I've been saying this for three weeks, is I've told my reporters, you know, everybody's obsessing on this.
[02:37:15.310 --> 02:37:16.230]  I guess it's a big story.
[02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:25.233]  Look at the other Podesta emails and real stuff, the paper play, the, you know, all the weird stuff that's going on, you know, people begging for jobs and offering money.
[02:37:25.233 --> 02:37:26.294]  That's what's serious.
[02:37:26.954 --> 02:37:30.137]  And then I get attacked and people say I'm covering up Pizzagate.
[02:37:30.137 --> 02:37:32.640]  No, I'm not covering up Pizzagate.
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.542]  Like, I put a video out yesterday that has all these downvotes.
[02:37:34.542 --> 02:37:35.443]  People say, how dare you?
[02:37:35.443 --> 02:37:36.204]  You sold out.
[02:37:36.204 --> 02:37:37.445]  On and on and on.
[02:37:37.445 --> 02:37:45.033]  No, ladies and gentlemen, you gotta be careful about stuff like this because, look, I'm one of the middle of the road guys and I'm being accused of being involved in it now.
[02:37:45.814 --> 02:37:46.675]  So, this is serious.
[02:37:46.675 --> 02:37:47.935]  We do not need violence.
[02:37:47.935 --> 02:37:50.577]  We do not need people marching into pizza places with guns.
[02:37:50.577 --> 02:37:52.338]  We need to investigate exactly what happened there.
[02:37:52.338 --> 02:37:54.879]  So, joining us is Sharif.
[02:37:54.879 --> 02:37:55.980]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:57.661]  Now, I've been ranting for five minutes.
[02:37:57.661 --> 02:38:00.403]  You've got the floor for five minutes here.
[02:38:00.403 --> 02:38:00.903]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:00.903 --> 02:38:01.824]  Thank you for having me.
[02:38:01.824 --> 02:38:04.445]  I appreciate it, Mr. Jones.
[02:38:04.445 --> 02:38:14.191]  And I want to start out because, like you said, I am joining you and I'm a man of my word and I do hold you responsible to some extent for the events that took place.
[02:38:14.838 --> 02:38:16.599]  And there's a good reason for that.
[02:38:16.599 --> 02:38:21.542]  You have been on the forefront of attacking Comet Ping Pong.
[02:38:21.542 --> 02:38:31.988]  All of a sudden, after the incident that went down yesterday, you're shifting your position somewhat and saying that the focus needs to be on other things and that Comet Ping Pong has nothing to do with it.
[02:38:31.988 --> 02:38:35.310]  But look, just go back to November 23rd.
[02:38:35.310 --> 02:38:42.655]  You posted something on your YouTube channel that said something is going on, Pizzagate, and you watched the video.
[02:38:43.155 --> 02:38:46.396]  A couple minutes into it, it's all about Comet Ping Pong.
[02:38:46.396 --> 02:39:01.901]  You're attacking hardworking people there, you know, people that are grinding for $14, $15, $13 an hour, you know, putting a target on their back by this innuendo and all this, you know, harsh talk.
[02:39:01.901 --> 02:39:03.842]  To be honest with you, let me tell you the first thing.
[02:39:03.842 --> 02:39:05.642]  I did not vote for Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:05.642 --> 02:39:07.383]  I do not support Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:07.383 --> 02:39:10.024]  I think Hillary Clinton is a criminal and a warmonger.
[02:39:10.604 --> 02:39:17.587]  And I would absolutely and totally reject her leadership of this country.
[02:39:17.587 --> 02:39:22.230]  And I likewise reject Donald Trump's leadership of this country.
[02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:33.275]  But when it comes down to targeting innocent people and putting a target on a small restaurant that has a staff that has people there that has customers.
[02:39:33.835 --> 02:39:36.917]  And spreading innuendo, spreading falsehoods.
[02:39:36.917 --> 02:39:38.057]  It's very dangerous.
[02:39:38.057 --> 02:39:40.078]  I don't need five minutes to tell you this.
[02:39:40.078 --> 02:39:56.987]  I just wanted to, you know, get my message out and look you face to face, not behind some Twitter, like hundreds of folks that subscribe to your messages and other people's messages have been attacking me for being a Muslim, attacking me for being a
[02:39:58.390 --> 02:39:59.271]  Well you have, you have...
[02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:23.335]  Mr. Jones, you have made statements regarding Muslim women forced to wear helmets and how we're... I agree.
[02:40:23.335 --> 02:40:29.780]  I don't think orthodox... I don't think orthodox Christianity extremely practices good.
[02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:34.163]  Muslims were brought on slave ships by Europeans to America.
[02:40:34.163 --> 02:40:36.245]  You can't tell us we have no business here.
[02:40:36.245 --> 02:40:37.225]  We're Muslims.
[02:40:37.225 --> 02:40:40.268]  We're just like the... Well, the Muslims weren't involved in slave trade now?
[02:40:41.363 --> 02:40:42.204]  Okay, hold on.
[02:40:42.204 --> 02:40:43.224]  Listen, let's be fair.
[02:40:43.224 --> 02:40:46.186]  I thought you were segwaying for me to pop in saying I don't need five minutes.
[02:40:46.186 --> 02:40:52.129]  Let me give you another minute or two to finish up with what you're saying, and I'll write some notes here, and then I won't interrupt you.
[02:40:52.129 --> 02:40:53.150]  Go ahead.
[02:40:53.150 --> 02:40:53.730]  No, go ahead.
[02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:54.331]  I'm done.
[02:40:54.331 --> 02:40:55.391]  I made my point.
[02:40:55.391 --> 02:41:06.778]  Okay, well, again, you were talking about people disparaging where you're from, and I said I haven't done that, and then you brought up the fact, you know, that I have said things about radical Wahhabism.
[02:41:06.778 --> 02:41:08.359]  Yeah, but you said I could talk.
[02:41:09.778 --> 02:41:12.562]  I didn't disparage, I didn't say that you disparaged where I came from.
[02:41:12.562 --> 02:41:17.829]  Well, what I mean, your counter was is that, you know, you've heard me say these terrible things generally about Muslims.
[02:41:17.829 --> 02:41:27.302]  What I was saying is the type of Muslims that are going into Syria and other areas funded by our government and murdering the Shiites and the Alawites and Christians and people in mass and throwing...
[02:41:28.123 --> 02:41:43.040]  You mentioned that Muslims are entering the United States, that they're ruining American culture, that Muslim immigrants are... So what you're mad about here, what you're mad about with me, saying what my position is, is that where I'm at about the Islamification of the United States.
[02:41:44.376 --> 02:41:45.878]  No, I'm not mad at you.
[02:41:45.878 --> 02:41:47.060]  I respect you, actually.
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:48.461]  I think you've done some great work.
[02:41:48.461 --> 02:41:59.455]  I respect the work you did to uncover the atrocities that take place in the Bohemian Grove and other disgusting things that the elite politicians in this country are engaged with.
[02:41:59.455 --> 02:42:02.118]  Okay, well then let me just say this then about your earlier allegation, okay?
[02:42:02.859 --> 02:42:24.174]  I can call Rob Deu in here right now, my news director, about me two weeks ago saying, I don't, I am sick and tired of the obsession on one thing, there is some weird stuff going on, I don't know if you've researched it, that this, I mean, you know, like, rock bands are there, they're like, yeah, we like, they have relationships with kids, yeah, I know, we'll talk about preferences and, you know, and then all the weird art, I mean, I don't know if you've seen the art, I'm not gonna even mention it here, there's some crazy stuff, okay?
[02:42:24.434 --> 02:42:26.555]  But let's just say it's weird liberal stuff, okay?
[02:42:26.555 --> 02:42:32.379]  And then the Podesta Brothers and the Washington Post saying, you know, we'll put naked pictures of teenagers on our walls.
[02:42:32.379 --> 02:42:33.660]  We call this radical art.
[02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:35.882]  And then the Washington Post pulls the article.
[02:42:35.882 --> 02:42:37.523]  But I'm not saying they're involved in anything.
[02:42:37.523 --> 02:42:39.304]  I'm sure Podesta's a wonderful person.
[02:42:39.304 --> 02:42:40.325]  I'm being sarcastic now.
[02:42:40.325 --> 02:42:41.526]  But expanding on this...
[02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:51.602]  We probably had 10 or more videos on this, and when I've talked about it, I say it looks really bad, but I'm not saying anything's going on.
[02:42:51.602 --> 02:42:58.203]  It needs to be investigated by law enforcement, and the same stuff you heard me say 10 minutes ago is my position.
[02:42:58.203 --> 02:43:00.904]  So what I'm doing is clarifying my position.
[02:43:00.904 --> 02:43:04.925]  Can you go see one of my reporters' videos and say it has a different, you know, angle on it?
[02:43:04.925 --> 02:43:09.786]  Reporting on the Reddit phenomenon and the censorship and the media saying it's all fake?
[02:43:10.286 --> 02:43:11.166]  Absolutely.
[02:43:11.166 --> 02:43:17.889]  But I'm saying in the compendium of our coverage, I will tell you, I don't know what's really going on at Ping Pong Pizza.
[02:43:17.889 --> 02:43:24.512]  I've reached out, and I intend to reach out again, and say I will come there and actually debunk this if it isn't true.
[02:43:24.512 --> 02:43:25.612]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[02:43:25.612 --> 02:43:28.674]  But I did not create this.
[02:43:28.674 --> 02:43:32.795]  We simply responded to one of the biggest stories on the internet and covered it from different angles.
[02:43:35.493 --> 02:43:43.177]  You took a story that's about John Podesta and his sick issues that he has and made it about Comet Ping-Pong.
[02:43:43.177 --> 02:43:45.257]  Comet Ping-Pong is not the issue.
[02:43:45.257 --> 02:43:51.080]  Comet Ping-Pong's a... You go there, you can have pizza... But here's the deal, the Podestas are connected to that.
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.820]  Here's the deal.
[02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:52.841]  No, no, no, here's the deal.
[02:43:52.841 --> 02:43:56.182]  They, listen, they're in a relationship with him.
[02:43:56.182 --> 02:43:58.784]  Is Guy Fiera a pedophile?
[02:43:58.784 --> 02:43:59.944]  I don't even know that particular name.
[02:43:59.944 --> 02:44:01.865]  What I'm trying to get through to you is you're not listening.
[02:44:03.132 --> 02:44:05.094]  All I'm saying is the place was on Food Network.
[02:44:05.094 --> 02:44:06.455]  It's a delicious pizzeria.
[02:44:06.455 --> 02:44:08.877]  Why are you attacking people that work hard?
[02:44:08.877 --> 02:44:11.018]  You're acting like you're talking to a jury here.
[02:44:11.018 --> 02:44:13.300]  I'm not even, I'm not attacking it.
[02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:21.106]  I've had reporters that have covered why it's being censored on Reddit and looking at why people believe this.
[02:44:21.106 --> 02:44:24.509]  I have hardly talked about Comet Ping Pong.
[02:44:24.509 --> 02:44:28.812]  So what I'm telling you is, I didn't change my stance after this.
[02:44:28.812 --> 02:44:32.255]  I told people here that, and I've said on the internet, I've said,
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:35.861]  Hashtag Pizzagate.
[02:44:35.861 --> 02:44:38.624]  That's not about Comet Ping Pong?
[02:44:38.624 --> 02:44:58.722]  No, the whole thing, the entire situation's turned into Pizzagate because law enforcement says that pizza toppings, from the beginning, before the term Pizzagate was out there, it was all about pizza toppings and pasta toppings and 60 plus dollars in delicious, 60 plus thousand dollars in delicious succulent hot dogs that Obama was going to be enjoying.
[02:44:59.977 --> 02:45:18.963]  Well, why don't you, why don't we focus on John Podesta, on Hillary Clinton, on the, uh, now you got your, your boy that you got into power, uh, appointing, uh, uh, Sessions, the most anti, uh, immigrant and anti-marijuana senator that is around as Attorney General.
[02:45:18.963 --> 02:45:22.444]  So you keep going back to my, to my politics, but let's go back here.
[02:45:22.444 --> 02:45:27.826]  Can I go to Saudi Arabia and even walk down the street, uh, with my wife not wearing a burqa?
[02:45:28.683 --> 02:45:31.784]  The Saudi government is a sick, filthy regime.
[02:45:31.784 --> 02:45:32.564]  Okay.
[02:45:32.564 --> 02:45:33.404]  Now, listen.
[02:45:33.404 --> 02:45:42.767]  I'm the guy, when I saw the balance the other way, that was against the Iraq war when it was unpopular, that talked about 9-11, having globalists involved in it, that did all those hard things.
[02:45:42.767 --> 02:45:44.728]  So I'm always really trying to be on the side of justice.
[02:45:44.728 --> 02:45:49.990]  Now I see massive... Is Donald Trump going to stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia?
[02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.830]  Why don't you ask him that?
[02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:51.890]  You got his ear.
[02:45:51.890 --> 02:45:53.971]  Is he going to stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia?
[02:45:54.670 --> 02:45:56.152]  So they can bomb all those countries?
[02:45:56.152 --> 02:45:57.694]  That's a good question.
[02:45:57.694 --> 02:46:00.698]  So they can support terrorists in Syria?
[02:46:00.698 --> 02:46:03.161]  So they can support terrorists that are undermining Iran?
[02:46:03.161 --> 02:46:05.163]  We can have a debate separately.
[02:46:08.154 --> 02:46:10.855]  Is your boy going to stop selling weapons in Saudi Arabia?
[02:46:10.855 --> 02:46:11.375]  Sure, sure.
[02:46:11.375 --> 02:46:17.218]  We can have a debate if you want to come on about Donald Trump and things he's doing, things he's up to, separately.
[02:46:17.218 --> 02:46:19.679]  But we keep going off into politics here.
[02:46:19.679 --> 02:46:21.259]  I'm truly trying to have a real discussion.
[02:46:21.259 --> 02:46:22.340]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:30.463]  Can you describe for TV viewers and radio listeners, sir, again, you were inside Comet Ping Pong Airstable, this reportedly happened, exactly what you witnessed?
[02:46:30.463 --> 02:46:33.124]  Because that's one reason I want to get you on.
[02:46:33.124 --> 02:46:37.146]  Okay, I was at the Ping Pong, you know, the Comet Ping Pong.
[02:46:37.765 --> 02:46:45.528]  It's about, you know, I think we were there earlier, probably around two o'clock and, you know, we sat towards the, there's three sections in the restaurant.
[02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:47.449]  There's the front table section.
[02:46:47.449 --> 02:46:51.950]  There's a middle section that has three ping pong tables, foosball table.
[02:46:51.950 --> 02:46:55.712]  And then there's a back section that's closed off at that time.
[02:46:55.712 --> 02:47:02.574]  And I believe that is where they have like private party or, you know, reserved area or a nightclub or something.
[02:47:02.574 --> 02:47:03.095]  I'm not sure.
[02:47:03.095 --> 02:47:04.175]  I've never been back there.
[02:47:04.850 --> 02:47:10.351]  Um, so basically we're, you know, uh, finished our meal and we're playing ping pong.
[02:47:10.351 --> 02:47:12.192]  I was playing ping pong with my wife.
[02:47:12.192 --> 02:47:24.535]  Um, and my kids were around me and, um, a person, a white male, uh, tall slender guy, uh, walked straight through.
[02:47:25.582 --> 02:47:27.222]  Uh, from the front.
[02:47:27.222 --> 02:47:34.384]  Um, and I had, he was, he was basically coming in, uh, you know, towards, I had my side to him.
[02:47:34.384 --> 02:47:38.785]  So I was facing, you know, my wife, obviously on the ping pong table.
[02:47:38.785 --> 02:47:45.567]  And so I seen him in my peripheral vision and he walked behind me to the, to the back room.
[02:47:45.567 --> 02:47:47.668]  Did you see him fire a shotgun?
[02:47:47.668 --> 02:47:49.168]  Cause they don't really give details of what he did.
[02:47:50.049 --> 02:47:53.352]  No, I did not see him fire a shotgun.
[02:47:53.352 --> 02:47:56.575]  We did see that he was concealing a weapon.
[02:47:56.575 --> 02:47:57.656]  I can confirm that.
[02:47:57.656 --> 02:48:00.679]  Sir, did you hear a shotgun blast?
[02:48:00.679 --> 02:48:02.761]  No, sir.
[02:48:02.761 --> 02:48:05.323]  See, the first reports I saw was he had a shotgun.
[02:48:05.323 --> 02:48:12.830]  Then they added, I guess in the Daily Beast and a few others, that politically he was firing a shotgun.
[02:48:12.830 --> 02:48:16.393]  My understanding is that he shot a lock.
[02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:20.996]  That was like a door to an office.
[02:48:20.996 --> 02:48:23.237]  But I, again, didn't hear the shot.
[02:48:23.237 --> 02:48:28.881]  He didn't engage with me or any other patrons in my presence.
[02:48:28.881 --> 02:48:35.825]  But we did see him and we did see, you know, that he was, you know... Sure, let me ask you this question.
[02:48:35.825 --> 02:48:39.007]  Had you heard about the whole controversy before you went there?
[02:48:39.007 --> 02:48:45.812]  Yeah, I heard about it actually on the Kojo Namde Show, which is an NPR radio program here in Washington.
[02:48:46.388 --> 02:48:49.633]  Okay, so you're there in D.C., you hear about it, but I mean, I'm sure you'd eaten there before.
[02:48:49.633 --> 02:48:51.536]  You said it was good pizza.
[02:48:51.536 --> 02:48:52.918]  Yeah, that was very good pizza.
[02:48:52.918 --> 02:48:54.960]  So you'd eaten there before?
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:56.382]  No, that was the first time I ate there.
[02:48:56.382 --> 02:48:58.485]  Okay, wow, that's kind of bad luck.
[02:48:58.485 --> 02:48:59.968]  Was the pizza good?
[02:48:59.968 --> 02:49:00.669]  Very good.
[02:49:00.669 --> 02:49:01.269]  Very delicious.
[02:49:02.074 --> 02:49:05.476]  And it is rated as a supposedly really good place.
[02:49:05.476 --> 02:49:08.979]  And they don't have a basement, so that's been out there on the web as well.
[02:49:08.979 --> 02:49:11.921]  All the weird stuff the Podestas are putting out.
[02:49:11.921 --> 02:49:17.885]  Have you seen some of the art and some of the stuff and talk in there that's been put out on Twitter and Facebook?
[02:49:18.562 --> 02:49:24.803]  A normal pizzeria, very normal, nice employees, very calm atmosphere.
[02:49:24.803 --> 02:49:27.264]  All the customers are very nice.
[02:49:27.264 --> 02:49:29.264]  There's no weirdness.
[02:49:29.264 --> 02:49:31.505]  I went there with my three kids.
[02:49:31.505 --> 02:49:33.465]  There's no pedophilia.
[02:49:33.465 --> 02:49:36.386]  You guys have the wrong place.
[02:49:36.386 --> 02:49:37.806]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:49:37.806 --> 02:49:39.247]  I don't have the wrong place.
[02:49:39.247 --> 02:49:41.247]  We didn't generate this.
[02:49:41.247 --> 02:49:42.627]  We didn't generate this.
[02:49:42.627 --> 02:49:44.668]  Hundreds of sites reported on it.
[02:49:46.408 --> 02:49:47.709]  Focus on the elites.
[02:49:47.709 --> 02:49:59.173]  Don't focus on putting a target somewhere where, you know, hard-working waiters and waitresses... You know, I think I ought to hire you to actually be our news editor.
[02:49:59.173 --> 02:50:02.314]  You can sit in here and tell people that, or any other place.
[02:50:02.314 --> 02:50:05.295]  My model is, don't ever attack little people.
[02:50:05.295 --> 02:50:07.956]  And that goes to kids, but it also goes to businesses.
[02:50:07.956 --> 02:50:11.678]  And when I looked at this, and the Podestas, and the fact that the Democrats were there,
[02:50:12.538 --> 02:50:14.158]  Clearly, I believe in the Podesta emails.
[02:50:14.158 --> 02:50:15.139]  There's code going on.
[02:50:15.139 --> 02:50:16.299]  I've talked to law enforcement.
[02:50:16.299 --> 02:50:16.919]  That's there.
[02:50:16.919 --> 02:50:19.660]  But then I said early on, but everybody talks about pizza.
[02:50:19.660 --> 02:50:21.860]  In fact, I'll be honest, I ate it twice yesterday, okay?
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:23.520]  Once at an airport, once when I got home.
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:25.581]  And so it's not fair to do that.
[02:50:25.581 --> 02:50:27.681]  There is some weird stuff going on with the Podestas.
[02:50:27.681 --> 02:50:28.742]  So I've tried to be clear.
[02:50:28.742 --> 02:50:35.543]  I can see where our reporters reporting on what everybody was saying about it could then look like we're the ones pushing it.
[02:50:35.543 --> 02:50:37.383]  That's why you're here.
[02:50:37.383 --> 02:50:38.504]  That's why you're here.
[02:50:38.504 --> 02:50:39.164]  That's why you're here.
[02:50:39.983 --> 02:50:46.847]  Mr. Jones, you have a video, November 23rd, where you attack the pizzeria.
[02:50:46.847 --> 02:50:48.529]  You've attacked it in the past.
[02:50:48.529 --> 02:50:49.949]  You've changed your team.
[02:50:49.949 --> 02:50:52.071]  I have?
[02:50:52.071 --> 02:50:54.572]  November 23rd, you have a video on your channel.
[02:50:54.572 --> 02:50:56.234]  Why don't you... Are you saying me?
[02:50:56.234 --> 02:50:59.075]  Are you saying one of my reporters or somebody else's video?
[02:50:59.075 --> 02:51:02.057]  It's Alex Jones' video.
[02:51:02.057 --> 02:51:04.279]  You're talking about my reporter, Jon Bowne.
[02:51:04.279 --> 02:51:05.419]  Pizzagate is real.
[02:51:05.419 --> 02:51:06.120]  Something's going on.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:06.660]  But what?
[02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:07.461]  When I say real,
[02:51:08.755 --> 02:51:16.163]  We expanded the whole report to the larger pedophilia going on in the world and that pizza is used as a code word.
[02:51:16.163 --> 02:51:18.045]  Sure, sure.
[02:51:18.045 --> 02:51:22.250]  Let's get Doug Hagman, who's a law enforcement liaison.
[02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:23.411]  Go ahead.
[02:51:23.411 --> 02:51:27.055]  If you could allow me one quick comment and then I'll turn it over.
[02:51:27.055 --> 02:51:30.179]  Why don't you make a clear statement out there
[02:51:30.615 --> 02:51:37.202]  Telling your listeners, telling your followers, hey guys, do not focus on Comet Ping Pong.
[02:51:37.202 --> 02:51:44.130]  We do not want to focus on a place where poor, normal people are sitting there working.
[02:51:44.130 --> 02:51:47.254]  I think, well let me just continue here because I'm trying to be fair in this conversation.
[02:51:48.473 --> 02:51:54.518]  I think because of the pedestals and the things that are in there, I think law enforcement should look into everything.
[02:51:54.518 --> 02:51:59.822]  I personally don't really think they're using a pizza place as a front for this and I do think it's been a distraction.
[02:51:59.822 --> 02:52:00.683]  You're shaking your head.
[02:52:00.683 --> 02:52:05.027]  It has nothing to do with what you've been describing or talking about.
[02:52:05.607 --> 02:52:15.411]  Sure, but I don't think it's fair to tell my listeners that they're the ones... Look, one time three cops got killed in Pittsburgh, and they blamed me for it, and it turned out it wasn't true.
[02:52:15.411 --> 02:52:30.917]  So my whole thing is, I don't think it's fair to lecture my audience as if they're the ones, you know, that are causing this to go on, when it's the corruption in government, the media covering up pedophilia, the government covering it up, and mainstream media lying about all these wars.
[02:52:30.917 --> 02:52:32.338]  People don't trust the system anymore.
[02:52:33.058 --> 02:52:39.829]  Do you think that there's a large portion of your audience base that believes there's a pedophilia ring going on at Comet Pizza?
[02:52:39.829 --> 02:52:40.951]  No, I do not believe that.
[02:52:40.951 --> 02:52:41.832]  I do not believe that at all.
[02:52:41.832 --> 02:52:43.795]  I don't think it's a large part of my audience.
[02:52:43.795 --> 02:52:44.857]  The Reddit community and...
[02:52:47.085 --> 02:52:58.848]  And Facebook and all that is its own group, and you can actually go find where three weeks ago, I was being criticized for not being, you know, pushing the whole Comet Ping Pong situation.
[02:52:58.848 --> 02:53:01.908]  Because I told my staff, I said, I don't know what's going on there.
[02:53:01.908 --> 02:53:05.849]  You know, they're connecting the pedestals and stuff, but this is too, you know, this is too over the top.
[02:53:05.849 --> 02:53:09.610]  You need... You're making videos attacking Comet Ping Pong.
[02:53:09.610 --> 02:53:10.630]  It has your name on it.
[02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:12.911]  November 23rd, Pizzagate is real.
[02:53:12.911 --> 02:53:14.511]  Yeah, you're not, you're not, you know.
[02:53:15.877 --> 02:53:17.178]  Let me get Doug in here.
[02:53:17.178 --> 02:53:17.919]  Let me get Doug in here.
[02:53:17.919 --> 02:53:19.060]  People should go watch the video.
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:20.681]  Hashtag Pizzagate.
[02:53:20.681 --> 02:53:21.122]  Hold on.
[02:53:21.122 --> 02:53:22.663]  Hashtag Pizzagate's not our hashtag.
[02:53:22.663 --> 02:53:26.346]  I don't know why you keep making statements that aren't true.
[02:53:26.346 --> 02:53:27.227]  Go ahead, Doug.
[02:53:27.227 --> 02:53:28.608]  November 23rd.
[02:53:28.608 --> 02:53:30.229]  I know there's a video, but you're...
[02:53:31.394 --> 02:53:32.374]  Go ahead, Doug.
[02:53:32.374 --> 02:53:34.355]  Sir, let me ask you a question, Counselor.
[02:53:34.355 --> 02:53:40.779]  You said that November 23rd you viewed a video that was on InfoWars' channel, just to be clear.
[02:53:40.779 --> 02:53:53.545]  I was just curious, so you knew about the controversy surrounding this location prior to your entry with your three children, 7, 9, and 12, yesterday, December 4th, is that correct?
[02:53:54.420 --> 02:53:57.382]  I watched the video half an hour ago before coming on this program.
[02:53:57.382 --> 02:53:59.504]  It's dated, it was uploaded November 23rd.
[02:53:59.504 --> 02:54:10.391]  Alright, but nonetheless, you knew about the controversy that was stirring on the internet prior to your visit to the pizza shop yesterday, is that right?
[02:54:10.391 --> 02:54:15.755]  I heard the discussion about the controversy on the Kojo Namdi Show.
[02:54:16.543 --> 02:54:21.324]  In the context of potential alleged pedophilia, right?
[02:54:21.324 --> 02:54:33.328]  So, I'm just curious, did you go there because you were curious, or did you go there because you had always wanted to go there having never been there before and wanted to taste their pizza?
[02:54:33.328 --> 02:54:44.411]  No, I went there because I heard it has good pizza, that it has ping pong tables, that it's a fun place to be there as a community place with your family, and that's what I found!
[02:54:44.815 --> 02:54:50.161]  I went there and there are normal, nice, wholesome people playing.
[02:54:50.161 --> 02:54:51.162]  How long were you there, sir?
[02:54:51.162 --> 02:54:55.527]  How long were you there before you had to leave because of the incident with the gun?
[02:54:55.527 --> 02:54:56.989]  We were having a blast.
[02:54:56.989 --> 02:55:00.052]  I mean, how long were you there before the incident with the gun, before you had to leave?
[02:55:00.052 --> 02:55:01.614]  Probably an hour.
[02:55:02.529 --> 02:55:11.214]  Okay, so you made the entire determination in 60 minutes that it was a wholesome, it is a wholesome place, that there's nothing at all untoward going on there.
[02:55:11.214 --> 02:55:12.375]  Now, I'm not saying there is.
[02:55:12.375 --> 02:55:21.720]  I'm just asking you if you made that determination as a lawyer, an officer of the court, that, hey, there's absolutely nothing going on here whatsoever.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.782]  There's no artwork on the walls that's, you know... There is nothing.
[02:55:24.782 --> 02:55:25.882]  There is nothing.
[02:55:27.777 --> 02:55:30.439]  So you went through the entire facility?
[02:55:30.439 --> 02:55:31.199]  I'm asking a question.
[02:55:31.199 --> 02:55:32.740]  Sir, I'm asking a question.
[02:55:51.423 --> 02:55:52.805]  Sharif, it happened to fall today.
[02:55:52.805 --> 02:56:06.460]  I am being totally open here and totally nice and it's on record that the people that created the whole thing was the internet and Reddit and Facebook and then you're here just doggedly challenging.
[02:56:06.460 --> 02:56:08.222]  I'm not scared of this whole issue.
[02:56:08.222 --> 02:56:11.325]  The point is that I'm here covering the reality of it.
[02:56:12.106 --> 02:56:16.150]  And so that's why I have you here as someone's perspective on that.
[02:56:16.150 --> 02:56:19.512]  And all I'm hearing about is the, you know, Palestinian issue or this issue.
[02:56:19.512 --> 02:56:26.018]  And it just seems like you have an overall issue with this broadcast and my politics and Donald Trump.
[02:56:26.018 --> 02:56:27.879]  I didn't discuss the Palestinian issue.
[02:56:27.879 --> 02:56:29.921]  I mentioned I'm Palestinian.
[02:56:29.921 --> 02:56:36.507]  Well, you mentioned you're Palestinian and, you know, the way I frame Muslims and immigration.
[02:56:36.507 --> 02:56:37.648]  The way you attack Muslims?
[02:56:38.342 --> 02:56:38.742]  Yeah.
[02:56:38.742 --> 02:56:39.843]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:56:39.843 --> 02:56:40.583]  Here's the deal.
[02:56:40.583 --> 02:56:48.286]  We shouldn't have to conform, and this is happening more and more in the U.S., to extreme versions of Islam and Sharia stuff being pushed.
[02:56:48.286 --> 02:56:51.287]  And, you know, only Christmas trees have to come down.
[02:56:51.287 --> 02:56:52.587]  Everything else can be promoted.
[02:56:52.587 --> 02:56:55.809]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not singling Muslims out on that front.
[02:56:55.809 --> 02:57:01.631]  I think the left is using Islam to a great extent as a battering ram to get a lot of things done at once, and I'm against that.
[02:57:02.622 --> 02:57:15.310]  You're using Islam to scare people into feeling prejudiced and saying, look, you might have problems at home, but your problems are Muslims, your problem is Islam, your problem is brown people.
[02:57:15.310 --> 02:57:16.110]  This is the problem.
[02:57:16.110 --> 02:57:18.912]  That's not the message you should be sending to your listeners, my friend.
[02:57:19.392 --> 02:57:23.836]  Well, I just think you're angry at us for our politics or your view of our politics.
[02:57:23.836 --> 02:57:24.277]  I'm not angry.
[02:57:24.277 --> 02:57:24.737]  I'm not angry.
[02:57:24.737 --> 02:57:27.620]  I told you I respect some of your work.
[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:37.949]  One of my favorite things I've ever watched in my life was when you confronted David Gergen or whatever his name is, the guy that's served in every administration since Jimmy Carter about the rituals.
[02:57:37.949 --> 02:57:38.630]  About the rituals.
[02:57:39.414 --> 02:57:46.740]  Yeah, and yeah, I won't be surprised if he serves in the Trump administration, just like Trump is, you know, using the same elite political class.
[02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:49.362]  You're trying to score points politically again.
[02:57:49.362 --> 02:57:53.786]  I'm trying to have a real discussion with you about ping pong.
[02:57:53.786 --> 02:58:00.391]  And I wanted to really get your perspective on this and see where you're coming from on the whole situation, okay?
[02:58:00.391 --> 02:58:02.413]  We've reported on what people are saying about it.
[02:58:02.953 --> 02:58:06.758]  I'm here telling you that I think a lot of it's overblown and out of control.
[02:58:06.758 --> 02:58:11.184]  You want me to sit here and just say, I don't think there should be any investigation, period.
[02:58:11.184 --> 02:58:14.649]  I think all the WikiLeaks should be investigated, but I do think focusing
[02:58:15.931 --> 02:58:16.672]  Leave the employees alone.
[02:58:16.672 --> 02:58:18.753]  Leave the customers alone.
[02:58:18.753 --> 02:58:19.654]  Leave the employees alone.
[02:58:19.654 --> 02:58:20.074]  Leave them alone.
[02:58:46.091 --> 02:58:49.854]  This whole thing, like trying to tie it together to the pedophile stuff.
[02:58:49.854 --> 02:58:51.815]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:58:51.815 --> 02:58:53.136]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:53.136 --> 02:58:54.357]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:54.357 --> 02:58:59.640]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:13.190]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:14.551]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:59:15.311 --> 02:59:16.952]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:59:16.952 --> 02:59:19.534]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:19.534 --> 02:59:20.835]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:20.835 --> 02:59:21.935]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:59:21.935 --> 02:59:23.276]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:23.276 --> 02:59:27.779]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:27.779 --> 02:59:30.941]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:31.001 --> 02:59:34.103]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:34.103 --> 02:59:35.164]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:37.106]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:37.106 --> 02:59:38.126]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:59:38.126 --> 02:59:40.808]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:40.808 --> 02:59:44.091]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:44.091 --> 02:59:46.333]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:46.333 --> 02:59:52.397]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:52.397 --> 02:59:55.039]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.687 --> 03:00:11.309]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:11.309 --> 03:00:13.230]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.230 --> 03:00:17.711]  Sharif Shelmy is a lawyer in DC.
[03:00:17.711 --> 03:00:24.614]  We just happened to go over to Comet Pizza yesterday and witnessed this guy come in with a gun.
[03:00:25.828 --> 03:00:29.750]  We're glad that, uh, he and everybody else that works there weren't hurt.
[03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:39.916]  You know, it was funny, one of his tweets, as long as I tweeted it this morning, I went and checked it, it was like, you know, you're responsible partially for this, just like mainstream media is for lying about WMD in Iraq.
[03:00:39.916 --> 03:00:48.301]  I'm not even one-tenth as connected as the mainstream media lying about Yellow Cake, lying about nuclear reactors, saying Saddam was behind it when he was challenging Saudi Arabia.
[03:00:48.301 --> 03:00:50.282]  Total, total bull!
[03:00:50.282 --> 03:00:53.944]  But, I mean, I agree with the statement about the Iraq war being a fraud.
[03:00:56.277 --> 03:01:00.239]  But then, the Democrats were involved as well, and I know he'll second that.
[03:01:00.239 --> 03:01:05.521]  It's just, my issue here is, old media wants to censor new media.
[03:01:05.521 --> 03:01:07.002]  So they seize on these type of things.
[03:01:07.002 --> 03:01:13.605]  This is really a lesson just to new media, and everybody else for that matter, about how things are going to be spun, how they're going to be twisted, and how we've got to be better.
[03:01:14.145 --> 03:01:14.545]  I'd love to.
[03:01:14.545 --> 03:01:20.269]  I think you've got it all wrong about Islam, and it's something that I think you can change your opinion on, I hope.
[03:01:37.521 --> 03:01:43.664]  With regard to ping-pong, you know, I would just say again that, look, take the target off comment ping-pong.
[03:01:43.664 --> 03:01:45.065]  Those guys are good people.
[03:01:45.065 --> 03:01:46.326]  They're employees there.
[03:01:46.326 --> 03:01:49.327]  Yeah, there shouldn't be a target there because we don't know what's really going on.
[03:01:49.327 --> 03:01:51.408]  And quite frankly, I don't think a bunch of this stuff's happening.
[03:01:51.408 --> 03:01:52.369]  And I've said that for weeks.
[03:01:52.369 --> 03:01:54.890]  You can take other reports, people that disagree with me.
[03:01:54.890 --> 03:01:57.051]  I'm telling you what I've been saying for two, three weeks.
[03:01:57.051 --> 03:01:58.292]  It's not like I'm saying this now.
[03:02:00.093 --> 03:02:00.913]  Yes, yes.
[03:02:00.913 --> 03:02:09.998]  Take the target off that and put it on Podesta, put it on Lolita Island, put it on whatever happened to Penn State.
[03:02:09.998 --> 03:02:11.118]  Stand by your word.
[03:02:11.118 --> 03:02:13.559]  Stop using hashtag Pizzagate.
[03:02:13.559 --> 03:02:18.602]  Stop showing comment ping pong in your videos like you did the November 23rd video.
[03:02:19.142 --> 03:02:29.509]  And put the focus on John Podesta, put the focus on Hillary Clinton, put the focus on political elites that are actually hungry for power and are trying to manipulate situations.
[03:02:29.509 --> 03:02:30.930]  Let's be clear.
[03:02:30.930 --> 03:02:34.692]  110% Sharif, that is my motto, is nebulous.
[03:02:34.692 --> 03:02:37.074]  People seem to love stories of some nebulous whodunit.
[03:02:37.574 --> 03:02:39.875]  You know, with these characters, we don't even know who they are.
[03:02:39.875 --> 03:02:44.618]  I know with Podesta and the Clintons, there's real evidence there of Clinton on this plane.
[03:02:44.618 --> 03:02:46.579]  So, you're actually speaking with the choir here.
[03:02:46.579 --> 03:02:48.740]  The thing is, the media makes it so big.
[03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:55.383]  Seen another three weeks ago, focused on this area of Reddit, blowing it up, and then people are asking me, why aren't you covering it?
[03:02:55.383 --> 03:02:59.825]  So then my reporters go report on it, and some of it's pretty darn scary, man.
[03:02:59.825 --> 03:03:01.666]  Have you seen that artwork?
[03:03:01.666 --> 03:03:03.167]  And you don't think that's an issue?
[03:03:04.423 --> 03:03:08.325]  If they're having a private party and put up whatever artwork they put up, it's not my business.
[03:03:08.325 --> 03:03:10.367]  When I went in there, I didn't see any artwork.
[03:03:10.367 --> 03:03:12.948]  All I seen was ping-pong tables and some delicious pizza.
[03:03:12.948 --> 03:03:17.011]  Well, listen, I looked it up weeks ago and they admitted it's gourmet pizza.
[03:03:17.011 --> 03:03:19.412]  The point is... Guy Fieri was there.
[03:03:19.412 --> 03:03:20.393]  Food Network.
[03:03:20.393 --> 03:03:26.277]  They didn't... I mean, the place is... Well, let's be clear, we're not saying they're involved in anything either.
[03:03:26.277 --> 03:03:27.197]  Not doing it.
[03:03:27.197 --> 03:03:29.599]  My problem is this, and I'm glad you came on.
[03:03:30.481 --> 03:03:34.353]  Because you put me in the middle of this, and the people are going to come out of the woodwork against you.
[03:03:34.353 --> 03:03:35.396]  That is not me.
[03:03:35.396 --> 03:03:36.940]  So I'm glad we're having a friendly discussion.
[03:03:38.321 --> 03:03:39.242]  No, no.
[03:03:39.242 --> 03:03:48.308]  It was in the news, targeted by Reddit and Facebook.
[03:03:48.308 --> 03:03:48.968]  We covered it.
[03:03:48.968 --> 03:03:49.929]  I keep explaining that to you.
[03:03:49.929 --> 03:03:52.150]  And I love how you don't ever agree with me.
[03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:54.872]  I'm like, you're very gracious, very open, very real.
[03:03:54.872 --> 03:03:55.572]  It's what I do.
[03:03:55.572 --> 03:03:56.593]  It's like the David Duke interview.
[03:03:56.593 --> 03:03:58.454]  I'm not pretending you know him.
[03:03:58.454 --> 03:04:01.096]  But I mean, I had to try to have a real discussion, not so much a debate.
[03:04:01.576 --> 03:04:02.736]  And actually, let the guy talk.
[03:04:02.736 --> 03:04:08.418]  He ran over me, tried to score points, and people said, oh, you know, David Duke ran over Alex Jones.
[03:04:08.418 --> 03:04:10.098]  I'm not really having a debate with you.
[03:04:10.098 --> 03:04:13.099]  I'm trying to really talk to you.
[03:04:13.099 --> 03:04:14.159]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:14.159 --> 03:04:19.280]  Well, listen, you want to come back on sometime about the Middle East in general and have a discussion about it?
[03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:20.540]  I would love to.
[03:04:20.540 --> 03:04:22.981]  We need to stop supporting the Israeli military.
[03:04:22.981 --> 03:04:28.582]  We need to focus on America and not send weapons to Saudis and to other terrorist countries.
[03:04:29.936 --> 03:04:36.800]  All I know is I'm against supporting the Saudis, and I've been neutral on the Israel issue, so I get accused of being working for Israel, or that I'm anti-Semitic.
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:38.401]  It's all just crazy, and that's part of the Internet.
[03:04:38.401 --> 03:04:39.762]  That's why we've all got to be careful.
[03:04:39.762 --> 03:04:42.084]  And so I appreciate you coming on with us.
[03:04:42.084 --> 03:04:47.587]  We'll obviously talk to you again soon, then, if you want to have a discussion about Islam and the West and everything else.
[03:04:47.587 --> 03:04:49.248]  Thanks for talking to us.
[03:04:49.248 --> 03:04:49.528]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:49.528 --> 03:04:49.748]  Thank you.
[03:04:49.748 --> 03:04:52.650]  All right, we're going to come back in a few minutes with Doug Hagman to finish up.
[03:04:52.650 --> 03:04:58.814]  I'm going to hand the baton to Owen Schroyer, who has got a ton of news to cover.
[03:04:58.814 --> 03:04:59.154]  Stay with us.
[03:04:59.898 --> 03:05:11.149]  Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice just slapped Colorado's largest Sheriff's Department last month with a $10,000 fine and ordered them to take steps to correct their discriminatory hiring practices.
[03:05:11.149 --> 03:05:13.491]  The illegal act the Sheriff's Department committed, you ask?
[03:05:13.491 --> 03:05:14.753]  Well, they hired only U.S.
[03:05:14.753 --> 03:05:15.133]  citizens.
[03:05:15.273 --> 03:05:19.834]  Now, in a summary of the settlement on the DOJ's website, they said that insisting on U.S.
[03:05:19.834 --> 03:05:27.175]  citizenship violates an anti-discrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that forbids employers from hiring only U.S.
[03:05:27.175 --> 03:05:29.896]  citizens, except in cases where it's mandated by law.
[03:05:29.896 --> 03:05:35.377]  Now, the Denver Sheriff's Department maintains that it's committed to treating all people fairly with dignity and respect.
[03:05:35.377 --> 03:05:39.058]  They're, of course, cleaning up their practices now, and they vowed not to do it again.
[03:05:39.278 --> 03:05:45.003]  More than 40 states have rules in place keeping law enforcement agencies from hiring non-citizens.
[03:05:45.003 --> 03:05:55.914]  Only Colorado, Louisiana, Maine, and Vermont, as well as West Virginia, have no such statewide restriction, which means that Colorado is a target for the DOJ if they continue to hire only U.S.
[03:05:55.914 --> 03:05:56.594]  citizens.
[03:05:56.594 --> 03:05:58.957]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:05:59.770 --> 03:06:02.913]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:02.913 --> 03:06:06.997]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:06.997 --> 03:06:09.660]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[03:06:09.660 --> 03:06:12.502]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[03:06:12.502 --> 03:06:17.688]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:18.228 --> 03:06:24.436]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:24.436 --> 03:06:30.724]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:30.724 --> 03:06:33.287]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:33.647 --> 03:06:34.828]  We're the solution.
[03:06:34.828 --> 03:06:35.748]  Americans.
[03:06:35.748 --> 03:06:37.309]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:42.712]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:42.712 --> 03:06:44.533]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:06:44.533 --> 03:06:45.973]  DVDs now available.
[03:06:45.973 --> 03:06:49.875]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:49.875 --> 03:06:52.697]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[03:06:52.697 --> 03:06:55.478]  Americans need to see this film.
[03:06:55.478 --> 03:06:58.139]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[03:06:58.139 --> 03:06:59.020]  Let's fix it.
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:06.086]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:07:06.086 --> 03:07:18.856]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:07:19.056 --> 03:07:22.717]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:07:22.717 --> 03:07:29.699]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:07:29.699 --> 03:07:42.583]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:42.583 --> 03:07:44.123]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:44.423 --> 03:07:50.807]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:07:50.807 --> 03:07:55.770]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:07:55.770 --> 03:07:56.130]  Big Brother.
[03:08:13.450 --> 03:08:14.571]  Big Brother.
[03:08:14.571 --> 03:08:16.371]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:16.371 --> 03:08:18.292]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:18.292 --> 03:08:19.973]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:19.973 --> 03:08:21.634]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:21.634 --> 03:08:26.136]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.137 --> 03:08:31.619]  Alright, Doug Hagman's our guest, and I wish I had all his law enforcement training.
[03:08:31.619 --> 03:08:36.382]  He trains police, state police, FBI, you name it, around the country in his special investigations.
[03:08:36.382 --> 03:08:38.903]  I just love all the cop questions he was asking that lawyer.
[03:08:38.903 --> 03:08:40.684]  Let's be 100% clear.
[03:08:40.684 --> 03:08:49.769]  I've been the victim of the internet, especially the white supremacists, why I don't know, making up the most outlandish, crazy stuff you can imagine.
[03:08:51.598 --> 03:08:56.082]  And then I have mainstream media claiming I'm a white nationalist and you hate all the minorities.
[03:08:56.082 --> 03:09:01.707]  And I have experienced people online saying that I'm somebody I'm not and that I abuse kids.
[03:09:01.707 --> 03:09:03.889]  I mean, I've experienced, you name it, it's gone on.
[03:09:05.526 --> 03:09:12.187]  And I've learned that it just is made up BS so it doesn't matter, so it goes off my back like water off a duck's back.
[03:09:12.187 --> 03:09:17.608]  It destroyed careers of people that were overall, I think, innocent of what was being alleged.
[03:09:17.608 --> 03:09:22.189]  Other big talk show hosts that'll go unnamed, everybody knows about, used to be on overnight.
[03:09:22.189 --> 03:09:26.190]  So I'm acutely aware of this.
[03:09:26.190 --> 03:09:32.451]  But I gotta tell you, my brain has been basically abused.
[03:09:32.451 --> 03:09:33.511]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:42.397]  In college, one of the jokes 20 years ago, or 23 years ago, was somebody tell you some really dirty term for some weird sexual thing you never heard of.
[03:09:42.397 --> 03:09:45.240]  And I just told people, I don't want to know all these terms.
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:54.848]  And people nowadays will say a term to me sometimes, you know, you're out with some guys, or people are visiting, or you're protesting on the street somewhere, and somebody will say some horrible vulgar thing to me, and I'm like, what is that?
[03:09:54.848 --> 03:09:56.790]  They're like, you don't know what that is.
[03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:57.151]  I'm like, no.
[03:09:58.897 --> 03:10:05.202]  Reading the Podesta emails, and I looked at, I don't want to exaggerate, I had hundreds of them shown to me by the staff.
[03:10:05.202 --> 03:10:08.545]  I looked at hundreds and hundreds myself.
[03:10:08.545 --> 03:10:11.368]  I've looked at thousands of emails, total.
[03:10:11.368 --> 03:10:17.753]  Hundreds and hundreds on the code word stuff, and it's code word.
[03:10:17.753 --> 03:10:19.895]  You know, how fresh is the walnut sauce?
[03:10:19.895 --> 03:10:21.336]  I want to put it on my pizza.
[03:10:21.336 --> 03:10:23.578]  Oh, these are the best hot dogs, they're so succulent.
[03:10:23.578 --> 03:10:24.659]  Obama wants $62,000 worth of them.
[03:10:27.878 --> 03:10:28.599]  Where's the president?
[03:10:28.599 --> 03:10:30.640]  He's at a hot dog party.
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:31.100]  You know.
[03:10:31.100 --> 03:10:32.741]  Oh, there's a pizza party.
[03:10:32.741 --> 03:10:34.843]  And so that's what's going on with the cosmology.
[03:10:34.843 --> 03:10:36.424]  That's where all the pizza stuff comes from.
[03:10:36.424 --> 03:10:42.428]  Everybody kind of sees pizza over here with this ping pong pizza.
[03:10:42.428 --> 03:10:46.090]  But the reason I raise it is I don't know what's going on.
[03:10:46.090 --> 03:10:47.391]  It's a law enforcement issue.
[03:10:47.391 --> 03:10:51.714]  I will tell citizens we never put a target on their back.
[03:10:51.714 --> 03:10:55.717]  But if there is one, take it off their back because it's a diversion from everything else that's happening.
[03:10:55.717 --> 03:10:56.978]  And the staff and crew and people
[03:10:58.868 --> 03:11:01.510]  You know, need to be left alone.
[03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:03.772]  That just goes to say.
[03:11:03.772 --> 03:11:07.114]  I don't say that because that fellow was asking me to say that earlier.
[03:11:07.114 --> 03:11:08.455]  Because I know what the mainstream media will do.
[03:11:08.455 --> 03:11:13.739]  It'll be like, Jones backs off his ping pong pizza fake news myth.
[03:11:13.739 --> 03:11:14.680]  No, I never said it.
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:23.126]  It's like, Jones backs off saying Obama sent the tornado five years ago to Oklahoma City.
[03:11:23.126 --> 03:11:23.907]  I never said that.
[03:11:23.907 --> 03:11:25.608]  A lady said, could this be a weather weapon?
[03:11:25.608 --> 03:11:28.190]  I said, they have weather weapons, ma'am, but this probably wasn't one of them.
[03:11:29.639 --> 03:11:33.322]  So I cover this, not because their disinfo hurts us.
[03:11:33.322 --> 03:11:41.369]  I cover all of this because we need to expose the fake corporate news.
[03:11:41.369 --> 03:11:43.590]  And I gotta tell you, Doug Hagman is such a smart guy.
[03:11:43.590 --> 03:11:45.272]  He crystallized it so much better than I could.
[03:11:45.272 --> 03:11:48.735]  In 30 seconds he said, last hour, if you just joined us, he said, Alex,
[03:11:50.276 --> 03:11:57.842]  It's about the fake news narrative, and it's about saying all the pedophilia, all the stuff going on in the world, all the Podesta emails are basically fake.
[03:11:57.842 --> 03:12:03.045]  And I was thinking, that's what the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of them are saying now.
[03:12:03.045 --> 03:12:08.229]  Alex Jones says Hillary and Podesta are torturing kids at this pizza place.
[03:12:08.229 --> 03:12:09.230]  I never said that.
[03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:10.211]  My crew never said that.
[03:12:10.911 --> 03:12:34.254]  But see, that turns the whole Podesta thing, and the Lolita Express, and the underage cowboys at the White House, and all the stuff that's been in mainstream newspapers, including CBS News, CBS turns it all around today and says, I'm putting out fake news on this and a bunch of other stuff, when I've got CBS News in the 80s reporting on exactly what we're talking about.
[03:12:35.305 --> 03:12:38.026]  So see, they still think the public's dumb.
[03:12:38.026 --> 03:12:41.367]  They just think the public bought into what we were saying, whether it was true or not.
[03:12:41.367 --> 03:12:43.128]  And that's how they lost the election.
[03:12:43.128 --> 03:12:47.350]  So they're now going to try their own hand at just pure disinformation.
[03:12:47.350 --> 03:12:50.071]  That's not why you lost, folks.
[03:12:50.071 --> 03:12:53.832]  You lost because you've been discredited and you're seen as the power structure.
[03:12:53.832 --> 03:12:55.973]  And it's happening all over the world.
[03:12:55.973 --> 03:13:00.215]  So trying to censor the press and create this precedent to do it is not going to work.
[03:13:05.063 --> 03:13:09.520]  Now notice, we don't have... This is very skillful from the establishment.
[03:13:12.745 --> 03:13:19.470]  In the media, three weeks ago, focusing on the mom and pop shop, then everybody starts focusing on that as it becomes a trending term.
[03:13:19.470 --> 03:13:29.879]  LittleBittyArea mentioned, hey, look, Podesta goes to this thing called Ping Pong Pizza and this other pizza place, and it's connected into Homeland Security, and look, they go and they have fundraisers there, and look, the FBI talks about pizza.
[03:13:29.879 --> 03:13:36.244]  The FBI talks about pizza being a code word, not a pizza place, but people connected those dots, whether they're accurate or not,
[03:13:38.433 --> 03:13:46.438]  And then, it builds their crescendo, we cover it as it hits this big wave, we show the Google Analytics, we cover it and say, we don't know what's going on, but here's what people say.
[03:13:46.438 --> 03:13:50.140]  Then it turns into their real target, Infowars.com.
[03:13:50.140 --> 03:13:56.144]  And then people with other political motives, who don't like people like Trump, then it becomes connected to that, you see.
[03:13:56.144 --> 03:14:04.609]  It's interesting though, three different lawsuits filed claiming Trump raped teenage girls, all with fake names, all with fake people, all dropped.
[03:14:06.820 --> 03:14:15.367]  Before they ever went to trial, just to put the headline out, Trump raped girls with Jeffrey Epstein because they know that it was Clinton really on the airplane with him doing it.
[03:14:15.367 --> 03:14:23.193]  They were scared of Trump bringing that out, so they brought out their false claim first in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, in Vanity Fair, in hundreds of other publications.
[03:14:23.193 --> 03:14:35.342]  But it's okay when the mainstream media actually reports on fake lawsuits three times with fake names saying Donald Trump raped little girls and showing how they grabbed them at bus stops to take them to Donald Trump.
[03:14:35.342 --> 03:14:36.083]  Totally made up!
[03:14:36.243 --> 03:14:38.144]  But where are the Crocodile Tears there?
[03:14:38.144 --> 03:14:40.606]  We're on a break in four minutes.
[03:14:40.606 --> 03:14:43.208]  I'm going to hand the baton to Owen Troyer coming up.
[03:14:43.208 --> 03:14:45.009]  But Doug, thanks for riding shotgun with us.
[03:14:45.009 --> 03:14:46.670]  You made great points today.
[03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:48.171]  What'd you make of that fella earlier?
[03:14:48.171 --> 03:14:50.493]  You know, he admitted a lot of real things are going on.
[03:14:50.493 --> 03:14:57.817]  And he said he listened to the show for a long time and he knew there were real pedophile rings, but didn't leave comic ping pong alone.
[03:14:57.817 --> 03:15:01.520]  I mean, that's kind of sounded reasonable, but I'm not attacking comic ping pong.
[03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:05.723]  And he was talking to a jury like he wasn't going to ever acquiesce to that fact.
[03:15:06.303 --> 03:15:10.766]  And then I do find it weird, though, that, you know, he just magically is in there, but that's how coincidences work.
[03:15:10.766 --> 03:15:15.110]  Well, yeah, I mean, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, actually.
[03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:34.104]  However, you know, Alex, I'm not sure, I wasn't privy to what happened at the pizza shop where the shots fired, but regardless, if I was in a business, sitting in there having dinner with my three children, seven, nine, and twelve, my wife, perhaps, or just my children, me and my children, if that was me,
[03:15:35.605 --> 03:15:37.707]  I'm not sure I would be.
[03:15:37.707 --> 03:15:39.588]  Well, I just find it very curious.
[03:15:39.588 --> 03:15:57.142]  In my professional opinion, I find it very curious that the guest appeared to be more interested in rehabilitating or defending the reputation of that facility as opposed to describing the harrowing situation that he witnessed or was a part of.
[03:15:57.142 --> 03:15:59.003]  That's just my own feeling.
[03:15:59.003 --> 03:16:00.344]  And he didn't hear the gun go off.
[03:16:00.344 --> 03:16:01.165]  Well, here's what's crazy.
[03:16:02.742 --> 03:16:04.403]  No one at first said a gun went off.
[03:16:04.403 --> 03:16:06.165]  It's like something you've thrown on the end.
[03:16:06.165 --> 03:16:09.708]  But that adds to his credibility that he didn't just go along with a gun going off.
[03:16:09.708 --> 03:16:12.290]  Well, it was a mixed bag, wasn't it?
[03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:13.311]  Well, it was.
[03:16:13.311 --> 03:16:17.574]  And to a large extent during that segment, I felt like I was, you know, herding cats.
[03:16:17.574 --> 03:16:19.996]  Attempting to herd cats.
[03:16:19.996 --> 03:16:27.222]  There was a lot of territory covered in that last segment from Israel to, you know, pedophilia and everything in between.
[03:16:28.142 --> 03:16:43.576]  But, you know, the larger issue here is the fact that, and I agree, that it's difficult, Alex, to extract, for example, a business name in an email or series of emails, and certainly you don't create or write the hashtags.
[03:16:43.576 --> 03:16:44.837]  I mean, it's Pizzagate.
[03:16:44.837 --> 03:16:45.377]  That's what it is.
[03:16:45.377 --> 03:16:46.579]  Well, I told my crew this.
[03:16:46.579 --> 03:16:52.724]  I said, they could be using the name of this place as a code word and they're meeting in the parking lot and it could be secret documents.
[03:16:52.724 --> 03:16:53.364]  You don't know.
[03:16:54.085 --> 03:17:00.588]  Yeah, and frankly, I don't think we can stop talking about any one issue, any one person.
[03:17:00.588 --> 03:17:04.569]  When something was the number one trending term on the internet, we had to cover it.
[03:17:04.569 --> 03:17:07.911]  And I love how we're covering it up, simultaneously we're behind it all.
[03:17:08.476 --> 03:17:26.069]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, which, you know, and that is the whole, I mean, that's the whole thing right there, is the fact that they are going to say, look, because of your reckless coverage and your reckless accusations, not coverage, but reckless accusations when there were none made, you're just reporting on what was being said.
[03:17:26.989 --> 03:17:31.892]  Because of that, of course, we've got to censor you and you've got to be sanctioned.
[03:17:31.892 --> 03:17:34.473]  So this is where this is going.
[03:17:34.473 --> 03:17:38.175]  I just found that last segment very interesting, to say the least.
[03:17:38.175 --> 03:17:39.936]  That's all.
[03:17:39.936 --> 03:17:42.777]  Do you agree with me, though?
[03:17:42.777 --> 03:17:44.278]  And I wasn't just agreeing with him.
[03:17:45.273 --> 03:17:48.314]  That I think there's been massive coverage of this one thing.
[03:17:48.314 --> 03:17:56.578]  There's tens of thousands of emails mentioning kids and pizza and sauces all over the country and luscious hot dogs that are $60,000 for Obama.
[03:17:56.578 --> 03:17:57.419]  That's quite a group of hot dogs.
[03:17:57.419 --> 03:17:58.979]  That's a whole package of hot dogs, probably.
[03:17:58.979 --> 03:18:03.542]  You know, the average, I guess we did some looking into it, the average gay escort of
[03:18:04.602 --> 03:18:06.825]  Yeah, the extras for the condiments, I'm sure.
[03:18:26.653 --> 03:18:35.237]  Well, the whole thing, Alex, is we have to look at this, in my view anyway, we have to look at this, as I said at the beginning, as a large crime scene, a global crime scene.
[03:18:35.237 --> 03:18:37.257]  Sure, what do you make of the mainstream media, though?
[03:18:37.257 --> 03:18:42.860]  They have quotes saying, Jones thinks the Podestas are involved in pedophilia, and none of it exists.
[03:18:42.860 --> 03:18:45.761]  Just like the Catholic Church, they're just saying none of this exists.
[03:18:46.567 --> 03:18:51.490]  Well, you know, again, you're looking at evidence that appears to be largely circumstantial.
[03:18:51.490 --> 03:19:01.555]  However, you cannot make the, or you cannot create the art that is certainly suggestive of a Dahmer type of theme, shall we say.
[03:19:01.555 --> 03:19:09.379]  You can't make up, obviously, the spirit cooking, which is ample photographic documentation that exists there.
[03:19:09.379 --> 03:19:11.961]  Alistair Crowley stuff, and that's child sacrifice magic.
[03:19:12.717 --> 03:19:14.698]  Yeah, I mean, it exists.
[03:19:14.698 --> 03:19:18.821]  Are we to just look aside or look away from that and say, well, it doesn't exist?
[03:19:18.821 --> 03:19:19.281]  Of course not.
[03:19:19.281 --> 03:19:21.563]  We have to say, yeah, here it is.
[03:19:21.563 --> 03:19:25.765]  But what does that mean aside from that?
[03:19:25.765 --> 03:19:28.407]  But there are so many other things, too.
[03:19:28.407 --> 03:19:36.252]  The Clinton Foundation at the epicenter of Haiti and of all these connections.
[03:19:37.032 --> 03:19:39.515]  I mean, this is an elephant, a huge elephant.
[03:19:39.515 --> 03:19:53.849]  We have to take one... And by the way, I can show thousands of articles about huge pedophile rings being found everywhere, and it's always judges in government, and people involved, and child trafficking groups, and, you know, groups that are involved in moving folks across borders.
[03:19:56.074 --> 03:20:08.568]  Yeah, and it's the very people who have the power and the influence and the cash that are involved in this that can influence the judicial system.
[03:20:08.568 --> 03:20:10.611]  I mean, this is just so crazy.
[03:20:11.812 --> 03:20:26.105]  The bottom line here is, with respect to the business establishment in Washington, D.C., you know, I never heard you really focus in on that, aside from it being an element of an article or a story or an interest with respect to the emails.
[03:20:26.105 --> 03:20:31.409]  But look at the emails, the 650,000 plus all of the other emails together.
[03:20:31.409 --> 03:20:32.370]  Look at what they're saying.
[03:20:32.370 --> 03:20:34.172]  Look at the principles involved here.
[03:20:34.172 --> 03:20:37.635]  Yeah, even that lawyer couldn't deny it looks like some horrible stuff's going on.
[03:20:38.260 --> 03:20:38.600]  Yeah.
[03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:40.342]  But that's what I kept telling people.
[03:20:40.342 --> 03:20:42.865]  There's going to be innocent folks in these emails.
[03:20:42.865 --> 03:20:45.567]  You can't just take stuff and then just say it.
[03:20:45.567 --> 03:20:48.791]  And so, you know.
[03:20:48.791 --> 03:20:54.677]  But then again, I thought it was interesting that, you know, it's OK to throw a pedestrian under the bus.
[03:20:54.677 --> 03:20:57.199]  However, leave common ping pong alone.
[03:20:57.199 --> 03:20:59.021]  And I can understand that to an extent.
[03:21:01.121 --> 03:21:09.367]  Those two are not necessarily, you can't extract... Yeah, I think law enforcement, and I mean independent, out-of-state, state police, you name it, it should all be looked into.
[03:21:09.367 --> 03:21:23.096]  But quite frankly, I think the way CNN focused on Comet Ping-Pong three weeks ago, got everybody feverishly on it, forcing us to cover it, basically, when I was looking at other areas, you know, many different areas, is the distraction overall.
[03:21:23.096 --> 03:21:25.257]  Well, listen, I really appreciate you joining us.
[03:21:25.257 --> 03:21:26.418]  Any other points, Mr. Hagman?
[03:21:27.369 --> 03:21:29.731]  No, just keep on doing what you're doing.
[03:21:29.731 --> 03:21:42.642]  I think you've done a great job and thank you so much for being at the tip of the spear on this and covering all of this and having the, really, the brass ones to do so because it does take a lot of courage to go out there.
[03:21:42.642 --> 03:21:44.704]  Well, I appreciate you, brother, and I appreciate your courage.
[03:21:44.704 --> 03:21:48.567]  You're the one that, again, before Eric Prince came out, before it was even in the news,
[03:21:51.410 --> 03:21:53.535]  Law enforcement's looking at this being sex trafficking.
[03:21:53.535 --> 03:21:55.300]  I mean, look at the parties.
[03:21:55.300 --> 03:21:57.987]  Jerry Epstein, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner.
[03:22:00.782 --> 03:22:04.084]  Yeah, we know there's massive exploitation of children in the Middle East going on.
[03:22:04.084 --> 03:22:08.726]  And then look at Aberdeen and just all of this, and then it's in there.
[03:22:08.726 --> 03:22:11.467]  I mean, there's emails where you just can't, there's no way.
[03:22:11.467 --> 03:22:13.088]  We're meeting at the farmhouse.
[03:22:13.088 --> 03:22:16.749]  The children are pliable and, you know, I'm paraphrasing, will behave themselves.
[03:22:16.749 --> 03:22:18.590]  You know, here's their ages.
[03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:20.311]  They'll be in the hot tub for your entertainment.
[03:22:20.311 --> 03:22:21.832]  I mean, what the hell is that?
[03:22:23.141 --> 03:22:26.964]  Or is that, is that code word for adult hookers or something?
[03:22:26.964 --> 03:22:30.907]  See, see, the reason I want to be careful here is, it's clearly code, that's what I'm saying.
[03:22:30.907 --> 03:22:34.250]  Pizza Gate is real, and I say that, I mean, the government's saying pizza's code word.
[03:22:34.250 --> 03:22:37.752]  As you talked about three weeks ago, you weren't talking about this, you were on the show.
[03:22:37.752 --> 03:22:42.536]  And we're not CYA here with this, we're really going back to what we said.
[03:22:42.536 --> 03:22:47.359]  And you were here saying, you know, they talk about pizza, toppings, this is in the law enforcement manuals, we've shown it.
[03:22:48.223 --> 03:22:52.864]  But that's separate from these other pizza places, and that's where people start mixing it together.
[03:22:52.864 --> 03:22:54.304]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:22:54.304 --> 03:23:02.706]  Yeah, and as you said, too, I look at CNN and other agencies identifying this business over and over and over again.
[03:23:02.706 --> 03:23:13.389]  To me, they're more responsible for the blowback than anyone who cites this as an element of a larger enterprise or a larger investigation, I should say.
[03:23:13.389 --> 03:23:15.049]  So, yeah, indeed.
[03:23:15.629 --> 03:23:25.415]  Yeah, well, if they think they're going to sit there in the media or in any witch hunt against us or anybody else and only focus it in on ping pong, they want to jump in that Breyer patch.
[03:23:25.415 --> 03:23:35.721]  Because, let me tell you, everybody connected to it, everybody there, we've seen enough footage, enough photos, enough images, enough stuff to know that something's going on in Denmark.
[03:23:35.721 --> 03:23:42.225]  And with the depositions alone, the discovery, I mean, Doug, looking at this, I tell you, it just,
[03:23:43.626 --> 03:23:45.988]  Looks like this rabbit hole goes pretty darn deep.
[03:23:45.988 --> 03:23:47.028]  Indeed it does.
[03:23:47.028 --> 03:23:49.250]  And they wanted us like a mama bird.
[03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:52.552]  Like it's wings broken, it'll hop around 20 feet from its nest.
[03:23:52.552 --> 03:23:55.014]  They're like, you know, over here by the comet, ping pong.
[03:23:55.014 --> 03:23:57.235]  I'm like, what's over there by those bushes?
[03:23:57.235 --> 03:23:59.657]  Let me walk over there and look for that, you know, the nest.
[03:23:59.657 --> 03:24:02.118]  And I think I think that's what's happening here.
[03:24:02.118 --> 03:24:03.980]  What do you think?
[03:24:03.980 --> 03:24:07.122]  Well, I mean, again, with blinders off.
[03:24:08.066 --> 03:24:08.646]  We're good to go.
[03:24:36.745 --> 03:24:42.532]  20 or 30 huge big pedophile scandals all over the US, all over Europe, and it's just in the paper, gone.
[03:24:42.532 --> 03:24:46.937]  Confirming, you know, finding dead bodies of kids, everything, it just doesn't matter.
[03:24:46.937 --> 03:24:50.781]  They just sweep it under that rug, and then wonder why everybody's so hysterical, it's crazy.
[03:24:51.542 --> 03:24:52.002]  Indeed, yeah.
[03:24:52.002 --> 03:24:53.783]  All right, Doug, thank you.
[03:24:53.783 --> 03:24:55.604]  There goes Doug Hagman.
[03:24:55.604 --> 03:25:00.767]  Before we hand the baton to Owen Schroyer here, I want to tell you about some of our fine sponsors.
[03:25:00.767 --> 03:25:10.113]  Revelations, Dawn of Global Government, the movie, the film directed by Chuck Anders, he stars General Jerry Boykin, Charlie Daniels, G. Edward Griffin, Phil Skousen, and myself, Alex Jones, and many others.
[03:25:10.113 --> 03:25:15.576]  It covers a range of topics such as privacy, General 21, the Federal Reserve, nationalism versus globalism, and much more.
[03:25:15.576 --> 03:25:17.197]  You can see that's the flavor of the whole world today.
[03:25:18.393 --> 03:25:24.875]  Visit revelationthemovie.info to purchase the DVD or check into hosting it at a theater near you.
[03:25:24.875 --> 03:25:28.236]  Separately, Solutions from Science Pocket Solar Generator.
[03:25:28.236 --> 03:25:38.239]  As a new pocket-sized solar generator, it can run off and run a lot of 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:25:38.239 --> 03:25:41.760]  But the best part is that you can also take it with you.

[03:26:08.663 --> 03:26:10.824]  And then separately, DNA Force is a
[03:26:12.130 --> 03:26:15.952]  Neutropic, quite frankly, it boosts the brain, but it's about getting toxins out of your cells.
[03:26:15.952 --> 03:26:22.114]  It's been proven, it's patented to be able to detoxify the mitochondria, to nerve regrowth.
[03:26:22.114 --> 03:26:24.335]  I mean, it's just simply amazing.
[03:26:24.335 --> 03:26:30.378]  Competing brands of this are only found in, you know, via doctors and medical facilities, just nobody will pay for it unless it's from them.
[03:26:30.378 --> 03:26:32.779]  It's prescription in Europe, stuff like BioPQ Cube.
[03:26:33.882 --> 03:26:35.163]  This is a hundred dollars.
[03:26:52.598 --> 03:26:54.499]  I forget how many thousands.
[03:26:54.499 --> 03:26:57.040]  It's $12,000, $14,000 a kilo just for the BioPQQ.
[03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:58.680]  It's amazing.
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:00.681]  Strangely enough, it's kind of like comets and stuff.
[03:27:00.681 --> 03:27:01.741]  It's really weird.
[03:27:01.741 --> 03:27:02.602]  Check into it.
[03:27:02.602 --> 03:27:04.342]  That's just one ingredient.
[03:27:04.342 --> 03:27:06.483]  175 clinical studies.
[03:27:06.483 --> 03:27:08.484]  4.7 stars from third-party sites.
[03:27:08.484 --> 03:27:11.665]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:27:16.547 --> 03:27:19.128]  And I'm here to tell you, it's amazing.
[03:27:19.128 --> 03:27:20.529]  Now we also have other specials running.
[03:27:20.529 --> 03:27:26.051]  Brain Force is back in stock, now 20% more in each bottle.
[03:27:26.051 --> 03:27:28.372]  We've also got some of the other amazing products.
[03:27:28.372 --> 03:27:29.972]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:27:29.972 --> 03:27:33.534]  We are at the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[03:27:33.534 --> 03:27:39.016]  And it takes a lot of money to run this operation, as you can imagine.
[03:27:39.016 --> 03:27:40.737]  To have the reporters, the crew, the staff,
[03:27:42.267 --> 03:27:49.437]  The legal, the customer service, the shipping department, it's pretty much self-contained here.
[03:27:49.437 --> 03:27:58.690]  About a third of our shipping is drop shipped from other folks, so we can save people money instead of shipping it from, say, where they make the water filters in Michigan.
[03:27:59.531 --> 03:28:03.853]  The case of ProPure shipping in here and then we ship it out to you and it ships right from there.
[03:28:03.853 --> 03:28:07.394]  But most of it's all done right here in Austin, Texas.
[03:28:07.394 --> 03:28:15.358]  We employ now more than 60 people and it is a tough nut to crack even with lower prices than other areas of the country here in Texas.
[03:28:15.358 --> 03:28:16.678]  So thank you for your support.
[03:28:16.678 --> 03:28:17.739]  Thank you for your prayers.
[03:28:18.359 --> 03:28:22.701]  You can also call toll-free while answering your questions and take your order or whatever you'd like to do.
[03:28:22.701 --> 03:28:24.302]  888-253-3139.
[03:28:24.302 --> 03:28:25.183]  888-253-3139.
[03:28:25.183 --> 03:28:29.945]  And understand, we're under massive globalist attack.
[03:28:29.945 --> 03:28:31.606]  They want to censor us down more than ever.
[03:28:31.606 --> 03:28:34.047]  The President, Hillary, all of them attacking us.
[03:28:34.047 --> 03:28:35.308]  Mainstream news every day.
[03:28:35.308 --> 03:28:36.849]  Disinformation twisting.
[03:28:36.849 --> 03:28:37.649]  We're the big target.
[03:28:37.649 --> 03:28:40.571]  We got the whole leftist, globalist machine coming after us.
[03:28:41.331 --> 03:28:43.614]  We need your financial support and your prayers and more.
[03:28:43.614 --> 03:28:45.056]  I know you're going to give it to us.
[03:28:45.056 --> 03:28:48.100]  So thank you so much, again, in the face of this tyranny.
[03:28:48.100 --> 03:28:50.544]  Owen Schroyer, hosting the next 30 Minutes.
[03:28:50.544 --> 03:28:52.146]  Thank you for popping in today with us.
[03:28:52.146 --> 03:28:54.129]  Sorry to take 30 minutes of the fourth hour time.
[03:28:54.129 --> 03:28:55.230]  What do you got coming up today?
[03:28:55.851 --> 03:28:59.293]  Well, we got all kinds of news, and I just gotta say, you had a great show.
[03:28:59.293 --> 03:29:02.615]  I thought that that last guest with Doug Hagman was really great.
[03:29:02.615 --> 03:29:04.355]  I enjoyed listening to that.
[03:29:04.355 --> 03:29:09.898]  Well, Alex, it looks like freedom and liberty is catching on worldwide now with Italy.
[03:29:09.898 --> 03:29:15.281]  Italy, one of us, the Brexit, I think Germany is next, France is next as well.
[03:29:15.281 --> 03:29:23.525]  What are the globalists gonna do when all of the countries that they have co-opted to bring globalism to this planet are falling out of line?
[03:29:23.525 --> 03:29:24.446]  What are they gonna do, Alex?
[03:29:25.714 --> 03:29:34.121]  Well, they're going to bring in authoritarianism and start a big war and try to plunge the economy, but so many good parts of Wall Street are rallying, so they don't know what to do.
[03:29:34.121 --> 03:29:35.662]  They're losing control.
[03:29:35.662 --> 03:29:36.683]  The old media is dying.
[03:29:36.683 --> 03:29:38.344]  The globalists are collapsing.
[03:29:38.344 --> 03:29:40.566]  It's an incredible time to be alive, my friend.
[03:29:40.566 --> 03:29:41.787]  They're going to come for our free speech.
[03:29:41.787 --> 03:29:43.388]  That's what's going to happen next.
[03:29:43.388 --> 03:29:44.509]  So back us up, listeners.
[03:29:49.252 --> 03:29:53.198]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.198 --> 03:29:55.862]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.912 --> 03:30:01.493]  First Brexit, then Trump.
[03:30:01.493 --> 03:30:06.135]  Is Italy next for the West's, quote, populist movement, as The Guardian puts it?
[03:30:06.135 --> 03:30:11.977]  Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after losing a crucial reform referendum.
[03:30:11.977 --> 03:30:23.282]  A global political earthquake is underway where decidedly people are standing up in westernized nations and taking back their countries from rogue globalist, its latest victim, globalist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
[03:30:23.422 --> 03:30:30.926]  Who has announced that he will resign after suffering a humiliating defeat in a referendum, throwing the country and the Eurozone into utter confusion.
[03:30:30.926 --> 03:30:33.968]  Now he says that the experience of my government ends here.
[03:30:33.968 --> 03:30:41.633]  Renzi said in a televised address to the nation yesterday that the results show his yes camp was well on track to losing the referendum.
[03:30:41.633 --> 03:30:45.275]  Now, as he quits, arguably Hollande and Merkel are next.
[03:30:45.275 --> 03:30:49.277]  This comes after MPs and Senators representing the Five Star Movement
[03:30:49.417 --> 03:30:56.510]  Launched by Bethe Grillo, decided to get 4 million signatures they needed to take back their country and launch a referendum.
[03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:58.233]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfantWars.com
[03:30:59.670 --> 03:31:00.490]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:00.490 --> 03:31:02.771]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:31:02.771 --> 03:31:06.613]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:06.613 --> 03:31:08.694]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:08.694 --> 03:31:18.979]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:18.979 --> 03:31:24.962]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:25.282 --> 03:31:25.783]  We're good to go!
[03:31:40.299 --> 03:31:40.779]  I think so.
[03:31:59.560 --> 03:32:02.202]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[03:32:02.202 --> 03:32:04.364]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[03:32:04.364 --> 03:32:13.192]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[03:32:13.192 --> 03:32:15.714]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[03:32:15.714 --> 03:32:16.415]  It's mobile.
[03:32:16.415 --> 03:32:21.119]  To jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:32:21.559 --> 03:32:25.302]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[03:32:25.302 --> 03:32:28.726]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:32:28.726 --> 03:32:29.746]  A true innovation.
[03:32:29.746 --> 03:32:31.828]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:32:31.828 --> 03:32:33.550]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:36.072]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[03:32:36.072 --> 03:32:40.256]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[03:32:40.256 --> 03:32:42.358]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[03:32:42.358 --> 03:32:44.400]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:32:44.400 --> 03:32:45.180]  And check this out.
[03:32:45.180 --> 03:32:46.341]  Buy one right now.
[03:32:46.341 --> 03:32:48.003]  Use coupon code PRIVATE.
[03:32:48.263 --> 03:32:48.723]  I don't know.
[03:33:01.573 --> 03:33:08.156]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:25.293 --> 03:33:27.814]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.814 --> 03:33:29.994]  Owen Troyer here hosting with you.
[03:33:29.994 --> 03:33:37.997]  And when Alex left us, he asked you, the audience out there, to help support us in the attack of being deemed fake news.
[03:33:37.997 --> 03:33:43.338]  It doesn't matter that Alex has been proven right on many of the things that he's been reporting for decades now.
[03:33:43.338 --> 03:33:47.459]  No, they're just going to say discredited fake news and try to shut us down.
[03:33:47.459 --> 03:33:53.241]  And we thank you so much for your support by going to Infowarsstore.com and buying our great products.
[03:33:54.421 --> 03:33:57.648]  As Alex mentions that, I had this story here that I wanted to cover.
[03:33:57.648 --> 03:34:02.938]  Website labeled fake news threatens to sue Washington Post for defamation.
[03:34:03.905 --> 03:34:14.314]  This is from The Daily Caller, one of the websites the Washington Post labeled fake news and a November story demanded a retraction and threatened the paper with a defamation suit in a demand letter Sunday.
[03:34:14.314 --> 03:34:22.700]  Now, the name of the website is Naked Capitalism, and while I haven't heard about Naked Capitalism, I'm not even familiar with them.
[03:34:22.700 --> 03:34:25.643]  In fact, I didn't have time to vet them before I came on here.
[03:34:25.643 --> 03:34:28.825]  In fact, I don't know if you guys want to pull up Naked Capitalism there for me real quick.
[03:34:28.825 --> 03:34:30.607]  We could take a quick look at it.
[03:34:30.607 --> 03:34:31.628]  But I'd like to salute them.
[03:34:32.625 --> 03:34:36.787]  They are right there on the ship of deplorables with us apparently as fake news.
[03:34:36.787 --> 03:34:39.389]  Now again, I don't know anything about Naked Capitalism.
[03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:47.073]  I've never been to their site, but they are threatening to litigate with Washington Post over being called fake news.
[03:34:47.073 --> 03:34:48.674]  So there's Naked Capitalism.
[03:34:48.674 --> 03:34:50.394]  Some of the headlines here.
[03:34:50.394 --> 03:34:54.156]  Looks kind of more like a blog style website.
[03:34:54.156 --> 03:34:58.299]  Fearless commentary on finance, economics, politics, and power.
[03:34:59.159 --> 03:35:03.267]  Here's a headline that's on their homepage, Can Uber Deliver Part 4?
[03:35:05.191 --> 03:35:09.793]  Understanding that unregulated monopoly was always Uber's central objective.
[03:35:09.793 --> 03:35:11.154]  Oh, oh, no wonder!
[03:35:11.154 --> 03:35:15.436]  Must be fake news over there at Naked Capitalism having their own opinion.
[03:35:15.436 --> 03:35:16.637]  But we salute them.
[03:35:16.637 --> 03:35:20.099]  Now this is what was said, and I got a kick out of this.
[03:35:20.099 --> 03:35:25.302]  This is what was said in the letter from the lawyer representing Naked Capitalism.
[03:35:25.302 --> 03:35:32.025]  You did not provide even a single example of fake news allegedly distributed or promoted by Naked Capitalism or indeed any of the 200 sites
[03:35:33.906 --> 03:35:35.988]  On their blacklist.
[03:35:35.988 --> 03:35:36.629]  I love that.
[03:35:36.629 --> 03:35:38.170]  This is from James Moody.
[03:35:38.170 --> 03:35:52.322]  You provide no discussion or assessment of the credentials or backgrounds of these so-called researchers and no discussion or analysis of the methodology protocol or algorithms such as researchers may or may not have followed.
[03:35:53.723 --> 03:35:55.764]  So, there you go.
[03:35:55.764 --> 03:36:02.669]  And I don't need to get into the inner workings of protocols here, but I promise you, we are not fake news.
[03:36:02.669 --> 03:36:06.672]  At the end of the day, we want to get to the truth, just like you do.
[03:36:06.672 --> 03:36:12.396]  Now, there is real fake news out there, and again, I salute James Moody for that.
[03:36:12.396 --> 03:36:13.997]  I really got a kick out of that, exactly.
[03:36:13.997 --> 03:36:18.881]  They provide no evidence of fake news while being fake news, with all the stories that they cover that get debunked.
[03:36:18.881 --> 03:36:21.923]  Speaking of, one of those would be, with Brexit,
[03:36:22.967 --> 03:36:24.288]  The economy is going to collapse.
[03:36:24.288 --> 03:36:25.289]  The markets are going to collapse.
[03:36:25.289 --> 03:36:26.369]  Stocks are going to go down.
[03:36:26.369 --> 03:36:28.251]  If Trump gets elected, the economy will collapse.
[03:36:28.251 --> 03:36:29.111]  The markets will crash.
[03:36:29.111 --> 03:36:29.892]  Stocks will go down.
[03:36:29.892 --> 03:36:30.993]  And then it's record highs.
[03:36:30.993 --> 03:36:33.455]  This is from CNBC today.
[03:36:33.455 --> 03:36:39.259]  Stocks shrug off Italian referendum as Dow hits new record.
[03:36:39.259 --> 03:36:41.040]  Energy consumer stocks lead.
[03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:42.101]  So how do you like that?
[03:36:43.424 --> 03:36:55.314]  Despite them trying to scare you out of getting out of the EU, telling you the stocks would go down, the stocks are hitting record levels in Europe, the stocks are hitting record levels in the United States.
[03:36:55.314 --> 03:36:58.337]  Freedom, free market, not globalism.
[03:36:58.337 --> 03:37:00.939]  Nationalism is what is returning power to the people.
[03:37:00.939 --> 03:37:03.421]  Now we've got a report from Alex Jones on this.
[03:37:03.421 --> 03:37:06.884]  Italy votes against the EU takeover as globalism implodes.
[03:37:06.884 --> 03:37:08.005]  Let's play that report for you.
[03:37:13.806 --> 03:37:15.267]  It's Sunday night.
[03:37:15.267 --> 03:37:19.909]  By the time many of you see this, it'll be Monday.
[03:37:19.909 --> 03:37:27.292]  We have had another huge victory against the forces of globalism.
[03:37:27.292 --> 03:37:42.438]  Now, the New York Times, a few weeks ago, had three different articles in one week about yours truly, saying, who is this fake news purveyor that is telling his audience that there is a movement run by a group called the globalists?
[03:37:43.567 --> 03:37:50.872]  And they had three different articles investigating the theory of globalism and the globalists that run it.
[03:37:50.872 --> 03:38:03.921]  Globalism and globalists are terms used for more than 60 years by the Rockefeller Brothers Endowment, the Carnegie Endowment, the Ford Foundation.
[03:38:03.921 --> 03:38:07.824]  They had hearings in the 70s in Congress dealing with it.
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:17.326]  And the church committees, Barry Goldwater, Senator, spoke about it, exposed it, wrote books about it.
[03:38:17.326 --> 03:38:23.329]  It's corporate global government using a technocracy to control people.
[03:38:23.329 --> 03:38:28.373]  The European Union is the first major project of it, set up as a steel agreement in 1957 called the Treaty of Rome.
[03:38:32.228 --> 03:38:37.252]  Out of that, they have the European Economic Community, like NAFTA and GAAP, that became the euro.
[03:38:37.252 --> 03:38:44.458]  And of the 25 nations that have entered it, only three ever were able to vote to even enter.
[03:38:44.458 --> 03:38:51.244]  Now, they just had Brexit a few months ago for the UK to begin to pull out of the EU that makes most of its loss.
[03:38:52.895 --> 03:38:54.338]  The EU itself is unelected.
[03:38:54.338 --> 03:38:55.861]  It's a permanent bureaucracy.
[03:38:55.861 --> 03:38:59.830]  It has a parliament of elected people, but that's only ceremonial.
[03:38:59.830 --> 03:39:03.558]  So it's the definition of a corporate, unelected government.
[03:39:04.414 --> 03:39:07.635]  That consolidates power for a few private central banks.
[03:39:07.635 --> 03:39:12.558]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have been involved since the conception of it.
[03:39:12.558 --> 03:39:16.379]  Globalism is the movement towards world government.
[03:39:16.379 --> 03:39:20.481]  Not to be confused with international citizenship or loving to travel the world.
[03:39:20.481 --> 03:39:21.501]  They sell it like that.
[03:39:21.501 --> 03:39:24.163]  That's the icing on the cake.
[03:39:24.163 --> 03:39:27.544]  But the actual filler is poison.
[03:39:27.544 --> 03:39:32.266]  So, this imaginary global movement has been defeated in Russia.
[03:39:32.266 --> 03:39:33.747]  The Russians have thrown off the oligarchs.
[03:39:35.438 --> 03:39:37.839]  The UK is pulling out.
[03:39:37.839 --> 03:39:43.381]  And now there are 25 referendums in all 25 Euro nations to pull out.
[03:39:43.381 --> 03:39:50.183]  And the first big one was today, December 4th, Sunday.
[03:39:50.183 --> 03:39:55.165]  And the five-star party, started by a populist comedian of all people,
[03:39:56.567 --> 03:40:01.988]  He has just three years has come to prominence and had devastating victories in the Italian Parliament.
[03:40:01.988 --> 03:40:08.150]  So the Italian president announced he's stepping down, resigning tomorrow.
[03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:11.351]  And they're now going to have to have the different parties elect their new leaders.
[03:40:11.351 --> 03:40:15.532]  And the party with the most people in Parliament gets their new president slash prime minister.
[03:40:15.532 --> 03:40:16.772]  The point we're getting at here is
[03:40:18.749 --> 03:40:32.556]  Everywhere, from Catalonia to what's happening in Reykjavik, Iceland, to what's happening with Donald Trump's election here, to UKIP, to Russia, to nationalists getting elected in Australia.
[03:40:32.556 --> 03:40:33.817]  Humanity's awakening.
[03:40:33.817 --> 03:40:44.082]  Now, the New York Times sells it like, yes, the nationalists are angry at the establishment, so despite the fact there are needed reforms, they voted against the reforms.
[03:40:45.199 --> 03:40:56.344]  Yes, it was a no vote to hand their laws completely over to the EU bureaucracy, what's left of their sovereignty, and let them jack up any amount of debt they want and have austerity on the population.
[03:40:59.144 --> 03:41:04.486]  The IMF and World Bank have done the same thing to the third world that is now happening via the euro.
[03:41:04.486 --> 03:41:09.608]  The IMF and World Bank are just the international Federal Reserve of the very same private banks.
[03:41:09.608 --> 03:41:17.351]  It's central banks that are privately owned and controlled, consolidating control, using economic warfare to make people poor to control them.
[03:41:17.351 --> 03:41:19.752]  And the world's waking up to that!
[03:41:19.752 --> 03:41:20.773]  And no amount of CNN
[03:41:22.594 --> 03:41:29.340]  I remember CNN like 10 years ago would go, Jones believes the Euro is dictatorial and other conspiracy theories.
[03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:34.025]  By its definition, it's dictatorial and totalitarian.
[03:41:34.025 --> 03:41:39.991]  And so they just try this stonewalling, stonewalling, stonewalling, hoping everyone's so ignorant nobody learns about it.
[03:41:39.991 --> 03:41:47.057]  How NAFTA and GATT are merging into the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Asian Union and the Atlantic Treaty that merges us with the EU.
[03:41:48.846 --> 03:41:51.506]  Thousands of pages long, passed in secret.
[03:41:51.506 --> 03:41:52.707]  We now get a copy of it.
[03:41:52.707 --> 03:41:57.728]  It's total corporate world government, all one-sided, to shut down the little guy.
[03:41:57.728 --> 03:41:58.928]  It overrides Congress.
[03:41:58.928 --> 03:42:00.248]  It overrides parliaments.
[03:42:00.248 --> 03:42:02.168]  It overrides state legislatures.
[03:42:02.168 --> 03:42:09.670]  It turns our governments, not just here but all over the world, into rubber stamps.
[03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:14.551]  And so the good news is, liberty is on the march.
[03:42:14.551 --> 03:42:15.991]  Trump is a manifestation of that.
[03:42:17.159 --> 03:42:18.800]  What's happening with Briggs is a manifestation.
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:22.782]  It's all a huge manifestation and all we're having is victories.
[03:42:22.782 --> 03:42:29.787]  In Germany, Merkel's party had such a super majority that's taken three elections to bring her to almost having no majority.
[03:42:29.787 --> 03:42:31.808]  So she should really resign.
[03:42:31.808 --> 03:42:36.231]  But there's evidence that at least the elections in Germany are quasi-legitimate.
[03:42:36.231 --> 03:42:38.372]  Not the case in Austria.
[03:42:38.372 --> 03:42:41.114]  Polls keep showing nationalists should be winning.
[03:42:42.541 --> 03:42:44.101]  By 10, 15 points.
[03:42:44.101 --> 03:42:46.262]  But the Green Party and others, quote, keep winning.
[03:42:46.262 --> 03:42:47.342]  Give me a break.
[03:42:47.342 --> 03:42:49.483]  Because they'll keep the borders open, the rest of it.
[03:42:49.483 --> 03:42:54.944]  So Austria was having more of a symbolic vote about who their president would be.
[03:42:54.944 --> 03:42:59.065]  This, quote, ultra right-winger of the Green Party, and they elected the Greens today.
[03:42:59.065 --> 03:43:01.066]  So that's the first defeat.
[03:43:01.066 --> 03:43:10.709]  But on the same day, Italy had a much more substantive, real victory in saying, no, we're not going to hand over our sovereignty to the unelected EU entirely.
[03:43:10.709 --> 03:43:11.869]  Now, the EU has responded.
[03:43:12.864 --> 03:43:14.305]  The EU has come out.
[03:43:14.305 --> 03:43:16.807]  You can just Google this for yourself.
[03:43:16.807 --> 03:43:23.873]  And since these member states are trying to pull out after Brexit, we're going to create an EU army and order you to dissolve your armies.
[03:43:23.873 --> 03:43:25.874]  And we'll have an army that keeps you safe.
[03:43:25.874 --> 03:43:27.736]  Oh, you're trying to leave?
[03:43:27.736 --> 03:43:30.878]  We'll put a new army in place and tax you for it.
[03:43:30.878 --> 03:43:37.584]  We'll quarter a multinational force in Germany, in Spain, in Greece, in Italy, in the Netherlands.
[03:43:39.272 --> 03:43:41.958]  I guess in the UK, if you try to pull out.
[03:43:41.958 --> 03:43:49.173]  And the mayor, an Islamicist, in London has said, we're not going to leave even if the British government says so.
[03:43:49.173 --> 03:43:50.455]  We'll take control of the city.
[03:43:51.511 --> 03:43:53.352]  We work for the EU.
[03:43:53.352 --> 03:43:57.635]  This is how you're conquering the 21st century, is by corporate bodies.
[03:43:57.635 --> 03:44:01.417]  But another huge victory in Italy.
[03:44:01.417 --> 03:44:04.780]  This is six or seven big victories just in the last few years.
[03:44:04.780 --> 03:44:06.140]  And they're accelerating.
[03:44:06.140 --> 03:44:09.783]  And as there's more victories, more people start to pull out now and now.
[03:44:09.783 --> 03:44:10.843]  We told you this would happen.
[03:44:10.843 --> 03:44:12.244]  Brexit came out.
[03:44:12.244 --> 03:44:14.326]  I mean, after Brexit, the EU said, you know what?
[03:44:14.326 --> 03:44:16.987]  You're not allowed to leave.
[03:44:16.987 --> 03:44:17.928]  We're just not going to let you leave.
[03:44:20.646 --> 03:44:24.050]  People say, well at first it's hard to leave if they bureaucratically control you.
[03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:26.792]  But they're showing themselves as dictatorial.
[03:44:26.792 --> 03:44:29.435]  Mid-term, long-term, they're going to lose.
[03:44:29.435 --> 03:44:37.183]  By exposing it's unelected, by talking about it, and getting ridiculed, and having CNN say it doesn't exist, we force it out into the open.
[03:44:38.359 --> 03:44:45.281]  The same CNN that said Trump's going to lose by 10 points because they were adding 15, 20, 30 points to their polls against him.
[03:44:45.281 --> 03:44:48.141]  The same CNN that gave the questions to her in all the debates.
[03:44:48.141 --> 03:44:50.422]  The same CNN that got caught colluding with the White House.
[03:44:50.422 --> 03:44:54.663]  The same CNN that got caught talking to the White House about how to lie to the public.
[03:44:54.663 --> 03:44:56.163]  You're all discredited.
[03:44:56.163 --> 03:45:01.505]  And now Obama wants state run media to counter InfoWars.com.
[03:45:01.505 --> 03:45:02.285]  And what they do is.
[03:45:03.851 --> 03:45:07.985]  They go on obscure internet sites a lot of times that are set up by their own people, it's come out.
[03:45:09.099 --> 03:45:12.840]  About different foundations that put out horrible lies on the internet.
[03:45:12.840 --> 03:45:19.101]  And then they claim, oh, look at these horrible lies and these of Alex Jones with a straw man to mix us in.
[03:45:19.101 --> 03:45:23.022]  The good news is people know that mainstream media is lying to them.
[03:45:23.022 --> 03:45:27.703]  You know, the only time we watch mainstream media is at an airport or maybe on an airplane or somewhere.
[03:45:27.703 --> 03:45:32.284]  And it's all, it's on the free setting on your, you know, Wi-Fi connection.
[03:45:32.284 --> 03:45:34.845]  So you still watch it, but you know you're being force fed.
[03:45:36.025 --> 03:45:38.447]  The mainstream media already died, folks.
[03:45:38.447 --> 03:45:39.447]  They already know it.
[03:45:39.447 --> 03:45:43.050]  They're propped up, they're paid for by corporate facades.
[03:45:43.050 --> 03:45:47.973]  The corporations are refusing to pay for it now because none of it delivered.
[03:45:47.973 --> 03:45:52.876]  So I predicted they'd go pure state-run media once they lost the election and try to censor us.
[03:45:52.876 --> 03:45:55.918]  Now they're announcing total state-run media.
[03:45:55.918 --> 03:45:57.659]  Think about it.
[03:45:57.659 --> 03:45:59.700]  They're trying to appoint presidents in Europe.
[03:45:59.700 --> 03:46:01.562]  They're trying to go to pure state-run media.
[03:46:02.861 --> 03:46:07.484]  They're trying to sell us authoritarianism as it's no big deal, but nobody's buying it.
[03:46:07.484 --> 03:46:09.485]  And the awakening is huge.
[03:46:09.485 --> 03:46:10.666]  It's accelerating.
[03:46:10.666 --> 03:46:11.307]  It's amazing.
[03:46:11.307 --> 03:46:13.528]  So I'm going to be covering this tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:46:13.528 --> 03:46:16.350]  Central, InfoWars.com, Ford's last show.
[03:46:16.350 --> 03:46:20.353]  If you don't have a station in your area, but we've got like 50 new affiliates the last six months.
[03:46:20.353 --> 03:46:23.675]  We're at 240 something affiliates right now.
[03:46:23.675 --> 03:46:26.957]  The show is exploding across the nation and the world.
[03:46:26.957 --> 03:46:27.878]  This is an info war.
[03:46:28.778 --> 03:46:47.036]  So when you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show or InfoWars.com forward slash app, when you spread the link to the areas to get the free app, we have a paid app as well, or when you spread the link to the video feeds and audio feeds and podcasts, that's how we reach some weeks as many as 85 million people.
[03:46:47.817 --> 03:46:52.158]  Our new floor is about 41 million people a week.
[03:46:52.158 --> 03:46:54.959]  One way or another, we can confirm or watch if you're listening.
[03:46:54.959 --> 03:47:00.840]  Our old ceiling was about 30 million and our floor was 20 million.
[03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:03.141]  It's now 40 million.
[03:47:03.141 --> 03:47:06.001]  And that dwarfs CNN, folks.
[03:47:06.001 --> 03:47:08.362]  That's up there with Fox News.
[03:47:08.362 --> 03:47:09.102]  I'm not bragging.
[03:47:09.102 --> 03:47:10.922]  I want you to know we're winning.
[03:47:10.922 --> 03:47:12.363]  You're winning.
[03:47:12.363 --> 03:47:13.423]  You're having a big effect.
[03:47:15.771 --> 03:47:16.912]  Little note to mainstream media.
[03:47:16.912 --> 03:47:19.756]  People like these low-tech things shot here after hours.
[03:47:19.756 --> 03:47:21.578]  Way better than our big glitzy studios.
[03:47:21.578 --> 03:47:26.003]  You guys can learn something from that as well to the mainstream media.
[03:47:26.003 --> 03:47:29.326]  Who, by the way, know they're mercenaries?
[03:47:29.326 --> 03:47:32.730]  We'll be covering a lot of this and more tomorrow.
[03:47:32.730 --> 03:47:34.652]  I've got some big Donald Trump revelations as well.
[03:47:35.878 --> 03:47:36.098]  11 a.m.
[03:47:36.098 --> 03:47:40.240]  Central, 12 noon Eastern, Infowars.com, forward slash show.
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:44.401]  Start your own website, start your own blog, cover real information.
[03:47:44.401 --> 03:47:47.562]  Don't get off into conspiracy theories.
[03:47:47.562 --> 03:47:52.664]  The media will make jokes about this and say, oh, Mr. Conspiracy Theory says don't say conspiracy theories.
[03:47:52.664 --> 03:47:56.065]  They would always call me a conspiracy theorist because I was so devastating.
[03:47:56.065 --> 03:47:58.926]  That's how they try to discredit you.
[03:47:58.926 --> 03:48:00.407]  That just means questioning known liars.
[03:48:01.593 --> 03:48:06.956]  Now their new term is fake news when they're the fake news and they've been discredited in this election more than ever.
[03:48:06.956 --> 03:48:12.879]  But there are people that do fit the bill of just making up random crap.
[03:48:12.879 --> 03:48:16.000]  Like, oh, this crystal will heal your cancer or stuff like that.
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:18.802]  And they use that to discredit the real work we're doing.
[03:48:18.802 --> 03:48:25.245]  Now, separately, when I rant, when I rave, when I do some satire, they try to discredit us, you know, using that.
[03:48:26.536 --> 03:48:29.258]  People love that stuff, and that only adds to our credibility.
[03:48:29.258 --> 03:48:30.699]  So to each his own.
[03:48:30.699 --> 03:48:39.767]  All I'm saying is there's enough hardcore, real evidence of tyrannical world government taking place that all of us have more serious work to do than we could ever do.
[03:48:39.767 --> 03:48:41.548]  So don't infight.
[03:48:41.548 --> 03:48:43.070]  Stay focused.
[03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:49.014]  Stay away from all the race-baiting crap, no matter what color you are, and come together for basic human liberty and freedom and a new renaissance.
[03:48:49.895 --> 03:48:51.277]  Again, I want to thank you all for watching.
[03:48:51.277 --> 03:48:54.841]  I want to thank God for providence and support.
[03:48:54.841 --> 03:48:59.047]  And I want to thank Buckley for coming over here at like 11 o'clock at night to shoot these videos.
[03:48:59.047 --> 03:49:02.150]  We're going to upload these to YouTube and to Facebook.
[03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.871]  We've done our part.
[03:49:02.871 --> 03:49:06.336]  Please do yours and spread the links and subscribe below.
[03:49:10.942 --> 03:49:24.353]  And I personally think one of the biggest reasons why we're seeing the trend against the establishment politicians in Europe, in the EU, is because of what has happened because of their migrant policies.
[03:49:24.353 --> 03:49:33.541]  Now, there was another woman who was allegedly raped and murdered by a migrant, and they're still researching into this, but here's the thing.
[03:49:34.659 --> 03:49:45.104]  The German government, their own statistics show, they have to admit, violent crimes have skyrocketed since over a million migrants have arrived in the country.
[03:49:45.104 --> 03:49:49.426]  But of course, of course that is going to happen.
[03:49:49.426 --> 03:49:57.590]  And they just don't want to live in a country that is becoming less and less safe, less and less stable.
[03:49:57.590 --> 03:50:02.572]  It's not that we don't feel bad for the plight of these people coming in, it's just
[03:50:03.809 --> 03:50:13.438]  We don't want that coming into our country, especially at the hands of when there's political people who seek to gain from it with voter blocks here in America.
[03:50:13.438 --> 03:50:14.699]  That's what they love to do with that.
[03:50:14.699 --> 03:50:16.261]  Now, this is what's happening.
[03:50:16.261 --> 03:50:24.689]  This is a story that's actually a couple months old that I just saw today when I was doing my research into this migrant story from Germany.
[03:50:27.645 --> 03:50:48.336]  What we have here is African migrants making their way to South America and there is some deal between South and Central America and the Obama administration where these migrants from Africa work their way up through South America and the whole goal of them getting to South America is to get asylum in the United States.
[03:50:48.336 --> 03:50:50.377]  So crazy stuff going on there.
[03:50:50.377 --> 03:50:52.117]  We've got more on the other side.
[03:50:52.117 --> 03:50:54.879]  This is the Alex Jones Show final segment, fourth hour.
[03:50:59.969 --> 03:51:08.072]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it?
[03:51:08.072 --> 03:51:15.936]  I have my help today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:15.936 --> 03:51:20.718]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite, as suggested, for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:20.718 --> 03:51:23.139]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on.
[03:51:23.139 --> 03:51:25.380]  You know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:25.740 --> 03:51:32.505]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:32.505 --> 03:51:33.646]  Life is too short!

[03:52:58.817 --> 03:53:00.618]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein.
[03:53:00.618 --> 03:53:05.501]  In my twenties, I abused stimulants and antibiotic steroids to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[03:53:05.501 --> 03:53:08.603]  I suffer from extreme fatigue and an inability to handle stress.
[03:53:08.603 --> 03:53:15.288]  For over six years, I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[03:53:15.288 --> 03:53:19.231]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[03:53:19.231 --> 03:53:24.394]  Now, just after one month on Synergy One and ADR Medix, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[03:53:24.614 --> 03:53:31.456]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR Medix.
[03:53:31.456 --> 03:53:35.797]  I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[03:53:35.797 --> 03:53:38.838]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[03:53:38.838 --> 03:53:46.941]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort, but now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy One and ADR Medix.
[03:53:47.421 --> 03:53:49.682]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.
[03:53:49.682 --> 03:53:51.143]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[03:53:51.143 --> 03:53:51.923]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[03:54:23.214 --> 03:54:27.671]  Welcome back to the final segment of the Alex Jones Show on this Monday.
[03:54:29.332 --> 03:54:31.794]  I thought it was one of the best Alex Jones Shows.
[03:54:31.794 --> 03:54:32.855]  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
[03:54:32.855 --> 03:54:35.037]  I hope that you out there did too.
[03:54:35.037 --> 03:54:37.780]  If you did, go to infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:37.780 --> 03:54:39.361]  Check out our products.
[03:54:39.361 --> 03:54:41.563]  One of the, you know, a lot of people don't realize we have a bunch of apparel.
[03:54:41.563 --> 03:54:43.105]  There's actually a new hat on there.
[03:54:43.105 --> 03:54:45.066]  A new Moan Labe hat.
[03:54:45.066 --> 03:54:46.808]  I just got one myself.
[03:54:46.808 --> 03:54:50.491]  If you're into hats, that's a great hat.
[03:54:50.491 --> 03:54:51.352]  It's a sleek design.
[03:54:51.352 --> 03:54:52.673]  It's very comfortable.
[03:54:52.673 --> 03:54:55.676]  So this just came across my news desk.
[03:54:55.976 --> 03:54:57.798]  This is out of KSDK in St.
[03:54:57.798 --> 03:54:58.139]  Louis.
[03:54:58.139 --> 03:54:58.359]  St.
[03:54:58.359 --> 03:55:03.145]  Louis man accused of threatening to bomb workplace.
[03:55:03.145 --> 03:55:13.799]  A Missouri man is jailed on $500,000 cash bond after being accused of telling co-workers he was affiliated with ISIS and could have their auto dealing job site blown up by making a phone call.
[03:55:14.199 --> 03:55:14.339]  St.
[03:55:14.339 --> 03:55:24.427]  Louis County prosecutors charged the 26-year-old Mustafa Baramik on Sunday with making a terrorist threat that is a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison.
[03:55:24.427 --> 03:55:24.987]  Police in the St.
[03:55:24.987 --> 03:55:34.074]  Louis suburb of Creve Coeur say Baramik made the threat November 25th to fellow employees of Tefzeel, showing them a tattoo he claimed was related to ISIS.
[03:55:34.554 --> 03:55:42.497]  A police investigator wrote in a probable cause statement accompanying the criminal complaint that Beramec admitted making the threat.
[03:55:42.497 --> 03:55:46.179]  Police did a search of the business, did not find any explosives.
[03:55:46.179 --> 03:55:52.421]  It is not said whether or not Beramec has an attorney or not.
[03:55:52.421 --> 03:55:52.822]  So more
[03:55:55.313 --> 03:56:03.138]  I guess domestic ISIS agents or alleged domestic ISIS agents here in America.
[03:56:03.138 --> 03:56:06.600]  It'll be interesting to see what comes of this.
[03:56:06.600 --> 03:56:12.544]  You know, and we live in this news cycle that is constantly twisting, constantly swirling.
[03:56:12.544 --> 03:56:14.565]  A story like this is going to be forgotten in 36 hours.
[03:56:17.742 --> 03:56:22.805]  There was the guy in New Jersey that planted the bombs, I guess still allegedly.
[03:56:22.805 --> 03:56:23.465]  Do we even know?
[03:56:23.465 --> 03:56:25.886]  Did we get any of that confirmed ever?
[03:56:25.886 --> 03:56:27.187]  About the Chelsea bombing?
[03:56:27.187 --> 03:56:29.048]  The bombs that were found in New Jersey?
[03:56:29.048 --> 03:56:32.149]  This guy gets in a shootout with police?
[03:56:32.149 --> 03:56:35.371]  What were his affiliations to ISIS?
[03:56:35.371 --> 03:56:39.893]  How did he get radicalized?
[03:56:39.893 --> 03:56:44.816]  Is there, I mean, are we looking at terror cells here, folks?
[03:56:44.816 --> 03:56:46.597]  Or are we looking at lone wolves?
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:57:00.044]  And when you've got a guy making threats, saying he could have an auto dealership blown up by making a phone call, that would indicate a sell, wouldn't it?
[03:57:00.044 --> 03:57:01.924]  But I don't know.
[03:57:01.924 --> 03:57:04.085]  But this just came across today.
[03:57:04.085 --> 03:57:07.486]  STL man accused of threatening to bomb workplace.
[03:57:07.486 --> 03:57:13.408]  Claims to be affiliated with ISIS 26-year-old Moussafa Baramek.
[03:57:14.625 --> 03:57:21.991]  So we'll find out if anything develops from that, any affiliations, or if they just brush that under the rug.
[03:57:21.991 --> 03:57:26.055]  Now, this story I had already planned on coming here talking about.
[03:57:26.055 --> 03:57:27.916]  This is from the Express.
[03:57:27.916 --> 03:57:34.302]  ISIS declares war on Trump's inauguration day, calling it Bloody Friday.
[03:57:34.302 --> 03:57:42.649]  The Islamic terror organization is reported to have recruited a number of new English-speaking operatives in recent months in a major bid to communicate messages ahead of the event.
[03:57:43.925 --> 03:57:47.949]  And then of course I see the story with this man out of St.
[03:57:47.949 --> 03:57:53.434]  Louis and you can't help but want to raise your eyebrow.
[03:57:53.434 --> 03:57:58.619]  Now I don't think ISIS is going to do anything that brazen.
[03:58:00.131 --> 03:58:05.314]  They wouldn't want to tip off, you know, police officers or American citizens.
[03:58:05.314 --> 03:58:10.717]  But, nonetheless, that wasn't the express and we know that ISIS loves to brag about this.
[03:58:10.717 --> 03:58:12.518]  Don't believe a thing you hear unless it comes from me.
[03:58:12.518 --> 03:58:16.100]  Megyn Kelly responds to rumors she's going to CNN, but doesn't rule it out.
[03:58:17.541 --> 03:58:18.262]  So who knows?
[03:58:18.262 --> 03:58:19.963]  I kind of predicted that she would be a Wallio.
[03:58:19.963 --> 03:58:20.744]  Maybe she will.
[03:58:20.744 --> 03:58:24.987]  Holidays on the moon will be possible in just a decade.
[03:58:24.987 --> 03:58:25.688]  So who knows?
[03:58:25.688 --> 03:58:26.668]  Will we be on the moon?
[03:58:26.668 --> 03:58:28.630]  Donald Trump said he'd take us to the stars.
[03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:29.751]  Thanks to everybody who tuned in.
[03:58:29.751 --> 03:58:30.932]  Infowarsstore.com.
