[00:00.000 --> 00:29.340]  This just in ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on Alex Jones for two days
[00:29.340 --> 00:36.840]  into the globalist takeover. America first is dead inside DC, but it lives in our hearts.
[00:36.840 --> 00:41.580]  Globalism of the New World Order is now on the attack. The Empire is striking back. This
[00:41.580 --> 00:49.700]  just in. Baseball Hall of Famer and former MLB home run king Hank Aaron is dead at 86.
[00:49.700 --> 00:56.520]  A great guy thought he was helping folks took the shot first saying he wanted to encourage
[00:56.520 --> 01:01.420]  other black folks to take it because he saw the statistics that blacks are double affected
[01:01.420 --> 01:05.460]  by COVID-19. He didn't know that's because of vitamin D3 and blacks living in the Northern
[01:05.460 --> 01:14.060]  Hemisphere. And he died after taking the second shot. That's really when it gets you. So I
[01:14.060 --> 01:21.620]  guess he got the first shot on the sixth and I guess he got the second shot sometime after
[01:21.620 --> 01:24.660]  that usually wait two weeks. That would be just the last few days ago. That's when they
[01:24.660 --> 01:30.220]  say it really hits you and he's dead. Hank Aaron receives COVID-19 vaccine and hopes
[01:30.220 --> 01:36.780]  inspire other black Americans do the same. That was on the sixth Atlanta Braves legendary
[01:36.780 --> 01:43.860]  legend Hank Aaron dead at 86. We need to investigate that. We need to find out when he did get
[01:43.860 --> 01:52.940]  the second shot. Absolutely disgusting. And we are having reports pour in. In fact, sometime
[01:52.940 --> 01:56.940]  next week we should do a whole show just for medical whistleblowers. And if you love the
[01:56.940 --> 02:00.020]  shot, think it was greater. You're a nurse think it's wonderful. We're not screening
[02:00.020 --> 02:04.340]  the calls. We've done these shows before no one calls in except victims of getting sick
[02:04.340 --> 02:08.820]  by getting hurt and nurses talking about preenies die when you give them shots. And that's even
[02:08.820 --> 02:18.260]  in the news by the way. So this is a well-known fact and that's why England again when they
[02:18.260 --> 02:22.020]  started this over a month ago within a few days of it they said okay here's three groups
[02:22.020 --> 02:26.180]  should not take it. This was the main advisory board to the British government, the national
[02:26.180 --> 02:31.460]  health service, but then they basically ignored that. No one under no one over 75, no one
[02:31.460 --> 02:38.740]  under 16 and no one pregnant should take the COVID-19 vaccine. But they don't care. And
[02:38.740 --> 02:43.060]  you sure as hell need to watch out when you take the second dose because it's going to
[02:43.060 --> 02:46.780]  cause that big autoimmune response. And the word is now if you come in contact with a
[02:46.780 --> 02:51.300]  regular cold virus and you're already old, you're going to have an autoimmune response
[02:51.300 --> 02:55.100]  like the Spanish flu that's going to kill you. That's what top scientists that look
[02:55.100 --> 03:01.380]  at the breakdown of the Pfizer and Moderna and these other mRNA vaccines are all basically
[03:01.380 --> 03:07.540]  the same is they're like this is not all stuff it shouldn't have in it like jellyfish genetics
[03:07.540 --> 03:17.260]  and it's got the entire genome of a boy that died and a baby that died in 1963 that they
[03:17.260 --> 03:22.140]  keep cloning the cells of and you can't make this up. And then one of them's got connections
[03:22.140 --> 03:26.900]  to the black lady that died in 51 the first immortal gene line they found where they can
[03:26.900 --> 03:32.100]  put the cells under a petri dish and they never die unless you put a blowtorch to them
[03:32.100 --> 03:37.740]  like it's a yeah again the woman doesn't live forever it's the cancer cells that do so they're
[03:37.740 --> 03:41.060]  jacking with some stuff they're doing some weird stuff I'm not even to pretend I know
[03:41.060 --> 03:46.660]  all of it but the top scientists are saying that just the just the Pfizer one the former
[03:46.660 --> 03:54.140]  chief scientist there said attacks a general protein that is in all mammals placentas
[03:54.140 --> 04:00.300]  including humans and then it will attack the placenta and what the hell are they doing
[04:00.300 --> 04:07.820]  so I'm explain that again it makes your body have an autoimmune response to yourself where
[04:07.820 --> 04:17.140]  the peanut allergies come from they didn't know yeah that's a separate article about
[04:17.140 --> 04:25.820]  the horseshoe crowd that's not a colony creature it's it's the the the Pfizer vaccine has jellyfish
[04:25.820 --> 04:33.380]  luminescence DNA in it that's that's in the actual report so we're gonna we're gonna talk
[04:33.380 --> 04:39.100]  about it all here today I just I'm completely blown away Hank Aaron dead at 86 after getting
[04:39.100 --> 04:43.540]  a second round of the covid shot and it is the people that work here have family that
[04:43.540 --> 04:46.620]  runs nursing homes you name it they say man the old folks are out running around having
[04:46.620 --> 04:50.820]  a good time they got the shots they're all in bed one's dying one's half dead and other
[04:50.820 --> 04:55.340]  ones can't get out of bed they'll all be dead soon it's just another little liberal loving

[06:29.900 --> 06:34.660]  of breaking news that Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron has died he's known
[06:34.660 --> 06:40.100]  as the home run king he played 21 seasons for the Atlanta Braves and retired in 1976
[06:40.100 --> 06:46.900]  as baseball's all time home run leader details just coming into our CBS 46 newsroom we will
[06:46.900 --> 06:52.140]  of course have more on this coming up on CBS 46 news at noon and on our CBS 46 streaming
[06:52.140 --> 07:00.540]  app but see Hall of Famer Hank Aaron has died the new from us at five baseball legend and
[07:00.540 --> 07:06.300]  Mobilean Hank Aaron receiving the first dose of Moderna's vaccine today Aaron along with
[07:06.300 --> 07:10.820]  former UN ambassador Andrew Young and former Health and Human Services Secretary Lewis
[07:10.820 --> 07:15.540]  Sullivan getting their shots in the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta the men say
[07:15.540 --> 07:20.260]  they're hoping to send the message to the African American community that the vaccine
[07:20.260 --> 07:30.740]  is safe make me feel wonderful. I don't have it in the corns that are about it at all you
[07:30.740 --> 07:37.140]  know I feel quite proud of myself of doing something like this you know it's just a
[07:37.140 --> 07:45.820]  small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.
[07:45.820 --> 07:51.580]  All thing to do be a hero take the vaccine don't hurt others now they go actually doesn't
[07:51.580 --> 07:56.380]  help stop COVID actually doesn't even help you actually it's much worse than I said Bill
[07:56.380 --> 08:03.980]  Gates told us it's gonna hurt 700,000 people or kill them how's he know that 700,000 people
[08:03.980 --> 08:09.980]  they're just setting the precedent. Hey Hank you know about black folks in Tuskegee tens
[08:09.980 --> 08:15.940]  of thousands of them shot up with syphilis tell them it was vaccines you know about
[08:15.940 --> 08:21.780]  that Hank Hank doesn't know about that Hank's dead now and Hank meant well he was a great
[08:21.780 --> 08:26.580]  guy I wasn't a huge baseball fan out and when I was a kid I was at time to watch it really
[08:26.580 --> 08:32.500]  like Hank Aaron like watching the replays of him. Hank Aaron one of the best baseball
[08:32.500 --> 08:41.380]  players ever a great American dead at 86 deader than a box of nails deader than a hammer
[08:41.380 --> 08:49.820]  deader than a doorknob deader than a mountain of granite got that first shot they said how
[08:49.820 --> 08:55.980]  you feeling right after you took it well I'm feeling good right after you took it now very
[08:55.980 --> 08:59.740]  small percentage of people have convulsions within 10-15 minutes that's why you saw that
[08:59.740 --> 09:07.500]  one nurse pass out but again they did this the National Health Service did this in England
[09:07.500 --> 09:11.220]  when they started a month and a half ago and they had to suspend it within a few days because
[09:11.220 --> 09:19.820]  again old people were dying young people were dying and pregnant women were they were having
[09:19.820 --> 09:25.060]  miscarriages at two months six months eight months nine months it was it was it was some
[09:25.060 --> 09:29.860]  of the babies got saved at eight nine months because it was your body's like whoa I'm getting
[09:29.860 --> 09:34.940]  rid of everything. Everybody knows that too all the inserts in the vaccine say don't give
[09:34.940 --> 09:38.060]  it to pregnant women but they don't ever tell you they'll give you a fact sheet at the clinic
[09:38.060 --> 09:45.580]  oh might have your arm might be a little sore safe and effective they all there's those
[09:45.580 --> 09:50.180]  anti-vaxxers they're against science I'm not a good science actually know the science
[09:50.180 --> 09:55.660]  you could put out clean effective vaccines that were tested they'd be very expensive
[09:55.660 --> 10:02.020]  because most lots would end up being contaminated because if you get anything else in there
[10:02.020 --> 10:06.860]  if wind blows and some pollen gets into the vat or you grow the stuff on peanut protein
[10:06.860 --> 10:13.900]  or you grow it on human cells you grow it on cow cells then it causes all sorts of immunodiseases
[10:13.900 --> 10:19.180]  in the body where your body attacks itself and the scientists have all looked at this
[10:19.180 --> 10:24.420]  medical doctor's virologist again head EU scientist Wolfgang Wodarg advisory board
[10:24.420 --> 10:30.620]  former head of Pfizer chief scientist all came out and they said we have looked at this
[10:30.620 --> 10:38.260]  in depth and this will cause autoimmune disorders that will attack women's placentas and not
[10:38.260 --> 10:45.420]  let the the embryo grow and develop it'll it'll it'll cause again huge autoimmune problems
[10:45.420 --> 10:49.680]  and it may shut off other people's immune systems they said this is a road to hell a
[10:49.680 --> 10:56.620]  gateway to hell this is so dangerous and then I ran into the scientist and owner of a major
[10:56.620 --> 11:04.220]  biotech company that at first said you know the didn't say don't quote him but then they
[11:04.220 --> 11:07.100]  kind of freaked out later said don't don't don't don't say his name so I won't but I
[11:07.100 --> 11:12.660]  mean he just said what all the others said he said it's a gene therapy it's not a vaccine
[11:12.660 --> 11:18.260]  and if you look at what it'll do it's so broad it's going to make your body attack proteins
[11:18.260 --> 11:23.660]  and this gentleman told my lawyers and others he just happened to be using the same facility
[11:23.660 --> 11:29.900]  and knows them do not under any circumstances take that vaccine and my lawyers have known
[11:29.900 --> 11:34.860]  this guy longer they've known me and they said they've never seen him act like that
[11:34.860 --> 11:37.780]  and he said a bunch of other stuff to them and they're just like Jones don't even say
[11:37.780 --> 11:44.020]  that it's it's but I mean he's so pissed off I guess he might say something but Twitter
[11:44.020 --> 11:48.140]  Google YouTube will just ban him doesn't matter he's a scientist doesn't matter he creates
[11:48.140 --> 11:53.140]  real gene therapy stuff antibodies for colon cancer you name it and by the way they've
[11:53.140 --> 11:57.700]  got all this stuff really works and I'm sure it has its issues but this is not designed
[11:57.700 --> 12:02.220]  to work this is designed to screw society up create a bunch of sick people and debilitate
[12:02.220 --> 12:06.820]  us how do you beat America if you're the globalist well you shut us down well China stays open
[12:06.820 --> 12:09.900]  you have a problem that can never be fixed the more testing there is the more cases there
[12:09.900 --> 12:15.780]  are because of the PCR test is 96% fraudulent the false positives that's all admitted that's
[12:15.780 --> 12:20.380]  what's crazy is this is all admitted but the general public just I'm virtue signaling
[12:20.380 --> 12:26.460]  I'm wearing the mask and I'm going to take the shot like Hank Aaron I'm going to do it
[12:26.460 --> 12:32.820]  I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to do it meanwhile Pelosi delivered impeachment
[12:32.820 --> 12:36.860]  articles to the Senate on Monday Mitch McConnell says they're going ahead with it given Trump
[12:36.860 --> 12:42.500]  one month it's going to start in late February National Guard allowed back into Capitol after
[12:42.500 --> 12:47.580]  eviction to parking garage Trump offers DC hotel room why some of the members said that
[12:47.580 --> 12:55.220]  they weren't wearing their mask it's like a class thing now the mask Nazis open look
[12:55.220 --> 12:59.820]  who else wasn't wearing their mask Joe Biden it turns out says I'm not wearing my mask
[12:59.820 --> 13:09.820]  I'm celebrating I'm the president I don't have to talk about a disgusting power trip
[13:09.820 --> 13:14.620]  but that's the essence of authoritarianism they don't have to follow the same laws we
[13:14.620 --> 13:21.060]  all do finally though Politico is first fake news mainstream outlet to hint at Joe Biden's
[13:21.060 --> 13:26.500]  obvious dementia and it's going to get worse and he'll be the one that leaves or 25th amendment
[13:26.500 --> 13:30.660]  that's why they want Trump out of the way because you're going to have major Trump nostalgia
[13:30.660 --> 13:34.580]  they want to have that conviction in the Senate with a trial and I predict they go ahead with
[13:34.580 --> 13:43.060]  it all absolutely incredible but we're going to lay out the latest on covid and this hot
[13:43.060 --> 13:47.380]  mic catching the Joe Biden people talking about plea deals to the deep state totally
[13:47.380 --> 13:53.380]  owns by this is incredible and meanwhile FBI believe Hillary Clinton not Donald Trump was
[13:53.380 --> 13:59.620]  receiving help from foreign influence 2016 memos reveal of course she was writing Vladimir
[13:59.620 --> 14:07.380]  Putin's ding-a-ling I mean absolutely on the payroll she was I don't know it's a family
[14:07.380 --> 14:11.820]  show I'm gonna stop right there she literally snuck in his office once groveling to him
[14:11.820 --> 14:17.060]  these people worship put because he's got all the power and actually runs things that's
[14:17.060 --> 14:20.980]  why they hated Trump they know Putin's beating them and he received whether he's bad or good
[14:20.980 --> 14:24.620]  he actually runs things he's in charge they just they just have the real power they worship
[14:24.620 --> 14:28.020]  well Trump was an American and they hate America and he was actually beating them and cutting
[14:28.020 --> 14:34.980]  them out at least put was throwing them little breadcrumbs payoffs oh yeah money here it is
[14:34.980 --> 14:40.100]  so but with Trump he was actually the president actually breaking balls all over the planet
[14:40.100 --> 14:47.180]  and they feared his ass because he was going to be the super Putin without the authoritarianism
[14:47.180 --> 14:53.860]  but alas we don't want 4% growth rates we don't want a future we want Barabbas give
[14:53.860 --> 14:59.860]  us Barabbas and so a toast to you liberals and leftists the ending of Trump you're gonna
[14:59.860 --> 15:05.020]  get what you want I'll see the headline Jones toast Biden victory it's called being a smart
[15:05.020 --> 15:14.460]  ass Jones wants on air toasted Biden's victory yes it's called sarcasm it's the I did a video
[15:14.460 --> 15:18.820]  about Q on the eve of the inauguration saying oh it's true Trump will be inaugurated the
[15:18.820 --> 15:23.740]  military is going to arrest Biden in a minute ago this is satire it's fake I'm being sarcastic
[15:23.740 --> 15:29.420]  they're still like jones and what's going on he says it in the first part that Trump will
[15:29.420 --> 15:33.740]  be inaugurated he says it isn't I mean you it's like are you that stupid no I know our
[15:33.740 --> 15:38.700]  general audience isn't but some people are and that's what we're dealing with all right
[15:38.700 --> 15:45.660]  the martial law takeover all of it isn't coming it's here Bitcoin sell-offs the purge Biden

[18:21.100 --> 18:31.020]  in black and I fought hard for Trump went through hell got made enemy number one and
[18:31.020 --> 18:36.900]  I wanted him to win and they did steal the election from us but now I'm the underdog
[18:36.900 --> 18:45.020]  again now I'm the rebel now I'm double outlaw I mean make no mistake we were never the establishment
[18:45.020 --> 18:49.820]  we established a beachhead and now we expose their operations show what real prosperity
[18:49.820 --> 18:52.980]  could be show that there was a light at the end of the tunnel a way to get out of this
[18:52.980 --> 18:58.380]  hell and that's their problem they had Reagan they partially control the George W Bush's
[18:58.380 --> 19:03.420]  dad that was terrible and then the Clintons and then George W and then Obama and so people
[19:03.420 --> 19:08.860]  didn't know what was up from down but people saw their gas prices down at the dollar seventy
[19:08.860 --> 19:13.860]  a gallon instead of four bucks a dollar fifty in some areas people saw suddenly their pay
[19:13.860 --> 19:20.180]  tax bigger people saw their tax cuts people saw all the factories reopening because it
[19:20.180 --> 19:26.340]  was all artificially done to sell us out to China where the globalists had invested and
[19:26.340 --> 19:31.220]  then you saw Bill Maher and the Democrats suddenly on all the news show saying we need
[19:31.220 --> 19:35.820]  to kill the economy to teach Trump and his people and then I saw articles in the Financial
[19:35.820 --> 19:42.820]  Times of London we need a global reset a lockdown so that people get worried about money and
[19:42.820 --> 19:47.660]  then and then and then refuse to be populist because they're so poor whatever that means
[19:47.660 --> 19:52.420]  is if they won't know what hit them well now you see them the king the globalist putting
[19:52.420 --> 19:55.580]  us under siege because the peasants revolted so I guess they're going to increase our
[19:55.580 --> 20:01.020]  taxes that's what they always did and because that instinct works for thousands of years
[20:01.020 --> 20:05.700]  that they're doing it again so when you see covid you're under siege and it's never meant
[20:05.700 --> 20:10.980]  to work the more testing the more cases the more lockdowns the worse it gets because people
[20:10.980 --> 20:15.620]  aren't getting in vitamin D3 they get depressed indoors they get phobias of being sick it becomes
[20:15.620 --> 20:21.780]  psychosomatic and study show you think you're going to get sick you do get sick it works
[20:21.780 --> 20:27.580]  like clockwork that's why prayer in all the studies they admit helps cancer patients and
[20:27.580 --> 20:34.300]  others because you need hope your cells battle back through the spirit you've got but let's
[20:34.300 --> 20:41.980]  go over it overhead shot futures slide as euphoria fizzles on renewed lockdown fears
[20:41.980 --> 20:48.580]  see it's not trump killed the economy it was the global lockdown killed it and trump
[20:48.580 --> 20:52.380]  halfway went along with it figured it out pulled out you go to a trump rally nobody
[20:52.380 --> 20:57.260]  was wearing masks but still our own people would say trumps not doing enough okay fine
[20:57.260 --> 21:03.820]  focus on the left and who did it but don't worry don't have trump to kick around anymore
[21:03.820 --> 21:11.500]  towards biden's taking the helm of a sinking ship no the globalist torpedoed our ship biden
[21:11.500 --> 21:18.780]  was riding along on the u-boat on the submarine as we sink he climbs on to have a victory
[21:18.780 --> 21:25.180]  and I guess feed off of us like a buzzard it's a buzzard's bounty the buzzard's beak
[21:25.180 --> 21:28.700]  we are suffering through the most painful economic crisis since the great depression
[21:28.700 --> 21:36.860]  of the 1930s big article Michael Snyder and it's true but here's the issue it was triggered
[21:36.860 --> 21:41.300]  by the lockdowns that are ongoing that's why the migrant waves are coming they say from

[30:49.020 --> 30:53.740]  uh reprogramming they're talking about arresting quote religious extremists for their views
[30:53.740 --> 30:59.140]  and even libertarians that's a quote i made a big deal about it yesterday and you know
[30:59.140 --> 31:03.740]  for me though i've known this was coming so long was right beneath the surface that's
[31:03.740 --> 31:07.500]  like telling somebody hey you got a lot of roaches in this house they're like no i don't
[31:07.500 --> 31:11.380]  they finally turned the light on at midnight to get a glass of milk and there's like 400

[31:49.100 --> 31:53.540]  back when i had time to do such a thing of where to go well i just asked were people
[31:53.540 --> 31:57.420]  that hunted on the same land got the biggest or best bucks or i go out and drive around
[31:57.420 --> 32:02.220]  and look for rubs on trees or where a bunch of paths come together or near a watering
[32:02.220 --> 32:09.300]  hole it's called basic intelligence but the public doesn't have that it's been drummed
[32:09.300 --> 32:19.860]  out of them and now we have these hideous evil predators like joe biden and john brennan
[32:19.860 --> 32:26.700]  on tv saying they're gonna root out they're gonna purge they're gonna arrest they're gonna
[32:26.700 --> 32:31.700]  reeducate they're gonna brainwash they're gonna kill they've got articles about they're
[32:31.700 --> 32:38.180]  gonna kill trump supporters they're gonna route it out and that's why they're gonna
[32:38.180 --> 32:46.060]  have that senate hearing and try to say it's illegal and they could have lawyers up there
[32:46.060 --> 32:50.100]  and argue all day about well under the first amendment there wasn't actually incitement
[32:50.100 --> 32:55.100]  all you do is show nancy polosi the democrats saying burn things down attack things kill
[32:55.100 --> 33:00.620]  trump fifty times what trump said you can show the speech trump gave saying be peaceful
[33:00.620 --> 33:07.780]  or i said be peaceful or were don jr said we're not gonna be violent we march we're
[33:07.780 --> 33:15.420]  not like the democrats we're not like antifa we're not like blm meanwhile of the million
[33:15.420 --> 33:18.780]  people there there are already a hundred thousand or so that started marching with the time don
[33:18.780 --> 33:25.540]  even spoke and again the fact that i've got to even try to defend that is asinine but
[33:25.540 --> 33:31.340]  the left is everywhere saying arrest the nr a for what happened capital arrest senator
[33:31.340 --> 33:38.060]  cruise arrest senator holly oh oh some of the members of the conservatives that were
[33:38.060 --> 33:44.060]  there were seen in the capital the day before casing it for the attack oh everyone's a counter
[33:44.060 --> 33:51.500]  terrorism agent now you watch all the abc cbs nbc shows fox shows it's sycophantically
[33:51.500 --> 33:56.980]  worship homeland security and checkpoints and and and tracking and their terrorist everywhere
[33:56.980 --> 34:01.780]  and meanwhile the people running things are injecting old people with a vaccine that kills
[34:01.780 --> 34:16.340]  them better than hammer the evil is truly right out in the open and it's coming for everyone
[34:16.340 --> 34:20.580]  i've got so much news to hit so much news to cover so many things i want to get to here
[34:20.580 --> 34:28.260]  but i gotta tell you big tech on the establishment are fiddling while rome burns and this is deadly
[34:28.260 --> 34:35.100]  dangerous i mean i personally know ten or more people close to me that i've had family
[34:35.100 --> 34:41.580]  members almost die from covid vaccines i know a whole bunch of other people that know people
[34:41.580 --> 34:46.380]  who've lost loved ones that took it in the nursing homes i know the studies i know the
[34:46.380 --> 34:52.220]  british ministry's own warning i'm but then i've got hank erin takes it and he's dead
[34:52.220 --> 34:56.100]  takes the first shot two weeks ago takes another shot sometime after they say they usually make
[34:56.100 --> 35:02.860]  you wait two weeks and he's dead and then they a lot of times you test positive for covid-19
[35:02.860 --> 35:07.740]  when you've taken it i bet they say he died of covid-19 i mean there's just just crazy
[35:07.740 --> 35:12.580]  we got to watch the public execution of hank erin that's why they said even on npr i was
[35:12.580 --> 35:19.220]  driving them in the car a few days after the election and they were saying well black folks
[35:19.220 --> 35:23.300]  are worried about to ski get other secret testing on them that's why the health service
[35:23.300 --> 35:28.660]  is working with the nih institutes of health to make sure that on that there's educational
[35:28.660 --> 35:33.780]  programs with black leaders and medical professionals convincing african americans it's safe and
[35:33.780 --> 35:39.220]  then all you saw was black nurses giving black people the shot oh look i'm a black nurse so
[35:39.220 --> 35:44.700]  it's showing in oh what if it was a black nurse with a handgun it's like it's okay as long
[35:44.700 --> 35:51.900]  as she's black i mean what does this even mean as if the nurse even knows what's in
[35:51.900 --> 35:59.780]  the damn thing again oh trust the nurse i mean i'm sure the nurse is a nice lady so
[35:59.780 --> 36:03.780]  how many people you got to see you know dive a vaccine or get sick of a vaccine i mean
[36:03.780 --> 36:08.820]  i'll tell you again there are two people that work in this building who lost children
[36:08.820 --> 36:15.380]  where they admitted the vaccine killed in this building one of them 40 feet from me
[36:15.380 --> 36:19.180]  my grandmother got the second round of polio she was a beautiful woman and lovely woman
[36:19.180 --> 36:26.660]  beauty you look like a beauty queen my mother's mother died at 92 a few years ago she was crippled
[36:26.660 --> 36:30.660]  with most of her nerves in her body eaten in an excruciating pain but she put up with
[36:30.660 --> 36:36.180]  it wasn't a victim for the rest of her life for more than two-thirds of her life my mother
[36:36.180 --> 36:45.540]  was four years old when she got paralyzed they had the iron lung and all the rest of it till
[36:45.540 --> 36:52.740]  she fought back and her doctor told her any grace we're sorry it was that second vaccine
[36:52.740 --> 36:57.060]  it was live and then it's even in Reuters that the majority of polio cases are from
[36:57.060 --> 37:04.060]  it now and they don't care they even tell you what they're doing to you know but they
[37:04.060 --> 37:07.900]  won't tell you you need vitamin d or c or zinc or anything essential or that any virus
[37:07.900 --> 37:12.780]  could kill you they won't tell you any of the facts or that when you take all these
[37:12.780 --> 37:17.900]  vaccines it lowers your immunity to regular outside threats because it's the cult of the
[37:17.900 --> 37:22.420]  medical system the cult of the hospitals the cult of being inducted into this and it's
[37:22.420 --> 37:27.420]  a sick spiritual energy and I pray the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior to break
[37:27.420 --> 37:32.220]  the bondage of this medical tyranny that is upon our nation of the Rockefeller science
[37:32.220 --> 37:37.500]  take over 100 years ago that there be a global awakening in those held by the hypochondria
[37:37.500 --> 37:42.260]  and held by this system be broken free from it and be given health and justice and freedom
[37:42.260 --> 37:48.380]  if they just call out in your son's name Jesus Christ I'm in I didn't mean to even
[37:48.380 --> 37:52.660]  pray like that on there but I tell you this touches all of us it touches me it touches
[37:52.660 --> 38:01.580]  me even my family and it makes me so sad I have family even caught in the mental illness
[38:01.580 --> 38:06.100]  I have family that wears mask in their homes I have family that shudder and fear and hide
[38:06.100 --> 38:10.860]  statistics don't matter reality doesn't matter it doesn't matter they're caught in a spirit
[38:10.860 --> 38:15.820]  of fear and God does not give us a spirit of fear but a spirit of victory and a spirit
[38:15.820 --> 38:20.020]  of righteousness and a spirit to overcome and that ain't clear to you now this is a
[38:20.020 --> 38:27.940]  fight between good and evil it's never gonna get clear so your ship in the storm is God
[38:27.940 --> 38:32.820]  your rock to mount your defense your mountain is Jesus Christ and it's real ladies and gentlemen
[38:32.820 --> 38:37.260]  that's why the globalist had to capture the Vatican they had to capture all the institutions
[38:37.260 --> 38:42.980]  before they could take us on and now you're seeing world government genetic market the
[38:42.980 --> 38:50.100]  beast to mind sell global social credit scores robots taking over all of it is here and the
[38:50.100 --> 38:54.180]  very people at the highest levels are even scared themselves and asked me is there a
[38:54.180 --> 38:59.660]  way to get out of this they've got the power they're part of it and they know it's evil
[38:59.660 --> 39:05.540]  and even they don't want to be part of it I talked to top level people that were around
[39:05.540 --> 39:09.460]  Hillary her own people and others and I confirmed it from Larry Nichols God rest easy died last
[39:09.460 --> 39:14.100]  year and Hillary literally went to church and prayed to Jesus and then she went and
[39:14.100 --> 39:19.620]  had satanic events as well she was so conflicted and scared she said well I'm hedging my bets
[39:19.620 --> 39:23.980]  isn't that perfect for these people they're lukewarm I spit you out of the mouth she's
[39:23.980 --> 39:29.460]  a devil worshiping satanist and she goes to church and and prays to Jesus that's imagined
[39:29.460 --> 39:35.660]  I mean the mind control of that man I mean if you had Jesus lady you'd be running away
[39:35.660 --> 39:39.580]  from the devil not out of fear but for the love of Christ because when the devil gets
[39:39.580 --> 39:45.900]  close the God moves away you want to get behind me Satan as we blast off into eternity with
[39:45.900 --> 39:55.140]  unlimited things you can't even imagine ready for us on the other side beyond the veil due
[39:55.140 --> 40:00.260]  to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain many of the best selling products implores

[41:07.940 --> 41:13.340]  the world from the uk to brazil they were desperate they admitted their own publications

[43:59.940 --> 44:23.940]  well i like to inspire a great awakening and last week i did a really nasty rant the
[44:23.940 --> 44:29.020]  alex jones black bill rance what it's called it's gone viral with millions of views online
[44:29.020 --> 44:33.140]  and a major talk show host national talk show host sent me a message yesterday saying i can't
[44:33.140 --> 44:37.540]  disagree with this and that talk show host said a really good 30 minute breakdown on
[44:37.540 --> 44:41.700]  what really going on last night now the secret police the intelligence agencies have announced
[44:41.700 --> 44:47.780]  they're going to come after libertarians christians everybody by name so it just shows that really
[44:47.780 --> 44:52.340]  laying out how much trouble we're in gets people to wake up not candy coating it and
[44:52.340 --> 44:57.140]  then last night i had dinner with joe rogan and some other folks some scientists and they're
[44:57.140 --> 45:02.940]  really awake so there's a lot of good news happening but we're not going to get there
[45:02.940 --> 45:07.820]  without shaking people out of their doldrums and saying hey trump isn't going to save you
[45:07.820 --> 45:15.300]  so we salute biden sarcastically ok most popular man in american history what a lie we're going
[45:15.300 --> 45:19.540]  to fight everything you do we're going to legally and lawfully remove you we don't buy
[45:19.540 --> 45:24.940]  a damn thing you stand for so here is the video that's gone so viral well tucker carlson
[45:24.940 --> 45:29.460]  and others just saw a short clip of it online we've doled it up our great wilson has added
[45:29.460 --> 45:35.180]  some clips to it but here it is and it's a alex jones black pill ran i want to explain
[45:35.180 --> 45:37.980]  something here to everybody okay if i seem really irritable and mad it's not with the
[45:37.980 --> 45:44.580]  crew i'm just done with all this and i meant to come in here today and say this is my last
[45:44.580 --> 45:49.500]  broadcast and by that i'm going to keep doing shows but i mean you understand folks i believe
[45:49.500 --> 45:52.260]  they're going to shut everything down the next few months they're going to blow up federal
[45:52.260 --> 45:56.500]  buildings they're going to put poison in in in water supplies i mean it's over it's over
[45:56.500 --> 46:00.380]  you understand your only shot you've got is realizing that we're screwed your candy-ass
[46:00.380 --> 46:04.260]  church isn't going to do it your candy-ass boss is going to do it we're a trained group
[46:04.260 --> 46:08.460]  of monkeys in this country we're not what americans used to be we're not rugged individualists
[46:08.460 --> 46:12.260]  we don't stand up for the bill of rights and constitution we're a joke okay and so they
[46:12.260 --> 46:16.900]  got people like bryan skelter if they're saying shut down all of his competition on tv now
[46:16.900 --> 46:21.780]  he thinks he owns you jeff sucker thinks he owns you these are bad people okay so i've
[46:21.780 --> 46:25.420]  done the best job i can i'm not bitching at the crew or you or anybody i'm just saying
[46:25.420 --> 46:29.940]  it's hard for me to get up here and do a normal show when we have a group of corporate criminals
[46:29.940 --> 46:34.860]  literally gang raping us i mean if we ever beat this thing it'll be in the history of
[46:34.860 --> 46:39.860]  like these people were hitler i mean this is unbelievable it's not like oh we're getting
[46:39.860 --> 46:45.340]  there it's bad things are out of control it's it's they just begun they're gonna take your
[46:45.340 --> 46:49.500]  pension funds they're gonna bankrupt they're gonna cut the power off the oil off they're
[46:49.500 --> 46:54.740]  gonna open the borders it's over man it's over it's all gone it's all over they're gonna
[46:54.740 --> 46:59.820]  activate the boogaloo's fbi adl terror forces they're gonna start blowing everything up then
[46:59.820 --> 47:02.940]  they're gonna come arrest all the patriots the idiots will cheer it then they're gonna
[47:02.940 --> 47:07.100]  shut your power off they want you starving in the street they want to rape your wife
[47:07.100 --> 47:13.100]  they're bolsheviks they're jackabins it's all over man all over enjoy in fact america is
[47:13.100 --> 47:18.620]  rotting and deserves it so all your games are over all the tv watching all the laziness
[47:18.620 --> 47:23.980]  all the slack drawings over it's over you're gonna be just like a baby at six months being
[47:23.980 --> 47:29.260]  chopped up at its mother's womb you're not a human you're not essential you're dead they're
[47:29.260 --> 47:34.980]  gonna kill you because you don't care so i'm glad this video is really inspired a lot of
[47:34.980 --> 47:39.140]  people it's alex jones black pill editions actual name of it i call the black pill ran
[47:39.140 --> 47:44.140]  here's tucker carlson getting into just some of this last night the purge is on deep state
[47:44.140 --> 47:49.420]  leader calls for arresting everybody here it is glenn greenwald is the most independent
[47:49.420 --> 47:54.500]  of independent journalists he writes on substack where we hope you support him he joins us tonight
[47:54.500 --> 47:59.940]  glenn this is starting to make me a little bit nervous do the rest of us have caused
[47:59.940 --> 48:07.780]  to be concerned about this trend absolutely a lot of times if you warn of a danger you
[48:07.780 --> 48:12.780]  have to piece things together in order to demonstrate that it's actually coming in this case you
[48:12.780 --> 48:17.460]  don't have to they're explicitly saying precisely what they want to do the thing that struck
[48:17.460 --> 48:22.460]  me so much about that john brennan video is it would be one thing if they were saying
[48:22.460 --> 48:27.900]  look there's a band of people twenty here fifty over here who wear swastika armbands
[48:27.900 --> 48:32.140]  who still are in the kkk there's maybe two thousand we need to that's not what they're
[48:32.140 --> 48:37.340]  saying what he's saying is the exact opposite every group he lifted even libertarians it's
[48:37.340 --> 48:44.340]  essentially he's defining the insurgency as anyone who has an ideology other than neoliberalism
[48:44.340 --> 48:50.140]  in other words other than the ruling class of you that is about to congeal and merge
[48:50.140 --> 48:55.500]  with the power of the state and what they're talking about explicitly talker is using the
[48:55.500 --> 49:00.700]  tools that they use to take ISIS off the internet the tools that they use to destroy al-qaeda
[49:00.700 --> 49:05.660]  they're talking about it as a second war on terror and that first war on terror no matter
[49:05.660 --> 49:11.260]  what your views were originally at the beginning of nine eleven ended up eroding not civil
[49:11.260 --> 49:17.140]  liberties just elsewhere but here at home as well one that is born by name of being
[49:17.140 --> 49:24.060]  a domestic warrant error designed to essentially criminalize any oppositional ideology to the
[49:24.060 --> 49:29.020]  ruling class there is literally nothing that could be more dangerous and it's not fear
[49:29.020 --> 49:35.340]  mongering or alarmism to say it there are bills pending by Adam Schiff as well that would simply
[49:35.340 --> 49:41.020]  take the existing war on terror legislation always aimed at foreign governments and foreign
[49:41.020 --> 49:46.860]  actors and simply amend it to say we can now do that within the United States who's going
[49:46.860 --> 49:51.900]  to stand up in opposition to this I don't see any of the corporate republican caucus really
[49:51.900 --> 49:57.140]  even noticing I see a lot of people I thought were liberal turn on the full report is that
[49:57.140 --> 50:01.420]  info wars dot com it goes on for 30 minutes it's it's it's excellent fact Tucker's intro
[50:01.420 --> 50:08.180]  is even more powerful but for dear from Greenwald they are specifically saying they want to
[50:08.180 --> 50:13.260]  put us in reeducation camps they're specifically saying they're going to brainwash us they
[50:13.260 --> 50:19.460]  have groups that go out provocateur and then burn things down and then are called heroes
[50:19.460 --> 50:24.460]  then they provocateur our event to then blame us and they've got even frontline editing
[50:24.460 --> 50:30.420]  videos to say I called for an attack on the Capitol this is a criminal decision to go
[50:30.420 --> 50:34.220]  for broke so let me explain this is not like other probing attacks as I've said a hundred
[50:34.220 --> 50:43.220]  times they're making their move this is a real neo fascist neoliberal but using a Bolshevik
[50:43.220 --> 50:49.620]  attack model corporate takeover and even though some of the top CEOs do not like this but
[50:49.620 --> 50:54.060]  the big money banks in the shadow monies what controls big tech because I've talked to some
[50:54.060 --> 50:58.060]  of the high level big tech people I'll just leave it at that and they're like Jones we
[50:58.060 --> 51:03.100]  know this is all real we don't know what to do and then I've talked to some other very
[51:03.100 --> 51:07.260]  famous people that have talked to some of the top they go no Jones this person likes
[51:07.260 --> 51:11.060]  you they're scared they don't know what to do they just go along with it what they hoped
[51:11.060 --> 51:15.100]  you would succeed so I want to explain something I don't tell you that to brag I tell you that
[51:15.100 --> 51:20.420]  to understand that there's a lot of good people at the lowest levels the mid levels the highest
[51:20.420 --> 51:24.580]  levels of everything but if you just think it's all magic up at the top and oh they know
[51:24.580 --> 51:29.180]  what's going on they don't it's all this big dark banking money that goes back hundreds
[51:29.180 --> 51:33.540]  of years and it does what it wants and it controls the stock markets and it's anti human
[51:33.540 --> 51:37.940]  and it's nasty I don't know it's you know Satan and an electronic control room running
[51:37.940 --> 51:45.140]  it I don't know what it is but it's an evil intelligence that's operating this entire
[51:45.140 --> 51:57.060]  system and it's very very very very dangerous Robert Barnes coming up we have a really articulate
[51:57.060 --> 52:00.820]  good guy Roger Jones personal lawyer who grew up next door to the Bidens he's going to be
[52:00.820 --> 52:07.780]  joining us Tyler Nixon oh and shroyers coming in the co-host later and then I am taking
[52:07.780 --> 52:11.900]  off a few days be with my family I hardly see my family and I've got a lot of family stuff
[52:11.900 --> 52:19.660]  going on and a lot of stuff needs to be done and so I'm going to take off a few days here
[52:19.660 --> 52:23.300]  and recharge we call it that you know me though all the horses can't drag me away so I'll
[52:23.300 --> 52:29.980]  be here some but it's really up to just getting right with God at this point there's something
[52:29.980 --> 52:35.620]  really important I want to point out right now Bill Gates it's come out secretly is buying
[52:35.620 --> 52:39.860]  up all the major farmland in the US he's the biggest landowner in the country after him
[52:39.860 --> 52:48.180]  it's Ted Turner and others and they're doing this to raise GMO crops on their property
[52:48.180 --> 52:51.380]  that shows you in the future they know where this is going they're going to devalue the
[52:51.380 --> 52:56.860]  currencies you're going to know there's total inflation within six months to a year we're
[52:56.860 --> 53:00.620]  going into economic implosion that was triggered by designed by covid they're going to blame
[53:00.620 --> 53:03.980]  it on covid but they're the ones that are consolidating and imploding the middle class
[53:03.980 --> 53:08.580]  and imploding the third world then flood us with giant refugee masses so the smartest
[53:08.580 --> 53:12.820]  thing you can do is educate people around you get prepared get a small piece of property
[53:12.820 --> 53:18.140]  in a rural area away from everybody just to be safe if the cities go down because I'm
[53:18.140 --> 53:22.060]  serious they're setting up the end of America three economic collapse that's why they have
[53:22.060 --> 53:26.700]  a walking corpse that can hardly talk emblematic of our end this has been well thought out now
[53:26.700 --> 53:30.860]  I hope we can defeat it but there's not some secret trust the plan group coming to save

[56:29.260 --> 56:35.780]  start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable that we are essential

[56:58.900 --> 57:07.660]  cover ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios
[57:07.660 --> 57:16.540]  it's alex jones and so we are back thank you so much for joining us on this january 22nd
[57:16.540 --> 57:26.420]  friday broadcast the year is 2021 now i am scheduled to take a few days off with the
[57:26.420 --> 57:30.860]  family something i really haven't done for real in years and we'll see if i could stay
[57:30.860 --> 57:38.860]  away from the broadcast probably not but oan shroyer will be coming in at the bottom of
[57:38.860 --> 57:45.500]  the next hour he can't be on air with us today because he's doing his community service here
[57:45.500 --> 57:51.900]  in texas for dc for his arrest at the capital if you remember for wearing the tape over
[57:51.900 --> 58:02.940]  his mouth silently in the front entry but on the day of the capital being stormed in
[58:02.940 --> 58:06.380]  the greatest insurrection in world history online with pearl harbour court in chucky
[58:06.380 --> 58:12.380]  schumer after the first riot police gave up only 20 or 30 of them then the police just
[58:12.380 --> 58:18.820]  stood down incredible and that news is coming out the reason that's so important is they
[58:18.820 --> 58:24.660]  are advancing a trial in the senate mitch mcconnell says he intends to have it uh in late february
[58:24.660 --> 58:30.540]  to give trump a month to get ready to get ready for the adl southern part of law centers
[58:30.540 --> 58:36.060]  dream a a senate trial because impeachment is just the indictment they play on the public's
[58:36.060 --> 58:39.660]  hearings and go he's been impeached twice well that means indicted twice not convicted
[58:39.660 --> 58:47.180]  once but if they can have a successful trial and a successful conviction of the president
[58:47.180 --> 58:52.700]  of the united states the 45th president of the united states for edited videos when he
[58:52.700 --> 58:57.820]  said peacefully go to the capital when his son said we're not like the left we don't
[58:57.820 --> 59:02.900]  burn things we don't attack police i mean they had a blind spot like i did not thinking
[59:02.900 --> 59:06.300]  oh the false flag won't be a mass shooting or bombing that's what we were expecting
[59:06.300 --> 59:10.380]  that could happen god forbid but it's a fight for our country we had to be there even the
[59:10.380 --> 59:15.060]  left my state something but to have the police stand down like that we put too much faith
[59:15.060 --> 59:19.700]  in them they followed the orders and i'm not blaming them entirely i should have thought
[59:19.700 --> 59:26.060]  of that but it's simply insane you know i i mentioned last hour that i would get to that
[59:26.060 --> 59:32.340]  this hour next segment i will i didn't have time to watch the whole thing i scanned through
[59:32.340 --> 59:38.940]  it yesterday morning it just aired the night before another front line reediting the old
[59:38.940 --> 59:45.220]  one that attacked me six months ago with with new info and it made me physically sick but
[59:45.220 --> 59:50.100]  if you go to band dot video you will see alex shows talks about what really happened at
[59:50.100 --> 59:57.180]  the capital or just shows what really happened and it and it just shows like a 20 minute
[59:57.180 --> 1:00:04.500]  video of the real clips of us going saying be peaceful getting there saying be peaceful
[1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:11.180]  and then what really happened they edit the tape to cut that out and then they have me
[1:00:11.180 --> 1:00:16.940]  arriving at the capital and then the attack begins they even changed the timeline to try
[1:00:16.940 --> 1:00:21.060]  to frame me it's one thing to see the left doing my own twitter and even new york times
[1:00:21.060 --> 1:00:28.540]  riders doing it but front line specials now edited to deceive so next segment i will show
[1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:38.260]  you what front line aired and then i will show you the video where you can go see what
[1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:42.060]  actually happened i've already played it several times should i play it again i mean there's
[1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:45.380]  like 20 minutes maybe i should play a few of the clips they show and then show it really
[1:00:45.380 --> 1:00:50.780]  happen because these are jump cut clips i mean it's clips where i say let's start marching
[1:00:50.780 --> 1:00:57.060]  they cut their peacefully again peacefully we're not like the left imagine let's start
[1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:04.500]  marching and they cut where i say peacefully peacefully and they do it over and over again
[1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:10.940]  three times i don't have the money the time the energy for the lawsuit to beat this so
[1:01:10.940 --> 1:01:15.220]  they're just gonna be able to lie but just know when you watch things like this they're
[1:01:15.220 --> 1:01:20.060]  all over the news saying i was in the capital they show footage of myself and nick pointe's
[1:01:20.060 --> 1:01:26.500]  inside the Georgia capital peacefully months ago i mean sitting there going to their metal
[1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:31.780]  detector shaking the cops hands that's who i am everybody knows it but they use my rhetoric
[1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:37.620]  of we're gonna crush tyranny freedom 1776 in the info war to say i want violence no that's
[1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:42.060]  you the dirty communists left that's apple that runs death camps in china not me i have

[1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:16.300]  this last hour but i still just can't get over hank erin in the top three or four baseball
[1:03:16.300 --> 1:03:25.340]  players ever i mean definitely a better player than bae bruce 86 receives covet 19 vaccine
[1:03:25.340 --> 1:03:28.620]  and hopes to inspire other black americans do the same wanting to be you know a hero
[1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:36.900]  it was strong hey i'll line up and do it dead two weeks later dead today after he got the
[1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:49.540]  second injection unbelievable absolutely incredible and again they know how to suppress the deaths
[1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:52.620]  because you don't hear about the ones they want you to know about and they got oh 36
[1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:59.020]  here 22 there 18 here nine here seven there and it's almost all old people but usually
[1:03:59.020 --> 1:04:02.940]  it never gets reported when they die they say of a heart attack or they die of a convulsion
[1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:07.700]  or they die of a stroke sometimes the very day of the shot but those are the ones you
[1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:12.900]  mainly end up getting recorded as maybe it was the shot so if i walk up see and shoot
[1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:15.620]  you in the head and you fall down and die and they say maybe it was the bullet killed
[1:04:15.620 --> 1:04:19.980]  you maybe it was a hit in your head on the ground killed you but why did the british
[1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:23.900]  government and i hammered on this yesterday we got to warn everybody you know why did
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:29.900]  the british government come out a month ago when they were the first to start this and
[1:04:29.900 --> 1:04:35.580]  were then two days they said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa if you're above 75 the headline
[1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:42.260]  is yahoo news BBC news you had a minute these are three groups should not take the shot
[1:04:42.260 --> 1:04:57.300]  above 75 younger than 16 or pregnant above 75 under 16 pregnant i mean the damn inserts
[1:04:57.300 --> 1:05:02.540]  always on vaccines say that but oh it's this religious thing of submitting the system and
[1:05:02.540 --> 1:05:05.940]  there's no long-term studies on these mRNA shots that aren't even vaccines they're gene
[1:05:05.940 --> 1:05:17.060]  therapy so they only put that out to CYA cover their fanny cover their arse their gluteus
[1:05:17.060 --> 1:05:26.180]  maximus and they just set the present to roll this out get rid of the old people and that's
[1:05:26.180 --> 1:05:29.860]  what John Rapport day one eleven months ago when this all cranked up said it was about
[1:05:29.860 --> 1:05:35.380]  but i covered that great detail last hour let's let's move back to what i said i would
[1:05:35.380 --> 1:05:42.620]  cover last segment
[1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:47.620]  they are planning to have the senate trial against president trump so that he can't
[1:05:47.620 --> 1:05:54.180]  well for several reasons so that he can't run for political office again and so they
[1:05:54.180 --> 1:05:59.020]  can demonize the trump brand and demonize the american people and have a huge spectacle
[1:05:59.020 --> 1:06:03.460]  to talk about what happened on january six of the capital and that's why i've seen their
[1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:10.940]  disinformation lies go to an entirely new level of disinformation against myself against
[1:06:10.940 --> 1:06:17.980]  president trump against many others where they say that we said go attack the capital
[1:06:17.980 --> 1:06:22.860]  our motive was to get them to do the ten days of investigation that no one had done that
[1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:27.900]  each senator ten crews was pushing we've had huge rallies up to a million people previously
[1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:32.140]  in dc with literally no arrests during our rallies at night there'd be a few fights a
[1:06:32.140 --> 1:06:36.380]  few stabbings and this is like the equivalent of ten nfl football games going on you have
[1:06:36.380 --> 1:06:41.660]  more crowd than one of those we had at one of our events but nothing's perfect that's
[1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:46.300]  what happens in a big city when a city you know gets a million extra people in it just
[1:06:46.300 --> 1:06:53.060]  there's things go wrong but it's a very orderly law abiding crowd trump is known as that and
[1:06:53.060 --> 1:06:57.780]  so they're like jones why is jones confessing that he paid for the riot and they're just
[1:06:57.780 --> 1:07:02.540]  thousands of complaints the fbi the fbi told us just false complaints i was in the capital
[1:07:02.540 --> 1:07:09.300]  i was saying burn it i was doing this it's all lies soon as i got there people already
[1:07:09.300 --> 1:07:13.660]  gotten there by the hundred thousand probably i don't know and i was trying to stop it because
[1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:19.220]  that trump was coming to speak at the damn thing we had a little stage back around the
[1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:24.860]  other side that was set up and not before we get there it's gone we were set up so manty
[1:07:24.860 --> 1:07:31.500]  fuss and fbi provocateur right wing groups boogaloo's they were there same group went
[1:07:31.500 --> 1:07:37.820]  after the michigan governor to make her look like a victim and we saw it unfold but talk
[1:07:37.820 --> 1:07:44.700]  about next level frontline used to be popular it's not anymore because it's a joke well they
[1:07:44.700 --> 1:07:51.060]  had a frontline six months ago with a bunch of lies about me and now they come out with
[1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:58.540]  a new frontline episode that is well to say the least part for the course absolutely part
[1:07:58.540 --> 1:08:03.740]  of the course united states of conspiracy they took the last episode maybe added 10 minutes
[1:08:03.740 --> 1:08:09.780]  of new footage into it scrolled it about and then changed uh you know the name to a whole
[1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:13.860]  other show on frontline and i'm not going to play the whole thing and decide by side
[1:08:13.860 --> 1:08:17.380]  comparison would take too much time with other news to cover which is an example of deception
[1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:23.460]  ahead of trumps trial and the senate but trumps should actually invite this trial and the
[1:08:23.460 --> 1:08:29.100]  senate because under due process he'll have 50 50 the time he can play the videos of antivacine
[1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:32.780]  let's burn this place down and break it down he could show how boogaloo's have been federally
[1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:37.260]  funded and protected and unarrested he can show how they provocateur and had the riot
[1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:41.900]  police attack the peaceful crowd so that's someone in the crowd says charge alex jones
[1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:47.420]  says so we now know that was from reports witnesses saw it to then have a few hundred
[1:08:47.420 --> 1:08:51.460]  people out of a hundred thousand already gotten there hundreds of thousands more coming from
[1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:57.340]  the ellipse trump is still speaking to then try to get a huge crisis going and a kidnapping
[1:08:57.340 --> 1:09:01.460]  and members of congress but it didn't happen it it failed it was a dud like a firecracker
[1:09:01.460 --> 1:09:06.220]  that kind of pops but doesn't pop like it should sometimes you'll shoot one of those
[1:09:06.220 --> 1:09:12.020]  mortars off and instead of going all those colors a little bit kind of spurts that's
[1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:16.780]  what happened thank god pipe bombs were found they didn't go off you said we walked into
[1:09:16.780 --> 1:09:21.700]  a trap we have to fight the election fraud we had to go peacefully expose it but it's
[1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:25.900]  next level for them to do this show so I'm going to show you a if your TV or I'm going
[1:09:25.900 --> 1:09:30.220]  to show you banned out video and the name of the video where you can go see the footage
[1:09:30.220 --> 1:09:35.340]  of me dozens of times saying let's be peaceful and then getting there and trying to stop
[1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:39.980]  them and saying let's be peaceful and it's called alex jones lays out what really happened
[1:09:39.980 --> 1:09:46.620]  at the Capitol and then go watch frontline where they literally edit out where I say
[1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:53.020]  be peaceful they even took footage when I was at the Capitol expressly saying we don't
[1:09:53.020 --> 1:09:56.860]  want a new kid state we need to basically go to the other side where we have a permit
[1:09:56.860 --> 1:10:00.660]  let's be peaceful don't go in the Capitol and they literally turn that into me arriving
[1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:07.260]  right when the attack starts edit it where I say attack basically and then they edit
[1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:11.980]  out where I'm not even there and I'm actually a mile away when this happens I mean this
[1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:16.100]  is the fraud of these criminals so this is who they are praying on your mind praying on
[1:10:16.100 --> 1:10:20.900]  your children in school let's go ahead and roll the frontline piece here it is they
[1:10:20.900 --> 1:10:27.260]  rigged it like they've never rigged an election before we won in a landslide this was a land
[1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:44.100]  slide 400,000 ballots appeared from nowhere we will stop the steal we're gonna walk down
[1:10:44.100 --> 1:11:00.020]  to the Capitol and I'll be there with you
[1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:25.980]  and we fight we fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell you're not gonna have
[1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:45.900]  a country anymore today is not the end it's just the beginning
[1:11:45.900 --> 1:11:50.740]  so that's just one small piece of the deception they kind of have one spot where I say peaceful
[1:11:50.740 --> 1:11:54.740]  civil disobedience but then they edit it where I'm there and I say attack fight for
[1:11:54.740 --> 1:11:58.740]  Trump and they charge him and I wasn't even there and they cut all the places I said let's
[1:11:58.740 --> 1:12:04.020]  be nonviolent let's be peaceful and then they cut it in like I'm up there commanding people
[1:12:04.020 --> 1:12:09.580]  to surge into the Capitol when I'm actually saying don't do this turn back they they they
[1:12:09.580 --> 1:12:20.020]  dub over USA USA fight for Trump incredible deception incredible fraud the worst thing
[1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:25.260]  for us to happen was the 200 people out of hundreds of thousands breaking into the Capitol
[1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:28.980]  why would we do that we didn't and now we know it was leftist help lead it help trigger
[1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:32.660]  it and the police were told to stand down so that's the reality of what happened it's
[1:12:32.660 --> 1:12:37.380]  very very serious I want to come back going into more the latest on the former CIA director

[1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:38.980]  a lot of that in the first hour and coming up Roger Stone's personal lawyer and also
[1:15:38.980 --> 1:15:44.380]  relative Richard Nixon even looks like an interesting fellow army veteran patriot will
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:53.300]  be joining us coming up Tyler Nixon in the third hour and in Robert Barnes said he could
[1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:58.380]  pop in today we haven't gotten in touch with him yet but he he may be coming up to actually
[1:15:58.380 --> 1:16:02.900]  give you a briefing on the situation and the and the path forward what he thinks is gonna
[1:16:02.900 --> 1:16:07.540]  unfold next segment but we'll see a lot of times he says he can do it but then he shows
[1:16:07.540 --> 1:16:13.700]  up last minute so look forward to having Robert Barnes on if that materializes but I wanted
[1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:18.660]  to talk about Antifa burning American flags for the second night after Biden was sworn
[1:16:18.660 --> 1:16:24.740]  in burning buildings tagging police stations and I have all these videos of the police
[1:16:24.740 --> 1:16:29.660]  in Oregon in Seattle other areas politely asking him please stop please stop burning
[1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:35.140]  the building please stop breaking the windows and so Trump never caught the National Guard
[1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:39.300]  on him when federal officers would defend themselves while being hit with hatchets they
[1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:43.980]  were called terrorists on the news I don't care if you're an Antifa method devil worshiper
[1:16:43.980 --> 1:16:49.340]  or some wound up deranged you know crazy that still likes Trump some of those exist being
[1:16:49.340 --> 1:16:54.060]  led by provocateurs you don't just randomly hit federal officers or old ladies or white
[1:16:54.060 --> 1:16:58.660]  people or black people or Chinese people or anybody with a hatchet you got all that footage
[1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:02.500]  they're trying to break in the federal buildings and hit cops with hatchets and the news defending
[1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:07.020]  it and then you know Pelosi saying well people are gonna do what they're gonna do so where
[1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:12.140]  is the outrage Democrats accused of ignoring latest leftist protest violence that if you
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:16.460]  add it all up together is thousands of times what the few hundred manga people did led
[1:17:16.460 --> 1:17:23.780]  by globalist provocateurs but I'm not defending what happened I'm just simply saying if the
[1:17:23.780 --> 1:17:29.580]  capital event was as bad as Pearl Harbor on January 6 then what Antifa's done is like
[1:17:29.580 --> 1:17:35.140]  blowing the planet up like Krypton I mean obviously that's an exaggeration Antifa hasn't
[1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:40.300]  blown the planet up well what happened on January 6 was not Pearl Harbor but you're
[1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:45.220]  gonna see the Senate hearing and the Senate trial of Trump and you know I'm getting sucked
[1:17:45.220 --> 1:17:49.420]  into this and they got frontline setting me up folks they're licking their lips we're
[1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:56.060]  gonna arrest Jones I still think there's some sliver of jurisprudence and even a leftist
[1:17:56.060 --> 1:18:01.020]  jury is not gonna put me in prison but but maybe I'm wrong and if that's the country
[1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:07.540]  they want to live in so be it I mean this has gotten redonkulous this is insane but
[1:18:07.540 --> 1:18:12.020]  you try to go organize a protest against election fraud the Democrats said there's all this fraud
[1:18:12.020 --> 1:18:15.900]  Trump stole the election four years ago they're not gonna accept it no matter what they're
[1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:22.420]  gonna block the electoral college we do the exact same thing that's actually in the Constitution
[1:18:22.420 --> 1:18:26.260]  you can do it if you've got the votes meaning you know then they're gonna be held accountable
[1:18:26.260 --> 1:18:31.060]  by their voters you better have the goods but that's that's where we are but but let's
[1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:35.380]  talk about every time they say two thousand then it's seven thousand that's twenty thousand
[1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:39.700]  now they're saying it's about thirty thousand migrants the UN set up at Honduras broke into
[1:18:39.700 --> 1:18:44.780]  Guatemala and they admit it's the COVID lockdown triggered this which we told you what happened
[1:18:44.780 --> 1:18:49.740]  this is just the beginning and my son oh don't come up right now I'll give you amnesty
[1:18:49.740 --> 1:18:55.300]  later but he's already getting rid of the wall stop construction put a freeze on deportation
[1:18:55.300 --> 1:19:01.540]  so oh the light went from red to green and now they'll keep implode the third world while
[1:19:01.540 --> 1:19:06.300]  sending all these poor folks up here so you want to see a real insurrection these are
[1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:10.620]  people in insurrection against borders and against the sovereignty of countries to swap
[1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:15.020]  western world for the globalist to bring us into collapse which is their admitted model
[1:19:15.020 --> 1:19:18.540]  their admitted plan so I'm not against the poor migrants who the globalist have hit with
[1:19:18.540 --> 1:19:22.980]  an economic weapon but it's the globalist that I told you eleven months ago to do this
[1:19:22.980 --> 1:19:28.300]  you'll see migrant waves the likes of which you've never imagined so here's German TVs
[1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:33.180]  take on it just a few days ago thousands of migrants from Central America are gathering
[1:19:33.180 --> 1:19:38.980]  in Guatemala for an expected to push north towards the United States Mexican border forces
[1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:43.780]  are alert for their arrival it's thought the migrants are hoping Joe Biden's incoming
[1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:47.420]  administration will be less tough on migration than the current one
[1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:56.260]  determined not to stop till they reach the US this group of several thousand Honduran
[1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:04.300]  migrants now in Guatemala have been walking for weeks some of them clashed with Guatemalan
[1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:17.060]  police as authorities try to push them back towards the border but with little effect
[1:20:17.060 --> 1:20:22.860]  escaping an economy battered by the pandemic gang violence and hurricanes they're seeking
[1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:32.980]  a better life in the north going after the American dream because in our country there's
[1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:39.620]  no jobs there's a lot of crime and you cannot make a living our house was swept away by
[1:20:39.620 --> 1:20:53.340]  hurricanes with a new US administration being sworn in next week and Joe Biden promising
[1:20:53.340 --> 1:21:01.060]  a more humane approach to immigration these travelers are hopeful first I'll find a job
[1:21:01.060 --> 1:21:10.500]  in the US we think about our families and want to help those who helped us Mexican authorities
[1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:16.780]  have deployed 500 officers to the border an agreement with the US stops them letting migrants
[1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:25.260]  through but like so many before them the people here see no alternative but to keep pushing
[1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:32.220]  on so this is all an admitted plan I mean I read 20 years ago when they had leaked North
[1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:39.940]  American Union documents they said we'll use disease X that's what they said and we'll
[1:21:39.940 --> 1:21:44.780]  use that to say that the economy has to be shut down for quarantine that will then cause
[1:21:44.780 --> 1:21:49.500]  a giant migrant wave and we'll bring in world government using migrant waves and then again
[1:21:49.500 --> 1:21:54.260]  11 years ago operation lockstep says the same thing that was public and when I saw them
[1:21:54.260 --> 1:21:57.620]  two years ago announced disease X is imminent they always tell you what they're about to
[1:21:57.620 --> 1:22:01.620]  do I said okay it's imminent it's imminent the music Jones claims will be locked down
[1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:06.340]  to force inoculations and then it's all imminent well I mean they're following the plan do
[1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:10.860]  I know the day or the week or the month no but we've generally learned these people sit
[1:22:10.860 --> 1:22:14.140]  up there like we don't even exist they just sit up there and admit global government and
[1:22:14.140 --> 1:22:18.260]  admit the new world order and admit all of this like like we're idiots but they admit
[1:22:18.260 --> 1:22:22.620]  it again in their white papers and communications I mean how small swab gets up there and says
[1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:26.900]  covid's not a threat we're using it to take over to shut down the economy to save the
[1:22:26.900 --> 1:22:32.420]  earth of course he's really just consolidating power by the way I'm not shutting things down
[1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:35.100]  they're trying to shut down the independent media we need your support we love you we

[1:26:10.300 --> 1:26:16.300]  the supreme ruler and creator of the universe the simoan people would drink kava tea during social
[1:26:16.300 --> 1:26:22.060]  gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little nowadays kava is used around the world by
[1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:28.380]  many who enjoy its serious benefits the new kava chill by dr jones naturals contains a full blend

[1:27:12.620 --> 1:27:18.380]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is robert barn stepping in for a brief bit the we're
[1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:23.260]  going to discuss today what are some of the president's solutions moving forward what are
[1:27:23.260 --> 1:27:29.020]  some of the solutions for populism moving forward where the president can be a proactive productive
[1:27:29.020 --> 1:27:33.900]  component of that so in that capacity let's talk about some things that have kind of been
[1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:39.660]  distractions that are not necessarily part of those solutions and then let's further bridge into
[1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:44.940]  what some of those solutions might actually look like so there's been some discussions of something
[1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:52.460]  called a writ quote waronto which is an old writ which was usually issued by the king back during
[1:27:52.460 --> 1:27:58.700]  the days of early england which basically said do you by what authority do you hold this position
[1:27:58.700 --> 1:28:04.220]  underneath the king and the king would be the one to actually issue the writ there has been in the
[1:28:04.220 --> 1:28:09.340]  united states those rits have mostly gone away in the common law and have been codified within
[1:28:09.340 --> 1:28:15.660]  various statutes so in the particular in the context of a federal officer the district of
[1:28:15.660 --> 1:28:24.140]  columbia code includes the writ by statute and it allows the united the attorney general a us attorney
[1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:29.260]  or a private citizen to bring that writ that says by what authority do you hold a particular
[1:28:29.260 --> 1:28:34.460]  position and challenges whether or not someone has holds a position a public office of trust for
[1:28:34.460 --> 1:28:42.940]  example by some has usurped it has improperly obtained it or something of that nature historically
[1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:48.380]  there's some question about whether that even applies at all to the president because some of
[1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:53.420]  the public officers and officers of the executive branch doctrine were considered to be people
[1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:59.660]  beneath the president but the way that protocol works is if the us attorney general or the us
[1:28:59.660 --> 1:29:05.340]  attorney for the district of columbia refuses to go along you have to get a federal district court
[1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:11.900]  to go along and that is an improbable solution so there are people that are focused on that i doubt
[1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:16.700]  that president will have any participation in that and those people talking about it honestly
[1:29:16.700 --> 1:29:20.380]  they're just you know it's i understand why they're looking at it but it's not something that is
[1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:26.380]  likely to achieve any particular positive outcome instead really the more productive focus for the
[1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:31.980]  president aside from dealing with and contesting and challenging the proceedings that are taking
[1:29:31.980 --> 1:29:39.420]  place in the senate in this sort of absurd trial this unprecedented unconstitutional trial
[1:29:39.420 --> 1:29:44.460]  one part of the solutions that the president can be to preserve and protect the constitution
[1:29:44.460 --> 1:29:50.540]  would be to contest that senate trial in the courts in advance force the courts to address
[1:29:50.540 --> 1:29:58.060]  whether or not the senate has the power to impeach to convict someone who is not in fact a current
[1:29:58.060 --> 1:30:03.580]  elected official within the federal government because if they have the power to impeach someone
[1:30:03.580 --> 1:30:09.020]  simply because they once held federal office then you could just go around impeaching your
[1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:13.900]  political adversaries all the time you could have historical trials just for the heck of it
[1:30:13.900 --> 1:30:20.300]  uh of people who are dead so if the you know the one positive solution the president could take or
[1:30:20.300 --> 1:30:27.020]  make is by contesting the senate's constitutional authority to even can uh conduct a trial in
[1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:31.180]  the first place because that will protect the constitutional rights of a bunch of other people
[1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:36.700]  and will preclude the senate from taking sort of preemptory action against uh political dissidents
[1:30:36.700 --> 1:30:43.580]  it dislikes uh in the future so the the right now they're setting out basically a trial schedule
[1:30:43.580 --> 1:30:50.220]  that has a trial being conducted in february uh my view is the president should file a suit in the
[1:30:50.220 --> 1:30:54.540]  uh in the same as professor dirshowitz professor turley some others have also agreed with this
[1:30:55.260 --> 1:30:59.980]  file a preemptive action in the courts and forced the courts to address it up front in advance
[1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:06.460]  of the actual trial proceeding itself that the senate has no constitutional power to conduct
[1:31:06.460 --> 1:31:11.340]  a trial over someone who's not an official of the government that's the limitation of the
[1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:19.100]  constitution is to impeachment itself not of a of an existing officer not of an x official secondly
[1:31:19.100 --> 1:31:25.180]  the constitution prohibits something that's called bills of attainder these bills of attainder used
[1:31:25.180 --> 1:31:31.340]  to be the legislature would often hold criminal trials against its political distance or adversaries
[1:31:31.340 --> 1:31:36.700]  dating back to the parliament parliamentary days in the united kingdom well that's what this is
[1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:43.180]  this is an attempt to punish to try and punish a private citizen who is not a elected official at
[1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:50.220]  this time and the amir act of doing so constitutes a bill of attainder which is explicitly prohibited
[1:31:50.220 --> 1:31:55.340]  by the constitution itself even before we got to the bill of right the third problem and then the
[1:31:55.340 --> 1:31:59.660]  other uh solution the president can bring by contesting this is preserving and protecting
[1:31:59.660 --> 1:32:03.900]  first amendment rights because that's going to be an issue that's going to be big in some of these
[1:32:03.900 --> 1:32:09.340]  upcoming criminal trials and of the dc riots where people are being thrown into the mix
[1:32:09.340 --> 1:32:13.260]  who did nothing who didn't know they were doing anything wrong some of whom had been
[1:32:13.260 --> 1:32:18.220]  these are the there's a group of people who didn't commit any violence who showed up late
[1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:22.380]  who were who were invited in or believe they were being invited in by capital police
[1:32:22.380 --> 1:32:26.460]  who walked within the lines who didn't do anything illicit as far as they knew and
[1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:31.180]  they're being targeted as well including journalists uh on the right not journalists on
[1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:35.500]  the left who are inside the capital filming everything that took place but journalists on
[1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:39.740]  the right are being targeted for potential criminal prosecution and punishment merely for
[1:32:39.740 --> 1:32:46.620]  being present and they're the president trump could help in part make sure that there's a
[1:32:46.620 --> 1:32:50.540]  only the people that committed crimes are targeted related to the capital hill rides
[1:32:51.180 --> 1:32:57.660]  by challenging his impeachment on first amendment grounds because they are trying to remove the
[1:32:57.660 --> 1:33:03.980]  president for constitutionally first amendment protected speech under the constitution a decision
[1:33:03.980 --> 1:33:09.180]  called brandonburg v ohio being the primary one but a range of other decisions in the
[1:33:09.180 --> 1:33:15.260]  jurisprudence that they call true threats jurisprudence or illicit imminent incitement
[1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:22.380]  jurisprudence in order for speech to be unprotected by the first amendment the individuals involved
[1:33:22.380 --> 1:33:31.820]  must first be having an express call for second illicit unlawful action third that could imminently
[1:33:31.820 --> 1:33:37.980]  occur none of those three fit what the president speech was the president never explicitly called
[1:33:37.980 --> 1:33:45.100]  for any unlawful illicit action to the contrary he explicitly called for peaceful protesting
[1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:52.620]  patriotic protesting that was peaceful protesting so he never explicitly called for any illicit
[1:33:52.620 --> 1:33:59.020]  action and of course none of it could meet the standards of illicit imminent action given that
[1:33:59.020 --> 1:34:05.100]  his speech took place when he was talking there was 45 minutes a 45 minute walk away from the
[1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:10.220]  capital and the people who breach the capital had preplanned it so it had nothing to do with
[1:34:10.220 --> 1:34:15.660]  trump's speech anyway they breach the capital at while the president was still speaking so they
[1:34:15.660 --> 1:34:19.660]  were not even the speech couldn't have influenced them because they started breaching the capital
[1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:24.620]  before the president even finished and many of them could not have been influenced by the
[1:34:24.620 --> 1:34:28.380]  speech given they were not even at the speech and there's evidence they didn't even hear it or
[1:34:28.380 --> 1:34:32.860]  listen to it independent and separate from the question of whether or not there were other
[1:34:32.860 --> 1:34:38.620]  imminent inciters there of course alex jones took the actions to make sure it didn't get out of hand
[1:34:38.620 --> 1:34:44.060]  because as soon as he saw it was happening told people stay out get out and to stay away from it
[1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:49.020]  and saved a lot of people's lives and freedom so one productive solution the president can take
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:55.500]  is to contest the constitutionality of this senate trial upfront by doing so he not only
[1:34:55.500 --> 1:35:00.540]  protects himself in his own future candidacy if he decides to run for reelection and the power and
[1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:06.460]  leverage the threat of his future candidacy provides the populist movement but co-equally
[1:35:06.460 --> 1:35:11.420]  it protects the constitutional rights and liberties of all potential future candidates
[1:35:11.420 --> 1:35:16.620]  and all potential future office holders by constricting the senate's ability to investigate
[1:35:16.620 --> 1:35:23.260]  or impeach or convict except in cases of existing office holders and last but not least it protects
[1:35:23.260 --> 1:35:28.380]  the first amendment rights that not only of the president and the future presidents and future
[1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:33.180]  political and public officials and precludes the power of impeachment from being utilized
[1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:39.260]  to punish this such speech it also protects the speech of people who may be getting swallowed up
[1:35:39.260 --> 1:35:45.660]  in the capitol hill riots who were not co-complicit co-conspirators in those events criminally and
[1:35:45.660 --> 1:35:50.140]  were simply there believing they were expressing their rights to protest their rights to petition
[1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:55.740]  for regressive grievances and were unaware that they had been caught up in something that was
[1:35:55.740 --> 1:36:01.740]  done by others in terms of illicit activities but he also could have and also limit and constrict
[1:36:01.740 --> 1:36:06.860]  the coming domestic terrorism laws and make clear up front that imminent incitement is still the
[1:36:06.860 --> 1:36:12.860]  standard and that protects speech and you can't start using criminal laws to effectively go after
[1:36:12.860 --> 1:36:18.780]  and target people solely and wholly because of their speech so that's just one place the president
[1:36:18.780 --> 1:36:24.620]  could take productive proactive solutions moving forward and when we come back after the break
[1:36:24.620 --> 1:36:30.700]  we'll get into the many other places the president can play a key role in providing solutions for the
[1:36:30.700 --> 1:36:36.620]  burgeoning national populist revolution that is going to continue taking place to restore our
[1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:41.500]  constitutional democracy to our constitutional roots so come back right after the break
[1:36:43.500 --> 1:36:47.980]  hey alex how you doing man is this the guy that called in about living defense

[1:37:51.820 --> 1:37:56.860]  some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the united states that spread
[1:37:56.860 --> 1:38:03.180]  across the world from the uk to brazil they were desperate they admitted their own publications
[1:38:03.180 --> 1:38:08.540]  they didn't know what to do and so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated state law
[1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:14.300]  and stole it better than death and now they're coming after the president they're coming after

[1:40:46.780 --> 1:40:52.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:52.220 --> 1:41:17.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. This is Robert Barnes stepping in for a brief bit.
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:22.480]  The other parts where let's move on to other steps the president can take to be
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.960]  part of this populist revolution that's an ongoing phenomenon to restore
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:32.160]  America's constitutional Republican. It's democratic liberties that were gifted
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:37.920]  to us by our forebears for the last two centuries. So for example one thing the
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:41.960]  president can do is to step into the breach of those places and parts of the
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:47.600]  economy where increasingly if you are of a particular political persuasion you
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:50.800]  are have are going to be subject to marginalization. You're going to be
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:54.120]  subject to suppression. You're going to be subject to censorship. You're going to
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.280]  be subject to exclusion. To give an example one very positive thing the
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:02.960]  president did but on his way out the door was to preserve and protect the
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:07.320]  ability of people to have access as consumers to capital and credit from
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:12.160]  banks without regard to their political beliefs. And in fact this is was passed
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:16.440]  by the office of the controller of currency. The Biden administration is
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:20.520]  already committed to trying to unwind that protection. So what does that mean?
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:25.680]  Well you saw again today also in the news more banks closing off accounts of the
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:29.720]  president himself personally. Not only Deutsche Bank and other banks but now
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:33.520]  multiple banks where he has done business over the years. Any bank that was
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:37.240]  really listed in his financial disclosure many of them are removing
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:41.960]  Trump's ability to even bank at those accounts. Now of course frankly banking
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:45.600]  is as much a privilege for the banks as it is for the person and that's why it
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:49.280]  is important that we preserve and protect independent means of access to
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.720]  credit and capital for people regardless of their political belief system. One
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:58.920]  way the president can participate in that regard is not just in helping
[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:02.400]  create PACs and political organizations and political groups that lobby state
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:07.280]  legislatures that pass new laws that include the a sort of new bill of
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:11.200]  rights for the First Amendment that protects your right to access a capital
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:15.040]  your right to access social media your right to act your right to employment
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.880]  and education regardless of your political beliefs to prohibit and preclude
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:23.760]  political base First Amendment based discrimination against individuals and
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:27.720]  there the president can take a proactive and productive role with leveraging
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:32.560]  his audience leveraging his marketing skill leveraging his reputation to help
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:36.520]  facilitate that but he could also just take more direct tangible action by
[1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:40.080]  either creating a marketing relationship with a bank or even potentially
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:43.920]  creating his own bank and the idea would be what you have a bunch of people out
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:49.080]  there who now know they cannot trust the establishment banks the institutional
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:53.120]  banks the institutional financial institutions of regular and routine
[1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:56.840]  basics now many of the people that are part of this audience are aware of that
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:00.600]  and have been aware of that but millions and millions of Americans are
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:04.480]  becoming aware of that millions of people around the world are becoming
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:08.760]  aware of that so just as there has been pushback on what Twitter and Facebook and
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:12.840]  Google did in terms of censoring and suppressing the president Facebook
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:17.880]  removing his his access Twitter removing his access and now even YouTube
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:23.680]  through Google reducing his access freezing various TV networks that were
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:29.160]  part of the sort of Trump campaign information distribution machine email
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:33.720]  companies not allowing him to use their email servers to be able to send out
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:38.240]  emails financial and payment processors not allowing him to use those payment
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:42.200]  processing for future campaign or political purposes but now of course you
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:45.960]  have banks going after him personally and professionally and the best way in
[1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:50.000]  which to counteract that is the one thing we can do is to create independent
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:56.840]  economic means outside of the control of this sort of big left oligopoly the to
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:00.720]  sort of get away from the oligarchs and the best way to get away from the
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:06.720]  oligarchs is to restore old-school free market little d democratic economics
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:10.360]  and that can take place aside from changing the laws to make sure people
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:13.360]  are protected for their political expression particularly from these
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:17.800]  private monopolies that are de facto public actors and state actors but
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:22.440]  also the president can use his power and leverage to create like a Trump bank
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:26.880]  imagine what a Trump bank could look like a Trump bank could use cryptocurrency
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:31.040]  a Trump bank could have an independent financial basis for its for any of its
[1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:33.880]  issuance of its currency it could choose different methods and mechanisms of
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:38.200]  backing up its assets independent and separate from just being dependent upon
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:43.240]  the Fed system the he could create the a Trump bank could also make sure
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:47.880]  preserve protect access to capital and credit for anybody regardless of their
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:51.760]  political belief and particularly for Trump supporters so the you would and
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:54.440]  in fact there's going to be high demand for it by people from all over the
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:59.240]  economic spectrum who if you want an honest independent apolitical financial
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:03.440]  institution and that's what everybody who's either investing in a bank putting
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:06.800]  money in a bank or getting money or getting money from a bank in the form of
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:11.120]  loan or credit what they want is a reliable financial partner they don't
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:17.240]  want an unreliable politically motivated emotionally driven partner that
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:21.400]  could undermine their position at any time they wanted literally pull the
[1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:25.440]  carpet out from underneath them at some critical time or juncture just because
[1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:29.200]  of something that does not relate at all to the economics of the transaction to
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.960]  the security of the credit available for the capital purposes so that's where
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:36.840]  the president forming a bank associating with a bank creating a
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:42.480]  Trump bank monetizing his brand marketing his brand which is uniquely
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:47.720]  powerful in the current political environment could help facilitate the
[1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:52.200]  improvement not only for himself but the benefit of everyday ordinary people
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:55.840]  and businesses across the country to be able to have access to capital and
[1:46:55.840 --> 1:47:01.860]  credit outside of big big bank control for its political sensorial role if the
[1:47:01.860 --> 1:47:06.200]  president could do similar actions in the big tech space create his own whether
[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:11.200]  maybe it's something like locals I created a locals board in part because to
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:15.040]  promote locals because it's outside of big-state censorship and control the
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:20.000]  content creator curates the community not any outside independent sensor and
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.120]  that's why I did it the president could do the same the president could create
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:27.120]  probably the ultimate form of a locals board the president could associate and
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:30.960]  affiliate with either gab or other or parlor with other companies and help
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:36.480]  create independent separate social media enterprises that provide for the
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:41.640]  opportunity for a public expression and public association that again monetizes
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:46.360]  his brand monetizes his audience monetizes his reputation well at the
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:51.000]  same time serving and suiting the interest of ordinary everyday people in
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.240]  the expression of our constitutional liberties and building and expanding the
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:59.200]  populist base that got him elected in the first place to make broader bigger
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:04.320]  bolder change across the country in a wide from the local to the city to the
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:08.080]  county to the state to the federal to the national level and so that's another
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:11.800]  place the president can be productive the president can provide solutions the
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:14.760]  president can be part of solutions and the president can be part of those
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:20.880]  solutions well also helping himself financially so it's a win-win bargain of
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:26.080]  exactly the kind the president has had a lifetime of doing performing and it
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:30.320]  successfully achieving in the same capacity of taking on using his
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:34.880]  monetizing his base monetizing his financial institution potential role
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:39.200]  the other place is to promote independent sources of content creation and
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:44.560]  news distribution the model for this of course has always been info wars that
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.480]  the info wars audience and info wars network prove you could operate and
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:55.560]  distribute information you could create content you could share ideas you could
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:00.600]  build a community of similar minded individuals with common interest without
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:06.800]  dependent upon corporate donations and corporate advertising without dependence
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:12.200]  on state funding without dependence on big tech social media platform access
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:16.600]  without dependence on any of that instead it's solely dependent upon the
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:21.720]  audience appreciating it and valuing it and being able and this is a similar
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:26.040]  kind of win-win situation as for Trump the Trump can do with his solutions the
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:29.840]  genius of the info wars model is it's win-win for the audience it's win-win
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:33.920]  because you promote and protect the ideas and ideals you care about keeping
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.120]  open the chains of communication separate from an independent of the big tech
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:42.920]  oligarchs but also you make yourself healthier wealthier and wiser in the
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:47.840]  process because you are purchasing products that help fund the operation but
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:51.600]  they're products that you can get at a discount and products that can make you
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:56.520]  healthier in the process outside of big pharma control outside of big company
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:00.200]  control outside of big business distribution mechanisms because it's a
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:05.640]  direct right to the consumer product line and it the product line is based on
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:09.840]  using alternative health products and other products that you like and that you
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:13.560]  want that are the highest standard in the industry that have extraordinarily high
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:18.360]  review rates so people can get a good product that they need that makes their
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:22.640]  lives better they can get it at a discount and while doing so make sure the
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:27.240]  independent free press stays an independent free press so how you could
[1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:31.520]  do that individually is to go to info wars store calm and you can purchase
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:35.760]  find what products you like there's a wide range of items there knowing that
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:39.120]  in the process of doing so you're not only going to make yourself healthier
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:42.080]  you're going to make yourself wealthier because you're getting products that you
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:47.000]  need and buy on a regular basis anyway but you get them at a discount and
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:51.560]  they're things that make your life more productive more efficient whether it's

[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:23.280]  look at those places where there's a market need fill that need by monetizing
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:27.640]  and marketing your brand to your audience and it's a win for the audience

[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:45.680]  they say this is not over yet don't trust the man with the orange skin oh no
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:55:02.600]  I can't believe it we gotta make him a billionaire oh yeah and then the final
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:09.600]  solution which is a year to two years off is the vaccine I wear my face mask in
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:19.600]  my house so I can so I can stop a symptomatic disease spread to myself
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:32.040]  I wear my face mask when I bite so I can so I can placate all the carons at the
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:41.640]  park
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:52.920]  security TV's got control of me I turn it on they say don't take it off to the
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:56:02.160]  back scenes here oh no wait that's not even gonna stop it go back to work oh
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:12.280]  yeah oh no I can't believe it it's not just a nerdy's like a doctor too oh yeah
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:37.040]  the contact trace is knocking at my door oh no I'm just a number
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:44.160]  we're in the clown world so we might as well have a laugh every once in a while
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:49.960]  at the clown show oh it's Royer here now hosting the Alex Jones show I'll be
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:56.320]  with you for the next hour and then Dr. Nick Begich hosting the fourth hour I'll
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:57:01.960]  then be back in the chair hosting the war room today as well which starts every
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:08.560]  weekday right after the Alex Jones show Tyler Nixon is going to be joining me
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:16.840]  in about 15 minutes and he knows firsthand about the Biden crime family
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:24.320]  he grew up with the Bidens so he knows about the reputation they have he knows
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:30.680]  how they treat their fellow Americans just in the neighborhood growing up and
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:33.560]  the reputation they had and so it's pretty much exactly what you would
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:38.640]  expect in fact you got a little taste of it when Joe Biden signs an executive
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:45.640]  order you have to wear a mask on all federal grounds which does that extend
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:50.360]  to have interstates actually it does you have to wear a mask in your car now
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:55.560]  and so that's where we played the song which was of course a joke when it came
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:59.720]  out what like March of last year whatever you wear a mask in your car to
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:04.280]  stop asymptomatic spread to yourself and so now that's law you'll buy and sign
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:08.560]  that into law and then right after he signs the executive order that you have
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:12.960]  to wear a face mask on federal property he then goes to federal property the
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:17.880]  Lincoln Memorial with his whole family and none of them are wearing masks it's
[1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:21.400]  all about rubbing your face in it it's all about setting the precedent that
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:27.560]  they are a higher class than you they are above you there is no more we the
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:36.240]  people it's them and then you the peon you the pleb but you the surf you the
[1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:38.840]  slave
[1:58:44.760 --> 1:58:48.920]  ladies and gentlemen I've studied history I've interviewed all the experts I
[1:58:48.920 --> 1:58:54.000]  have looked at every facet of this and now only days until the inauguration of

[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:54.240]  segment he's gonna give you a bit of a family history layout the Biden crime
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:57.560]  family he grew up with the Bidens he's very familiar with their activity how
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:02.520]  they're received by the public even they're very aware of who they are I
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:09.720]  think the analogy stands with what we saw from Biden signing the executive
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:13.600]  order you have to wear a mask on federal property and then directly after
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:18.760]  going to a federal property and then his whole family not wearing a mask and of
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:24.280]  course when his press secretary gets asked about this she says oh they were
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:32.160]  celebrating oh they were just celebrating okay so here's now the double
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:35.960]  standard that just shows how you can't even apply it to yourself if you wanted
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:43.880]  to so if you want to go out and riot and loot and burn and and steal and assault
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:49.960]  and murder if you just say black lives matter or antifa then it's okay you'll
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:55.000]  get a bailout and you'll have your charges dropped but if you have an
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:59.400]  American flag if you have a Trump flag if you're chanting USA and you're around
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:05.400]  something like that well then the government's coming after you so again
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:08.440]  remember they were saying Trump supporters can't have rallies they're
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:13.480]  spreading COVID but then they just they didn't even care about all the riots
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:16.200]  that were going on apparently those didn't spread COVID but then they
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:21.720]  literally said oh no COVID smart it knows it doesn't go to these events and go
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:28.800]  but it goes to these events science can like Biden says we'll save 50,000 lives
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:33.000]  with this mask mandate show me that science there's no science he pulls it
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:37.320]  out of his ass he I mean imagine the nerve of a guy standing up there and
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:41.080]  he's just gonna pull a number oh 50,000 lives we'll save with masks why stop
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:49.240]  there we'll save 500,000 lives we'll save 5 million we'll save 500 million lives
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:54.160]  and he might as well he made up 50,000 why not make it all we'll save Biden is so
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:05:01.480]  out of it we'll save 500 billion lives by wearing masks
[2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:08.920]  total nonsense
[2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:16.240]  but so this is where we're at and now if you don't want to wear the mask you
[2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:20.440]  just say you're celebrating right so if you want to have an event if you want to
[2:05:20.440 --> 2:05:25.520]  have a rally if you want to go loot just say BLM or antifa and if you want to go
[2:05:25.520 --> 2:05:29.000]  walk around freely and breathing air without a mask on just say you're
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:35.360]  celebrating if it's good for the president sir you need to wear a mask oh
[2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:39.240]  I'm celebrating I'm just celebrating did you hear Biden said that you can
[2:05:39.240 --> 2:05:43.040]  celebrate you don't have to wear a mask just celebrate you're celebrating if
[2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:46.040]  that doesn't work just go ahead and put the fist up say BLM maybe that'll hit
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:49.680]  him with a the double whammy and then they'll just be spinning around they
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:52.800]  won't even know what's going on you just walk past them at that point they're
[2:05:52.800 --> 2:05:56.680]  just so dizzy with the two thoughts and then the conflicting natures of them
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:04.280]  all so this is the clown world but I will say this new world order is dead on
[2:06:04.280 --> 2:06:10.440]  arrival it is dead on arrival people are done with the masks they're done with the
[2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:15.760]  fake pandemic it's it's over and this is just the general population I can tell
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:19.320]  the general population that's been neutral to this or not wanted to talk
[2:06:19.320 --> 2:06:23.080]  about or whatever they're not done with it they're not sick of it they see the
[2:06:23.080 --> 2:06:31.120]  sham they see the fake and the inauguration of Biden with nobody there
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:36.680]  nobody there nobody there and I don't even know how to properly do it because
[2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:42.600]  I was thinking about this why don't we just show the pictures huh it's like the
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:46.440]  crew just read my mind of Trump's inauguration versus Biden but it's
[2:06:46.440 --> 2:06:53.680]  beyond that because because sure that that shows but it's so much more than
[2:06:53.680 --> 2:06:58.800]  that it's it's the media it's the internet views it's it's the energy of
[2:06:58.800 --> 2:07:05.120]  Trump it's just everything Biden comes to the table with nothing nothing other
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:11.560]  than a 50 year in politics Washington DC resume a total scum swamp creature and
[2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:18.040]  then now all of his problems with his son Hunter Biden's laptop and all of his
[2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:21.800]  problems with his deals in China and Ukraine hey but he's got his window back
[2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:32.160]  guys he's got his window back to creepily stare out of but you know it the
[2:07:32.160 --> 2:07:35.640]  new world order here is dead on arrival now that doesn't mean it's not gonna be
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:39.440]  walking around like a zombie and still try to you know bite your head off or
[2:07:39.440 --> 2:07:43.320]  whatever but it's dead on arrival people are sick of it they know it's fake and
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:50.120]  so I think this is a transition period you know going from a real president
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:55.160]  Donald J. Trump to a fake president Joe Biden and there's going to be a lot of
[2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:58.080]  new things I think that are turning right now they're just gonna organically
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:02.280]  come out of this and I don't think starting a third party is the answer
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:08.280]  maybe it is I don't even know I mean Trump running again in 2024 I'm not
[2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:12.000]  even sure that is the answer the answer is going to be the actions that we the
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:15.760]  people take in the next in the coming days that that's what really the answer
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:20.520]  is gonna be and then we'll just see what happens what happens after that but all
[2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:25.000]  their shams all their fake news all their propaganda their fake their fake
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:29.080]  president it's all being totally rejected people that people played along
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:32.760]  long enough they were made neutral long enough they're done it's over it's all
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:36.400]  over so it's still here it's still going on but it's the walking dead just like
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:41.120]  the president Joe Biden but it's all a big sigh up it's all part of the plan so
[2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:44.320]  it's not Trump's plan it's not Q's plan it's the New World Order's plan and
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:47.560]  they're trusting their plan and so they're gonna move forward with this
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:51.400]  plan and yeah they're gonna mandate the mass they'll probably have the corporate
[2:08:51.400 --> 2:08:55.040]  government mandate the vaccine but it's so unpopular and then Hank Aaron
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:01.840]  probably dies from it where he takes and promotes the vaccine let me just say
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:04.600]  this though before we go to break I have to correct the record on something that
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:08.440]  was said earlier on this show by Alex Jones said that Hank Aaron was probably
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:12.160]  better than Babe Ruth I'm sorry but I just have to say that that I have to
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:16.720]  disagree with that in fact Babe Ruth it's not even close other than the home
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:25.800]  run but anyway point is they use Hank Aaron to promote the vaccine he promotes
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:29.920]  it he does the videos he gets the second word round and then boom dies
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:34.200]  deader than a hammer and they'll and they will probably say it was from
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:38.960]  COVID because or they'll have to lie about it and then change the whole thing
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:46.160]  over this I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee I just love it I
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:51.600]  can't get enough of it we've got a fresh brew right now that's what fills my mug

[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:48.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:12:06.560]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:11.960]  now your host Owen Troyer
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:22.800]  you know they sell Joe Biden as the Scranton kid the fighting Scranton kid
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:29.360]  the rough and tumble the dirt on the knee the scruff on the face the all
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:36.240]  American Midwestern boy the Scranton kid Joe Biden well that's a lie that's to get
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:40.080]  people in Pennsylvania to believe that so that they could win that swing state
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:45.680]  no Joe Biden was a white shoe boy spoiled rotten brat arrogant punk from
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:50.840]  Delaware but they know that image doesn't really sell to middle America so
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:57.640]  they gave you the Scranton kid a made-up legacy nobody knows that better than my
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:04.200]  next guest Tyler Nixon who knows this firsthand growing up with the Bidens
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:07.760]  going to the same high school as them and of course the reputation that Joe
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:14.680]  had earned around town so Tyler joins us now well Tyler it's been quite a first
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:21.000]  two days now I guess for Joe Biden in the White House I think it's now 25
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:26.480]  executive orders in his first two days before that the record was eight so he's
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:32.560]  just smashing as an authoritarian now but tell us the real Joe Biden not the
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:36.840]  Scranton kid that the media tells us he is but but really what was it like
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:41.680]  growing up with the Bidens in Delaware well I mean you have to understand and
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:45.480]  it's good to be with you Owen and you know God bless America and God save
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:51.600]  America frankly I I have known Joe Biden for at least 36 years my mother has
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:57.160]  known him probably going over up on coming up on now let's see 1960s 59 so
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:02.400]  what would that be you know 60 years too many and yeah exactly you know and it's
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:07.280]  funny what it is with Joe Biden is is that it's not that he is he was ever
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:12.320]  privileged growing up okay what it is is he is one of these people who is
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:17.080]  constantly trying to prove himself and what happened was he got into politics
[2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:19.800]  and and you know the thing is he's constantly trying to prove himself and
[2:14:19.800 --> 2:14:22.720]  prove he's the smartest guy and he's got a handle on everything but he doesn't
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:29.220]  and he's not and so what he's spent his life trying to do is to prove wrong what
[2:14:29.220 --> 2:14:33.640]  he thinks people think of him so if that makes sense to you this this in terms
[2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:37.800]  of like a psychological profile the problem is is that he'll never prove
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:42.120]  them wrong because they're right he is a blowhard and a lightweight and a
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:46.520]  ambitious opportunist and frankly someone who would you know he's a
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:51.400]  panderer I mean literally the man embodies almost every trait you could
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:57.960]  think of in terms of a sleazy politician a sleazy parasitic lifer career
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:03.760]  politician and he's always embodied those and on to add on top of that a one
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:08.040]  of the original demagogues of this era I mean you literally have Joe Biden in
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:12.320]  1986 I mean this and this and in addition to being a flip-flop or someone who
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:16.840]  will take whatever side of an issue or whatever he thinks he can capitalize on
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:22.760]  in of the times that are the era so you have for example him in 1986 giving a
[2:15:22.760 --> 2:15:26.920]  speech to the NAACP in Baltimore you know as a prelude or maybe 87 is that
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:31.080]  prelude to his presidential campaign where he is the first one really I
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:35.360]  think to come out nationally in terms of it an actual US senator or someone of
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.560]  that stature who just outright called the Republicans you know racists and
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:42.960]  Confederate flag you know waving I mean he was actually going after Jeff
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:47.200]  Sessions at the time not that there's any I've any affection for sessions but I
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:51.360]  mean I think sessions you Biden just went way overboard with this and then you
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:55.840]  have Biden ten years later talking about you know the inner city black youth
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:15:59.280]  being you know the super predators or whatever his particular term is that he
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:03.560]  use you know that literally talking about them not wanting his kids to grow up
[2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:08.160]  in the jungle so you know this man will take any side of any issue you know he
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:12.080]  was against the Vietnam War supposedly just on the surface of it but then later
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:16.320]  came out and said you know well I was never particularly an anti-war liberal
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:21.320]  politician and I tell you if you want to see who Joe Biden really is compared to
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:25.400]  what his image has been as a constant perpetual perennial Democrat candidate
[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:32.120]  for president go to his withdrawal press conference in 1987 I believe it was in
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:37.040]  mid round let's see I guess I just signed on with Pete Dupont's campaign for
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:43.200]  president and Biden dropped out but he gave this sort of very self revealing
[2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:47.600]  the true Biden press conference where he talked about his background he talked
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:51.280]  about the mistakes he made you know and it was never really taking full
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:54.880]  accountability for himself I mean in addition to being a flip-flopper an
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:59.920]  opportunist an empty suit a line stepper he's also of course a plagiarist I
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:04.960]  mean he's so you know he's this brash guy thinks he's he's confident himself and
[2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:08.320]  he comes across he's the expert on everything he had to be on judiciary and
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:11.440]  foreign relations both committees because you know he's the brilliant
[2:17:11.440 --> 2:17:15.640]  constitutional law professor or whatever and then he's also of course the
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:19.440]  brilliant I've known every world leader he said you know just that he's a
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:24.160]  braggard above all and a constant braggard and beyond what he actually
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:28.080]  deserves in terms of credit I mean in 1986-87 when he was running he's
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:32.920]  challenging Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire you know my IQ is bigger
[2:17:32.920 --> 2:17:36.640]  better than yours I bet and I you know graduated in the top of my class all
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:39.520]  this kind of stuff so kind of like what he was doing there during the campaign
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:43.960]  where he almost called a guy a fat ass live during oh yeah yeah he insulted
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:48.040]  other people you know he said now I know why your wife left you to an
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:52.680]  individual in a crime it was just blatant insults this is a sign for him
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:56.160]  inviting 12-year-old girls backstage of them I'm not even kidding this is all
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:01.640]  part of his campaign yeah I mean he's an angry man and I always has been angry
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:05.560]  because I think he felt he's always felt as though he never got his due in life
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:11.560]  you know it's his folks were not old man Biden Joe Biden senior was very much
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:15.600]  you know almost like an itinerant salesman you know never had any really
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:22.040]  sort of stable income and work I guess he was you know he sold cars they moved
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:26.480]  from Scranton to Delaware because he needed you know economic opportunity and
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:31.680]  look I'm not one to lambast people who have passed but it runs in the family
[2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:35.240]  let's just say and this is a story from a good friend of mine who I grew up with
[2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:40.400]  of you know close trusted friend his father was a judge and his grandfather
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:47.080]  was a big developer around Delaware and you know the old-time guys who built
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:53.280]  like you're talking like you know 20s 30s 40s era 50s and you know Biden was
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:58.480]  known around town as frankly his son I think Frank and Jimmy were you know
[2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:02.880]  sort of in that mix as always owing people money you know and always
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:06.160]  stiffing people for whatever it be they'd borrow some cash they'd take
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:11.240]  services they wouldn't pay so this guy this friend of mine's grandfather was
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:15.680]  being constantly put off by the Bidens they had a bar in town saying listen you
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:18.520]  know I we can't we don't have any money we're broke we can't pay it and he
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:22.240]  remembers he finally got really upset and just went to the bar like you know
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:27.200]  mid-afternoon first and and they're counting piles of cash in there I mean
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:31.600]  it was just completely ludicrous I mean they play poor mouth but you know Joe
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:35.560]  Biden has frankly gotten into the bed in during a Senate career with all of the
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:40.520]  worst elements I think unfortunately the most facistic elements in many ways the
[2:19:40.520 --> 2:19:45.640]  big banks I'm surprised he's not more in bed with big tech you know I just
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:48.120]  think that he's such a fossil they didn't want to be in here to do with him
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:51.640]  and you know here's the thing here's the really frightening part of it though
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:57.640]  is that that Joe Biden I think almost the Joe Biden I mentioned this angry
[2:19:57.640 --> 2:20:01.360]  ambitious opportunist who would like literally pandered everybody tell any
[2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:05.520]  audience whatever they want to hear and wrote the worst legislation I mean the
[2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:10.520]  drug war this this is the single most culpable guilty whatever gonna call him
[2:20:10.520 --> 2:20:17.400]  drug warmonger in American history that's alive today counting cash at the
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:23.840]  bar to stacking cash in the bank from China and Uzbekistan or whoever the
[2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:27.440]  highest bidder is this is just what we know of this is just what we know I
[2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:30.720]  mean who else knows what else Biden has been doing under the table we'll be
[2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:35.280]  right back with more from Tyler Nixon more stories and we'll get his take on
[2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:39.520]  the first days of the man who was never elected president Joe Biden all of the

[2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:06.560]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he it's alex jones and now your host
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:15.360]  Owen Troyer Tyler nixon along with us today telling the stories of the
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:21.040]  Bidens and their reputations growing up in Delaware and I also want to talk
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:27.400]  about what it's been or what his take is on the moves by Joe Biden so far since
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:30.480]  he's been in the White House but you know one thing that will always anger
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:36.440]  Joe Biden and I'm sure Tyler can comment on this as a personality trait for Joe
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:40.920]  one thing that will always anger Joe is the fact he was never elected president
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:45.640]  and he'll know that and he'll always know Joe Biden was never elected president
[2:24:45.640 --> 2:24:49.240]  and so a man who was never elected sits in the White House and of course that's
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:54.440]  why they have that whole military performance if you will staging the
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:58.000]  military staging and all the staging of the Biden inauguration because he has
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:01.560]  no voters he has no support it would have been an empty inauguration even if
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:06.000]  they had it all open so that was all for optics a made for TV synthetic event
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:11.840]  but Tyler what other details would you like to talk about here about Biden and
[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:16.080]  his reputation growing up in Delaware with him your family and then what's
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:22.320]  your take so far on the actions of Joe Biden hello and what I wanted to say I
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:25.640]  guess what I was gonna complete the thought was the Joe Biden that I mentioned
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:29.680]  you know the Joe Biden the blustering blowhard the demagogue the
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:34.520]  opportunists the panderer you know the the marcher to the front of the parade
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:39.720]  that he didn't start you know the expert on everything the guy who cleared the
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:42.840]  Senate gallery as soon as he came on to the floor any given time because they
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:47.360]  knew it was gonna be a three-hour you know soliloquy to his own brilliance
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:52.240]  spouting off nonsense and then okay 1990 he has an aneurysm and is knocked out
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:56.640]  for almost a year and it was a serious you know serious I mean he came he was
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:01.320]  within within you know inches of death so to speak I mean he really was you know
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:06.880]  out of it and I think that he did he came out of that without any apparent
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:11.960]  you know trauma or vascular you know issues in his brain but I think there's
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:18.000]  some long-term effect because the Joe Biden that I knew and you knew growing
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:22.440]  up and had been around and watched closely and studied closely as someone
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:26.640]  that I always felt was dangerous if he would ever become president and I but
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:30.560]  you know which was gratifying when he was busted for being you know literally
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:35.440]  trying to co-opt or plagiarize not just another man's words but his entire life
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:39.720]  story as we've all seen with the Neil Kinnick you know from the coal mines of
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:44.320]  Pennsylvania which is even itself a lie so he he adopts a story someone else's
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:48.720]  life story that even if he could adapt it to himself was bull you know what
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:53.080]  anyway which by the way you know just just for more of this the psychological
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:59.200]  profile I mean this is actually a sign of a psychotic and this is low-level
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:04.240]  psychology but that's why when you see the movies you know the scary movies like
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:08.080]  I guess I think it was Hannibal Lecter I can't remember them all but it's they
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:13.200]  take the skin they literally take other people's skin and wear it as their own
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:18.160]  skin it's psychotic behavior so that's like a low level of that psychology is
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:22.320]  trying to live someone else's story it's kind of like an American psycho he kills
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:26.200]  the people and then he takes their name lives in their apartment so it's a
[2:27:26.200 --> 2:27:32.240]  psych it's a psychological it's a psychology of a psychopath and I think
[2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:36.760]  that it's pretty obvious that the the narcissistic psychopath Joe Biden shows
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:41.800]  some of those some of those profile traits yeah well he's an imitator and
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:45.760]  a pretender and I think he's got some very psychopathological tendencies and
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:51.320]  when I say imitator or pretender look I mean he was he grew up in the 60s and he
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:56.240]  was very well his first campaign 1972 was heavily backed by the Kennedys you
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:01.400]  know jet Ted Kennedy had thought that he might have a chance of running again he
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:06.720]  did in 76 and was of course you know blown out after Chappaquiddick but you
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:09.760]  know they had their fingers in every pie in fact they were very much responsible
[2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:14.840]  for a lot that went on in terms of the the Nixon you know hounding Nixon out of
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:20.640]  office with you know the Watergate and the whole blow up there and so he was
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:25.840]  viewed himself almost as some sort of you know air to the throne of the
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:31.440]  Kennedys you know our our heroes were assassinated and he would quote Robert
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:36.240]  Kennedy without attribution of course and he would all this lofty rhetoric and
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:39.640]  quoting the Irish poets just like President Kennedy did of course you know
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:45.040]  President Kennedy was a very highly literate intelligent you know just a
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:49.960]  brilliant man who understood you know I mean it fit him Joe Biden just seemed
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:53.800]  like he was just trying to you know take a page out of the Kennedy book and
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:28:57.600]  really just adopted and wear that mantle and it was perceived as a joke
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:01.440]  because I mean he was literally you know stealing these words and trying to prop
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:06.840]  himself up and speaking this lofty rhetoric about race how he he desegregated
[2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:10.920]  the charcoal pit you know no such things ever occurred I mean this man has like
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:16.240]  put himself I mean he's almost a zealot or a forest gump in terms of history and
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:19.920]  putting himself in places where he did not he did not he was not and here's
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:23.200]  the thing is funny he talks about how he was a civil rights activist and he
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:29.320]  marched and he you know they he protested yet in that 1987 press conference I
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:32.920]  told you about he admits straight away I was never a civil rights I wasn't
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:37.120]  involved and I was just a you know up-and-coming young lawyer with my my
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:41.280]  wife you know and a kid and that and that's actually true I mean that's the
[2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:45.600]  reality of it he was just an ambitious you know second-rate lawyer in Wilmington
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:50.080]  and ran for city for County Council happened to win and it was literally
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:55.720]  brash and self-important enough to think he could take on and run for the United
[2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:58.560]  States Senate before he was even 30 years old before he's in a constitutionally
[2:29:58.560 --> 2:30:01.760]  eligible although he was going to be eligible if he were elected when he was
[2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:06.320]  sworn in which is the case and so he won I mean the thing about Joe Biden is in
[2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:11.440]  addition to having these sort of traits of trying to prove himself he actually
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:15.640]  won the big you know the big McGillus so to speak he won a US Senate seat from a
[2:30:15.640 --> 2:30:21.560]  Titan from a great senator Republican you know legend in many ways a cow of
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:28.000]  bogs and so you know he in the sense I think has like an insecurity he's always
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:32.160]  had an insecurity about himself because he didn't really believe that he deserved
[2:30:32.160 --> 2:30:35.600]  it and then he was amongst these the old bulls of the Senate I mean back when it
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.800]  had you know men of stature when of course he doesn't deserve it now so he
[2:30:39.800 --> 2:30:47.280]  must be just tortured on the inside knowing and also no matter what he
[2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:50.360]  does he'll always be in the coattails of Obama he'll always be Obama's vice
[2:30:50.360 --> 2:30:55.840]  president and so he knows that too here's the thing is that's and I guess I
[2:30:55.840 --> 2:31:00.040]  was leading up to is he had the aneurysm and I just noticed about a year and a
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:03.920]  half ago to two years ago or the time the period I guess between when Obama and
[2:31:03.920 --> 2:31:07.800]  they left office and where he reappeared on the scene to run against Trump or
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:12.320]  run for the nomination something happened and he is not anything I mean it
[2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:17.600]  is disturbing because he went from being a sort of an opportunist demagogue who
[2:31:17.600 --> 2:31:22.080]  would get in bed with anybody if it would advance himself to being an empty
[2:31:22.080 --> 2:31:26.800]  suit who is has you know always surrounded himself with some of the
[2:31:26.800 --> 2:31:33.080]  worst elements I mean the basically the neocon you know neoliberal the what I
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:35.840]  would call the fascist wing of the Democrat Party I mean that's where Joe
[2:31:35.840 --> 2:31:39.000]  Biden's coming from he's an authoritarian you know and he'll help but
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:43.560]  but more more important he's willing to be authoritarian but worse is you know
[2:31:43.560 --> 2:31:48.000]  all his civil rights talk and his you know his speaking of uniting and all
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  that that's just that's just bull that's complete whitewash that is nonsense
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:56.960]  that is just pablum you know the people around him are cutthroats they're the
[2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:04.080]  core of the sort of the ambitious you know the worst elements the Democratic
[2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:07.920]  Party frankly the Democrat Party and and that's what frightens me is because he
[2:32:07.920 --> 2:32:11.600]  is like you know these people had an open door I mean if you look at his vice
[2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:17.080]  presidential pick I think Obama picked Joe Biden because he knew that Biden was
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:20.320]  never gonna outshine him number one but more importantly Joe Biden would have
[2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:24.840]  no problem going along and even participating and even maybe promoting
[2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:29.920]  the corruption that went on the abuses of power and it's exactly what Biden
[2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:34.200]  has done he's picked the most you know pliable willingness to be corrupt and
[2:32:34.200 --> 2:32:38.240]  previously corrupt you know with a track record an empty suit as his vice
[2:32:38.240 --> 2:32:42.200]  president and what's scary is he think I think he feels and knows that he's gonna
[2:32:42.200 --> 2:32:47.040]  hand this woman the presidency and you know she's obviously the you know she I
[2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:50.920]  mean the glow these are the two least popular candidates I mean Joe Biden
[2:32:50.920 --> 2:32:54.320]  only one by default because everybody else was pushed out and they all got
[2:32:54.320 --> 2:32:57.920]  behind him rather than Sanders and Kamala Harris dropped out you know right
[2:32:57.920 --> 2:33:01.840]  that she was the first one to go but they were I mean she is more dangerous
[2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:06.360]  probably than Biden so it's like well I mean yeah get what do we want to get rid
[2:33:06.360 --> 2:33:11.080]  of Biden I mean honestly and have her it's very look at that total phony up
[2:33:11.080 --> 2:33:14.840]  there I never watched this apparently she didn't actually swear in on the Bible
[2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:18.760]  either there's a whole theory about that but geez I didn't even see the pompous
[2:33:18.760 --> 2:33:24.680]  arrogance of that woman when she walked up there to take the vow wow that just
[2:33:24.680 --> 2:33:29.120]  shows you it's all about her I want to get Tyler's what was that she's a

[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:12.080]  please the first two days of the Biden administration has been an unmitigated
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:18.880]  disaster from the I think it's 25 executive orders in the first two days
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:25.280]  a record quadruple times the old record to the troops being left out to rot in
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:28.320]  the cold and now apparently they all have coronavirus at least they're
[2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:35.400]  testing positive in a garage being forced to wear masks so Jill Biden to try to
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:39.000]  save face of course where's Joe Joe literally does an hour of signing
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.400]  executive orders every day and then disappears so that's your new president
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:46.880]  people write executive orders for them he wakes up signs them and then takes his
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  meds and goes back to bed so Jill Biden goes out today to save face with a basket
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:57.320]  of cookies for 65,000 National Guard troops and she has a basket of cookies
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:02.800]  for a photo op to say hey we love you guys thank you but you can tell there's
[2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:06.880]  the video the National Guard are not interested in seeing her they're not
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:14.720]  excited they're being forced to do this Tyler this is real sick from Obama
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:20.240]  treating the military like like dogs having them held up on a boat and I ran
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:24.840]  Benghazi I mean the list goes on but then to Trump giving them a raise
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:30.960]  treating them like gold visiting them on Thanksgiving I mean just probably the
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:35.680]  most popular president for the military in a long long time and but now we're
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:40.920]  back to Biden leaving them out to rot in the cold and then the CNN and MSNBCs
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:44.880]  of the world see the pictures of the National Guard they're saying who's
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:49.480]  responsible for this who is in charge here I can't believe it I'm surprised
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:53.800]  they didn't blame Trump but of course he's not in office the commander in chief
[2:39:53.800 --> 2:39:57.920]  is directly in charge of the National Guard well who's the commander in chief
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:01.720]  well apparently Joe Biden so is that amazing Tyler they blame Trump for
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:04.600]  everything all these years and then something that's actually Biden's fault
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:07.920]  and they're like who's in charge who did this I can't believe it I know we'll
[2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:11.800]  find there will ring their necks but it was buying the whole time and they knew
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:15.200]  it and then it for a photo op Jill Biden goes out there with a basket of cookies
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:22.920]  I mean what an insult to our military is always been a user of people to the
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:25.640]  extent that they were I mean he didn't care he didn't mention the troops he didn't
[2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:30.720]  care about the troops he sent the troops into ridiculous wars twice they're
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:33.360]  already going back into Syria there's probably gonna be an expanded one yeah
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:37.240]  I'm wondering how soon yeah how soon till they launch the next one for you know
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:42.520]  so Joe could be a wartime president with what's left of his mind yeah I mean you
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:45.560]  know they would just use them as props and frankly you know if he wants to do
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:49.240]  something for the troops send them home to their family send them home to their
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:53.440]  jobs let me tell you something standing I mean I was in the infantry I actually
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:57.680]  was in the you know active duty infantry airborne qualified and was in the
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:01.040]  Berlin Brigade in Germany so you know I went between the desert and the very
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:05.920]  cold and rainy often snowy whatever forest of Germany in the most harsh
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:10.520]  unhospitable terrain you can imagine and let me tell you something just standing
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:14.200]  guard out there in the cold is I mean it's been bitter out there I mean that
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:17.920]  that really wears you down I mean it and these people should be with their
[2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:22.040]  families there's no reason for this they have active duty troops in that area and
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:25.280]  I you know I firmly believe I couldn't I wasn't could understand why is it that
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:29.240]  they're deploying National Guard units you know for around the country for this
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:33.440]  I mean they have plenty of active duty units within the region you haven't any
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  number of bases within 60 to 70 90 miles of Washington DC for Belvoir for AP Hill
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:45.880]  for Meyer for I mean all you know all kinds of Fort Meade so and you know it's
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:51.400]  funny because as soon as it's just like clockwork this absolutely repulsive
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:59.080]  fascist piece of garbage Steve Cohen is starts questioning the loyalty and just
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:03.040]  comes out with this arbitrarily just got an seemingly out of nowhere comes out
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:07.000]  with this slur against the troops about oh well you know one of these people
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  they're white males so they're suspects you know they they could any one of these
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.640]  could take try something against the president you know this is these people
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:18.440]  are just I mean they're so sick and despicable and I honestly believe I
[2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:22.640]  mean I wouldn't I wouldn't surprise me that they called up some of these units
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:26.320]  because they're so fearful because they know they stole the election because
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:32.640]  they know that they have been eroding and working with me is absolutely
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:35.600]  bona fide I mean think about it they weren't even letting them have
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:41.440]  magazines or ammunition I mean they were walking around with guns yeah they're
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:46.520]  trying to I think they called in those units to identify and to just for the
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:50.640]  purpose of being able to run those checks and to literally you know get these
[2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:55.320]  people and try to weed out or figure out what their politics is or what their
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:58.520]  politics are and who that you know who the they think are identifiable
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:02.560]  troublemakers so they can begin purging them from the military just as Obama did
[2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:06.760]  at the upper echelons and just as you know Robert Mueller did in another
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:10.760]  agency with the FBI you know get another sign that this whole thing is
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:14.240]  dead on arrival Tyler because they know it look everybody knows they stole this
[2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:18.600]  election everybody knows DC and politicians are the real criminals and
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:22.360]  the most corrupt and Joe Biden is the face of that so I mean they know nobody
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:25.440]  likes them they know he's the least popular person ever to be in the White
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:30.120]  House he probably didn't even get 60 million votes quite frankly so but it
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:32.880]  just shows you it's all dead on arrival where they don't even trust their own
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:36.920]  security I bet they don't even trust Secret Service I mean they're they're
[2:43:36.920 --> 2:43:40.200]  basically on an island in there kind of like the reverse island of Trump in a
[2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:44.240]  way we're just the real people of America and the military know that these
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:49.040]  are crooks and criminals and are just nobody likes them yeah and there the
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:54.000]  problem is though that when they've got this mainstream propaganda megaphone
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:58.120]  that's constantly gaslighting everybody and constantly distracting and
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:02.680]  constantly trying to successfully set the narrative and then you have the big
[2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:08.160]  tech fascist I mean this is the their definitional fascism okay fascism is
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:12.320]  not national authoritarian strongman whatever you want to say you know the
[2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:17.080]  definition that they the left has used or the communist left let's just say is
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:21.360]  used to try to hang up you know what our I mean let's face it all authoritarian
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:27.440]  ideologies are left-wing there's no two ways about it well yeah if you were
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:32.040]  gonna install a fascist authoritarian dictator it would look like active
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:36.440]  military on the street no citizens allowed exactly what you got and what it
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:43.680]  is is socialism or you know pre-communism with a fake veneer of you
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:48.400]  know managerial capitalism so it's basically you have these massive
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:53.000]  monolithic monopolistic companies that have the imprimatur of the government
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:57.480]  of the ruling elites the government elites and do their bidding for them so
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:01.600]  it's like okay well they don't need to tell me you know we'll rest you for not
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:04.440]  wearing a mask in the airport you just won't be able to fly so they get the
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:07.960]  private companies supposedly private companies and we see it of course with
[2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:12.080]  the supposedly private companies in the in the tech sector where these they're
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:15.400]  just basically doing who gets all the government they get all kinds of
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:19.640]  government money and their tax exempt yeah they're doing the oppression against
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:25.080]  well worse than that I mean the you know if anybody tells you Twitter oh they're
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:29.120]  private companies this is their private do it the hell they are no one that's
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:32.760]  private has sovereign immunity like they do they have sovereign immunity
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:37.080]  meaning they can't be sued for no matter what they do they can commit torches
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:40.880]  at Tyler it came out in fact I'm gonna cover this on the war room there was a
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:45.720]  little boy that got trafficked and and raped and that was allowed to happen on
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:49.800]  Twitter Twitter still has not suspended those accounts or there's been no
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:53.000]  punishment a new report just came out again I'm gonna cover all this coming up
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:46:00.440]  in the warm at 3 o'clock that identified 94% 94% of child sex trafficking can be
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:06.720]  linked back to Facebook 94% Tyler if you have again this is totally hypothetical
[2:46:06.720 --> 2:46:09.120]  I mean it's disgusting to think about it but it's like if you were somebody a
[2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:12.480]  private individual has people over to their house and they discuss trafficking
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:16.760]  children and that word gets out there will be arrest you can't talk about
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:20.240]  trafficking kids you can't traffic kids in your private home oh but if you knew
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:23.920]  it on Facebook Facebook is allowed and that's okay no investigation so I'm
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:27.440]  gonna be covering that on the war room but Tyler two minutes left here just
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:33.320]  final comment you know I just think we're in a perilous time because these
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:37.840]  people are ruthless they're diabolical they're absolutely cutthroat and they're
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:42.760]  absolutely intent on carrying out this this jihad against good America you
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:46.840]  know half of America basically after stealing the election I mean there's no
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:50.040]  humility there there's no sense that okay wow we got away with it maybe we've
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:55.320]  got no no no they keep doubling down so you know every American who believes in
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:59.520]  the Constitution who wants us to remain free and not be just a fascist police
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:03.440]  state which is what these people are just fine doing I mean they don't care
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:07.920]  about anybody except their own themselves and their own power so you
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:11.680]  know I would urge you to start disassociating yourself out there with
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:16.960]  any sort of tentacles possible to these large tech companies and any company
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:21.320]  that is or any organization frankly that's in bed with or supportive of or
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:27.320]  otherwise you know doing the bidding of these these overlords these would be
[2:47:27.320 --> 2:47:31.760]  fascist overlords I would urge you to contact or identify family members
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.240]  people in your community who are of like mind and don't just assume things
[2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:39.560]  don't just have casual conversations talk to them about what's going on and
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:43.400]  form them try to talk to people who you think are moderate and you know maybe
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:48.400]  can be educated you know I mean the thing is they keep constantly shifting the
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:51.520]  narrative so it was first you know we went from the trying to prove the
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:56.000]  election fraud to now trying to disprove that we're insurrectionist so you know
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:00.760]  stay on guard be vigilant be strong be safe and God bless you all and you know
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:04.160]  we should take heart in knowing that there's way more of us than there are of
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:08.560]  them yeah oh they are surrounded frankly absolutely Tyler Nixon thank you so much
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:11.640]  for joining us again folks I'm gonna be coming back on the war room here in an
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:16.680]  hour dr. Nick bagish taking over but guys that footage we were just rolling of
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:20.120]  Joe Biden molesting kids I mean I almost vomited but you know what we're gonna
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:22.840]  have to I'm gonna need to carry that over for the warm and we're gonna have to
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:25.440]  put that up on band on video I mean that was like the best compilation ever I
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:27.600]  mean that's how sick this guy is
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:33.320]  mountain patriot in Colorado thank you for holding how you doing Alex man I'm
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:35.920]  just working as hard as I can we're in such a critical time brother how are you
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:41.600]  I love you man I want to make a quick plug that DNA force I love it I've been
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:45.480]  using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:50.400]  other day and I see that it contains quercetin which according to some
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:56.320]  published studies that dr. Merkel has cited is an ion of four similar to
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:49:01.720]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might
[2:49:01.720 --> 2:49:07.160]  want to take a look at that all I know is with DNA force we went out and looked
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:11.480]  at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:14.680]  prescription but the doctor self like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:18.000]  of expensive product in them it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:21.840]  basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:25.360]  this so thanks thanks for the plug
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:34.720]  President Trump won in a landslide on the River Thurden but the globalists
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:39.000]  weren't gonna let that happen they had to have some way to repudiate the
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:43.640]  populist movement imminently from the United States and it spread across the
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:48.240]  world from the UK to Brazil they were desperate they admitted their own
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:52.800]  publications they don't know what to do and so they put out 80 million fake
[2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:58.200]  ballots violated state law and stole it better than dollars and now they're
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:00.960]  coming after the president they're coming after you they're coming after me
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:04.440]  they're shutting everybody off the internet they're trying to totally
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:08.360]  censor us and that's why in full wars is still in the fight because we knew this
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.120]  was coming we told you this was common we were the first main target that we're

[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:50.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:50:50.680 --> 2:51:02.560]  show with Nick Baggage and welcome back and it's good to be here this Friday
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:07.280]  headed into afternoon in my part of the world in afternoon and a lot of other
[2:51:07.280 --> 2:51:11.520]  places you know earlier in the week on Wednesday night I had a couple hours
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:15.600]  unexpected couple hours actually I would like y'all know last week I was on
[2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:19.920]  coast-to-coast talking about the same themes you know caring what we've been
[2:51:19.920 --> 2:51:23.000]  talking about the last few weeks a little further to a whole different group
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:28.040]  of folks but I did hear from one of the info wars listeners that appreciates
[2:51:28.040 --> 2:51:32.200]  the sour but I also hear you know I read the emails that come to me at info
[2:51:32.200 --> 2:51:37.800]  at earth pulse.com I try to read them I may not always respond time is only so
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:41.160]  much but I try to look at them and there were a couple things that came through
[2:51:41.160 --> 2:51:47.120]  firstly I want to apologize for last week I said I used the phrase asshole when
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:52.480]  the bad guys and here's the thing one one man's asshole is another man's hero
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:56.960]  okay I'll say that again one man's asshole is another guy's hero and I was
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.280]  talking about the divinity of man last week and so it didn't fit the context
[2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:06.440]  and I apologize it was wrong and and what I want to say is the divinity of
[2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:10.200]  man deserves more respect than that and I was a bad example of it so I
[2:52:10.200 --> 2:52:14.240]  apologize to that for two million people for the man that pointed it out to me
[2:52:14.240 --> 2:52:19.640]  and thank you for that the the other thing I'd say about all that is is this
[2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:23.480]  that's me okay that's I'm not saying that's what everybody else's programming
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:28.520]  is but for me for who I am that's my programming and and then I got this
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:33.680]  other thing that someone said that they said hey what your message is doesn't
[2:52:33.680 --> 2:52:37.440]  fit the program it doesn't fit what we're doing the other 19 hours during the
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:42.480]  week with Alex and I thought a lot about that and and and I give that
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:48.240]  consideration I appreciate having heard that but maybe I I offer something that
[2:52:48.240 --> 2:52:53.480]  is the way I see it okay I'll again not saying that's the right or wrong it's
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:58.680]  it's a good observation the man that made it but for me what I'm doing here is
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:05.800]  trying to deliver another dimension of the solution okay just that's it just
[2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:10.320]  another dimension of the solution through the porthole of Nick Begge's soul
[2:53:10.320 --> 2:53:14.920]  okay that's it that's the only thing I'm doing differently Alex does it to the
[2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:19.120]  porthole of Alex's soul then I say he does it really well and elegantly for
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:24.600]  who Alex Jones is and and here's what I know about every host on the show you
[2:53:24.600 --> 2:53:29.240]  know that you're listening to that's what we're doing we're showing our heart
[2:53:29.240 --> 2:53:33.120]  we're revealing our heart in the method that we have to the channel that we are
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:38.360]  as a human being trying to do something decent and and you're in it with us so
[2:53:38.360 --> 2:53:42.560]  you participate you send me messages I hear you and and I'll try to make the
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:46.440]  course corrections and you know I'm I'm what I'm thinking about as you know as
[2:53:46.440 --> 2:53:50.520]  they're thinking about a reset I'm thinking about just setting it right
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:55.400]  how about we do that we set it right with each other and ourselves in a way
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:54:00.720]  that's dignified and respectful like the messages I got this week now the other
[2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:04.680]  one that I got the kind of I really thought a lot about that was I only
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:07.720]  heard it from one person but I I know there's a lot of people echoing this
[2:54:07.720 --> 2:54:15.040]  right now is that the way I characterize God as my friend as love somehow
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:18.680]  doesn't fit their narrative they'd like me to be talking about this angry
[2:54:18.680 --> 2:54:26.120]  vengeful you know God and and and I I get that dimension you know from the
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:31.440]  angry parents sort of point of view I get that all right I get that a lot but
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:37.360]  I think what we had happened 2,000 years ago and then this the other criticism I
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:41.280]  get I don't use the name Jesus enough okay I'm gonna use that a little bit here
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:45.560]  and then I'm gonna let that go because I'm not gonna parrot someone else's
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:51.560]  narrative here that's not what I'm doing here but I'll say this about that is if
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:56.480]  you don't think I use that name enough in my narrative that I'm delivering here
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:01.760]  then you haven't seen my heart enough know who I am and what I believe in and
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:07.280]  what I do with my life because that's my testimony how I live right now okay
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:12.480]  so I'm not gonna have that conversation anymore you know where I'm at you know
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:17.120]  who I know you know who I met you know what mate you don't know when I met him
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:21.760]  so I'll fill that in someday in the course of the conversation but today I
[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:26.720]  want to awaken something in each of you that's awakened me and I want to do it
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:31.280]  in the Nick Beggach way and no one else and I thank you for the criticisms
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:38.480]  because they helped me be a better guide to each of our this is Greg grease from

[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:50.880]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:57:02.000]  host Nick Baggage and just picking right up from where I left off with the angry
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:06.320]  God because I want to explore that a little bit you know because here's what
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:11.280]  I I think is really needed right now is is calm you know I would have much rather
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:15.840]  seen on the backside of a capa building a thousand people singing amazing grace
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:19.260]  instead of charging the doors you know that would add an impression on the
[2:57:19.260 --> 2:57:23.160]  world that would have been way different you know what I mean that would
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:28.440]  have really touched the world way differently and I'm saying let's touch
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:33.520]  the world in the ways that we can through who we are and how we carry
[2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:37.040]  ourselves into the world and that's what everyone does here that's what
[2:57:37.040 --> 2:57:40.960]  everyone's doing whether it's it's the other Nick who's on the other end of his
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:46.360]  earpiece that's talking to me every once while who's helping me today bring
[2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:50.280]  this information to you or whether it's you listening to the information or me
[2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:56.400]  delivering it my my purpose here is to give you some things to think about not
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:01.320]  to not say hey this is the only pathway because it's not I won't ever say that to
[2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:06.880]  you I'll say your pathway is the right one every single time and as long as
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:10.480]  you're looking for one of two things either God or love which I believe is
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:15.600]  the same thing and you'll be alright and if you don't know who God is then at
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:19.600]  least look for love because this is something I've been saying and I said it
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:23.960]  the other night on coast to coast we keep thinking love is a verb you know an
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:29.800]  action word like eight it's an action word love love is not a verb it's a noun
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:37.440]  it's the other name God gives himself God is love okay it's a noun think about
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:43.240]  that now doesn't have an opposite you know it stands on its own and it
[2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:48.960]  compasses earthly love which is an emotion a verb okay I'll go with that
[2:58:48.960 --> 2:58:56.440]  but what I'm talking about is something that covers us ah that's not very angry
[2:58:56.440 --> 2:59:01.520]  is it kind of a nice covering to get 2,000 years ago if they got the message
[2:59:01.520 --> 2:59:06.280]  and here's the man hanging on the cross with the guys who just slaughtered him
[2:59:06.280 --> 2:59:10.680]  right and what did he say he said forgive them they know not what they do
[2:59:10.680 --> 2:59:16.240]  even the people that were crucifying him in real time he was forgiving as it was
[2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:23.520]  happening wow did you do that you don't even do it with yourself we don't we
[2:59:23.520 --> 2:59:27.360]  beat ourselves up all the time because we're flawed I am too I've made it the
[2:59:27.360 --> 2:59:31.720]  front end of the show okay I'm not afraid to admit it and to be a public
[2:59:31.720 --> 2:59:35.080]  person means you give up all your privacy see now you're a transparent
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:39.560]  person because the more public I am the more people will want to point out my
[2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:45.000]  flaws and if I wear the label of a religion they'll blame that instead of
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:49.040]  me so I won't use labels anymore I'm not going to do that you know Thomas
[2:59:49.040 --> 2:59:53.840]  Jefferson the man that made sure that we'd have freedom of religion never
[2:59:53.840 --> 3:00:00.040]  told anyone what his what do you know that as a fact that is a fact he never
[3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:05.880]  did and why didn't he why didn't he you might self-examine to ask a question
[3:00:05.880 --> 3:00:11.160]  because there's also a Bible version out that he wrote he carried around you and
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:15.400]  it wasn't his words he carved out of the Bible something now called the
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:21.240]  Jefferson Bible go get a copy at your local Bible bookstore you know and and
[3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:25.680]  and in that are the are the words of Christ and that's what he followed that
[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:31.960]  those messages but he never told anyone if people didn't know it you know this
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:36.200]  is the foundation now Jefferson has been in my heart a lot lately because of
[3:00:36.200 --> 3:00:40.880]  this this book I started talking about recently this one by edited by Eric
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:46.200]  Peterson called light and liberty Thomas Jefferson but but it's nobody's words
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:50.640]  it's not Eric Peterson's words he just compiled from all of the thousands and
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:56.320]  thousands of recorded words of Jefferson that he read all those written words he
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:01.520]  read in a very difficult language that's hard to understand Jefferson needs a
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:08.640]  new translation believe it or not now I'll read you a paragraph even and it's
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:12.440]  on forgiveness now you try and get forgiveness out of this paragraph in
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:18.720]  Jefferson's word and here it is I cannot have escaped error it is incident to
[3:01:18.720 --> 3:01:24.000]  our imperfect nature but I may say with truth my errors have been of und of the
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:28.920]  understanding not of the intention and that the advancement of people's rights
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:34.880]  and interests has been the constant motive of every measure for honest
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:40.320]  errors indulgent may be hoped do you even know what that says I'm a scholar I
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:44.400]  have trouble with language and it's English 250 year old English that needs
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:49.840]  a new a new expression so that we can understand it in the context of the
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:54.760]  21st century so that in a digital gulag that we're living in where our digital
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:58.840]  doorways have been kicked in the thoughts of Jefferson about freedom and
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:03.080]  liberty in the pursuit of happiness might be revitalized in the nation on the
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:07.640]  platform that our founding fathers and I wish there were a little more few more
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:11.640]  mothers involved but you know that came later as we figured out that we needed to
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:17.400]  grow in our remembrance the divinity of each of us including women including
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:22.400]  minorities including a lot of people and that's how we began you know we started
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:28.600]  under monarchies under virtual slavery for everyone equally equal slavery for
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:34.200]  all and then we broke those chains in an age of enlightenment is what all these
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:38.960]  wise people said that we can't even read today so one of the things I want to do
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:46.400]  is there's there's a bunch of themes here love faith happiness joy Jesus of
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:51.280]  Jefferson's and his words I'd like to do a segment on each one someday I need
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:55.160]  help all right here's my naked hour you want to talk about a naked hour this is
[3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:01.760]  my former fiance's words and it's a way of expressing how we feel about ourselves
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:07.120]  sometimes you know when we have to reveal ourselves when we're vulnerable
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:13.360]  think about this from this perspective in the garden we were there and I was
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:17.440]  talking about this last week we're in the garden in the garden with the creator
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:22.480]  no good or evil until someone ate from an apple and now we know good and evil
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:26.880]  first thing everyone does is has your naked hour they hide themselves they
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:32.680]  feel guilt they've done something wrong your naked hour you hide from yourself
[3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:39.160]  you run away that's the naked hour okay that's our guilt that's how we carry it
[3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:43.960]  and that's our signaling system you know there's two questions every there's two
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:47.120]  things every time we make a choice that most people don't think about I was
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:50.640]  mentioning this the other night on coast to coast and I really want to say it
[3:03:50.640 --> 3:03:55.200]  here when you make a decision there's actually two that you need to two things
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:58.760]  you need to do a the choice that you're making that's the intellectual that's
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:03.320]  the brain that's the mind and then you have to say how do I feel about that
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:07.720]  decision okay that's the other half of the brain that's the heart if you want
[3:04:07.720 --> 3:04:12.560]  to put it that way and if you ask that each time I'm going to decide this how
[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:17.040]  do I feel well if you don't feel right you might want to reconsider the choice
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:22.440]  you just made before you execute because when you execute now you put it in
[3:04:22.440 --> 3:04:26.440]  action and if your heart is saying one thing and your head is saying another
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:31.800]  you might examine your heart a little deeper that's your connection I'll say
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:36.360]  it again that's your connection to consciousness that links you to the
[3:04:36.360 --> 3:04:40.520]  divinity that you're creating the image and lightness of you know it flows from
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:46.560]  here and then it flows out of your voice into your words as you create reality
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:52.400]  with words what I'm trying to convey is a way to get your power back that your
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:58.720]  birthright back if you will through a reexamination of a set of words that have
[3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:04.440]  been turned around and used against us that's why you see the train wreck in
[3:05:04.440 --> 3:05:09.560]  the world that's why you see all these institutions in the world that have a
[3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:14.720]  form of godliness but they've denied the inner power of it because they don't
[3:05:14.720 --> 3:05:19.920]  have it they are mimicking it in many ways now I'm not talking about people
[3:05:19.920 --> 3:05:24.680]  warming benches there but there's a lot of bench warmers who don't have their
[3:05:24.680 --> 3:05:28.920]  belief well anchored to knowing and I want to talk about that in a very honest
[3:05:28.920 --> 3:05:33.640]  way but I want to also say something because I get all kinds of messages I
[3:05:33.640 --> 3:05:37.640]  get one from Yoshi in Japan who hears me and says I don't plug enough I don't
[3:05:37.640 --> 3:05:43.000]  plug enough so I got a plug today for Yoshi in Japan and it's the alpha power
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:46.400]  deal right I mean and I'm reading the ingredients I'm thinking yeah that'll
[3:05:46.400 --> 3:05:50.280]  work for men yeah that's a good one that'll perk you up right away and your
[3:05:50.280 --> 3:05:55.160]  your partner will appreciate it but the point that the point is it's a good
[3:05:55.160 --> 3:06:00.040]  product and if you really want to piss off the left live a hundred years you
[3:06:00.040 --> 3:06:04.000]  know I mean I want to say that again you this is from my one of my friends that

[3:08:56.640 --> 3:09:08.440]  Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich and
[3:09:08.440 --> 3:09:13.080]  welcome back you know before the break I started talking about this thing that
[3:09:13.080 --> 3:09:19.160]  ended passed on to my former fiance and we were talking about this whole
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:24.960]  concept of the naked hour you know exposed vulnerable if you will that's
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:30.360]  when you're vulnerable okay when you're exposed okay and you got a deal with it
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:34.040]  you know and I'll tell you as a public person you're exposed all the time and I
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:37.320]  mean it's all the time every sin you ever made is gonna be in front of you
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:41.080]  someday or as my family say hey if you don't want to read about on front page
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:44.160]  of the paper you might want to think about it a little differently you know
[3:09:44.160 --> 3:09:49.320]  because when you're raised in it you have a different perception of it and
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:53.080]  unfortunately a lot of leaders are raised up differently and so they don't
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:56.440]  get the training you know and that's unfortunate but that is what it is and
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:10:00.280]  and so we all kind of stumble around a bit you know I only got a little bit
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:04.560]  of training my dad as many know disappeared and subsequently was presumed
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:10.600]  dead when I was young 14 the big change you know the big shock for my life the
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:15.760]  big trauma that that altered my path dramatically and someday I'll talk about
[3:10:15.760 --> 3:10:20.480]  all that I wish there was time to do it all there just isn't ever enough time
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:24.760]  but but again thinking about what I learned in the week that that's
[3:10:24.760 --> 3:10:28.640]  transpired since I saw you last and what was important to me to bring back into
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:32.600]  this conversation and how does how does it all come in how does content be
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:36.280]  developed you might want to know that there's a lot of prayer involved
[3:10:36.280 --> 3:10:41.360]  revealing the heart as I was explaining last week because I really don't want to
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:45.800]  screw it up I really don't and and I thought about it and this came to me as
[3:10:45.800 --> 3:10:52.480]  a one-liner all right I start my day with a plan and if I let it the universe
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:58.520]  God reshapes it in art you know and so I start out with the plan you know and then
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:02.960]  it kind of in one sense disintegrates and gets reformed into something that
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:06.840]  actually works pretty well and so I kind of weave in and out of conversations
[3:11:06.840 --> 3:11:10.040]  with a lot of different people and I gather a lot of information I'm reading
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:14.160]  all the time and then I've also got some work that I need to do that makes my
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:18.640]  revenue it's unrelated anything that you and I do together but that's okay it all
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:22.520]  comes together works really good and I have a livelihood instead of a job so
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:26.680]  it's kind of good it's integrates everything I am into what I'm doing hey
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:30.600]  that's a good way to express ourselves and we should all try and do more of
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:35.200]  that in the ways that we wherever we find ourselves express more of our gift
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:40.800]  whatever that is and we all have it we just fail to see it a lot of times and
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:46.520]  so I want to I'm trying to teach some ideas to think about not just think about
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:51.120]  them and draw your own conclusions one of them is always ask two questions when
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:56.040]  you only think there's one everything you're choosing choose with the
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:01.000]  liberation and then ask yourself how do you feel so always two questions one is
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:05.080]  the choice and one is the feeling of it because that will be a guide that's what
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:09.320]  feelings are for it's a guide to tell us if you get angry in the choice you might
[3:12:09.320 --> 3:12:12.840]  want to think about it if you feel compassion and empty in the choice you
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:17.920]  might want to just get on it you know so use it as a guide it's a way of testing
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:24.440]  yourself testing your own spirit if you will against your heart because that's
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:28.800]  where as a metaphor we draw what we talk about feelings about love we talk about
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:34.000]  heart you know and again I want to say love is the other word that God uses
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:39.160]  to describe himself that's important because a lot of people aren't there with
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:42.720]  you they're not gonna have a conversation with you about God but they
[3:12:42.720 --> 3:12:47.600]  might have a conversation with you about love most people want that most most
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:52.240]  people want that lesser heart is so broken and dark you know but even them
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:56.840]  those that would crucify Christ for goodness sake he'd forgiven an incident
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:02.880]  you should too that's hard man that's a tough one that's easy to say hard to do
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:07.000]  and here's some things to consider you know in this and I made a few notes I
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:10.400]  do that but there's scribble notes you know cuz I do them all day you know
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:13.280]  they'll come to me and I'll write them down and then I get through three of them
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:17.440]  in the other 20 fall on the floor and get lost in the shuffle maybe they'll
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:23.080]  get into something later but the ones that come through one this was two
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:26.400]  questions and then think about two witnesses there's another way to look
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:30.400]  at two because we're in a dualistic system good and evil that's what the bite
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:35.200]  of the forbidden fruit yielded right a dualistic world instead of one that was
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:40.360]  integrated that worked the way it was intended out of one consciousness the way
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:46.200]  it was intended with us has created souls like nodes on that consciousness like
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:50.360]  little spikes of light poppin through it if you want to see it in your head a
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:54.840]  little bit that's maybe one way to see it a little bit but think about that as
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:58.920]  each of our as these are the lights go on that are popping through and we become
[3:13:58.920 --> 3:14:04.640]  aware that we're lights you know and then we start to see that in other people we
[3:14:04.640 --> 3:14:09.600]  realize that wow if we all kind of move in a direction that's different then we
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:17.120]  got a beam and then we have all an overwhelming thing that that fills a
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:24.560]  boy that's there right now in the heart of men and women all around the world
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:28.840]  you can be the filler of that void in some way what do you want to fill it
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:36.840]  with what echo chamber in the void of people's hearts you want to enter change
[3:14:36.840 --> 3:14:43.240]  not to change their path not to tell them what to do just so that they feel
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:48.880]  like they can maybe reveal a little bit of their heart to the channel of love
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:15:01.040]  which is not a verb it is a now okay if we can accept that noun into our heart
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:06.040]  you know then we change the game plan and the way we reflect in the world
[3:15:06.040 --> 3:15:12.040]  because it comes from a very very different place as strange as we all
[3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:16.640]  are all over the planet I've traveled a lot man and I've I've seen the
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:22.160]  uniqueness of a lot of people and I can label it strange or uniqueness you know
[3:15:22.160 --> 3:15:24.800]  they have different meanings but they say the same thing in a different way
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:28.480]  because they carry a different emotion with depending on how you use those
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:33.920]  words you see because the words and the emotions that they carry in the intent
[3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:43.200]  they carry is how the word in the beginning was that so you got to think
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:47.480]  about that as the essence of creation coming out of the words we speak in the
[3:15:47.480 --> 3:15:52.160]  vibration that creates in the reality we perceive as the physics of it I was
[3:15:52.160 --> 3:15:56.160]  explaining it for a couple hours on Coast last night or Wednesday night I
[3:15:56.160 --> 3:16:01.960]  explained it a little bit it's all in what I'm saying it's it's science as well
[3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:05.040]  as something else that's deeper than science ever thought of being because
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:10.440]  science is the analysis of the creation and the uncovering of it the discovery
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:19.400]  of alright and we don't know anything man I mean we don't know anything yet but
[3:16:19.400 --> 3:16:25.760]  we're uncovering bit of revelation if you will through all kinds of ways of
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:29.360]  seeing the creation and the truth that's around us you know that's the point
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:34.360]  I'm making is the path to your own salvation is a path worth traveling and
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:38.400]  anyone who wants to judge another man's path is stepping in a place of
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:45.320]  judgment I would not recommend at all I'd be very careful there I'd be very
[3:16:45.320 --> 3:16:51.400]  very careful there because the real judgments where there's power unless you
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:56.560]  are in fact a judge and in the position of making judgment the real powers the
[3:16:56.560 --> 3:16:59.880]  self-judgment you make about how you're gonna reflect in the world I'll give you
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:04.040]  a simple example if you can all do next cashier you see with their head down not
[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:09.080]  looking in the eye grab their attention with a bit of joy and draw them into the
[3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:14.520]  joy and what you'll have done is create a chain reaction in yourself in them it's
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:18.760]  called a resonance it's a mathematical principle that I've explained before but
[3:17:18.760 --> 3:17:24.800]  it applies to joy be an expression of something different and cause the title
[3:17:24.800 --> 3:17:29.640]  wave to begin that direction this is dr. Nick we're gonna be right back after
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:35.440]  this message is hey support us if you can the pope came out yesterday and
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:39.960]  announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth create a

[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:33.560]  slaves we must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now

[3:21:17.360 --> 3:21:20.480]  there's actually like a hundred there when you click on it it goes straight
[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:26.040]  into the info wars programming which is band.videos and then it chronologically
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:29.200]  lists so you can look back what I've been doing and what I've been saying and
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:32.760]  kind of put the messages together and get the whole picture of what I'm trying
[3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:37.200]  to say at least part of it you know you always run out of time and today I get
[3:21:37.200 --> 3:21:40.400]  the whole hour so I'm really happy about it but I want to finish up kind of
[3:21:40.400 --> 3:21:45.840]  where I was at I was talking about two choices I talked about two witnesses the
[3:21:45.840 --> 3:21:50.160]  witnesses are you against your own soul because you know all your sins that
[3:21:50.160 --> 3:21:53.880]  everyone doesn't see and the universe that knows all of what you don't even
[3:21:53.880 --> 3:22:01.280]  see okay and so those are the ones that matter everyone else is commentary
[3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:06.000]  without clarity commentary without clarity because they're not walking with
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:11.040]  you in your shoes every day but God is whether you know it or not and so those
[3:22:11.040 --> 3:22:15.600]  are the only two witnesses to make your judgments by and believe me at the end
[3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:20.280]  of the tunnel it all comes clear but this life is a snapshot it's like a
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:26.120]  photograph in eternity all right has a little texture on it gives a little bit
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:30.320]  of depth but in the scope of eternity the bandwidth here is pretty narrow if you
[3:22:30.320 --> 3:22:35.720]  want to look at it that way this is a snapshot of reality and our perception
[3:22:35.720 --> 3:22:40.720]  of it in the body is regulated by a set of sensors that limit the bandwidth the
[3:22:40.720 --> 3:22:46.920]  visual system that we have here the eyes only see up to a certain bandwidth so
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:50.800]  they don't see infrared or ultraviolet but other creatures that are alive do
[3:22:50.800 --> 3:22:56.120]  that's interesting isn't it the hearing our hearing we hear a vibration
[3:22:56.120 --> 3:23:01.280]  between 150 Hertz or pulses per second the acoustics all the way up to about
[3:23:01.280 --> 3:23:06.440]  24,000 Hertz or vibrations per second in words that come out of things and
[3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:12.720]  sounds that we hear around us you know dolphins here up to 250,000 Hertz ten
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:17.120]  times the bandwidth in terms of their perception of sounds that we don't even
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:23.680]  know exists through our bandwidth of the human body so you got to remember all
[3:23:23.680 --> 3:23:30.560]  these senses that we have have a limited perceptual ability okay then you have to
[3:23:30.560 --> 3:23:35.160]  go well where do you get all this know inside you know thoughts you can't
[3:23:35.160 --> 3:23:39.440]  touch them you can't grab me can't shove them in a box emotions either but they
[3:23:39.440 --> 3:23:45.080]  decide everything right in so many ways or at least how you feel about it and
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:51.520]  what you think about it if you're observing it and what you're doing okay
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:56.880]  so this is your your plug into consciousness is this other thing that
[3:23:56.880 --> 3:24:00.400]  you have that I have that we all have that we don't see we can't touch we
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:05.320]  can't put the box our thoughts and our emotions and people want to hook that up
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:10.280]  to the brain and say oh that comes from the brain no it's the other way around
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:15.320]  this is how physics teach this what physics teach us that out of energy comes
[3:24:15.320 --> 3:24:22.040]  matter okay that's fundamental physics that goes back to the very basics matter
[3:24:22.040 --> 3:24:28.160]  comes out of energy out of consciousness out of consciousness deliberate
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:35.440]  decision if this is what quantum physics the best of the best in science are
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:42.720]  telling us you know what a weird pathway to get to that answer right math
[3:24:42.720 --> 3:24:49.360]  science get to that answer that really it is a conscious God if you you know give
[3:24:49.360 --> 3:24:52.800]  it any name you want God couldn't even name himself he tried a bunch of times
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:57.400]  in the Bible to give us breadth depth you know a to z alpha mega all this stuff
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:01.400]  try to get the bigness of it pictured in our heads but we can't because our band
[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:05.640]  with this too narrow as I explained but how do you explain band with 2,000 years
[3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:09.520]  ago and no one even knows there's a vibration involved so you know again
[3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:14.840]  2,000 year old language manages to come through we can still perceive it in some
[3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:20.920]  way that it rings true you know 2,000 I talked about Jefferson a little while
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:24.800]  ago and I read a little to Jefferson how convoluted is that trying to discern
[3:25:24.800 --> 3:25:30.920]  you know okay so and that's principles by which we say we live as Jeffersonian
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:37.720]  thought yet we can't even articulate it very well and I'm a scholar alright this
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:43.360]  means that I need to slow down take another look make sure I'm digesting
[3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:49.080]  information in a way that can bring it into form so we can have a conversation
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:54.440]  and talk about these ideas and reform our Republic on the foundation that it
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:26:02.080]  began with a rearticulation in the 21st century that has creation in it that has
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:08.560]  who we are embedded in it as living souls to and work in the world all of us
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:15.080]  this is the foundation upon which this nation was formed was brought into form
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:19.760]  to a set of words embedded in a constitution that even to the fog of
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:26.840]  250 years we still read clearly wow now that ladies and gentlemen as I read
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:32.280]  Jefferson you should view as a miracle that we could articulate some words that
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:37.880]  would carry their whole meaning through 250 years of time or words that could
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:43.200]  carry their whole meaning through 2,000 words of time or longer because the Bible
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:48.840]  isn't a book it's a group of books under one cover it's called a compilation
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:53.920]  okay there's a lot of ignorant people that don't know that that would beat you
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:56.720]  in the head with this thing that they don't even know what it is they're
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:02.080]  beating you in the head with so we need to take a different view of this it's
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:10.560]  not about beating someone in the head okay it's about letting them wake up and
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:17.360]  us being the gateway maybe for some love that might come through us as humans
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:22.840]  in the way that we behave towards each other as an example a living vibrating
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:27.920]  example that came out of energy into this world to do something and that's
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:35.960]  every single one of us and that's the big message here ladies and gentlemen as
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:43.280]  we all have this capacity and we don't even realize it but we can realize we
[3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:49.560]  can begin to realize we can then take control of ourselves which denies the
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:56.320]  control of ourselves from someone else okay now this is something to think about
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:03.520]  here now when you react to someone who's pissing you off in anger you know what
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:10.840]  you do in in physics here's the physics of that not the theory the science when
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:17.800]  you take that energy and then you add to it your energy you create a thing called
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:25.720]  residence X plus X in brackets and then you square it you amp it all up so you
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:34.080]  feed the beast I'm gonna say it again you feed the beast the fuel that it needs
[3:28:34.080 --> 3:28:41.080]  to devour that what you want to do I don't think so but we get angry for good
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:46.200]  reasons we're mad we're upset we were taking the money changers tables over
[3:28:46.200 --> 3:28:50.600]  ladies and gentlemen we're angry and and the commercial model reminded me of
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:54.280]  Cecil Rhodes you know the first time I ran into Cecil Rhodes as a young man at
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:29:00.800]  14 studying gemology studying diamonds and Cecil Rhodes has a place in the
[3:29:00.800 --> 3:29:06.000]  diamond world because he created the cartel the beers cartel that concentrated
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:13.080]  all the diamond wealth from every wedding think about this what did they take
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:18.260]  from every wedding when you bought that diamond from the De Beers cartel you
[3:29:18.260 --> 3:29:23.320]  fueled the bankers you fueled Cecil Rhodes and every Rhodes scholar that
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:28.120]  came from him and we didn't know it we were innocent we were you know that's on
[3:29:28.120 --> 3:29:32.640]  the cross God forgive him for what they do not know right God doesn't hold you
[3:29:32.640 --> 3:29:37.000]  responsible for what you do not know but when you know now we have
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:41.840]  responsibility to behave differently because now we know but in knowing not
[3:29:41.840 --> 3:29:48.600]  believing this lesser bit of knowing is believing knowing causes the behaviors
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:54.040]  fall off your back like water because they're no longer serve anything their
[3:29:54.040 --> 3:30:00.440]  illusion evaporates their control over you evaporates see these are the
[3:30:00.440 --> 3:30:07.440]  tentacles of evil and grab us and and turn righteous anger into something ugly
[3:30:07.440 --> 3:30:12.840]  let's not let that happen ladies and gentlemen let's reroute channel and
[3:30:12.840 --> 3:30:18.400]  let's turn the channel and let's change the course in which we're traveling and
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:24.560]  we all have that choice when we ask ourselves and making every choice how
[3:30:24.560 --> 3:30:29.560]  do we feel about it and God will answer that question every single time

[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:17.240]  patents that they produced do you understand it is a takeover of the
[3:32:17.240 --> 3:32:21.360]  entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with dog collars and

[3:32:45.720 --> 3:32:49.600]  the chai-kong agent it's all coming into place that's how they change the
[3:32:49.600 --> 3:32:52.440]  subject from election fraud it's how they change the subject from Hunter's
[3:32:52.440 --> 3:32:58.520]  laptop it's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al-Qaeda and
[3:32:58.520 --> 3:33:03.560]  the New World Order and now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19
[3:33:03.560 --> 3:33:08.360]  and that's what it is to then be expanded and become political and become

[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:10.480]  And welcome back to the U L S C dot com go there sign up for my mailing list I
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:13.320]  know I keep saying I'm going to send something out and I haven't and the
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:18.840]  reason I have it is I don't know what I didn't know what to ask for and what to
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:22.280]  volunteer and information that would be useful to what we're trying to do
[3:35:22.280 --> 3:35:25.960]  together and until I really know I just don't I'm not going to bother you with
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:31.480]  a bunch of stuff that you don't need so go there because I'm about to start
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:34.920]  asking for help I'm going to have my naked hour I'm going to tell you what I
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:40.000]  need to make my work get done and it's not about money it's about volunteers in
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:44.240]  my community of Anchorage in the area I live I need a volunteer coordinator and
[3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:49.080]  I need some help so I can plug in another hundred hours into the info war and
[3:35:49.080 --> 3:35:53.880]  get it into this channel that is communicating some things that I think
[3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:57.440]  need to be communicated not just about the stuff we've been covering today but
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:36:01.320]  a lot of the mechanical stuff that gets covered all during the week I don't have
[3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:07.840]  enough time and it's just me here in this spot right here and I need a few
[3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:11.800]  other people to join me in this spot and for me that requires a bit of humility
[3:36:11.800 --> 3:36:15.560]  because I don't like asking for help I like doing it the way I do it where I
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:18.520]  don't have to get paid I don't need to do any of that I don't need to get paid
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:23.640]  I'm not for this but I do need people to commit some of their breath of life like
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:29.840]  I commit mine to show up and they have men I'm really happy without even asking
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:33.400]  they've been showing up and I've been out talking to my conversation but thought
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:36.160]  about what I'm supposed to do and people have to show up or I won't do it
[3:36:36.160 --> 3:36:41.360]  that's how it goes so back to the message of the day that's my ad the ad for
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:46.520]  help so I can give you more information choices I'm talking about the two
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:51.400]  questions two choices the duality of the earth up and down left and right you
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:54.920]  know think about up and down you know where does up begin and down begin in
[3:36:54.920 --> 3:36:59.920]  that lock how about left and right where on the line does left begin where on the
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:03.200]  line does right yeah it's kind of interesting isn't it how about temperature
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:08.720]  when is it really cold and when is it hot how about too hot you know I mean
[3:37:08.720 --> 3:37:13.920]  where are we on the line of hot and cold left and right up and down where are we
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:18.240]  on the line is really a maybe a more interesting kind of question you know and
[3:37:18.240 --> 3:37:22.280]  nobody even thought there was a place on the line that might be different wow
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:27.280]  that's our beliefs you know they tell us where on the line we are okay those
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:31.160]  can change those have a little elasticity in them based on what we know
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:36.640]  that gets locked into fiction whoa and then project it into our words into what
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:42.200]  we do is what we know is what we do not what we speculate on you know what we
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:48.080]  fear doesn't happen to us most of the time right what we dream doesn't
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:55.520]  happen either right now how do you activate the dream or the horror show
[3:37:55.520 --> 3:38:01.240]  by taking an action based on a choice without asking the question how do I
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:05.320]  feel about that will lead either to a train wreck most of the time not all the
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:10.480]  time because sometimes a lot of the time maybe even most of the time God doesn't
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:15.000]  let us have the train wreck we're otherwise walking it's a good parent you
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:18.720]  know again tries to steer you in the right direction give you a few hints along
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:22.680]  the way a couple little nudges you know a little whisper in the air however you
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:27.360]  perceive it you know whatever your deal is or your conscious plug-in to
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:32.000]  consciousness and whatever you want to call it is alright with me it's fine
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:35.680]  with me I'm not gonna judge you for that that's not my place my place provide
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:40.680]  information so you might listen a little more closer whatever's going on and
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:44.480]  then you might say wow the search for love to be to God or the search for God
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:48.040]  took me to love and either one of them will end you in the same place it's
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:54.000]  worth the search it really is and and it's worth spreading that fill in the
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:59.600]  void with some of that and here's I give again everyone underestimates their
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:06.040]  power in this all right we're all pinholes I can bring it all through we're
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:09.520]  all pinholes in this universe think about yourself that way and everything
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:13.680]  around you is the universe and you're the pinhole along with a bunch of other
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:22.400]  pinhole but but not like some small incident thing embedded in us is the
[3:39:22.400 --> 3:39:31.080]  image and likeness of the whole the creation God love the core of what is
[3:39:31.080 --> 3:39:35.080]  possible if we can push that a little bit out of us just a little bit you'll
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:39.920]  have to do much just a little bit you start this bleed of energy moving in
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:45.160]  that other direction now you're feeling depressed you're bummed out right now
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:49.200]  because your job is gone because you worked in a restaurant tell you a year
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:54.400]  ago you know or whatever's happening that's really depressing and it's hard
[3:39:54.400 --> 3:39:58.320]  I've been in hard spots you'll get more of it as you get to know me in this
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:04.440]  broadcast and others but but but here's what I know about that if I just let go
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:08.800]  with that just for a moment and recognize the hurt in someone else just for a
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:13.240]  moment maybe it's just the sad cashier that you get to cheer up that day as
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:21.040]  soon as you put effort into lifting someone else you lift yourself through
[3:40:21.040 --> 3:40:26.480]  resonance principle I was explaining that the evil guys use to grab you and
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:32.440]  run you in the wrong direction it's a theft of your emotional creative power
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:37.640]  channeled into destructive forces and look around the world train wreck the
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:41.520]  world is in from people behaving badly in every instance and everything you have
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:46.360]  to complain about or be the victim of are ultimately choices of people made
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:50.960]  without discernment without asking how do I feel about it then maybe changing
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:55.120]  their course a little bit and it doesn't take a majority of anything to do
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:41:01.640]  anything it takes just one person to start you want to start an avalanche
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:07.000]  throw the rock in the right pond in the right spot in the right place you know
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:11.840]  create a wave you don't even see the end of because you just don't take
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:17.880]  responsibility for anything but doing the very very best that you personally can
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:22.240]  in a way that brings you a measure of joy because that's you're entitled to
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:26.960]  that you shouldn't feel so guilty you're not entitled to a measure of joy ask for
[3:41:26.960 --> 3:41:31.920]  grace so you don't screw it up and ask for a measure of joy in and in finding
[3:41:31.920 --> 3:41:36.760]  your gift and repurposing it in your life that's all channel a little bit
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:41.520]  about that part of you that part that you believe in that part that you really
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:45.960]  want to amplify that you know is the goodness in you and and find the
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:51.560]  simplest ways that you with absolute conviction know you can pull off and then
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:56.200]  do them then elevate the events to the biggest ones you can pull off with that
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:02.960]  kind of joy knowing that you're doing it and man what flows into that is a chain
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:06.640]  reacts and you don't need to get attached to it know that you're lighting up the
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:11.960]  other nodes of life creating the image and likeness inadvertently by the side
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:18.520]  effect of just doing your internal and external projection internal work so you
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:24.760]  get purify your spirit a little bit you measure it against your voice your truth
[3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:29.320]  and then try and do a little more that and don't feel overwhelmed like your big
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:35.440]  failure God takes your flaw this is my biggest realization guys is as flawed as
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:40.000]  I am and I am I have screwed up so many different ways in my life I'm flawed you
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:43.440]  may not see that I'm going to reveal more of that because I want you to feel
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:50.120]  that that for me that I'm I'm just like you I've gone through my promise too and
[3:42:50.120 --> 3:42:56.640]  so as a leader I have to reveal myself so that you can forgive yourself a bit and
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:00.600]  know that you can still accomplish things in the world being flawed you know
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:06.400]  that's the beauty of it see is if we are available to try and do something
[3:43:06.400 --> 3:43:12.840]  better it works just fine you have to be available you have to remain calm you
[3:43:12.840 --> 3:43:16.560]  have to try and express yourself as a better version of yourself every day
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:20.320]  and my hope every time I come on the radio that it's more powerful that it's
[3:43:20.320 --> 3:43:24.800]  better that it reveals more of what my heart is saying and that if it gets out
[3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:29.840]  of control some of you please tell me what you think and even if I disagree
[3:43:29.840 --> 3:43:32.880]  with you I'll be respectful of what you have to say and I'll take a deep all
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:38.680]  listen as deep as I'm speaking because I need to learn how to listen deeper I
[3:43:38.680 --> 3:43:43.240]  say it again I need to learn how to listen deeper if you believe if something
[3:43:43.240 --> 3:43:49.000]  share with me I want to hear it info at earthholst.com now know that I can't
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:53.120]  always respond don't feel like I've left you out of the conversation I try to
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:58.520]  take it all in I may answer you in a broadcast I do that a lot see because
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:44:02.360]  this is what quantum entanglements about why you're the tip of the spear and
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:07.640]  we're in this together is a matter of physics and the physics tells us that
[3:44:07.640 --> 3:44:13.320]  once we touch each other we're entangled forever no matter where we are in the
[3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:17.200]  world we're entangled forever and that's how the universe entangles with us when
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:21.200]  we know we have one to entangle with we become consciously participating in
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:25.040]  that's what we're doing the butterfly effect is what I've been explaining
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:31.440]  today another principle in physics this is a very small a breath a breath on one
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:36.200]  part of the planet could literally create a hurricane on the other that's the
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:42.000]  physics you're that breath ladies and gentlemen this is where your power is
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:47.600]  you are the breath the butterfly's wing that changes the world by your intention
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:53.880]  to do it better to do it better to do it richer to do it greater in terms of
[3:44:53.880 --> 3:44:57.760]  your own possibilities when you link up with the universal and you allow it to
[3:44:57.760 --> 3:45:02.440]  take one step for the one you take the universe will elevate you a million
[3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:08.440]  steps ahead of the game you're in the info war internally and externally and
[3:45:08.440 --> 3:45:12.400]  let's change the world together let's change the way we see the world let's
[3:45:12.400 --> 3:45:18.680]  change the way the illusion sees reality this is dr. Nick we'll be back next
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:44.080]  week thanks for being here
