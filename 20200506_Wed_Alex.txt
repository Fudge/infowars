[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex Jones
[00:13.000 --> 00:33.000]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  and it is Wednesday May 6th the year is 2020 I'm gonna be hosting the first hour here today
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  and then Paul Watson is gonna host a couple hours and then we have hosting in the fourth hour
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  John Rappaport always informative and I may pop back in some with him in the fourth hour
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  I'm gonna be here working on some very big stories and some very big developments that are so important
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  I have to go off air to deal with them we don't normally have things like that happen maybe a couple times a year
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  but there's definitely some good things happening there's also a lot of bad things happening
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  of course it was the best of times it was the worst of times
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  but I'm gonna do my best in this hour just to lay out the big themes of where we are as a planet
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  and you'll notice if you're a regular listener or a long-time listener particularly that you're turning on the news every day now
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  and it's everything we told you 20 years ago 10 years ago 5 years ago a year ago
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  the United States is at war with communist China
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  now I told you two weeks ago Trump is moving everyone towards understanding that
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  and now indeed you hear Trump talking about we're in a type of war with China
[01:48.000 --> 01:57.000]  that that undeclared war been going on for a long time with communist China and its fifth column inside the United States
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  the globalists developed China to help bring down the United States and that's just the facts
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  that's what the CFR and the club of Rome and Davos and all of them say they're arrogant
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  the head of Goldman Sachs when Trump first got in and said we're gonna rebuild America he laughed and said
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  no you'll never do that America's over
[02:18.000 --> 02:26.000]  those are public statements these are horrible, horrible, horrible people
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  and that's why you have the Washington Post with headlines like G.G. Ping the dictator of China
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  must destroy Trump to save America
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  and the average leftist that I know my oldest producer been here 18 years
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  his sister will not talk to him in Minnesota
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  and says I love G.G. Ping cross Trump
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  you understand this is mainline Democrat thought processes so I get for the average Christian
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  conservative nationalist patriot common sense guy Gal just goes to work black white old young
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  you're like oh yeah like the communist Chinese own Hollywood they're taking over with the elites and Harvard
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  yeah Harvard is the nest of communist Chinese spies I mean if Harvard disappeared I'm not calling for that
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  but but if the people that run Harvard were were dropped into a black hole
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  our problems would be 80% fixed okay because they run China that's why G.G. Ping's daughter
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  no one's supposed to know this but I've confirmed this with folks in let's just say certain areas
[03:36.000 --> 03:44.000]  goes to school and lives at Harvard under a pseudonym under an alias
[03:44.000 --> 03:54.000]  so it is a China that runs all this but China's the big demonic robot China's the big automaton
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  and then you've got the little bubble on the top with the little Harvard mafia up there running the levers of this giant robot that's attacking us
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  and they're up there laughing and squealing and setting up one sided trade deals where we've been totally screwed and the surrender's over
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  by the way I got news for the leftist in the New World War you might be able to take me out you might be able to take Trump out with
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  but it's the beginning of the ends here because people now know and there's been a huge awakening to what's happening
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  and you'll never put the genie back in the bottle I'm gonna talk about cause and effect and why the globalists have really screwed the pooch
[04:33.000 --> 04:43.000]  they are blown their feet off stuck their ding dong in the light socket I mean you can cut their own nose off despite their face
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  there's a lot of different sayings but there's nothing like actually watching the real thing happen so best of times worst of times
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  the tale of two cities stay with us I'm your host Alex Jones and remember you are the resistance you are the Paul Revere's
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  what does Paul Revere do?
[04:59.000 --> 05:08.000]  when one studies history and human nature you learn very quickly that rugged individualism and people to think for themselves
[05:08.000 --> 05:17.000]  build free societies innovate to amazing things but those that love to grovel those that love to be subservient
[05:17.000 --> 05:26.000]  those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue they create stagnation corruption tyranny and then finally collapse
[05:26.000 --> 05:36.000]  and the world is now being tested and we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  if they just submit down a bigger way somehow they'll create a heavenly future
[05:42.000 --> 05:52.000]  but the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean
[06:00.000 --> 06:23.000]  it's Wednesday May 6th the year of 2020 we are now 180 days out for the most historic election in world history
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  this is not a simulation this is real life on this planet in deep space in the third dimension
[06:30.000 --> 06:39.000]  God is real Satan is real and you and I are real this is what it is to be conscious sentient beings
[06:39.000 --> 06:49.000]  what a time to be here what a time to have millions of amazing humans through race color and creed who bleed red blood
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  and have a connection to God standing and promoting a pro-human future against the technocracy
[06:55.000 --> 07:05.000]  the battle is joined the gloves are off the games are over and people now know info wars was dead on
[07:05.000 --> 07:23.000]  thanks to province thanks to the fact that our ancestors knew what was coming and what was going on
[07:23.000 --> 07:37.000]  and had so much foresight into the future that they could envision what was coming and warn us so that we would be in a position
[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  to stand against this dehumanizing force when the final battle came
[07:44.000 --> 07:53.000]  okay the United States is now officially war with communist China and the fifth column that commands it and runs it that is so critical
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  it's very easy to defeat communist China because if you simply cut the head off the snake of their operatives here in the United States
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  it's very few of them then the chai comms will not have command and control here in the United States
[08:07.000 --> 08:17.000]  and more than 50 major universities have already publicly cut off the communist Chinese government funding that's run officially by the Chinese army
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  UT was getting hundreds of millions a year from the Chinese army
[08:22.000 --> 08:30.000]  the Chinese army was in control of who could be hired to work at UT and they would run the office of personnel hat that Obama gave the chai comms
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  so anybody that was a conservative or a patriot or a military who wasn't a communist couldn't get a job I mean that's the level of the takeover
[08:38.000 --> 08:47.000]  and the chai comms have infiltrated every other facet of our nation but particularly universities and the media where money is king
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  but that is all being cut off and they're arresting academics and you're about to see a giant wave of arrest
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  but it's not moving quick enough with only 180 days left
[08:56.000 --> 09:04.000]  this country is fighting for its life and look our governments had problems and our militaries had problems and our intelligence agencies have had problems and
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  you can look back at different political operations or political dynasties but America is fighting for its life that means your future
[09:11.000 --> 09:19.000]  that means our currency that means our way of life everything's on the line and people just better choose what side they're on
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  and declare what side they're on America or the chai comms and the globalist
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  the globalist and the chai comms are going to lose the question is how bad is this going to be
[09:30.000 --> 09:39.000]  I'd rather they pick up the crap and get out and stop it but they can't folks because they need to dominate the republic
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  they need to to feel like they're better than us and to try to enslave this juggernaut so that they can control and enslave the planet
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  we must not allow that to happen
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  so that's coming up at the bottom of the hour
[09:54.000 --> 10:03.000]  US and UK intelligence warned China is trying to hack bio labs working on COVID research so they can put out false numbers to create a panic
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  that's how US intel now controlled by patriots partially is telling you that China is behind the whole damn thing
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  and behind the hysteria and the media and behind all the false diagnoses
[10:14.000 --> 10:23.000]  and all behind the actuaries set up in the coding at the hospitals by the NIH under WHO control was under Bill and Melinda Gates control
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  and the world depopulation bureau world depopulation bureau Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[10:30.000 --> 10:43.000]  United Nations WHO NIH World Health Service and then also controls the National Health Service and other systems of major countries like the UK
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  and so that's how they're hyping up the deaths that's how they're coding it where they pay you
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  I'm sorry I was saying $39,000 that was just if they intubate you
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  it's $13,000 just to say you're COVID and then millions of your hospital says you have so many COVID patients in it
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  and it's all just incentivized for fraud and doctors and lawyers and nurses are going public and saying we're being ordered to engage in fraud
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  and that's why the blue cities and blue states have all the cases because they are criminal institutions completely now
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  U.S. universities now shutting down arms of China propaganda machine
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  video Senator Cotton says China should provide evidence to disprove Corona lab league
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  the government knows who did it because Obama has the receipts China slams evil liar Pompeo over Wuhan lab nonsense
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  thank you it's nonsense alright
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  researcher on cusp of COVID-19 breakthrough killed and bizarre murder suicide uh-huh University of Pittsburgh researcher
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  a lot of loose ends getting covered up
[11:47.000 --> 11:58.000]  scientists whose doomsday medals and models sparked global lockdown resigns after breaking quarantine to bang married lover
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  he's the guy that said half a million dead in the UK three million dead here
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  those estimates were 20 30 40 50 times higher
[12:07.000 --> 12:15.000]  Hollywood is complicit in Chinese censorship introduces bill to restrict productions yes we shouldn't have foreign governments running Hollywood
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  see it's all happening
[12:17.000 --> 12:28.000]  Gates honored Obama admin appointed doctor wants to quote get rid of all whites that video is coming up
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.000]  they want to make social distancing a permanent part of our lives we're gonna get to all of that and what that means
[12:36.000 --> 12:45.000]  also political founder I want a coronation of Joe Biden not a rape investigation he goes on to say he doesn't care if Joe Biden sexually assaults women
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  they're really showing who they are right now Kavanaugh's innocent he's the devil
[12:52.000 --> 13:00.000]  Biden does it in public grubs little children he's wonderful well of course the Democrats they can't kill your child in the womb
[13:00.000 --> 13:12.000]  they want to have convicted pedophiles have them ride horsey in public by the way now they're having strippers go to schools I don't care if it's a 20 year old stripper or a fat dude keep your perverts away from the kids
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  whether it's heterosexual or homosexual a woman spreading her legs and pumping at the kids and then pole dancing just get it off the screen
[13:20.000 --> 13:29.000]  these people make me sick
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.000]  we're gonna look at how the markets have been intentionally broken what's gonna happen with the economy
[13:36.000 --> 13:47.000]  and they've got major scientific groups with major insurance companies and actuaries working with the South African government
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.000]  and even the commies down there have come out and figured out what's happening they said currently this is out of the financial telegraph
[13:57.000 --> 14:11.000]  currently it's causing 20 times 29 times more death COVID-19 in Africa just in South Africa than it is by the virus
[14:11.000 --> 14:22.000]  but see while you start to death and put your baby into a six foot hole it's okay because you can wear your mask even though nobody's dying
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  less people are dying in South Africa not now from COVID-19 and now from the flu but it doesn't matter the government says wear your mask and social distancing and everything's breaking down
[14:30.000 --> 14:41.000]  the human food chain the human infrastructure the human network the human grid is being destroyed for the computer grid to take over
[14:41.000 --> 14:53.000]  oh and they admit Bill Gates and all of them it's a post human world that means you and I are done in it
[14:53.000 --> 15:04.000]  you know a few months ago we had llamas in studio just to have some fun and who knew out of Europe one of the most promising treatments
[15:04.000 --> 15:13.000]  for COVID-19 is antibodies out of the blood of llamas and they're finding that it just completely knocks it out
[15:13.000 --> 15:25.000]  so there you go that was actually last year so tomorrow's news today ladies and gentlemen yet again we bring you the llama
[15:25.000 --> 15:37.000]  my daughter my youngest daughter and her birthday yesterday and I don't know why my wife had llama little napkins
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  yellow napkins and pink llamas on them these llamas are everywhere it's one of the llamas
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  this humanity and vision of the llamas will save us but well the truth is what's in natural world what's in plants what's in animals is what always saves us
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  but the globalists don't want you to have that so they always go and patent it so they can overcharge you for it in it so it doesn't work as well
[15:57.000 --> 16:07.000]  this is a pandemic survival alert and the most time sensitive messages you will hear this year you still have time to plan a one acre crisis garden
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  and secure a supply of your own nutrient dense food but time is running out and it's one deadline you don't want to miss
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.000]  who should plan a crisis garden individuals families churches communities anyone or any group that sees hard times ahead
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  let's face it even the main line media is talking about food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers who are becoming sick
[16:27.000 --> 16:34.000]  but there's more meat packing plants are closing mile long lines at food pantries and more farmers now in financial trouble

[18:11.000 --> 18:17.000]  I understand what comes around goes around you really put you so and I live that and I fundamentally at a cellular level understand it
[18:17.000 --> 18:33.000]  now if I would have hiked up the virus was gonna kill three four five million people like the UN did I was told five times more supplements but you know what I didn't do that but I said on a routine basis regardless people are vitamin D deficient people are deficient
[18:33.000 --> 18:52.000]  I and I have so many other issues you need those products regardless so we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion all the other products I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  defenses but now I'm telling you with the economic crisis going on get your storeable food now
[18:58.000 --> 19:13.000]  Hiding in plain view Politico the Associated Press you name it admit that a half a billion people extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because the global lockdown
[19:13.000 --> 19:28.000]  that is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society
[19:28.000 --> 19:44.000]  created depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane ladies and gentlemen they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get high quality storeable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere
[19:44.000 --> 19:59.000]  big tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing this is beyond 1984 the tyranny of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the word the info war you are the Paul Revere's
[20:15.000 --> 20:25.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  the news
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  the news
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  the news
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  the news
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  the news
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  the news
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  the news
[20:41.000 --> 20:49.000]  ladies and gentlemen we are live we are broadcasting worldwide coming up next segment
[20:49.000 --> 21:02.000]  Bill Gates has come out and said that we need to have a global collapse and just get used to it to save us from not even a million people dead from coronavirus not even 500,000 dead from coronavirus not even 300,000 dead just doesn't matter
[21:02.000 --> 21:12.000]  because he's a vaccine maker and he says that vaccine sterilize you and he says that you need to take his vaccines and that's just the way it is he's also announced we need a global government
[21:12.000 --> 21:21.000]  these video clips are coming up to enforce the force inoculation of everyone on earth and that will also have a digital ID with it that you have to have to travel
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.000]  and it's being announced all over the world that that's the way it is starting at the end of the year
[21:27.000 --> 21:40.000]  oh yeah they said they wouldn't have the vaccine for a few years now magically they're gonna have it by the end of the year and he's got seven different manufacturers making it who died and made him God who gave them the keys of the world I've been telling you
[21:40.000 --> 21:50.000]  Bill Gates is the most powerful globalist we know of who's actually involved running things the Rothschilds are very powerful but they are back in the shadows the Rockefellers have pretty much died out
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  but their powerful foundations are there but these are the folks that run the show
[21:56.000 --> 22:09.000]  now let's get into this right now look at this headline out says out of the Stanford advocate conspiracy theories run rampant when people feel helpless like now
[22:09.000 --> 22:20.000]  we'll know when you put out your bell curves that are all completely false and that are 20 30 times higher than what's actually died
[22:20.000 --> 22:30.000]  and then we learn that you're padding the numbers with people that come into the hospital they're 80 years old 90 years old that die of heart attacks or cancer or automobile accidents

[33:42.000 --> 33:59.000]  we are broadcasting worldwide I'm your host Alex Jones and I come to you with grave tidings and a desperate warning that you keep my warning or be enslaved impoverished finally starved to death and killed
[33:59.000 --> 34:14.000]  I was thinking just a minute ago before we went live into this segment how I could describe this because it's indescribably horrible but it's the truth and only the truth can save us my people perish for lack of knowledge
[34:14.000 --> 34:33.000]  the articles are on info wars dot com we're going to play the clips right now Bill Gates is planet Earth's first dictator oh and he wants to depopulate the planet oh and he wants to get rid of the middle class on record
[34:33.000 --> 34:54.000]  and he finances major leaders who push anti-white agendas you go why does he want to kill the black people and the white people jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife could eat no lean so between the two they lick the platter clean
[34:54.000 --> 35:13.000]  he wants us divided against each other he wants us killing each other while he inherits the future learn who he is or be destroyed I personally am facing arrest death right now because I refuse to stop attacking Gates but I will continue because I will not submit to Satan
[35:13.000 --> 35:33.000]  now let's go ahead and go over the facts earlier I read to you out of the financial telegraph major insurance companies in South Africa have openly come out and said that COVID-19 is not causing mass death that the lockdowns dwarf it
[35:33.000 --> 35:57.000]  massively 29 times more destructive than the COVID-19 deaths and that's just getting started so with that said the head of the world food program that will play in a few minutes came out two weeks ago and said 135 million on the verge of starving an extra 30 million are starving right now on top of the
[35:57.000 --> 36:17.000]  10 million that usually starve think about those numbers and those are accurate numbers probably conservative and what happens is you just shrivel up you get sick the bones are sticking out your side and any common colder flu comes by you just die in the night
[36:17.000 --> 36:32.000]  and they just say that oh you died of the flu you're out of the cold but you know you died of starvation malnutrition so here's Bill Gates that's constantly everywhere saying we need to reduce the world population you put the London Guardian Bill Gates is worried about the black population in Africa growing
[36:32.000 --> 36:53.000]  but he wants to give you a shot because he wants you to live GI want you to die please take the shot now let's go ahead and go to this clip Bill Gates the Financial Times of London normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population
[36:53.000 --> 37:08.000]  remember what he said two weeks ago 700,000 will get sick or die from bad reactions of course that's his number it's not one in 10,000 folks it's like one in 10 that have bad reactions you all know that most of you've had a bad reaction from a vaccine
[37:08.000 --> 37:27.000]  continuing in another clip he says America can't do it perfectly like China so we're gonna have problems with the contact tracing see China's perfect 3 million Muslims in death camps Bill Gates on vaccine the world again this is the first planetary world
[37:27.000 --> 37:45.000]  government through the UN WHO because they've learned like in Rwanda when the UN shows up and encircles a town and then when the animus go in to kill the Christians with machetes anybody that tries to get out the UN machine guns
[37:45.000 --> 38:04.000]  then you hear in the news oh the UN couldn't protect the poor Christian minority in Rwanda no it later came out they ran the extermination but the Africans fight back and a lot of times bare handed defeat the UN and defeat the black tribes they're funding
[38:04.000 --> 38:19.000]  so now they go oh we're coming with shots we're coming to help you and they've learned that people will trust someone in a white lab coat but still now the Africans run so now Bill Gates is coming out with crops that have the vaccine GMO in them
[38:19.000 --> 38:41.000]  I first saw that with prodigy in 25 years ago people didn't believe me not to mainline news that oh you'll soon get vaccines in your banana they can engineer it into the banana so let's go ahead and play Bill Gates normalcy only returns when you take the vaccine then have the ID or the chip to prove it here it is
[38:41.000 --> 38:58.000]  that trade off you just mentioned obviously the economic pain what do you think the right balances between the trade off of protecting people's lives and the economic hit I mean do you see a situation where the global economy could be virtually at a standstill for a year or even more
[38:58.000 --> 39:17.000]  well it won't go to zero but it will shrink global GDP is going to take you know probably the biggest hit ever you know maybe the depression was worse or 1873 I don't know but in my lifetime there this will be the greatest economic
[39:17.000 --> 39:35.000]  hit but you don't have a choice people act like you have a choice people don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected you know it's not the government who's saying OK just ignore this disease you know people are deeply affected
[39:35.000 --> 39:53.000]  by seeing these deaths by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain and old people their parents the grandparents could be affected by this and so you don't you know you don't get to say ignore what's going on here
[39:53.000 --> 40:11.000]  there are there will be the ability particularly in rich countries to open up if things are done well over the next few months but for the world at large normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population
[40:11.000 --> 40:27.000]  and so you know although there's a lot of work on testing a lot of work on drugs that were involved with you know trying to achieve that ambitious goal which has never been done for the vaccine that rises to the top of the list
[40:27.000 --> 40:43.000]  and finally so he's in charge of the big foundations all the tax free money Carnegie Ford Rockefeller IBM trust that was Watson when he died dedicated it to Hitler and the global depopulation so now he just says it never comes back to normal
[40:43.000 --> 40:58.000]  oh here in the first world maybe for a little while till we clamp it back down again this is all a plan doesn't matter if the global death will be hundreds of times he just says oh everyone knows that they're guilty and they're going to do this because they want to play along with it
[40:58.000 --> 41:14.000]  they've all psychologically wargamed us out they think you're going to play along well you're going to lose everything you got in the process because you're so afraid of something it turns out is a giant hoax it's a manufactured weapon that causes the collapse of society through its fear it is manufactured so
[41:14.000 --> 41:27.000]  Bill and Linda Gates could own the patent on the vaccines let's play the next clip Bill Gates on contact tracing basically says China does a perfect job we don't do a good job so see China is perfect here it is
[41:27.000 --> 41:43.000]  the epidemic in the United States is more widespread than it ever got in South Korea so we're like the part of China Hubei province where a lot of the cases were in one city Wuhan and the US and China are different
[41:43.000 --> 41:57.000]  you know the lockdowns that we do won't be as strictly enforced but they are very very important the way we do contact tracing won't be as invasive and so won't be quite as
[41:57.000 --> 42:17.000]  the last word is perfect so in post let's just add the full clip thanks we're live right now but the later update that and post on the site so this is what he's talking about this is what he's doing and South Korea didn't have a problem because they didn't do false positives
[42:17.000 --> 42:33.000]  and they didn't kill their people snaking ventilators down their throats innovating and they didn't pay $39,000 to put a ventilator on somebody they don't have blue states don't have blue cities with people like Cuomo and people like Governor Newsom with the heroin needles
[42:33.000 --> 42:48.000]  and the feces everywhere and the fentanyl and the death so this is their takeover ladies and gentlemen more Bill Gates on forcibly vaccinating the entire world as he becomes the first world dictator of the planet
[42:48.000 --> 42:56.000]  whatever you do folks spread the word about the broadcast don't know how much longer we'll be here because the tyranny is here
[42:56.000 --> 43:12.000]  so let's have a good day serving with info wars is a great honor but I still need my morning coffee and luckily our break room at the info wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality info war store

[44:25.000 --> 44:45.000]  and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its in game submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this

[46:04.000 --> 46:16.000]  not because of the virus but because of the crises in the economic shutdown it would cause because the globalist were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states
[46:16.000 --> 46:31.000]  so that prediction has come true because the globalist are running an operation it's not predictions we have their battle plans so going back more than eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies were sold out except my patriot supply because

[47:33.000 --> 47:49.000]  population of every man woman and child on the planet it's just unbelievable we're going to play you some of that audio and video when he was on CNN with Farid Sakaria of the Bilderberg group and Farid says the economy's not going to come back for a long time and
[47:49.000 --> 48:08.000]  Bill starts giggling and laughing and looking like he just had an orgasm he is the earth's first planetary dictator he's all over TV he's all over everything leading and guiding and directing us and saying sorry there is no choice it's
[48:08.000 --> 48:25.000]  not going to come back first it was two weeks then it was two months and now he said oh for some of the richer countries maybe you'll have a little bit of time before we lock you back down I just played this but for the rest of the world it's
[48:25.000 --> 48:39.000]  not going to come back and hundreds of millions will starve to death and it'll just be a little footnote yeah but people in America know not to go out and do things anymore and go out and buy things and as the world economy collapses the
[48:39.000 --> 48:58.000]  third world dependent on us they're dead it's totally sick we're gonna we're gonna play the audio in the video of him just I mean you thought Beto was bad when you thought the guy running against the other Democrats for the
[48:58.000 --> 49:13.000]  nation was bad here in Texas smiling when they talked about you know there's so many people shot he thought that was good that that was sick well let's just go ahead and go to the video and audio Bill Gates on CNN just looking
[49:13.000 --> 49:28.000]  like he just saw his newborn son or daughter he's just the happiest you never see him look happy when he talks about forced circulation or death or starvation or talks about reducing human population in a TED talk he just starts skipping around and hopping around like a demonic elf here it is
[49:28.000 --> 49:40.000]  the economy is not going to be anything like it was it's going to take a long time to recover it's going to be you know people are going to be surprised at how slow and how how fitful this is
[49:40.000 --> 49:55.000]  should we play the TED talk where he says we've got to do a really good job I can't imitate him well well if we do a really good job on all these things cutting carbon cutting industry cutting our
[49:55.000 --> 50:11.000]  consumers ship and we cut the human population we might be able to get this number down close to zero and everyone starts giggling because the number lit up and the equation is P for people this isn't
[50:11.000 --> 50:26.000]  E equals MC squared ladies and gentlemen this isn't about energy and being derived from matter and action or all the rest of it this is the end of civilization as we know it
[50:26.000 --> 50:42.000]  this is the most shocking video ever I should just roll this for the next five hours here Bill Gates on CNN last weekend and I forgot when I saw this clip I meant to play it but I'm just so used to him somebody's got to put together another compilation of him

[51:20.000 --> 51:31.000]  overjoyed how slow and how how fitful this is imagine Farid Zarkary is like it'll never come back it's going to be horrible it's going to be terrible and Bill's just like all of a sudden he's sitting there and he goes
[51:31.000 --> 51:52.000]  oh my gosh this is completely sick here let's look at that face he's just so damn happy they're saving the earth or they finally blew up the economy they finally brought in the Green New Deal
[51:52.000 --> 52:06.000]  they admitted was to get rid of humans yeah here it is the evolution of Bill Gates rattle rattle Microsoft and all the money and now GMO and mandatory vaccines I mean you name it he's involved but don't worry
[52:06.000 --> 52:22.000]  you know who the main funder of quote choice in education is which sounds good but it's it's it's they ruin the public schools try to block the private schools now they come in and buy up the schools for pennies on the dollar they buy up the curriculum not the school itself
[52:22.000 --> 52:37.000]  they pay the schools up to a third of their budget to run their curricula and here it is Reuters New York to work with the Gates Foundation to reimagine school says the governor
[52:37.000 --> 52:54.000]  oh and they're going to keep you at home now and you only go to school maybe once a week for activities or events you can build them on the gates curriculum and you never hear about all those people in Latin America Africa and Asia starving to death after all it's for the earth it's
[52:54.000 --> 53:08.000]  them doing the best job they can he's your king he's your lord he's your president he's your doctor he's your master and he's going to put things in your body and you're not going to say no or you're not going to travel or live
[53:08.000 --> 53:21.000]  you're going to take a chip in your arm because China as he said last segment is perfect we're not going to be perfect like China welding people in their homes shooting women in the head at checkpoints
[53:21.000 --> 53:29.000]  three million in death camps we're not going to be perfect you know shutting down South Africa causing mass death
[53:29.000 --> 53:44.000]  that's okay because Trevor Noah he's part African so it from South Africa so it's like oh he'll be there overseeing it as well oh good good Trevor Noah good
[53:44.000 --> 53:58.000]  here's Bill Gates on vaccinating the entire world with Trevor Noah go ahead so we'll have a lot of unusual measures until we get the world vaccinated you know seven billion people that's a tall order
[53:58.000 --> 54:13.000]  but it is it is where we need to get to despite a lot of things in between now and then to minimize the damage and then of course there's always going to be a new pathogen that comes out of the lab he runs and funds
[54:13.000 --> 54:25.000]  and that Fauci funds and runs and it won't matter yes patented coronavirus won't matter that he makes the money off of it we'll just do it if we say yes sir there's no choice
[54:25.000 --> 54:39.000]  but see I want all seven crates of the 70s having produced I want to be able to go to the factories get them myself and then I want to be able to inject Bill Gates with them myself because I mean I know he knows they're good for us
[54:39.000 --> 54:55.000]  so I want him to take all the vaccines not like they did at the Golden Globe Awards where they have nurses run around with fake syringes and give her by their shots oh everybody get your shots now it's so cool to trendy people how stupid are we
[54:55.000 --> 55:15.000]  but you see the virtue signalers I went for like a nice three four mile walk this morning hike and there'd be areas of the hiking bike trail that are 25 feet wide and you'd see every fifth or sixth person like up against the leaves oh that's like hey Africa starving you dumbass it's made up

[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  saying she's a trader saying she's a criminal she's spending seven days in jail
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  because unlike Walmart and Costco and CVS and Walgreens and Texaco she's not essential she's obsolete and they're saying she's an evil person but the general public says she's a hero
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  they're trying to reopen restaurants in Texas faster than the governor said they're getting swatting it's a shame the Texas has turned yellow but we're a lot better than California but not for long the people don't start exercising their rights
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  you know my businesses are deemed essential because I'm media but I said if they say it's not essential I'm coming here that's my line in the sand
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  if somebody can say you're not essential that's the power to kill your ass the power to tax is the power to destroy the power to say you're not essential and lock you down is the power to kill you
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  it's called siege to say you gotta stay right there or I'll attack you it's the most ancient form of total war but at least Fox News was debating is she good or is she bad everywhere else she's the devil here it is
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  a Dallas salon owner who gained national attention for defying stay-at-home orders now spending a week in jail after she refused to apologize for reopening her business before coronavirus restrictions were lifted
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Shelly Luther who publicly ripped up a cease and desist letter last week was given a choice by a judge she could offer an apology for quote selfishness pay a fine and shut down until Friday or she could serve time in jail but Luther defended her actions to the end listen
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  let your actions were selfish putting your own interest ahead of those in the community in which you live
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  I have to disagree with you sir when I when you say that I'm selfish because feeding my kids is not selfish I have hairstylists that are going hungry because they'd rather feed their kids
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  so sir if you think the law is more important than kids getting fed then please go ahead with your decision but I am not going to shut the salon
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Luther also has to pay a $7000 fine Brian I'll start with you did the government go too far in this case
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Oh absolutely there's no question you know think about this in a time in which everyone's letting everybody out of prison we're cracking down on a salon owner that wants to get open early while being socially distanced
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  there were lines on the floor they were going to be lines outside everyone wearing masks she just wanted to go down swinging because like major companies like Gold's gym which is now filing for bankruptcy
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  she did not want to go she did not see an end in sight so she opened up she got a she got a cease and desist letter
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  absolutely again working out totally essential everything's essential and the idea that if this was a super deadly virus people should have the right to do what they want if you want to stay indoors and starve to death go ahead
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  if you don't that's the way it is but this idea Hollywood's drummed into our head with hundreds of movies and TV shows as we all just locked down and it's the end of the world and the judge is you're selfish
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  I'm a good person you're selfish you're bad meanwhile 135 million people are starving to death
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  not even a half million have died worldwide from this so again it's all these virtue signalers who suspend logic
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  major insurance companies in South Africa have done the analysis 29 times more death caused already my starvation and collapse of society and then now they estimate that for decades this will take years off people's lives
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  it's up on info wars dot com it's up on news wars dot com only way the dog hunts is if you share it we need to save Africa Latin America and Asia and look I care about those folks but let me tell you I really care about all of us in America
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  we're collapsing the third world they're dying we're going to go down to that next gates is just getting them first because he's got them near death he either get rid of our economy with the big globalist corporations have done in these countries
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  and now they're gonna get us in their jaws just remember everything I tell you comes true bugs because I do my damn homework I live this I dream this I'm a machine it's all I do and finally good news is starting to happen you notice the Pentagon says we're at war with China and they're starting to arrest the Chinese spies
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  the Democratic Party is the fifth column it's us or them ladies and gentlemen Paul Joseph Watson and others coming up and he's loaded for bear spread the live links now
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete non essential that's why they position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to our family farms and industry that's based United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  plumber that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out they can simply look at us and say because again you are not essential that's what the robots and all of this is about it's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  we can be told to stay on our houses and after all shut up this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to the new AI gods the rich elitists that emerged with machines yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  that's actually the public plan they're pushing these people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  and we are live talking COVID 1984 the world continues to lurch towards the atomized dystopian prison planet that we've been warning about for the past two decades with this coronavirus outbreak the aftermath the lockdown the draconian control measures
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  I was thinking about the film network earlier you know the one with the scene where he leans out the window or he encourages people to lean out the window and shout I'm mad at Helen I'm not going to take it anymore well in the UK we lean out of the window and we
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  are going to get into this article later by the way we've got Andrew take coming up in the second hour in the next hour going to cover an article about restaurants making diners eat in pods
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  working a pod socializing a pod because apparently this is a new one on me after March 2020 humans suddenly stopped having immune systems now we've literally got to live our lives in the prison pod
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  why doesn't the government just mandate everybody live in you know those zorbing balls and just live in those living a pod the boy in the bubble there was a film I think it was back in the 70s with John Travolta called the boy in the bubble where he basically has no immune system
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  and he's forced to live life inside a giant pod that's basically what we're being asked to do with his mother and father having to cradle and hug him wearing these biological gloves that they shoved through this pod just to have contact with their own son
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  that's what we're being told to do I'm going to get into that later what's going on in a strip one today though well of course last night we had profess they see John Travolta the boy in the bubble that film is not the highest quality but it's definitely has echoes of our situation we're facing today
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Professor lockdown this is the guy who created the model the Imperial College model in the UK which warned the government that if they didn't impose a lockdown and social distancing measures 500,000 people in the UK would die
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  that model has been totally eviscerated and then if you look at Sweden which I'm also going to get into later which of course didn't have a lockdown there are rates the rate of infection is the same as the UK's and their death rate a capita if you compare their population to as
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  inclusive of the obvious vast difference in population their death rate was lower than the UK they didn't lock down anything what was the point we were told we had to lock down to save lives and protect the NHS the NHS was never overwhelmed
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  the hospital beds the acute hospital beds are four times emptier than normal the nightingale hospitals that they built to cope with the overflow most of them are now either not going to open or being closed down already
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  you have the professor of cancer at Kings College University London coming out and saying that excess cancer deaths there'll be more excess cancer deaths than total coronavirus deaths in the UK over the next five years what was the point
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Professor lockdown the brainchild behind all this the Boris Johnson stupidly listened to has been caught violating his own lockdown headline RT Professor lockdown Ferguson resigns after violating quarantine he designed to meet married lover
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Professor Neil Ferguson author of apocalyptic coronavirus models which was listened to by the government has resigned from his position as advisor to 10 Downing Street after revelations he violated quarantine himself to meet with a married lover
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  the woman had two kids she in fact complained I'm going to get into that in a minute what happened following Ferguson's resignation on Tuesday night the Daily Telegraph made it public that the man known as Professor lockdown now known as Professor pants down had allowed a married mother with whom he was having an affair to visit him at least twice
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  during the quarantine the woman was identified as Antonia stats 38 and now there are jokes about him massaging the stats the first visit was reportedly on March 30 as Ferguson warned the British public that lockdown measures in effect for a week at that time would have to remain in place
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  until June Boris Johnson is going to give a speech on Sunday by the way probably extending them another three weeks despite the fact the peak of the virus was a month ago he said I accept I made an error a judgment and took the wrong course of action
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  confirming that he's resigned from the government's mission but he maintained the call for a lockdown of course he's not going to be subject to it the minister in Scotland Scotland's chief medical officer she violated her own lockdown to visit her second home
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  it's one rule for them one rule for everyone else though he's still calling for the lockdown to continue even though he's wantonly violated there's more detail to this though and in fact there's an excellent website for lockdown skeptics dot org run by
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Toby young of the spectator and he cites the comment of Professor Pence down Ferguson who said I acted in the belief that I was immune having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for at least two weeks after developing symptoms
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  so be uncommon so not only does professor lockdown think you do develop immunity after recovering from COVID-19 of course now they're trying to tell us that that doesn't happen so they have yet another excuse to keep these ridiculous measures in place forever
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  but you don't even need to take an antibody test to prove it which he didn't if only all of us who think we've had it were free to act in the same way now if you look at the woman herself 38 year old Antonio stats mother of two married
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  according to the telegraph she lives in a $1.9 million house in London and has quo and open marriage how's that working out for you they dug up a podcast of her and she appeared on a podcast on March 31 which is now being removed
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  24 hours after visiting Professor Pence down in which she complains that the lockdown is putting a strain on her marriage yeah maybe the fact you're having an affair with the architect of the lockdown is putting a strain on your marriage even more
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  and then you can look at her politics and it's a big coincidence that a lot of these people who are so vehemently for these draconian lockdown measures are you guessed it for leftists the telegraph has her down as a left wing campaign or a reference to the fact she campaign against leaving the EU
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  and it's a long standing environmental activist who supported Greta Bumberg's climate strike so he and it's always the biggest virtue signalers who who are the biggest hypocrites every single time in fact there's a picture of her delivering a petition to end fossil fuel
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  subsidies subsidies to 10 Downing Street and her politics are as this article explains far left even further to the left as compared to Professor Pence down himself so the very architect of the lockdown program in the UK the one that they said was necessary to say 500,000 lives
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  now other professors are saying that more people will die of cancer anyway the guy the head honcho behind the entire program violated his own lockdown absolutely incredible but half of the course given what happened in Chicago there with the mayor and of course in Scotland with Scotland's chief medical officer
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  now Boris Johnson is set to give a speech on Sunday as I said what's interesting about the lockdown in the UK is that the British population like no other has been terrified beyond belief terrorized by the necessity for this despite obviously reaching the peak of coronavirus cases over a month ago
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  many of them want the lockdown to go on for months and months more I know people bar men people who work jobs mainly based on tips who are basically at this point completely bankrupt they're out of jobs they're losing their homes but there's a big segment of the British population
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  who are lazy and want to sit on their behinds for the next three four months and could collect the government paycheck 80% of their wages are covered by the government so in no other country do you see support for lockdown than the UK from all the polls that I've seen to the point
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  and I'm going to get into this more in the next segment they asked people about the lockdown and 50. In fact it was 60% in a poll said they wanted it to be more draconian the only place basically in the United Kingdom that you're allowed to go is the supermarket and the parks
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  60% of people in this poll wanted the government to close down the parks so we wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere I mean what has happened this has been an experiment in mass obedience and the results have not come out too good if you believe in
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  freedom of mobility and all that goes with it we're going to get into that study in the next segment summit dot news don't go away

[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  The moment of truth is now here. We are facing the post-human era.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  And I've been warning you for many years that they would use a global viral crisis to click.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Put us in the cage and then roll out the robot takeover.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  This is just the beta test. China is moving out of beta and into operational control.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  In just a few years, we will be under full globalist control, forced inoculations, total surveillance.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  We're all being taught that we are obsolete. The term they use is non-essential.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  This is not some dystopian novel. This is reality. This is the New World Order. This is Satanism.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  There has really been an exercise in mass conformity if you look at it from the British perspective.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  And this whole social distancing thing, there's a new study.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  We're at Twitter thread by a doctor, Dr. Muge Cebic. This again is on lockdownskeptics.org.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  He's an infectious disease researcher at St Andrews University. She, sorry.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  She cites numerous research studies suggesting that close and prolonged exposure to someone infected with the virus
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  is necessary for transmission, making a nonsense of social distancing rules.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  So you have to be in close proximity with someone for an extended period of time to transmit this disease according to new research.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  So this whole thing about social distancing, which now has got to the point where they're talking about putting markers on the pavement,
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  where you can't get close to somebody based on this marker.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  They've got facial recognition cameras in the works to tie your face into the social credit score that they're going to roll out, Chinese style.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  And again, what are the punishments going to be?
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Fines, a lowering of your social credit score, a revoke of your social media posting privileges, perhaps.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  The article goes on to say, in terms of this social distancing being questioned,
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  the most likely hotspots are not sporting arenas, shopping centers, restaurants, cafes, et cetera, but hospitals and care homes.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  The doctor said, quote, casual short interactions are not the main driver of the epidemic.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  The technical way of putting this is that the virus is no social meal infection.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Incidentally, this is another person, Matt Ridley's reason for becoming a lockdown skeptic,
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  because more and more of the science is saying that this social distancing that we've been doing for the past six weeks has no impact whatsoever.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Meanwhile, Reuters reports, Dutch restaurant trials glass booths for dining amid coronavirus.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  Again, live in a pod, work in a pod, socialize in a pod, eat bugs.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  The Dutch restaurant has come up with an idea on how to offer classy outdoor dining.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  In the age of coronavirus, small glass cabins built for two or three people, creating intimate cocoons on a public patio.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Waiters wear gloves and transparent face shields and use longboard to bring dishes into the glass cabins
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  to ensure minimal physical contact with customers.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  They're talking about having to have a table between every diner, you know, immediately cut restaurant income in half.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  They're talking about putting pods around everyone when they get on airplanes.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  The boss of Heathrow came out yesterday, I'm going to get into this later, and said this social distancing in airports is not going to work.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  It's practically impossible to be two meters away from somebody when you're boarding a plane, unless you want the queue for the plane to stretch for a kilometer.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  While the concept is currently being trialled only for family and friends of staff, it certainly looks glamorous.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  No, it doesn't. Having your dinner in a greenhouse is not glamorous.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  It's super cozy. It's really cozy. It's nice and the food is delicious.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Just making everyone a surf, not only making them a surf, making it sound cozy.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  And people are terrified. People in the UK are still terrified. They want them to lock down parks.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  60% in a pole said this social distancing, this draconian lockdown doesn't go far enough.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  The comedian Sam Hyde did a skit where he was like, stay at home, sit on a chair, go to your basement, sit on a chair, face the wall.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Don't look out the window and stay there for four to 10 years.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  Some of these people in these poles would actually probably unironically support that.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  The only place British people are allowed to go, unless they're going to Tesco Supermarket, is parks.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  So every weekend on a Saturday and a Sunday, the entire population of London is crammed into these parks.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  There's no social distancing. People are running. People are spitting as they run.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  They're spitting on the floor. They're breathing. They're running past you. You've got bikes, kids running around everywhere.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  There's no social distancing. They've crammed the entire population of the city into eight major parks across the city.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Insane. ITV reports, Cambridge study finds Brits are most concerned about COVID-19 risk.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Cambridge researchers have found that Brits are more worried about coronavirus than Italy, Spain or South Korea.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  The study is carried out by the University of Winston Centre for Risk and Evidence, and it shows that basically British people are the most petrified.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Here's the poll I was talking about earlier. A headline out of The Independent.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Coronavirus British public backs tighter lockdown restrictions if needed to beat disease.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  This is a BMG survey. It said if there were indications that support will wane, it said that there were indications that support will wane.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  And it says if the government came out and said that these lockdown measures will be extended into the summer, only 41% said that would be unreasonable.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  41%, that means the majority, unless they've got an option for don't know, which is not specified in the article.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  The majority are happy for it to be extended to August, and then only 48%, still a minority if you don't have a don't know answer,
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  are happy for it to be extended into September. So another four months from now.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Again, a lot of these people, if you said, stay at home for the next two years, they'd say yes, and they'd take their paycheck,
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  and they'd lean out the window every Thursday at 8pm and clap, big brother.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  12%, one in eight of the population said they believed a continuation of tight social distancing measures lasting nine months or more stretching into 2021 would be reasonable.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  So over 10% of the population want this to go on for another year.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  Participants support the government's approach to COVID-19, 57% support.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  64% said the government was right to prioritize saving lives at the risk of harming jobs.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Yeah, the professor of cancer at King's College says there will be more excess cancer death than COVID deaths.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  That's not saving lives, that's costing lives.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  You've got cancer patients who can't get screenings, who can't get treatment, can't get chemotherapy, thousands will die.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Already have, in many cases, some of these numbers of the daily fatalities include people who can't get treatment for cancer.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  27% said the UK was well prepared for an outbreak, 52% said it was not.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Here's the stat, 46% said they were not stringent enough, opposition to the restrictions of strongest amongst the young.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  And then it says with controversy raging over police officers' efforts to prevent sunbathing, God forbid.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  60% said they would back the closure of all parks if people continue to ignore social distancing rules.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  60% want the government to close down the only place that you're basically allowed to go, apart from food shopping.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  They've taped off park benches, not even park benches, benches in the streets in residential areas.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  They've taped them off with police tape.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  That's going to stop coronavirus, isn't it?
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  Can you imagine you're some elderly person who's going out for their government allotted one hour daily exercise for a walk?
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Suddenly you get some chest pains or something, maybe you've got an ailment, you want to sit down, no you can't,
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  because that's going to stop COVID-19, putting two bits of tape over a frigging park bench.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  There's an article by Michael Snyder, which I'm going to get into after the break.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  This is going to make social distancing a permanent part of our lives,
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  because again, it's about the enforcement of absurd petty rules on a whim that they can reintroduce at any point.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  They say, John, you say, how high?
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  And given how the polls are looking at the UK, a lot of people are perfectly happy to continue jumping in lockstep in the government.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  I'm going to get into that and more how Sweden has responded to the coronavirus and why it's so different to the rest of the world and why it's actually working.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  We'll see you next time.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  Ships free at fullycookedbacon.com, fullycookedbacon.com.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  Trust your family survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  A weak microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  Women own their bodies.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  Mark the beast.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  Oh, and guess what, Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  They hate you and your family.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  Who transferred the bio weapons to communist China so we could now release the weapon.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  But without the loving liberal media scaring you in the submission and the corporate press,
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  worshiping corporations that shut down all access as well as blue city governors and mayors,
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  we would never have been able to imbue the depression that will destroy your future forever
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  and starve the third world.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  Well done, American cowards.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America,
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  was the most common form of government.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it,
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  In fact, in most cultures, they called the peasants the little people
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  because they kept them again at a starving level.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  Well now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds,
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  the Jeff Bezos is the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  and private jets living the life, laughing at you shut down,
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  going bankrupt in the third world starving to death.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Their religion is power and control and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  We must break free from these monsters.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  The creator, the writer of Black Mirror, which if you haven't seen it, is a dystopian sci-fi TV series.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  I'm going to get into this later, has announced that he stopped writing the new series of Black Mirror
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  because the real world is more dystopian than his television program.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  This is where we're at.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  There's a Michael Snyder article called,
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  They Want to Make Social Distancing a Permanent Part of Their Lives.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  He talks about this, they're talking about putting physical markings on sidewalks.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  This is out the Daily Mail, in order to constantly remind us all not to walk too closely to one another.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  About 15 years ago in the UK, everybody suddenly started noticing the emergence of people wearing high-vis jackets,
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  barking orders at everyone and telling them what to do.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  I'm not talking about high people who wear high-vis jackets for, you know, if they're working on construction sites
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  or doing something potentially dangerous.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  I'm talking about just enforcers within society.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  So this high-vis jacket became the kind of emblem, the kind of motif of these new enforcers on top of the police
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  that were barking orders telling everyone what to do.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  Now the police wear those high-vis jackets, British police used to dress well.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  They used to dress in a way which would attract, garner respect.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  Now they all look like these same petty high-vis enforcers.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  They don't get respected.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  As we reported, in many migrant areas of major cities in Europe, these lockdown measures, these social distancing measures
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  are being completely ignored.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  In fact, in France, the Interior Minister even said we shouldn't enforce legally these social distancing measures
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  in certain migrant ghetto areas because it could lead to riots.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  So again, the people crafting the policies aren't following the policies or violating the policies.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  People in certain areas of society, certain areas of cities are protected.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  They don't have to follow the policies, only you, only the plebs.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  They're talking about arrows on the ground and other physical markers to encourage and enforce distance.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Imagine sidewalks with scoring every six feet.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  So those walking could make sure they're the human equivalent of a few car lengths behind.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  Or large sculptures deployed to separate people.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  So imagine the cost involved in putting markers on pavements on sidewalks every six feet around the entire country.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  What a pointless waste of money.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  And again, the proliferation of signs of street furniture, signs barking orders telling you what you can and can't do.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  If you look at any high street 40, 50 years ago, there were hardly any signs telling people what to do whatsoever.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  I'm not just talking about traffic signs, I'm talking about, you know, creating this pod planet prison society
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  where you're told how to behave, how to walk, how to behave around other people every two minutes, everywhere you look.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Walmart and other major retailers are already starting to put arrows on the floor to remind us which direction to shop
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  so that we can maintain proper social distancing.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  I saw in the supermarket the other day on Instagram a video of barriers that would normally be used for road traffic repairs
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  inside supermarkets telling people you can't walk this way down this aisle.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  The aisle wasn't even blocked off.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  You could only approach it from the opposite side.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  Again, completely pointless.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  It's absolute madness.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  Especially as I mentioned earlier, these new studies suggesting to catch it to transmit the virus,
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  you have to live in very close proximity for an extended period of time.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  So none of this matters anyway.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Article continues.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  We are being told that restaurants may have to start paying empty tables between customers.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Sports stadiums may have to keep at least half their seats empty.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  And churches may have to start holding services in shifts.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Again, in terms of restaurants, sports stadiums, businesses literally just lopping off half of their income immediately.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  That's really going to get the economy going again, isn't it?
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Just like in the days after 9-11, we would be told that the changes are just temporary measures.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  Once we accept temporary measures long enough, they have a way of becoming permanent.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Again, that's the whole point, isn't it?
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  We were told we had to go through this for a period of about six weeks, maybe two months, to get back to normal.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  Then about three weeks ago, they suddenly said, oh no, you're never going to get back to normal.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  This is the new normal.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Why did we do all that in the first place then, if that was your plan all along?
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  The new normal is living in a pod, working in a pod, dining in a pod,
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  and following these bizarre social distancing measures that the new studies suggest are completely pointless.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  In the UK, headline 18 million people entered the UK as the coronavirus pandemic was raging,
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  18 million people entered the UK in the three months before lockdown,
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  with hardly any of them undergoing health screenings or being put into quarantine.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  100,000 people from foreign countries are arriving at UK airports still to this day every single week.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  You're not even allowed to drive to the airport unless you're an essential worker or you've got an essential reason to be there.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  But 100,000 people are arriving every single week with no health checks whatsoever.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Bolt migrants, I'm going to get into this in a minute, arriving on the coast in greater numbers than before the lockdown in some areas,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  getting taxi services from the government to bring them in.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  Meanwhile, they're talking about, oh, maybe we can have, we can go outside and have a picnic in a month.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  The Mirror reports only 273 people out of 18.1 million who came to the country in three months leading up to the nationwide lockdown were put into quarantine.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  This means that tens of thousands of people were entering from coronavirus affected countries, including Italy and Spain,
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  and were then allowed to circulate amongst the general population.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Now, a labor MP called Stephen Doherty questioned this.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  Actually, some of the labor politicians have been good in questioning the government on this, not to give them a little bit of credit.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  He said, on what scientific basis were a handful of flights from Wuhan and one from a Tokyo from Tokyo singled out for extreme attention?
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  Because those are the only flights where they actually health screened the passengers.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  He said, not a single flight from northern Italy, Spain or the US.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  The fact that many of these people then likely arrived and traveled onwards across the UK with little or no adherence to social distancing,
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  and with no checks or protections at the border, barely a whiff of hand sanitizer is deeply disturbing.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Let alone the arrival of 3,000 fans from Madrid as the pandemic picked up speed. That's right, they had 3,000 football fans from Madrid arrive in the UK to attend a football match
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  days before this lockdown was put into place while coronavirus was raging in Spain.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Come on in! No checks whatsoever.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Meanwhile, Brits who have been put under government imposed lockdown for six weeks being told they might be allowed to go outside for picnics in a month.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Thank you, Boris Johnson.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  Breitbart reports,
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  He got visited by the police. No doubt because everyone on Twitter snitched on him.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Nigel Farage struck a defiant tone after being informed by police that reporting on the illegal boat migrants was not essential travel.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Well, it is essential because under the government's rules, the media is essential.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  You can go to work if you're in the media or a journalist because you're an essential worker.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Nigel Farage has a column in one of the biggest newspapers in the United Kingdom.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Nigel Farage is a radio host on one of the biggest radio stations in the United Kingdom. He is a reporter.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  He is an essential worker, so yes, of course, he can cover this under the rules.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  He said he'll continue to cover the scandal despite the police warnings and criticism from the sneerocracy in the mainstream media.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Meanwhile, Breitbart also reports London's NHS Field Hospital to be closed after barely being used.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  The 4,000-bed hospital NHS Nightingale London, the jewel in the crown of the government's emergency coronavirus planning, will be placed on standby from next week.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  They use the term placed on standby, which makes it sound as if it's about to be opened. Isn't it? It's about to be closed.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Absolute 180 in terms of Orwellian newsfeed.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  But again, it goes to the point, these overflow hospitals that they built because they said the NHS would be overwhelmed.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Most of them haven't even been used. Many of them are now being closed down.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  The acute hospital beds across the United Kingdom are four times emptier than normal.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  We will lie to, but now we're going to be told that we have to undergo this for three more weeks.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  Go away. Summit.News will be back.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  Very, very soon again, because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  And now it's mainstream news. The food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist, things may be okay.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  But it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  High-quality, affordable food ready to get to you and your family.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  And now to get your orders in at 4store.com.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  So, this is a real innovation.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it,
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  So refreshing, this is a big winner.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  It's a virus that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  You see, a regular cold or flu virus, you really can't do a vaccine for it because it's always mutating.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  But see, because this is a canira and lab made, they can have a speciality.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  So it's a whole giant franchise.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  They can filter you rich off of it.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  They can surveil everybody.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  Everybody gets to become a suspect.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  And now when you would have low numbers of death, it doesn't matter because they make a huge spectacle out of it.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  You watch next year with the flu, it'll even be bigger as well.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  This is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  The success is in full versus that.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  And everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  So be the polar bears you are.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  Now, I was somebody who, from the beginning, took this coronavirus very seriously.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  I'm not arguing that it's a hoax, that it's a fake disease. It's a very serious disease.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  But I was the one at the beginning, as were many others, saying that this was a big threat.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  It was coming from China, where it originated, and that countries in the West needed to take this more seriously.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  This was back in January when the World Health Organization was amplifying Chinese state media propaganda,
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  telling people on January 14th there was no human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  I was warning Western countries, as were many other people at the time,
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  that they needed to take strong action in terms of border control measures, which never happened until it was too late.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  This was during the time when people like De Blasio and Nancy Pelosi were out telling people to congregate in huge crowds in Chinatown,
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  but now we're the ones who are to blame for apparently downplaying this,
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  when in fact we were the ones warning about it from the start, and that it did need to be taken seriously.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  I was generally supportive of the UK government's lockdown measures,
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  given that it would be for a limited amount of time, and that the entire purpose was to get back to normal.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Now we're being told we will never get back to normal.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  An interesting phenomenon, of course, during this whole thing is the exploitation of it for more social media censorship.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  We have an article here, headline cell phone towers in Canada are being set on fire over 5G conspiracy theories.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  This has also happened in the UK and other countries, of course.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  It says there have been long-standing concerns about the radio waves that are being emitted by devices,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  especially from cell phones. However, it seems these concerns have been amplified with the launch of 5G,
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  where there have been conspiracy theories linking 5G to various health issues.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  It goes on to talk about instances in Canada where 5G towers being vandalized and set on fire.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Now the way the media's reported this again, they argue that they need to delete,
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  relegate the algorithm on social media, harmful conspiracy theories,
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  and then promote in the algorithm, game, rig their own algorithm to promote authoritative sources.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  Problem is, nobody thinks the media is authoritative.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  Trust in media has plummeted even lower since this coronavirus pandemic started.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  There's this weird kind of thing where the more the media talks about 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories,
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  the more it tries to squash them in terms of deleting information from social media platforms,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  the more people tend to believe them because the media is so discredited that when it becomes so aggressive
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  at trying to debunk conspiracy theories, and I don't believe there's any link between 5G and coronavirus,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  I haven't seen any evidence for it, but when the media is so aggressive in trying to debunk these conspiracy theories,
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  in a way it actually makes people believe them more because they don't trust the media.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  And in fact, there was a clip, which was in one of my recent videos, where I covered how a local news station
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  covered the COVID-19 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  I'm going to play this clip right now and talk about it. Here it is.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  And what about then 5G towers?
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  These 5G towers have absolutely nothing to do with the spread of the coronavirus.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Yeah, well the fact that anyone would believe this theory is absolutely mind-blowing.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  I agree with you that the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory is probably ****,
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  but the sheer inauthenticity of the way you speak with this ridiculous contrived intonation is absolutely mind-blowing.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  An ally to chronic levels of distrust in the mainstream media would actually make people believe the conspiracy theory even more.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  There is no link. None. It is just completely false.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  Sure, Dan.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  So they present it with this guy who's putting on a completely fake accent.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  Obviously, that's not how he talks in real life.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  And this is the common thing, of course, across mainstream media,
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  especially those kind of local TV news channels, where they put on this overemphasized fake intonation.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  And then they tell you there's no conspiracy theory without telling you why it's wrong.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  But there's literally zero detail. They could have put in like a 30-second explainer.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  Bam, bam, bam. This is why it's wrong. This is why it's stupid.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  No. They think that just by having a guy talk like this on a mainstream news station debunks it.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Doesn't. It makes people look at it and think, that's weird.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  First of all, why is he talking like that? That's bizarre. Nobody talks like that.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Then he's debunking the conspiracy theory without offering any information as to why it's wrong.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  Just because he's a guy in front of a camera on a mainstream news station, they think, that's enough.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  It's not enough. Then they put up a doctor.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Oh, look, he's wearing a white lab coat. He must be right.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Again, he doesn't even give in any information as to why the conspiracy theory is debunked.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  That's not a debunking. It's just, look at us. We're the authorities. This is wrong. Go to sleep.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  That's weird. If you want to debunk conspiracy theories, I would argue, don't even talk about them.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  Or at least explain why they're silly.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Then I just put up some weird guy talking in a fake accent or some doctor in a lab coat saying next to nothing.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  It's absolutely ridiculous. Article in relation to that.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  Out of the telegraph.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  Twitter steps up its fight against 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  Twitter will begin prompting people who tweet about 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories to read British government verified information.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  Yes, I'm sure that somebody who believes in 5G conspiracy theories will read a document from the British government about it when they just want to tweet something.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  It's going to make them believe it even more. They're going to look at it and think, oh, the government's trying to cover this up by the looks of it.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  It would be better to just ignore it entirely.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  The theory, which is spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecom mass and abuse directed at engineers in Britain.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  Scientists, phone companies and the government said it's completely untrue.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  Twitter said the search from would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and COVID-19,
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  include a link to a government website, which is like a probably like a 10 page terms of service thing that nobody reads anyway.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Katie Minshaw, Twitter's UK head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding COVID-19.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Again, not going to work. Not going to work. People aren't going to read it.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  When they try and suppress information, it makes people believe it's true.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Absolutely incredible that they haven't grasped this yet, especially with chronic levels of distrust in the mainstream media.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  Breitbart also reports, Twitter will now warn you if you're about to post wrong think.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  You're about to post a tweet containing harmful language.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Don't worry, Twitter is experimenting with a feature that will warn you ahead of time so you don't accidentally infect any users with your wrong think.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  When things get heated, you may say things you don't mean, wrote Twitter's official support account in a tweet yesterday to let you rethink a reply.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  We're running a limited experiment with a prompt that gives you the option to revise your reply before it's published if it uses language that could be harmful.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Doesn't really specify what harmful language is.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  No doubt that will be extended to include expressing harmful opinions, which of course is anything that goes against the government at this stage.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  That's what this has been exploited to achieve, creating a new standard for social media censorship where criticizing authority is against the terms of service.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  Literally, that's what YouTube has in place now.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  It's literally deleting one and a half hour presentations from licensed medical doctors because that's wrong think.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Article says it's a bit like pre-crime in the 2002 Tom Cruise film Minority Report.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  Twitter will notice when you're about to use a bad word giving you the chance to avoid a rule violation and save your account from the digital gulag.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  We're trying to encourage people to rethink their behavior and rethink their language before posting because they often in the heat the moment they might say something they regret.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Meanwhile, still no edit button.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  Still on Twitter, the digital hate mobs are allowed to engage in targeted cyber bullying, doxing and harassment of children.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  I made a video about this yesterday.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  What's happening is these radical left-wing identitarian hate mobs are going on to TikTok, finding edgy TikTok videos, offensive TikTok videos uploaded by teenagers,
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  posting them to Twitter with the tag Twitter do your thing.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Twitter do your thing is a dog whistle for thousands of other people.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  In some cases, tens of thousands to locate the personal information, work addresses, school locations, home addresses, members of their family.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  I'm talking about 15 year old kids to then dox, harass, cyber bully, call up schools, call up employment officers, threaten people.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Twitter is allowing this on an industrial scale on a daily basis.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  They do nothing whatsoever to stop it.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  But if you're going to tweet the F word, they're going to put up a prompt telling you not to do it.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  That's not the real problem, is it?
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  In fact, I think it was last year when Twitter instituted a rule whereby people were getting their account banned if they tweeted hashtag learn to code at journalists.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  Tweeting learn to code journalists, that was classified as harassment and abuse.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  The industrial scale harassment, doxing and cyber bullying of minors by these unruly, insane crazed digital hate mobs which have now found a home on Twitter.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  Apparently, that's perfectly fine and they're not going to do anything to stop it.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  No way. Summit.News will be right back.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store. Never been a better time than right now.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  InfoWars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom, but worldwide Maverick spirit.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars or the researchers or the journalists.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  And it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make InfoWars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the Council on Fine Relations,
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group and other club lists.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  Not a world where the establishment hate themselves, protect their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  I'm really excited to know that InfoWars has your support and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:53.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  Now, there's no doubt that nurses, doctors have been weaponized for the past and political purposes amidst this coronavirus outbreak.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Of course, we had widespread media coverage a few weeks ago of these nurses standing in front of anti-lockdown protesters holding signs.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Media portrayed it as if these protesters or the nurses, I'm sorry, were blocking the traffic, were blocking the protesters,
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  preventing them from driving in their vehicles.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  When you actually saw the videos of that, it was nothing like that.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  It was a photo op.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  They literally would stand in front of the vehicle for five seconds with the sign.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  The guy would take the picture, then they'd walk off.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  It was nothing like it was presented by the media.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  Well, now Project Veritas reports CBS News this morning aired fake COVID-19 drive-through testing site line of cause.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  We have yet another example of media fakery as it relates to this outbreak.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  And here's the clip that they put out on Twitter earlier today.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  You're telling me you're 100% certain that CBS News, CBS News Corporation, National staged a fake event.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  They fake the news.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  They fake the reality and broadcasted that to all of their audience last Friday on CBS This Morning.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  100% absolutely.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Only six states have reported more cases than Michigan, but fewer than 2% of its people have been tested for the virus.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  In our series on the state of coronavirus testing, Adriana Diaz shows how Michigan is trying to improve a system that has failed some of its people.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  But the governor says testing above all else will help determine when to fully reopen.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Apparently the news crew wanted more people online because they knew it was going to happen.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  Well, we knew when they were coming.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  We had no clue that we were going to have to like do a vaccination.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Gotcha.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  Did she tell you guys like, hey, you're not actually getting tested?
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  Yeah.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  Yeah, she did. It was just to make it look busy.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  That's crazy.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  Well, I didn't see you guys had to do the swab at all.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  I just saw you talking with them.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  And then I was talking with the other girl.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  You were tested.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  Yeah.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  There were a couple of real patients who made it worse.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  They probably just wanted to look busy.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  It's my guess.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  Is this the fake lines?
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  Yes. Yep. That's it.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  So the people on the cars are not patients?
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Majority of them.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  I do know from talking with the testers that one of them, one or two of them were real patients which added to their frustration because this line sat there for a while so they could organize the shot.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  So they've made a line of cars with medical personnel on the cars as opposed to patients?
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Correct.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  And the viewer does not know that?
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  Correct.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  You shouldn't be afraid to say the truth because in the end, you know, truth always wins.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  So obviously the narrative here that they're trying to spin, of course, is that the Trump administration is not keeping up with demand for testing for coronavirus, that they can't meet demand, that they're incompetent.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  So they literally stage a scene where they have multiple people trying to get tested for coronavirus. Only two of the people in that line were actually being tested and the rest were plants put there by CBS News.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  And now they've had to admit that today in light of this project Veritas expose.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  Of course, we also had CNN's Chris Cuomo.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  Headline CNN's Chris Cuomo emergence from basement compared to infamous Brian Williams Iraq moment where he made a big song and dance because he's an incessant drama queen about emerging from his basement having self isolated due to catching coronavirus.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  Turns out, of course, as Fox News reports, he was previously involved in a heated altercation that took place outside his second property in a completely different area of the Hamptons.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  Over the Easter weekend where he had a fight with a bicyclist who filed a police complaint.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  So he claimed that he was emerging from his Corona basement and that it was the first time he come out the basement.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  CNN broadcast this.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  It was then pointed out he'd been outside arguing with people as he loves to do a week before that.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  There was completely staged the idea that this was the first time he was emerging from his basement yet another example of media staging when it comes to this coronavirus outbreak.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Gonna wrap it up for now.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Don't go away.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  We'll be right back with, I guess, Andrew Tate on the other side.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Waking people up to the New World Order.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  Bohemian Grove.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  The American deep state.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  The rise of communist China.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  The plan for global depopulation.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  And global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  But because of your support, our fight continues.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  Join us.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  Support the Info War.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  Together, we will slay the dragon.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  Keep fighting out, stupid gladiator.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  And we are back talking about this virus which seems to have been circulating the world over the past few months.
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  We heard about it, had an article up on summit.news a couple of days ago, again, in context of social distancing.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  Heathrow Boss says social distancing will never work at airports.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  Heathrow Boss John Holland Kay, ones that social distancing measures would never work at airports because queues to board flights would be a kilometer long.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  They're expecting us to go through this. I talked about them putting markings on the pavement on the sidewalk earlier as if anyone's going to abide by that, especially in crowded cities.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  It's practically impossible.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  When will this madness end?
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  The British public has been repeatedly told that even after the lockdown ends, they will have to practice social distancing standing two meters away from the nearest person for months or even years into the future.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  This is impossible, most notably London's transport system, which is notoriously crowded virtually all the time.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  In fact, during the height of these infections in London in the United Kingdom, the people pouring off the subway trains, the trains in London, how social distancing going on there?
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  How is this even enforceable? It's not.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  Well, now the CEO of Heathrow Airport has poured cold water on the idea that social distancing could be practiced inside airports.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  He said, forget social distancing. It won't work in aviation or any other form of public transport.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  The problem is not the plane. It's the lack of space in the airport.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  The largest passenger plane, the A380, seats 500 people.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  The notion that those people could keep two meters distance as they board the plane just isn't feasible.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  Now, he's calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to come up with a common international standard of alternative solutions, because that solution is just not going to cut it.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Because we had the article, which was discussed earlier, South African data analysts, lockdown will lead to 20 times more deaths than coronavirus.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  This is what I've been banging on about for the past three weeks with top cancer experts in the UK and other countries saying,
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  not only will the cure be worse than the virus, it will kill more people.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  The economic impact will kill more people because it leads to poverty, which leads to economic destitution, which leads to death.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  The data analyst consortium in South Africa asserts that the economic consequences of the country's lockdown will lead to 29 times more people dying than the coronavirus itself.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  The model, which is made public today, was developed by consortium calling itself Panda Pandemic Data Analysis, which includes four actuaries.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  These are the people who do actuaries for insurance companies, an economist and a doctor, while the work was checked by lawyers and mathematicians.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  This is reported by the financial mail out of South Africa.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  According to the research, the 29 times figure is a conservative estimate that could be way higher of how many lives will be lost due to the impact of poverty caused by economic hardship over the long term.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  They go on to explain, I think they actually use the data from New York and transpose it onto South Africa because New York has more data.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  They estimate 5.4 years of life have been lost for COVID-19 death.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  They then multiply this by the range of deaths which they predict, 20,000, as well as the actuarial society's prediction of 88,000 fatalities.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  They factor in that the lockdown will have reduced some deaths, but not all. In the end, their model translated into a minimum of 26,800 years of lives lost due to COVID-19 and a maximum of 473,000 years.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  The model shows that the number of years lost due to the economic collapse caused by the lockdown will be between 14 million and 24 million, which means the 29 times figure is on the low end and could be even higher.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  The model also showed that based on European data, 90% of COVID deaths were in people 70 or older with one or more comorbidity with the relative risk to the young and healthy being negligible.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Again, if you look, and I'm going to talk about, let me know if we have a guest by the way, I'm going to talk about this later.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  If you look at the people wearing masks in the parks where I live, most of the people outwearing masks are young people aged 25 to 40, the elderly people out in the parks or outside are not wearing masks.
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  This mask has become like a status symbol for people to feel superior to you. They've got this kind of smugness behind them.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  I'm going to talk about that with Andrew Tate because he's waiting on the line.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Kickboxing world champion, entrepreneur, and all around G, the website is cobratate.com. Andrew, welcome back.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  It's been a while, man. It's been a while.
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Being too long. How's lockdown going? You had coronavirus, right?
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  Yeah, you know what, though? Let me tell you something. Everyone's had coronavirus. The logic to me, the logic deduction is that everybody's had coronavirus.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  I refuse to believe that a disease in which four out of five people who do get sick show flu-like symptoms was instantly detected by the World Health Organization.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  I refuse to believe that, which means it's been around for a long time, nobody knew, which means it's been all around the world, which means we've already all had the virus, which means this lockdown is a waste of time.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  That's my conclusion.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Well, there's actually evidence that came out yesterday, which suggested that it was in... People had it in France, I think, as far back as October.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  So there's now new evidence suggesting that it was circulating around the world long before we knew about it, maybe even before it was in China.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  But you went to Sweden. I talk about Sweden a lot, not always for the best reasons, but they actually got something right.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  This is how bad for the first time in human history. This is how bad other governments have failed, because they had no lockdown.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  Now they've got almost herd immunity. They didn't shut down their economy. Their economy is not going to be on its knees for the next three years, like every other European country.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  And their death rate is lower for capital than the UK's death rate.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  Their R rate, which is the rate of infection, is below one. You went to Sweden. Tell us what you saw, because it looks like they got it right.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Yeah, they absolutely did get it right. And not only do you see that things are open and life is completely as normal, nobody's wearing a mask.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  All the cafes are full. People are having coffee. The parks are full. People are walking around. And their view is very similar to mine.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  They said, listen, this virus has probably been around longer than we knew, and it's probably already got to Sweden, and we were fine.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  And now everyone's being hypochondriac. So for the first time in history, the Swedes got something right. And Stockholm's business is normal. Absolutely business as usual.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  So it was pretty impressive to see.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Now, of course, they relied on their own population to follow these social distancing rules, whether you believe they actually have any effect or not.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  I talked about evidence earlier suggesting that you have to be prolonged close proximity with someone to transmit this disease.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  So this entire idea of us needing to remain two meters apart, which is practically impossible in terms of transport systems, in terms of airports, as the boss of Heathrow said.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  They had that going on. Of course, now you've got a situation with the mass, but in terms of Sweden, the UK, the polls show our population is still completely
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  terrified by this coronavirus. They've been terrorized by weeks and weeks of government media hysteria.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  In Sweden, they said we're going to trust the population to keep social distancing. They did it, apart from in the migrant ghetto areas, which apparently nobody cares about enforcing it in those areas.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  What does it say about Sweden that their population is less terrified than the UK's population?
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  How much of an experiment in mass conformity for the government has this been?
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  Yeah, that's that's pretty crazy. I mean, this is the common cold tied in with a power grab.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  And it's pretty even. I'm surprised by how quickly and how easily people have instantly cowered and said, OK, all right, we'll give up our livelihoods.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  I mean, it's OK for for me and it's OK for a few others who have money.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  But imagine you're sacrificing a business you've worked on your whole life to for this disease, which in all reality, all the data is showing is far less deadly than anything they've ever told us it was.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Or far less deadly than most things you can catch on a normal day.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  We're never going to live life bacteria free. We're never going to be able to wander through the world without worrying about catching some kind of virus.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  That's not the that's not the goal of the human experience.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  We need a health service will take care of us if we're sick, which we have.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  And then we need to carry on getting on carry on with our lives and get things done. The whole lockdown is a waste of time.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  It's crazy.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  This is what Bill Martin said.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  It's as if after March 2020, humanity stopped having immune systems.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  Now we're literally being told you like you'll have to be in a pod to fly on an airplane.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  You have to be in a pod to go to a restaurant.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  They've got images of people sat in greenhouses saying, oh, look how trendy and cozy it is.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  No, walking around in a giant de facto pod is not trendy or cozy. That's a massive inconvenience.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Again, the social distancing is BS, according to all the new studies coming out.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  We're going to get into it more on the other side with Andrew Tate, cobraate.com. Don't go away.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  I sued the IRS and won.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  I can help you too.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  This is a corona crisis self-reliance alert.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  If you're worried about the power grid and the current crisis and want to generate your own supply of off-the-grid electrical power,
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  just in case, pay close attention.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  Here's why.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  A limited supply of solar backup generators will be available again in the next two weeks.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical backup power when you get off the grid.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  And unlike gas generators, these solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes,
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  Dangerous weather, social unrest, or overloaded grids this summer will not be a problem
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  if you go to mysolarbackup.com and get your solar backup generator.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  We regret that supplies are limited and only available on a first-come, first-served basis.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  Check availability at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  Never suffer painful power outages again.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  Mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  Fire your flies, water.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  Get your bug assault today.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Most human world.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its endgame.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless, disgusting power trip.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people,
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  already starving because of the global lockdown.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  This is insane.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  You need to get prepared now.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  You need to get high quality, storable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  This is beyond 1984.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  We are live with Andrew take over take dot com now.
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Andrew obviously does love a lot of things.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  Little known fact is that he's partially to blame for the downfall of Western masculinity
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  because he runs these cam girl studios where simps throw beta books at thoughts.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  And Andrew, I guess business is booming right now, right?
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  Business is at least tripled since the lockdown.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  The Western world is going to fall apart.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  It can at least make me rich on its way down.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  So I try my very, very best.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  Some of these guys, the girls will say to them,
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  look, why don't you just go out and get a girlfriend, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  But these guys, they want to live this way.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  They want to send money to girls online and the girls work for me.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  So yeah, business is doing very well.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  Yeah, I covered a story a few weeks ago.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  Only fans were saying that their sign ups have been the fastest ever
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  both in terms of customers and people going on only fans and performing.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  So yeah, business is obviously booming in that sector because everybody's staying inside.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  I want to get into masks.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  Now in the UK, unlike the US areas of the US at least, it's not the law to wear masks.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  You don't have to wear masks anywhere.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  That's not in the social distancing lockdown laws.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  From what I've seen though,
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  I might allotted one hour of daily exercise out in the park.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  See all kinds of different people, all kinds of different ages.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  This mask has become kind of a status symbol of spugness
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  adopted by cringe normies to make themselves feel superior to you
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  because they probably have a massive inferiority complex.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  I've noticed elderly people who are susceptible to coronavirus,
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  people who have pre-existing conditions, which is fair enough, wear a mask.
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  I totally understand that.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  They're not wearing the masks.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  The people wearing the masks are aged 25 to 40.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  And I've tweeted about this the other day.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  Three types of mask wearers.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  Because this has become a kind of new status symbol of conformity.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  You've got older people who are genuinely at risk, fair enough.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  Then you've got people who have been so terrorized by this constant bombardment
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  of death statistics and media hysteria about coronavirus
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  that I'm sure some of them actually think that they can catch it just by walking outside
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  and that COVID-19 is literally circulating everywhere in the air.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  You've got those, that category of people who've been so terrified.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  Then you've got this other category.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  And I've noticed they want to feel smug in their obedience.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  It's like, who can conform?
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  Who can jump the highest when the government asked them to the most?
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  They broadcast how much better they are than you.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  And they don't even social distance.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  And if you get, if you're in the supermarket, the people wearing masks
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  think they can ignore this social distancing stuff
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  because they're of a higher class.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  Have you noticed this?
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  Everyone I've seen with a mask is constantly playing with it as well.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  I thought we weren't supposed to touch our face.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  They're constantly adjusting it around their nose, putting it on, taking it off.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  It's just they're trying to advertise to the world what a dork they are.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  I'm a nerd and I do everything the government says.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  Listen, the World Health Organization did not identify this virus in its infancy.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  The virus has been around for a long time.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  It's already spread everywhere.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  It doesn't affect most people.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  It does affect you if you go to the hospital.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  That's the end of it.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  The whole world is insane.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  I cannot believe this has happened.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  We must live in some kind of simulation ball.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  How is the whole world turned off?
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  There's not even a huge mortality rate.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  You'd expect for a virus that was shut down in the world,
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  I expected a zombie apocalypse.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  There's nothing like that.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  It's absolutely nothing like this.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  It's insane.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  And there's two countries, Belarus and Sweden.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  Sweden I've already been to.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  Belarus I'm trying to go to in the next three days.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  Where nothing's closed and everyone's fine.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  Imagine working a job and imagine having your life savings destroyed
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  or your company destroyed in the name of a virus where there's other countries
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  proving in real time that the lockdown is a bullshit.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  Sorry, didn't mean to swear.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  But you get the point I'm making.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  It's absolutely insane.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  I don't know what's going on.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  I think it's just a power grab wrapped up with the common cold.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  That's all it is.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  It's incredible.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  I mean, we were told, and I've mentioned this before,
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  we needed these social distancing lockdown measures for a period of six to eight weeks
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  to get back to the new normal.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  Now they're saying, no, forget about that.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  You're never going to get back to normal.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  This is the new normal.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  They're talking about drone surveillance to enforce social distancing.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  They're talking about putting markings on the pavement.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  So you have to stay two meters away from everybody.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Literally filling the street with more street furniture,
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  more signs telling you what you can and can't do.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  This won't even work, as I've said, in airports and trains because it's practically impossible.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  This is going to lead to the increasing atomization of society.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  What's the real agenda behind these draconian measures?
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Is it just so they can reintroduce it on a whim and use it to impose a de facto prison camp
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  where we're all literally walking around in pods?
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  Absolutely.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  When is the last time a government has taken power under the guise of safety
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  and given the power back?
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  Ever.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  When does that ever happen?
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  When is the last time a government said, oh, we just need to spy on your emails for a little while?
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  We just need to tap your phone for a little while.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  Oh, we just need to send to your speech for a little while.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Oh, we just need to make sure you don't say hateful things for a little while.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  But in the future, we're going to go back.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  Never.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  Every single thing they introduce, they keep forever.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  And the reason they're saying we may have to go back at any point is so they can press a button at any point in the future.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  Yeah, and when else locked inside their house again,
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  you have to understand the people who are in charge of the world, the elites, are beyond money.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  They don't care about money.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  They print money on demand.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  Money doesn't matter to them.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  They have no problem destroying an economy and bankrupting millions and millions of people.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  It doesn't bother them.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  They're ultra trillionaires.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  They own banks.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  They own the food and the air and the water.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  They don't care about any of this.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  The one thing they want more of isn't money.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  It's power.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  And this has given them the perfect excuse to tell everyone to stay in their house,
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  otherwise face severe consequence.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  This is the power grab.
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  And they're never going to give the power back.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  Ever.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  It's insane.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  And we talk about the new normal here with the power grab.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  The new standard now for social media censorship.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  And this was introduced first by YouTube.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  Now Twitter and Facebook have basically followed suit.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  The new standard for you being banned on social media is questioning authorities.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  That's it.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  And who's an authority?
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  Anyone who they say is, despite the fact that trust in mainstream media is at record low
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  and nobody trusts these authorities anyway.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  To the point where they had two licensed professional doctors giving a one and a half hour calm
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  collected lecture on COVID-19 five million plus views on YouTube.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  They yanked the video.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  Now it doesn't even make sense.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  It got five million views that would have paled off.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  Most people would have watched it by that point.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  It got bumped up into the news once again because of the reason that they censored it.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  Now if they start censoring stuff, that's going to make people believe it even more now.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  That's what's completely crazy about these authority figures.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  The companies and organizations that they say are authoritarian and they're completely
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  correct and you cannot disagree with them.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  Of all the organizations before this whole COVID nonsense before this virus of all the
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  organizations, I thought that maybe at least capable.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  I would have assumed it be the World Health Organization because the idea is very simple.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  There's no bipartisan, there's no conservative liberal.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  It's just doctors around the world who want to keep people alive.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  But it turns out they're incompetent.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  It turns out they get everything wrong.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  You have doctors from all around the world who can't even sit there and deal with the common cold
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  in a very simple and different form without lying about whether it spreads from person to person
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  and sending all these lies out.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  So they're completely media controlled and they're completely a puppet.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  If the World Health Organization are puppets and they're at the whims of the elite billionaires
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  who are trying to control the world, then nothing's safe.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  That any authority you can possibly name is nothing but propaganda.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  Before the virus, I would not believe how deceptive the World Health Organization would be on purpose.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  Look at their track record on this virus.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  They've got every single thing wrong.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  These are the doctors and they've got everything wrong from start to finish.
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  Constantly flip flopping, everything they're told to say to keep people scared and in their house.
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  Fake news.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  And these are the bodies that you're not allowed to question.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Literally caught covering up the spread of coronavirus for China, covering up for China
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  and silencing their own doctors who were in the WHO meeting saying,
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  we need to tell countries to close their borders.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  WHO said, no, those are the trusted authorities that you're not allowed to question,
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  even though, as you say, they got it completely wrong.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  they thought might never be solved.
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  I can help you too.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  Sure, coffee, candy and other highly sugar filled drinks can give you a short boost,
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  but the crash always follows.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  Turbo Force.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, Turbo Force from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins,
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus,
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  clarity and a boost of energy when you need it.
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  Turbo Force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable and tasty energy.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try Turbo Force for a limited time at an incredible 40% off.
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get Turbo Force right now only at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  It was I, the leader of Cobra, that foresaw your inner cowardice and how much you would enjoy watching Netflix
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  and wearing masks in clubs when you went out to feel all important like you were in a war.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  With the real time that of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of starvation,
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  who were about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  Cobra thanks you for watching time.
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  Hail Cobra!
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  I believe in God and I believe in the long run.
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  It'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  I understand what comes around, what goes around.
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  You really put me so and I live that.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  And I fundamentally at a cellular level understand it.
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  Now if I would have hyped up the virus, was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like the UN did,
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  I would have sold five times more supplements.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  But you know what, I didn't do that.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless people are vitamin D deficient, people are deficient.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  I had died in so many other issues.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  You need those products regardless.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  So we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion, all the other products.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies defenses.
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food now.
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  We've seen these for the past two months. They don't seem to be stopping.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  They even had one a few days ago where the nurses were carrying a mock corpse with COVID-19 written on it.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  They're wearing PPE, which we were told was dangerously low on stock and couldn't be misused.
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  We were told that hospitals would be overwhelmed.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  It turns out that in the UK, acute hospital beds are four times emptier than normal.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  They're closing down some of these overspill hospitals because they've never been used.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  But they all have time to dance around and make TikTok videos.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  What does it say about how desperate you need to be for internet cloud and the state of narcissism in western society that this is what we're seeing?
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  I cannot imagine anything more disrespectful to the people who are dying in hospital of something else.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  Forget COVID. You have a heart attack. You go to the hospital. You die.
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  Are you telling me, and then doctors and nurses are doing this?
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  Are you telling me there is not a single activity they could participate in at their place of work,
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  which would be more likely to save a life than making a TikTok video?
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  This is more than just a waste of time.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  It's absolutely disrespectful to the people who are there with life-threatening conditions outside of this virus that we all talk about.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  These people should be reprimanded severely.
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  If I was in charge, every single person I caught doing a stupid dance would be fired on the spot.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  If there's ever a time in your life to take a job seriously, it's during a global pandemic.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  I mean, as a doctor or nurse, you should probably take your job seriously pretty much every day.
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  But during a global pandemic, which is being advertised as saying that the world is going to turn into a war zone and everyone's losing their jobs,
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  that's probably a pretty good time to take your job relatively seriously and not dance around like a fool.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  All of these people should be fired instantly. This does nothing but destroy confidence.
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Paul, would you trust any of those people to operate on your heart or your brain?
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  I'm asking you a direct question after watching their TikTok.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  It destroys confidence in the health care system.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  Why are we playing such ridiculous taxes in the U.K. getting destroyed to fund an NHS,
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  which every single year they have to put more and more tax on for us to fund for these people to run around and make stupid videos?
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  This is beyond a joke. It's beyond a joke. They should put me in charge.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  Of course, Andrew. We've been told, Andrew, you can't trust them. These are the new heroes.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  How dare you insult them? They're just letting off steam.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  Then you had actual family members of cancer victims saying, hang on,
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  we can't even get into hospital to get chemotherapy, to get screenings for cancer.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  There's plenty of time for them to dance around in TikTok videos.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  You've had doctors come out now and nurses, I featured one in my recent video,
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  they're questioning this. Now that family members of cancer victims, actual doctors are questioning it,
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  hopefully it'll subside, show no signs of subsiding so far.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  Talk about this professor lockdown. I talked about this earlier.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  The very guy in the UK responsible for being the architect of this policy, this lockdown policy,
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  they claimed, he claimed, based on his model, which has been completely discredited,
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  500,000 people would die in the UK if we didn't do what he said and locked down.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  The British government reversed its position based on his discredited model,
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  locked down the entire country. We're still in lockdown.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  We're being told, oh, we might let you out for a picnic in three weeks.
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  This guy behind the entire program gets caught having his mistress,
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  who is married with two kids, visit him. Now he's resigned.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  What does it say about people who are so serious about emphasizing the need for compliance,
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  but then they act in a totally non-compliant manner?
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  Oh, yeah, Mr. Horney. I heard about Mr. Horney. This dude should do jail time.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  He shut the whole country down. Why is he not going to jail?
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  He lied to the government, shut the country down, ruined millions of lives,
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  and he just would run around with his, I don't want to say that on Live on Info Wars,
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  with his desires, and he's not facing jail time.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  This is a typical example of why you should never believe what the elites say.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  I will take coronavirus seriously when the elites take it seriously.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  This guy, the man who's in charge of the fake computer model, he's not concerned, so I'm not concerned.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  I'm not concerned about crime, rich billionaires buying beachfront property.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  When they stop buying beachfront property and start trying to buy all the houses on top of mountains, I'll care.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  But until then, I don't care because there's nothing else but scaremongering and a power grab.
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  That's all it is. This guy should do jail time instantly. Resigning is not enough.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  The worst thing about these computer models, I can come up with a computer model for anything.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  The numbers you put in dictates what comes out.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  I can type in random numbers to come up with a model. It doesn't mean anything.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  England could have actually, for once in its life, in recent history, did the right thing.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  And for once, made me semi-proud to be British, left the country open like Sweden did,
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  reached herd immunity, and proved that a country that just has a bit of common sense could continue to function
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  and the health system will continue to look after the people that need to be looked after.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  But instead, they reversed everything based on, like you said, the recommendation of Mr. Horny,
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  who's running around breaking his own rules. Do not listen to the elites because they don't listen.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  When the rich people stop flying on private jets and buying houses on the beach, care about climate change.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  When Mr. Horny starts staying in his house locked up, scared to do news interviews, then you can worry about coronavirus.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  Until then, it's nothing but propaganda and a bid to control ordinary people.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  It's interesting because the government reversed their policy.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  They were originally going to go with a Sweden-type policy.
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  They reversed the policy based on this guy's fear mongering.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  And as a result of that, they terrorized the British population to such a degree that even now,
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  a majority of people, according to the most recent polls, don't want this lockdown to even end.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  There was a poll which said, I think 60% wanted the government to close the parks,
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  the only place basically that were allowed to go because they were terrorized so much by this propaganda.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  Absolutely incredible. And the guy behind it all is the first one to violate his own lockdown laws.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  Absolutely incredible. And in fact, this mistress, this 38-year-old woman who is married with two children
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  and has an open marriage, and that means, you know what it means,
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  interesting that she would be at the center of this, she did a podcast 24 hours after visiting
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  Professor Pentstown, Professor Lockdown, in which she complained that the lockdown
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  was putting a strain on her marriage while she was literally visiting the guy,
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  having an affair with the guy responsible for the lockdown. How's that for irony?
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  Mr. Lockdown looks like a nerd, and there's certain levels of nerdity I will tolerate.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  But if you show his face again, there is no need to look like this unless you're trying to project something.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  He looks like this to try and project to the world that he's smart.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  He's decided to look like a geek and a dork for his entire human life,
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  so everyone can look at him and think, oh, he's a nerd, but he might be smart with his stupid little glasses.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  Now we know he doesn't know anything. He can't control his urges when he's running around trying to have adulterous sex.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  He should go to jail.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  Absolutely incredible. Now, we've got a couple of minutes left here to tell people about, you know,
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  what people should do in the last three weeks of lockdown, money, fitness, mindset,
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  and some of the projects that you've got going on right now.
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  Absolutely. I think the one good thing about the lockdown is it's been a good chance for people
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  if they've used the time correctly to sit and reset and understand something.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  The government doesn't care about you. Your job doesn't really care about you.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  It's all about you and you have to find a way to fend for yourself.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  And I think that hopefully there'll be a good mentality and mindset change amongst people
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  when they see that when stuff really hits the fan and things really get hard,
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  the only person to be able to count on it is yourself and the people around you.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  I think that's one of the good things that could have possibly come out from the lockdown.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  So cobertake.com, I have a lot of courses on there. I explain a lot of things, how to make money, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  And I'll help you. You can go check out the website, message the live chat, and they'll talk everything through.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  I won't talk about it too much here.
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  But certainly from a mental, from a mentality standpoint and a financial standpoint,
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  there's a lot of people who realize just how fragile they are.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  And this is a good chance to change that because once something bad starts happening, it never fixed.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  This lockdown thing, it's something we've never seen before in our lives,
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  and it's going to be something we're going to start seeing more and more often.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  It's another tool. So if you're struggling now in the lockdown, let me tell you this.
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  It's going to come again. It's coming back. So you better prepare for it.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  So if you're sitting there going, if I could just get through the lockdown and get back to work,
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  the lockdown's coming back. It's all going to come back.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  This is another tool now they're going to use another thumb screw to punish the ordinary citizen
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  for living a life outside of their billionaire circle. So prepare yourself and be ready.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  That's all I can say.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  All right, cobratate.com. Andrew, thanks for joining us.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  Absolutely. Thank you very much.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  There goes Andrew Tate, number one.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  Gee, you're going to be back in the next segment.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  Talk about Germany's coronavirus death rate.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  Ten times lower than official figures show.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  This is after Angela Merkel came out and said that 53 million Germans would be affected
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  with it and that it would have a death rate of something in line with WHO's 3.4%.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  Once again, total lies. Don't go away. We'll be right back.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest? How do you put them under siege?
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  with the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  Bill Ma or even admitted it, man, I hope we have a depression.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  And now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  But that's not what they're doing. They are pulling America up by its roots
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  and committing millions of third world people to death.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  I'm always excited about Info War's live products.
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You love them. I love them.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  that is amazing. The only organic hand sanitizer on the market
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo,
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  but it's high quality. It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  It's got organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  But I just love it. Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  So, this is a real innovation.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  We have their battle plans.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest of a preposition.
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  Well, now they're caught back up. They've got high quality storeable food in stock
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  Get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to go right at the head of the queue
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  to get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the employer.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  Here's Storeable Food Now at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  We're not going to listen to Congress but all these other corporations
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  are going to work in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  This is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Public with the president and others need to develop a plan to understand
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  Only understanding the reality of the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  Joseph Watson.
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  Get back for the final segment before I get back into some more breaking news stories.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  In fact, an update on Professor Pantsdown on a Direct 2 to infowarstore.com
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  where we have the ultimate krill oil.

[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  Now back to the news.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  BBC reports coronavirus Neil Ferguson.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  That's Professor pants down to face no police action for undermining lockdown.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  Well, what a surprise.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  Despite the fact that police have handed out probably now thousands of thousands of fines
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  for the ordinary plebs who have broken the lockdown laws.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  Professor Neil Ferguson will not face police action after he accepted making an error of judgment.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  By breaching social distancing rules, by having his mistress, the mother of two children,
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  visit him for his sordid little affair.
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  Scotland Yard said Professor Ferguson's behavior was plainly disappointing,
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  but ruled out issuing a fine.
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  Not even going to get a fine.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  Force said he had taken responsibility.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  All right, so if you break the law and say, oh, I'm sorry, I take responsibility,
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  then you're immune apparently.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  Professor Ferguson said he regretted undermining social distancing rules.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  So again, police have said they're not going to take any further action.
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  Nothing whatsoever will happen to him.
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  They're not even going to give him a 60 pound fine.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  But breaking his own lockdown law that led to the shutdown of the economy of the entire country.
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  Meanwhile, Black Mirror creator not working on season six because we already feel depressed.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  This is Charlie Brokker.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  In fact, I've got a friend who writes with Charlie Brokker and he said he believes humanity could use a bleakness break.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  Of course, if you haven't seen it, Black Mirror is a TV series which basically portrays the world as a high tech dystopia.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  And the longer it goes on, the further the world actually edges closer to being exactly like the world portrayed in his series.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  He's revealed to the UK's Radio Times. He's not currently working on writing season six of Netflix Emmy winning series.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  Because we've already found ourselves plunged into a nightmarish dystopia like those explored in his shows.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  So he's not writing that because the world is becoming too similar to the dystopian hellscape portrayed in his fictional series.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Meanwhile, Mayor of Nice calls for health passports giving citizens permission to travel.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  Mayor of Nice has called for citizens to be required to carry health passports if they wish to travel.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  This again is similar to the immunity ID cards that the German government is talking about,
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  which again creates an added layer of bureaucracy and regulation needing government permission to travel.
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  Of course, when the vaccine rolls out, which we've been told will be in about a year or so as time,
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  maybe those ID cards will say whether you've had the vaccine or not. And if you haven't had the vaccine, well, maybe no traveling for you.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  Video. Senator Cotton says China should provide evidence to disprove coronavirus lab leak.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  There's a Senator Tom Cotton who said Tuesday the onus is on China to produce evidence that will dispute the global intelligence assessment
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  that there is a high possibility that coronavirus could have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  Of course, the bat that they say the coronavirus emerged out of is the horseshoe bat,
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  according to the studies, which was not sold at the Wuhan wet market.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  So how could it have come from a horseshoe bat if it came from the wet market when that bat was not present?
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  Where it was present is at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, just a coincidence.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  Appearing on Fox News, Cotton said all of the evidence will be at circumstantial points directly at those labs.
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  Trump has hopped on this time and time again. The media still comes out almost every day and says there's no evidence it came from the lab.
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  The same media that said it was racist to say it came out of the wet market because saying that Chinese people eat weird things and drink bat soup is racist.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  So you can't say it came from the meat market because that's racist. You can't say it came from the lab because it's a conspiracy theory.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  Where did it come from? Anywhere but China, according to them.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  Because now they're the de facto Communist Party state media.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  Ted Cruz says Hollywood is complicit in Chinese censorship, introduces built restrict production.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  Senator Ted Cruz has introduced legislation that would see Hollywood production severely limited if they're found to be bowing to Chinese censored.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  Of course, for years, for probably over 10 years now, Hollywood films have had to be edited to remove things that offend the Chinese government so that they then can be played and sold in the lucrative Chinese market.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  To the point that there was a movie last year about Freddie Mercury of Queen Bohemian Rhapsody, where they had to delete all the scenes which referenced the fact that Freddie Mercury was gay.
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  Now that's like 20% of the movie, whatever your beliefs or standpoint on homosexuality are, that's like 20% of what the movie's based on.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  They had to cut out all of that to sell it in China.
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  Now Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to try and roll some of that back because again, China is increasingly controlling US culture.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  Now US academia, US universities now shutting down arms of China's propaganda machine.
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  Another US university has announced it's shutting down its Confucius Institute, the organization which is overseen by the Chinese Ministry of Education,
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  and it charges that the cultural exchange programs are being used by the communist state to indoctrinate Americans and spread Chinese propaganda.
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  University of California Davis is the latest of a string of universities to act the Confucius Institute after heightened concerns among US officials that China is abusing the program.
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  So it started off as a program to teach people Chinese recipes, Chinese cooking, and it became Chinese culture.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  Now it's Chinese language, and it's obviously meant to subvert, infiltrate the US education system, which as we've seen, is not that hard to do if you've got a hard left agenda.
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  Information Liberation Reports researcher on verge of making very significant coronavirus findings shot in their head.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  Just a coincidence, a Twitter user evidently predicted this would happen over a month ago and that is that tweet is included in the article.
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  NBC News reports of medical researchers said to be on the verge of making very significant coronavirus findings was shot to death over the weekend in Pennsylvania.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  Bing Liu, 37, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine was found dead Saturday inside a home in Ross Township north of Pittsburgh.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  He'd been shot in the head an hour after his body was discovered.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  A second person was found dead inside a car less than a mile away.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  Investigators believe the second person killed Liu before returning to his car where he died of self inflicted gunshot wound.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  The guy who was killed was working on a cure for coronavirus.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  Very interesting coincidence there.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  We have people being arrested for cutting people's hair.
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  We covered that earlier in the show.
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  We covered media staging earlier in the show.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  Sweden, of course, this is our spectator.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  Sweden tames its R number without lockdown.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  As I've explained, Sweden did not lock down its entire economy.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  They merely trusted their citizens to engage in personal social distancing, which they did.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  Now they have herd immunity almost.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  They haven't locked down their economy.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  People aren't going to die because of related reasons of poverty.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  And now Sweden has been the world's COVID-19 outlier pursuing social distancing but rejecting mandatory lockdown.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  What I think will go through the fact that the R rate is the same or lower than it is in the UK, which did lock down its entire economy.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  The death rate in Sweden is lower per capita than the UK's death rate again, despite the fact that it followed diametrically opposite policy.
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  The virus is shown to be spreading far faster in Sweden, not because the mortality trends are significantly different, but because no full lockdown has been ordered so far.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  So what did this imply for Sweden?
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  Imperial did not translate the graph to talk about the UK model, of course, and they found that the latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  Despite the fact that the initial model, based on the fact that Sweden didn't shut down, said that there would be 40,000 COVID deaths in Sweden by May 1 and 100,000 by June.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  It didn't happen. They did have a higher death rate than other Scandinavian countries, but it was only 2,680 when this article was written.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  Their policy worked. They didn't destroy their economy. They didn't kill tens of hundreds of thousands of people, and now they can get back on track.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  They got it right. They got it drastic.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  War Room coming up. Don't go away.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  Info Wars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom, but worldwide Maverick spirit.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  It's not just myself or the host at Info Wars or the researchers or the journalists. It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena.
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  And it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make Info Wars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, Davos Group, and other globalists.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Not a world where the establishment, hate themselves, protect their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  I'm really excited to know that Info Wars has your support and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this.
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[2:59:37.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless, disgusting power trip.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  Alright, I'm at the court here sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour on Info Wars.
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  Lots to talk about today.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  We're going to focus on Neil Ferguson, of course, the lunatic who used what some people would call science to predict massive deaths all over the world that led to the lockdowns in the UK, the US, France, Germany, etc., etc.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  Some of you probably know by now that he's been caught up in a sex scandal as of yesterday for a man, and he resigned his government position.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  But of course, we don't know whether or not he's resigned his university position as a computer modeler.
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  He models the deaths. Here's where they are. This is how many he predicted 500,000 in the UK, 2 million in America, unless everybody locked down.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  And so Fauci, CDC, World Health Organization climbed on board, Trump caved in and listened, didn't ask serious questions.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  Let's get it straight once and for all and stop making excuses for the President of the United States.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  Did not ask questions. Did not read. Did not think. Simply went along with the show at the beginning instead of saying, who is this guy who says 2 million people will die unless we lock down the country?
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  What is his track record? You would have asked that. I would have asked that.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  I mean, right? Isn't that right? Wouldn't that have been the case?
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  And the parade of idiots behind Trump, Berks, Fauci, Redfield, etc., etc.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  Who is going to have confidence in these people? Who, Pence, are you serious?
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  I mean, it just drives you to distraction to think about this.
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  Boris Johnson in the UK. What does he do? Oh, Neil Ferguson. He's a computer genius, right?
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  He says that 500,000 people are going to die in the UK unless we lock it down right away, right? Isn't that the case?
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  Well, I guess we better do it then. Boris, don't be a schmuck. Too late.
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  Boris could have said, just like Trump could have said, who is this guy, Neil Ferguson? What is his track record? What has he done?
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  Would I buy a used car from this man, a light bulb, a box of matches, anything? What do we know about him, Fauci?
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  Apparently not. Because if Trump had asked Fauci, or if Boris Johnson had asked any number of people, or Merkel, or Macron,
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  we would have seen a completely different outcome. This is what you have to understand.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  We would have seen a completely different outcome. No lockdowns. No lockdowns. Instead, it would have been well, just like Fauci said in February.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  It's like a serious season of the flu, and that's about it. We get through it. We always do. Back to work. Here we go.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  But instead, this little potato head, Fauci, who pretends to be a scientist, who pretends to be a manager, who pretends to be a supervisor,
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  he said, Mr. President, two million deaths are on your head unless you lock down the country. We'll be back.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:20.000]  The moment of truth is now here. We are facing the post-human era, and I've been warning you for many years that they would use a global viral crisis
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  to click, put us in the cage, and then roll out the robot takeover. This is just the beta test. China is moving out of beta and into operational control.
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  In just a few years, we will be under full globalist control, forced inoculations, total surveillance, and we're all being taught that we are obsolete.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  The term they use is non-essential. This is not some dystopian novel. This is reality. This is the New World Order. This is Satanism.
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  Very exciting and positive has happened. The people of the United States, the people of the UK, the people of Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America,
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  began to go to local hospitals when they heard that they were all overwhelmed with death and body bags, and then to show that local media was staging events,
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  was staging photo shoots with actors and people dressed up in hazmat suits.
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  Now, a few months ago, when we were first exposing that, the media attacked us and said we were fake news, but then more and more citizens went out and documented it for themselves
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  when they would see a local press conference saying, we're here, there's lines around the block, there's, you know, body bags everywhere.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  People would drive sometimes in a few minutes and get there and show that it was almost completely empty and was a hoax.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  Project Veritas has now gotten insiders to come out. It's breaking today and show how CBS staged one of these events. This is smoking gun information.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  Also, US Intel has come out and said that China has been caught hyping this and working with mainstream media and funding it, and they're afraid that they're going to try to break into the databases
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  and inflate COVID numbers so we never reopen. It's now confirmed, this has been a CHICOM Deep State NIH WHO operation to bring in panic,
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  world government and economic collapse to bring the first world into submission and to starve and depopulate the third world.
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  So here is some of the highlights of this incredible Project Veritas report, and I'll be back with some final words.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  You're telling me you're 100% certain that CBS News, CBS News Corporation, National, staged a fake event.
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  They fake the news. They fake the reality and broadcasted that to all of their audience last Friday on CBS This Morning.
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  100% absolutely. Only six states have reported more cases than Michigan, but fewer than 2% of its people have been tested for the virus.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  In our series on the state of coronavirus testing, Adriana Diaz shows how Michigan is trying to improve a system that has failed some of its people.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  But the governor says testing above all else will help determine when to fully reopen.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  Apparently, the news crew wanted more people online, because they knew it was COVID.
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  Well, we knew when they were coming. We had no clue that we were going to have to do fake patients.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  Did she tell you guys, like, hey, you're not actually getting tested?
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, she just was just to make it look busy.
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  That's crazy.
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  Well, I didn't see you guys had to do the swab at all. I just saw you talking with them, and then I was talking with the other girl.
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  There were a couple of real patients that made it worse.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  They probably just wanted to look busy.
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  Is this the fake lines?
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  Yes, yep, that's it.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  So the people in the cars are not patients?
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  The majority of them. I do know from talking with the testers that one of them, one or two of them were real patients, which added to their frustration, because this line sat there for a while so they could organize the shot.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  So they've made a line of cars with medical personnel on the cars as opposed to patients?
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  Correct.
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  And the viewer does not know that?
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  Correct. You shouldn't be afraid to say the truth, because in the end, you know, truth always wins.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  As horrifying as this report is, the good news is grassroots journalists were the first to begin exposing this more than two months ago, and it shows the power of we the people.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  And I have friends and I have family that really thought COVID-19 was the end of the world and who really bought it to the hype.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  But now they're seeing the numbers, and now they're seeing the medical doctors come out and expose the fact that it's not even as bad as the flu.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  And people are really beginning to understand what a monstrous bill of malendigates financed hoax this has all been.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  But they're blocking Project Veritas on YouTube.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  They're blocking all of our videos on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  That's why this is posted at Band.video, and when you get excited and when you promote these band videos, like the doctors that came out and exposed it as a hoax a few weeks ago, the YouTube band, we mirrored it and it got over a million views at Band.video.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  So the next part of this equation is you taking action and sharing this video on your email, on your Twitter, on your Facebook, on your YouTube, and by word of mouth, don't let these criminals continue to operate like this.
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  They think you're stupid. They think I'm stupid. They think we're weak. They think they can override us and tell these incredible lies and stage these events, but they're not going to be able to do it.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, they are taking all the normal deaths of heart attacks, cancer, pneumonia, and putting it in the column of COVID-19 to jack up the numbers because they want to be able to have this lockdown.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  So President Trump and President Balasaro and others lose to repudiate nationalism. They admitted they wanted a global depression to stop Donald Trump, and now they're close to doing it, but not close enough because we the people are taking action.
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  So spread this video now like you've never had before, and I salute you and I thank you.
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  Band.video!
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  Alright, John Rathaport back here. So why would they fake reality? Because they don't have the numbers. Because they don't have reality.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  I mean, that's why you fake it when you don't have it. If you don't have it, you need to fake it. This is what I've been saying and writing for the past three months, day and night, day and night, day and night.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  Why do you think it's the 80 year olds and the 70 year olds and the 95 year olds? They're saying, oh yeah, it was a COVID death, a COVID death, a COVID death. Yeah, he fell off a cliff and on the way down, we tested him and he was positive.
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  So he's a COVID death because they don't have the numbers because it doesn't add up because it doesn't make sense.
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  They've been doing this with flu and pneumonia for decades.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  CDC putting flu and pneumonia in the same category in the year 2001 as was exposed in the BMJ British Medical Journal online.
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  If you took down the number of actual flu deaths in the US that you could confirm by finding the virus with a test, you got 18. Not 36,000. Friggin 18.
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  Oh, he couldn't be right. That's ridiculous. That would never happen. Yeah, well, you've been fooled again. That's all I can say. You've been fooled again.
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  All these numbers are concocted, flu numbers, COVID numbers. Why? Because they don't have enough numbers that they can blame on a virus.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  Because if they can blame it on a virus, they can tell you, you've got to have a vaccine. Get it?
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  And so this is what this guy, Neil Ferguson, was there for at the Imperial College of London. Tens of millions of dollars go into the Institute from Bill Gates.
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  That is Ferguson's Institute.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  And he is a computer modeler that makes the dire predictions that this psychopath that you're looking at on the screen, Bill Gates, can now use to say, we have to shoot everybody up on the planet with a COVID vaccine before we can end the lockdown.
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  I mean, wow.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  And much, in fact, it's exactly like saying, we have to destroy the village in order to save it. Remember that one?
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  We have to destroy the village in order to save it. That's what these psychopaths and sociopaths like Gates believe.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  We have to start over. Humanity is flawed. But we're the engineers. We can create a perfect technocracy with wall-to-wall surveillance to the Chinese model, as Alex was talking about.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  And we can impose that on the entire world. But in order to do that, we have to destroy what we've got in front of us.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  So in the succeeding segment, I will go chapter and verse on Neil Ferguson's past failed predictions, where if people were paying attention, anybody, doesn't have to be Trump, Fauci, Boris Johnson,
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  anybody in any public health status as a bureaucrat was paying attention to what Ferguson has predicted in the past. They would say, well, at best, this guy should be modeling the number of cockroaches and motels.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  That's it. And that's it for the moment. But stay because you're going to want to hear this. We'll be back after the break.

[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:18.000]  We don't get through the game.
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:32.000]  But this is why it's important for you to know this, because it's how you've been tricked, scammed, lied to, cheated, etc.
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  Bill Gates. His money goes to the Institute at Imperial College in London. That institute is run by Neil Ferguson, a scientist, computer modeler.
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  Neil Ferguson comes up with a computer model saying huge numbers of deaths in the U.K. and U.S. and, by implication, everywhere else, unless we lock down.
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  Prediction.
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  Neil Ferguson has a direct line into the World Health Organization, which of course is also heavily funded and basically owned by Bill Gates.
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  So Ferguson tells the CDC World Health Organization, here's what's going to happen. Here's the horror story.
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  He's talking for Bill Gates, basically, because he's funded by Bill Gates, and he's giving the justification and the rationale for a COVID vaccine worldwide, which is the plan, the Bill Gates plan.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  The terrible number of deaths, unless we lock down, can't end the lockdown until vaccine. Got it?
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  CDC World Health Organization go to governments like the U.K., like U.S., France, Germany, etc., etc., and say, okay, if you don't want millions of deaths on your head, you've got to lock down the country.
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  And excuse me for suggesting that political and mathematical idiots run these countries, but they do, because they don't ask questions, because they don't say what you or I would say.
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  Who's the modeler? Who made the predictions? What's his track record? Why should I just take your word for it and lock down an entire country and bring the economy to a standstill?
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  Because you are standing in front of me in my office and claiming that millions of people are going to die.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:55.000]  But no, they don't do that. They just say, well, okay, I guess that's what we have to do.
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  Morons, idiots. Okay, here's the man's track record. 2001, Ferguson, in a computer model, predicted 150,000 people could die from mad cow disease in the U.K., causing the destruction of 6 million animals in the U.K.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  Think about that, 6 million. And according to official stats anyway, in the end, 150,000 people died, 200 people died.
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  6 million animals. Are you ready to wake up tomorrow and say, hey, let's kill 6 million cows and sheep? That was 2001.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  Now, Big E came in 2005 with bird flu. When Ferguson predicted, get this, 200 million people could die, right?
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  The official real number when it was over in the low hundreds. That's the sky's track record.
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  Now, hey, attention, don't go to sleep. Don't cop out on me. Listen.
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  This bird flu model was the same basic computer structure model that Ferguson used in 2020 to predict COVID deaths.
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  He said 200 million could die from bird flu in 2005, and the final official count was in the low hundreds.
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  Then in 2009, swine flu predicted 65,000 people could die in the U.K., and the final figure was below 500.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  Got it?
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  This is the a-hole, the criminal scientist who is praised to the sky as a genius and whatever that all these governments are following.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  He's funded by Bill Gates.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  Bill Gates wants a lockdown.
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  Ferguson provides the rationale for the lockdown. The countries are locked down.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  Economies are destroyed.
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  People become robots walking down the street in masks and gloves like idiots everywhere.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  And the whole thing is a fake.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  I said it was a fake from the beginning.
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  I said the whole point was the vaccine from the beginning.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  I said everything else was a fake.
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  I've said they were all fakes since 1987.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  I've investigated fake epidemics for 30 years.
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  Eventually people come around when they see the devastation, the economic devastation that is being brought in the name of a virus.
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  And they begin to ask questions because they have to.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  Because they have to.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  Because they say, should I sacrifice myself on the altar of saving my next door neighbor from a virus?
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  I don't even know whether I have.
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  I don't even know whether it exists.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  I don't even know how the test works or whether it's any good.
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  Is that what you're asking me to do?
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  To lose my job?
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  To lose my livelihood?
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  To go bankrupt?
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  To sacrifice myself on the altar of insane psychopaths?
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  Is that what you want from me?
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  I don't think so.
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  I just have a sneaky feeling it's probably not the right thing to do.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  Do you know what I mean, listeners, viewers?
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  Get where I'm going with this.
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  It's probably not the right thing to do to say, well, gee, if you want me to sacrifice myself for all of that, I guess maybe I will.
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  Okay, sure, whatever.
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:48.000]  I'll become a robot, a pod person, if that's what you want.
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  You know those ads, I won't name the company, that show somebody like jumping into a pit of fire because supposedly the rain is going to come through a ceremony by which they keep sacrificing people.
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  And the rain doesn't show up and the idiots keep sacrificing people.
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  That's what I mean when I say fake.
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  That's what I mean when I say fake.
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  It was fake from the beginning.
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  It was fake in Wuhan, it was fake in Italy, it was fake in other Chinese cities.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  The whole thing was based on a fake.
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  And I'll go into it as we wind down on this segment as to how the whole thing was faked from the beginning.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  And why that was, if you were a criminal sociopath, the best way to do this by fake, there it is, rather than by an actual virus.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  Fake is my cheese.
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  Fake is my cheese.
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  Fake is my cheese.
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential. That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:24.000]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because again, you are non-essential.
[3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:31.000]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:35.000]  We can be told to stay on our houses, and after all, shut up.
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:37.000]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[3:30:37.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:47.000]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:26.000]  This is insane.
[3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:30.000]  You need to get prepared now.
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:34.000]  You need to get high-quality, durable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:34.000 --> 3:31:38.000]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:45.000]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:47.000]  This is beyond 1984.
[3:31:47.000 --> 3:31:49.000]  The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:51.000]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:05.000]  But you get that.
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:06.000]  You are patriots.
[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  You are people that live and work in the real world, who erase color and create and understand what's happening.
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke.
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:17.000]  Thank you for what you've done.
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:18.000]  We're all of this together.
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  We believe in families.
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:22.000]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[3:32:22.000 --> 3:32:26.000]  We believe in capitalism, America, and Jesus Christ, number one.
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:28.000]  And we believe in free speech.
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:35.000]  And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world.
[3:32:35.000 --> 3:32:42.000]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:43.000]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  They thought they would have won.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:48.000]  But they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  God bless you all.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:24.000]  Before I get into more of the fakery, let's just get another thing straight here just between us.
[3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  Why do we need to obey people who say we must obey?
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  Isn't that always a question?
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  In other words, when you look at people like Bill Gates and Fauci and so forth, you say,
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  well, who appointed them God such that if they say we have to stay home, we can't do business, we can't open up businesses,
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  we can't walk out on the street and live our lives, then we have to go along with that.
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  We just simply do.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  No, we don't.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  No, we don't.
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  Why?
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  Well, because if we tell you to commit economic suicide, you just have to do it in the service of a greater cause.
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  No, we don't.
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  No, absolutely not.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  So there's the level of protests and we see more and more protests across the country.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  Yes.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  But there's also the level of people opening up their lives again.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  Individually, companies reopening, people saying, I got to do business or I'm going to die.
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  There's a certain level of economic activity called making a living.
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  Have you bastards ever heard of that before?
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  You, whose paychecks are secure, who are living out in the suburbs of Washington, DC, have security, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  Yes, I can work at home.
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  It's a bit of a sacrifice, but you know, we'll all get through this together.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  Really, really.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  These are the people that we're going to go down in history as having obeyed?
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  No.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  So there's the level of protest, but then there's also the level of just opening up life.
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  Got to go get stuff.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  Got to do business.
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:41.000]  People are going to do it.
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  They are doing it.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  They should do it.
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  Oh, but what about the fear of the virus, the fear of the virus, the fear of the virus?
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  No, it's the fear of having an opinion that runs contrary to what you're supposed to believe.
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  It's the state religion that's preaching to you.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  They're saying, we are the ones who have the answers and you have to pray to us and get down on your friggin knees and in abject worship of what we say.
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:17.000]  No, you don't.
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  No, you don't.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  No, we don't.
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  No, we're not all in this together.
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  The robots are, but we're not the robots.
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  Do business, open up life, bring back life.
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  Don't listen to what self-appointed authorities tell you you have to believe.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  That used to be a cornerstone of education.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  That supposedly used to be a cornerstone of the press.
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  Now the press are the pod people that just go along.
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  Okay.
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  So I've been, I guess you could say questioned.
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  Because, oh, maybe as a reporter, I've gone too far because I said, well, convince me that they ever discovered a new virus in the first place in Wuhan.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  No, that's not going too far.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  That's not even going far enough.
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  But let's go there.
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  Well, how did they discover a new virus?
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  I don't know.
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  So in other words, because you don't know, it must be true that they did.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  Is that an equation you're happy with?
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  I don't know.
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  Therefore, they must have discovered a new virus.
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  I don't think so.
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  I don't think so.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  Now, I've gone into this in great detail in articles, so I'm not going to try to lay out the entire nine yards here.
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  I'm simply going to say that the discovery of a virus by traditional, the most reasonable methods would have involved.
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  And you see my article up there too vital experiments that have never been done.
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  The use of electron microscopes in a real study.
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  Not, oh, we got this picture here.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  Oh, we got that.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  No.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  500 patients, 1000 patients, 2000 patients.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  With proper procedure ending up with say 1000 side by side photographs taken under electron microscope.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  And the question, do we see many, many particles of a virus that we've never seen before in all of these photographs from the 1000 patients that are supposed to have this new disease?
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  Do all the particles look the same from picture to picture to picture to picture?
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  And are they all really viral particles that we've never seen before such that we can say there's a new virus?
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  You show me they've done that?
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  I'll drink the Kool-Aid.
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  They haven't.
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  They never will.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  They don't want to.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  They're afraid because the result is not going to show what they claim to show.
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  That is my computer prediction.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  And in the absence of that, all the fumbling and bumbling and stumbling in the lab when molecular this and that and the nucleotides and the sequences and this and that and the other thing are just so much technical nonsense.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  And if you can't prove that you ever discovered a new virus, then what are we talking about?
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  How are you going to test for a virus that you never really discovered?
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  That spits out false positives like there's no tomorrow.
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  The PCR test that registers positive meaning you're infected because of irrelevant germs, many different possible germs that have nothing to do with the purported COVID germ.
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  That get in and register falsely positive.
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  And then they say, oh, I'm sorry, but you have the virus.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  And you must believe us because we did the test.
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  Fakery, fakery, fakery, fakery all the way along the line from the discovery of the virus to fake tests to the fake case numbers based on the tests.
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  Come on.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  Come on.
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  It stands to reason that they would use a few actors in hospital setting with hazmat suits just to pump up the fakery given the enormous size of the actual fakery scientific from the beginning.
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  And when you think about it, faking the whole thing is their best option because they can control the story about a virus, which is what they're selling.
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  They're not selling a virus.
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  They're selling a story about a virus and that's what people have been buying.
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  Why buy it?
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  I mean, it occurs to me and I'm sure it occurs to you that there was once something called freedom in this country and liberty and that people actually fought and died for it.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  Not just in this country, but in Europe for many, many centuries.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  Why?
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  Because they knew that freedom was an inherent thing.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  Liberty was an inherent thing.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  They knew it.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  They felt it.
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  They wanted it.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  And so they fought for it in every way that they could.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  I mean, doesn't that sound reasonable?
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  Doesn't it sound reasonable?
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  Doesn't it sound reasonable that when they're talking about the necessity of a lockdown in such casual terms as through the summer into the fall until we have a vaccine that they're completely out of their frigging minds?
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  A bunch of criminal sociopaths whom we should reject in the name of freedom and liberty and instead live our lives.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  Doesn't that seem eminently reasonable given our need and desire for freedom?
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism and people that think for themselves build free societies, innovate to amazing things, but those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  They create stagnation, corruption, tyranny and then finally collapse and the world is now being tested.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit down a bigger way somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:44:13.000]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  And then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients from other nature that are known to supercharge it all. This is our best selling overall formula.
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  And I told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to fund our operations.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:47.000]  But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family.
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  DNA Force Plus now 50% off.
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:35.000]  And that's part of one testimonial.
[3:45:35.000 --> 3:46:02.000]  Well, communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half and the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  So guess what happened along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:27.000]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women own their bodies.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home.
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  Mark the beast.
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:45.000]  Oh, and guess what?
[3:46:45.000 --> 3:46:51.000]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:55.000]  They hate you and your family.
[3:46:55.000 --> 3:46:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  How much it means to you.
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:34.000]  Think about the lives of other people who value freedom.
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  Who would want to walk out on the street, live their lives, make a living.
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  And then you think about the shutdown, the lockdown as a preparation for a universal vaccine brought to you by Bill Gates.
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  As your passport out of jail, your passport out of jail.
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:12.000]  And this is the man who runs the world.
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:14.000]  I don't think so.
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  He may think he's going to run the world.
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  It's not going to happen.
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:30.000]  Do you seriously think that if the lockdown were extended for, let's say the next eight months, that people would sit still and just go for it?
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:34.000]  That they would just stay home and die in huge numbers?
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  I don't think so.
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  I think it's already that we're seeing the tide turning as more of us go out and live the way free people would live.
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:56.000]  Because the story about the virus does not sell.
[3:48:56.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  It's a story meant to keep people locked down.
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  And of course you can see how well it works because people are easily hypnotized.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:08.000]  And some people want to be hypnotized, it turns out.
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  A lot of people want to be hypnotized.
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  They want to serve the dictator.
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  They want to submit to the dictator.
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:24.000]  They want to lie down and kiss the dictator's feet and swear allegiance to the dictator.
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  They want to help the dictator enforce the dictator's edicts and laws.
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  They want to do whatever they can.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  And they think at the same time they're doing that, they're doing good.
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  Some dude named Plato pointed that out a long time ago that people always think they're doing good.
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:56.000]  Sure, I'm destroying lives on behalf of the dictator and that's a good thing.
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  Isn't it?
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  Yeah, you run into those people.
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  You get closer to six feet, they give you that hostile look.
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  They're going to line right up for the shot.
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  Can I get in front so I can get this vaccine delivered into me with synthetic genes so it alters my genetic makeup forever?
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  I want to be the first in line to be completely changed.
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  Completely changed.
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  That's what people are hoping for.
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  So desperate that they want to be changed.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:44.000]  So if you tell them, hey, they're going to inject you with genes.
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  It's going to alter your genetic makeup in ways that they can't even predict.
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:50.000]  And who knows how it's all going to turn out.
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  They say, man, give it to me. I need it because I can't stand my life the way it is now and I'll do anything to get out of it.
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:02.000]  That's another motive.
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:06.000]  And then there's just love your master.
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  But people who want freedom and liberty and who know what it is to get pissed off for the right reasons don't want that.
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  They want to live their lives.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  Without any hindrance, without any dictatorial restraint.
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  Just like it said in the foundational documents.
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:42.000]  Just like that.
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:46.000]  So what we've been watching over the last.
[3:51:46.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  You could say 100 years, but let's say the last 40 real is the rise of the medical dictatorship because that's the avenue along which the globalists and technocrats realize that they can sell the right story.
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:04.000]  That's what they're doing.
[3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:10.000]  They can't exactly sell the story of left versus right or anything political.
[3:52:10.000 --> 3:52:22.000]  They sell the guy in the green scrubs wearing the mask with the scalpel and the needle and the charts on the wall and the PCR tests and the virus.
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  They know how to sell that crap.
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:30.000]  They're experts at and believe me when I tell you.
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  That I've looked into their doings the last 35 years.
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  And I'm talking about the ones who do the basic research, the liars, the scumbags, psychopaths, the ones who sell their souls completely for the sake of physician prestige power.
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:58.000]  Some cases not even money.
[3:52:58.000 --> 3:53:02.000]  And that's all they're doing is selling a story.
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  That's all they're doing and they're looking for buyers all the time.
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  They've been looking for buyers all the time.
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:18.000]  They've hypnotized themselves into becoming true believers in their own cause.
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:24.000]  And so they've become the evil ones.
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  The evil.
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:42.000]  There was on a show not too long ago where the host said, you know, it occurs to me that if the media had never covered this whole thing, starting in Wuhan, that there would be nothing except a flu season.
[3:53:42.000 --> 3:53:46.000]  Another flu season, whatever that is.
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:50.000]  And we would just go on with our lives, which is absolutely the truth.
[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:52.000]  That's what it would have been.
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:54:00.000]  This whole thing is synthetic artificial fabricated.
[3:54:00.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  The building of prison bars to keep people inside.
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:10.000]  That's what it is.
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda, once said, it's possible to influence a million people, but impossible to change the mind of one man.
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  What does that mean?
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:36.000]  That means that the individual and his own consciousness can resist any kind of brainwashing or thought control.
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:42.000]  Whereas people who want to be lumped in together in a group are easily hypnotizable.
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  As long as they have that group think and group consciousness, which recent generations have grown up with, thinking that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:55:12.000]  The group, the group, the group, the group, give me more of the group, the group, not realizing that the globalists want to have society composed of groups, not individuals, because groups can be easily influenced and hypnotized.
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  Let's talk about care, concern, love.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:20.000]  We'll all get through this together, rainbows and all that.
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  I'm having a very tough time, I need to tell you, in the last couple of minutes here, restraining myself from using language that, I don't know, probably get us kicked off the air.
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:40.000]  I'm not sure, but live free.
[3:55:40.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  Live free.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:44.000]  That's the whole idea.
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  They can't tell you what to do.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  Unless you buy their story.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:54.000]  They don't have the science.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:56.000]  They never did.
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  This isn't about good science.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:10.000]  It's about fake science, and it was since the beginning.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  The case numbers, I'm afraid, are meaningless, folks.
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:28.000]  I mean, when I say meaningless, I mean meaningless, because they're based on tests that are useless and worthless, and spit out false positives like there's no tomorrow.
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  Or they're based on no tests at all, just lying.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  Let's put COVID on the form, because the hospital, as you saw in a previous episode here, needs more money.
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  And if we put COVID down, we get more insurance money.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:52.000]  So throughout, right, lying, fakery, et cetera, et cetera, the case numbers are all developed, broadcast.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  People spend their time pouring over these case numbers and claiming this, that they're all meaningless.
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  I mean, it's just like garbage.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:10.000]  You just open your garbage can and say, oh, that's where the numbers are, and shut the lid and forget about it.
[3:57:10.000 --> 3:57:14.000]  Right?
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:24.000]  The society has been trained to obey and think that obedience is love.
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  It's not.
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  It never was.
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  Never willed.
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  It might be masochism, but it ain't love.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  All right.
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:38.000]  That's me for today, sitting in for Alex.
[3:57:38.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  I thank you.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:58:00.000]  We'll see you next time.
