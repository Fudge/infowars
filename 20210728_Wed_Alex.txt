[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  The two big subjects of discussion for today are obviously going to be
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  the mixed messages coming from our health officials and, of course, the media lying about it,
[00:57.000 --> 01:06.000]  where the CDC director is admitting that vaccinated people are responsible for
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  this new outbreak, this new spread that's admitted by the CDC.
[01:12.000 --> 01:19.000]  I'm actually shocked and stunned that the CDC director is admitting it.
[01:19.000 --> 01:27.000]  But, of course, on the back end saying, yeah, the vaccinated people are causing the spread,
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  and it's the highly vaccinated communities where it's the biggest outbreak and the vaccines aren't working,
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  but we're still going to mandate the vaccines, and now you need to wear a mask for the next two weeks.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  Oh, there's that nice two weeks again to stop the spread.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  Where have we heard that before?
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  And so we're going to be joined by Alex Jones coming up in the next segment, breaking all of that down.
[01:55.000 --> 02:05.000]  Then, in the aftermath of yesterday's January 6th show hearings with a bunch of Democrat activists posing as police officers,
[02:05.000 --> 02:15.000]  yes, that's right, Democrat activists posing as police officers, as neutral observers, as neutral reporters.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  No, we now have the receipts.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  In fact, I've got a whole stack of them right here.
[02:23.000 --> 02:36.000]  Now, specifically one officer, but all of them, but one officer will be highlighted, and he was the one that they made the biggest deal of, made claims that he was called the inward during the events of January 6th.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  Doesn't produce any body cam footage, of course, because he's making it up, just a small let's dial.
[02:43.000 --> 02:55.000]  And now it turns out we've got all of his tweets going back four years, an avid leftist, an avid Democrat, an avid Trumpator, and he's the voice of reason.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  He's the neutral voice of reason on January 6th. I don't think so.
[03:01.000 --> 03:18.000]  And then, of course, it turns out that his lawyer, Mark Zeid, you may have heard of him, big Democrat activist, big time Democrat activist, and he's the lawyer representing Officer Dunn.
[03:18.000 --> 03:33.000]  So, again, the entire hearing yesterday was nothing more than propaganda, nothing more than lies.
[03:33.000 --> 03:45.000]  And the American media and the Democrat Party think you're too stupid or you're too lazy to go out and do a tiny bit of research on these individuals, and that's all it took.
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  A couple journalists just did a tiny bit of research and they found dozens of tweets.
[03:51.000 --> 04:04.000]  Oh, and not only are they avowed Democrat activists that have been implanted into the DC police as I was warned about three years ago by the DC police.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  When I was sitting in a jail cell, I was told, they said, oh, and you're not going to believe what's going on here.
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  But Democrats have implanted activists into our units, and there's nothing we can do about it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:28.000]  And they all know it. And you just saw them on Capitol Hill yesterday. Now they've been unmasked, pun not intended.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  So we'll talk about that.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  But coming up in the next segment is Alex Jones.
[04:36.000 --> 04:45.000]  And they admit the vaccine doesn't work. They now admit the vaccine doesn't work, but they're promoting a third booster.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  So the vaccine doesn't work, the mask doesn't work, but they're going to force you to wear a mask and force you to take a vaccine.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  It's all slavery. That's what it is.
[04:58.000 --> 05:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfowarsStore.com.
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this.
[05:21.000 --> 05:31.000]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  And we've packed it all in to FiberGreenCaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[05:53.000 --> 06:18.000]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  And that it does nothing to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  That's why they never ask why they don't have a vaccine for the common cold.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Because it's too varied. Because there's thousands of them.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  And because you have to get it exactly right and viruses are always mutating.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  They want you willingly to go take whatever it is that's going to be in there.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  Now Fauci has come out.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  If you just joined us, we're going to play the clip again first here in a moment and said,
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  hey, we're going to surveil people. We're going to cycle into other seasons.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  Next year you won't be able to go out either.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  So they'll run into the middle of summer and then let you have a month or two and then clamp it back down.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  But there'll be special apps they're announcing. You'll be tracked. China was the model.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  They're going to roll it out like they just got these ideas, but it's all pre-planned.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  By the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Rowland and the Gates, the tabletop exercises,
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  predicting COVID-19 in November when it was already launched in China.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one.
[07:21.000 --> 07:31.000]  And if we fail this test, we're going to be ruled by the threat of unending invisible bio weapons.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  They're going to tighten down the restrictions, loosen them by the summer,
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  and then release new strains immediately that aren't even as bad as the current strain.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  They'll say they're worse, fearmonger, and then clamp down even stronger.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  That's what they've done in Italy. It's what they've done in other areas where they've been beta testing like Spain
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  and now moving towards Australia. So this is all formulaic. It's all heavily scripted, and we know they're playing.
[07:57.000 --> 08:09.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  You don't need a mask. A mask is about compliance because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  So if they tell you you have to wear a mask, next they're going to tell you you have to contact trace.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  Then they're going to tell you you have to take the vaccine.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  And then guess what, kids? Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  they're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was going to be.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  So now you still got to wear your mask, still got to get contact trace, still have all the restrictions and social distancing,
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  and still take your vaccine. And then what did you get out of all of this?
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel, your business was closed, they took your rights of freedoms,
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  they forced the vaccine on you, and what happened? The same amount of people died.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  Everything is the exact same. And now they're going to put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till July of next year
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  so they can do the same thing again. Bring you from July, August and September, getting you off lockdown,
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  but just to bring you back on lockdown again.
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  If you idiots haven't figured it out yet, it's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take your wealth. Why?
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  So you become dependent on government. Why? If you're independent, the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every month, because they closed your business on you,
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  now the government doesn't work for you, the government rules you.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  So instead of a middle class, we have the government, upper class, and the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  In other words, we have a slave class. And that's what they're trying to do.
[09:46.000 --> 09:59.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, now you understand why info wars had to be banned off of the internet well in advance of this operation going down.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  Now you know why they had to demonize info wars and lie about Alex Jones and lie about what we do here.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  Because if we had the ear of the nation, if we had the ear of the world, then none of this would be going on.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  They would have said, no, we were warned about this. We're not going to comply. We're not going to fall for the propaganda.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  We're going to remain free. You're not going to deceive us.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  But they lied about us. They demonized us and they censured us off the internet.
[10:27.000 --> 10:39.000]  Now they are running phase two, phase three, phase whatever of their global tyranny imprisonment of man for the rest of time.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  This is the Alex Jones show live on this Wednesday, July 28, 2021.
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  Owen Schreuer in the info wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones on the phone with us now.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  And so it doesn't matter that the CDC says the vaccine doesn't work.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  They're even pushing for a third booster. It doesn't matter that they admit the mass doesn't work.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  They want you to wear it forever. And they've even brought back the old moniker Alex of two weeks to slow the spread.
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  Boy, they really think we're stupid, don't they?
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.000]  Well, they do. Oh, and again, I wasn't intending to be on the day, but this huge CDC announcement you said was imminent yesterday did happen right after you got off the air.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  So I'm actually on the road here. Am I coming in clear for you?
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  Loud and clear.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  Okay, I need listeners to listen to me very carefully. We can beat this, but we don't have much time and we do have the year of the nation.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  We have the year of the world of the people that count the hardcore folks from every continent and every region of every race, color, creed who bleed red blood.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  I love you all. This is an attack on humans. This is a post industrial world.
[11:42.000 --> 11:53.000]  This is a system designed to confuse people, designed to destroy confidence, designed to discredit American institutions when it's a globalist that are actually doing this.
[11:53.000 --> 12:03.000]  All of this, whether it's destroying the police or whether it's destroying the family, all of this doesn't mean families are perfect or police are perfect, but they were our institutions.
[12:03.000 --> 12:17.000]  Those are being destroyed and discredited now to bring in their new world order and the people bringing in cover story, New Yorker magazine, do not forget, 30 plus thousand children as young as two given to hardcore rapists to be gang raped.
[12:17.000 --> 12:32.000]  Now, I told you this years ago, but the point is, is that that's who runs things. People that have a mindset like that, people like Ed Buck who had a giant red skull on the wall and would vampirically torture black men.
[12:32.000 --> 12:42.000]  He said, I'm sucking your energy. And he would want them to OD and start dying. And then he would give them the drug to not OD to bring them back. And he said he was feeding on their energy.
[12:42.000 --> 12:52.000]  Okay, that's low level stuff, ladies and gentlemen. And now the videos are being shown in LA in court of hymns over them saying, I'm sucking your energy, give me your soul.
[12:52.000 --> 13:02.000]  That's a low level Renfield operator. Okay, need to understand because they they've got a thing for sucking the energy of black men to have spent the whole show on this. It's just, it's just insane.
[13:02.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's in all the criminology, but there's different types of vampires. They don't have things, but they do drink blood. They don't live forever, but the spirits in them are very, very old.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  That's why, you know, the old thing is, oh, they're immortal. And that's why in Transylvania or all over Europe, they said, don't get into the castle at night to their kids.
[13:17.000 --> 13:25.000]  The vampire will grab you and eat you because it was true. The Lord or his son or whoever would grab you and rape you and murder you.
[13:25.000 --> 13:37.000]  So that's where all these legends come from is psychotic ruling elites that are in bread. And that's why in ancient Japan, they had stories of don't go by the castle at night because some of the nobles were evil.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  They would grab you and drink your blood. Every culture said, don't go near the castle at night. Men in black will jump out with fangs and drink your blood.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  So again, that's not because they're real vampires, but because they are the Satanic, demon-possessed people.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  The ancient Greeks would lock up certain areas at night because there were psychotics that would go in there and grab people and drink their blood.
[13:56.000 --> 14:07.000]  Look that up, folks. That's mainstream history. So we're giving you tomorrow's news today. If none of this makes sense to you, it's because you don't want to tie down two-year-olds and suck their blood.
[14:07.000 --> 14:16.000]  You don't want to OD black men and then bring them back over and over again with adrenaline injections because you want to suck their souls.
[14:16.000 --> 14:27.000]  You're not a person, even things like that, to have a giant red skull and a black magic temple where the head of the House Intelligence Committee reportedly liked to party with that buck.
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  You're not one of these people. So I was going to try to be calm. I was going to try to just come on and talk about why this is such a big deal.
[14:34.000 --> 14:47.000]  But there was a clip of myself in February, March and April and May of last year telling it was coming. Then there was a clip of Skye in May after me laying out the exact same thing.
[14:47.000 --> 14:56.000]  How do we know it was coming? Because we understand what we're dealing with. We understand the enemy's operations and they've scripted it all out in white papers.
[14:56.000 --> 15:09.000]  What's incredible is, is we always said they're going to announce in the end that the vaccinated or shutters, I mean, those that have been injected are basically diseased now.
[15:09.000 --> 15:17.000]  How do we know that? It's an operation crimson contagion from three years before the event.
[15:17.000 --> 15:29.000]  And then crimson contagion is set in real time contemporary now that it comes out within a year of the injections that they were poisoned and maimed people and that it's going to shed all these new viruses, which I don't even think is true.
[15:29.000 --> 15:39.000]  I think they're going to release new versions that they've had cooked up ready in those labs. But then that's why they had COVID-19 as basically an attenuated virus that I actually predicted three years ago.
[15:39.000 --> 15:50.000]  If they were going to release an attenuated first since you're used to it, then they would release new bio weapons in the similar family but claim that they were naturally occurring. That way you won't get a nuclear war starter between countries blaming each other.
[15:50.000 --> 16:00.000]  So we're going to come back and I'm going to finish up and let Owen take over. He's got a lot to say, but I'm going to tie it all together with the January 6th information and so much more.
[16:00.000 --> 16:11.000]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[16:16.000 --> 16:27.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know.

[16:46.000 --> 16:57.000]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction and tell others to share those texts. Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[17:16.000 --> 17:25.000]  And now they've announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out into 2024. And then in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[17:25.000 --> 17:34.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  They're now implementing it. And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[17:39.000 --> 17:49.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany.
[17:49.000 --> 17:58.000]  And full wars will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[17:58.000 --> 18:12.000]  I'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service. I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the United States and sources of materials all over North America and from Africa as well,
[18:12.000 --> 18:19.000]  which he's proud of. That's where you get the good cotton and then they put it together here in the United States. And that is Mike Lindell.
[18:19.000 --> 18:28.000]  Mike Lindell is a patriot. Mike Lindell is fighting. He is bold and he's got his products in stock ready to ship to you.
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  When you use promo code Alex, you get the best specials they've got up to 66% off with promo code Alex.
[18:36.000 --> 18:47.000]  Whether it's their entire line of sheets or human beds that are revolutionary and very, very popular or animal beds for dogs and cats or the great towels or the pillows that they're best known for.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  And he's done great. His people are great. They've really come through and taken us out of the red into the black.
[18:52.000 --> 19:19.000]  Thank you all for shopping at my pillow dot com up to 66% off with promo code Alex.
[19:19.000 --> 19:36.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday.
[19:36.000 --> 19:51.000]  And I'm Alex Jones. Hi Jackie Mon show because the news is just so insane. I gotta say I was doing an excellent job boiling all this down. I just want to point out that January 6 is is all about taking that threat assessment national memorandum of the president the
[19:51.000 --> 20:07.000]  two months ago Joe Biden have been hammering on and declaring that anyone that questions lockdowns fraudulent elections open borders or legitimacy of anything Biden does as a terrorist and directs the Pentagon with CIA to spy on and attack the American people.
[20:07.000 --> 20:16.000]  They've been on TV talk about taking out members of Congress, frankly using another so they are really trying to get their forces ready.
[20:16.000 --> 20:27.000]  For a permanent coup because they've already stolen the election. Now they have to submit their ill gotten gain. So that's the historic point we've gotten to. And so all the theater we saw yesterday by the political operatives.
[20:27.000 --> 20:37.000]  All of that again is a bit to brand the American people in the opposition and the unvaccinated as terrorists, but they thought they'd get 60 70% 80% to take it.
[20:37.000 --> 20:51.000]  It's way less than 50 from the numbers. God, they've been exaggerating. And so they've got a big problem on their hands. So they're going to double back on the group that they've already got under their control and say, Oh, you've got Stockholm syndrome.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  You're like an abused prostitute under a pimps control that breaks your arm.
[20:55.000 --> 21:09.000]  We're going to come back at you now and say, guess what? You got to wear a mask too. And you got to take more shots. Well, okay, so that over a year ago, this is all been lifted. This is all been planned out. And I just want to reach out to the Democrats.
[21:09.000 --> 21:19.000]  Democrat on the ground. You're not going to get money and power and control out of this. I know you've been trained to hate Christians and hate Republicans and feel like you're part of the intellectual elite and everything because you buy and all this.
[21:19.000 --> 21:30.000]  All you are too much. All you are is idiots. The globalists use you. They're destroying you. This is a post human post industrial world. You're not going to get any power out of this.
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  The average Democrats got two or three degrees and they work back in groceries. But everybody I know that doesn't have degrees.
[21:37.000 --> 21:49.000]  I don't put folks down and have degrees and saying, you know, are making $200,000 a year, $100,000 a year. So I just really feel sorry for these folks because they're in a cult. They're lied to every step of the way.
[21:49.000 --> 22:01.000]  They're told, oh, your vaccine isn't working because other people didn't take the shot. But now they have to admit, no, you're the ones that are actually shedding all these new variants and viruses.
[22:01.000 --> 22:09.000]  But all of that is a backdrop to shut down our economy to make us a bunch of ninnies who are hysterical when the death rates in the United States and worldwide are the same.
[22:09.000 --> 22:21.000]  They were five years ago from the flu, from pneumonia. They just stopped reporting that and put it into the COVID-19 column. But the real issue here is we don't care about the third world want to starve hundreds of millions of them to death.
[22:21.000 --> 22:31.000]  That's on our conscience. It's wrong to organize the survivors and use this. That's part of the official UN replacement migration plan.
[22:31.000 --> 22:41.000]  So again, we can continue to tell you exactly what's going to happen years before it happens or we can do something and organize and get serious and move against these globalists.
[22:41.000 --> 22:49.000]  So more and more, Owen, I just asked the question, how do we form the opposition to this when Fauci ran the lab? They obviously released it on purpose.
[22:49.000 --> 22:57.000]  They blocked all the good treatments for regular flues and colds, killing millions. They've starved tens of millions of deaths the UN admits when the UN is the one that ran the whole thing.
[22:57.000 --> 23:05.000]  They are mass murdering criminals. We are in their clutches and they're only going to keep pushing this assault until they get pushed back against.
[23:05.000 --> 23:17.000]  So the question is, how do we begin to aggressively, legally, and lawfully push back against them when they were because the Rubicon are violently assaulting us with these poison GMO Franken shots?
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  I mean, what do we do, Owen?
[23:20.000 --> 23:29.000]  Well, historically, Alex, I do believe there's two answers to this question. And the one obvious answer is what we're trying to avoid at all costs.
[23:29.000 --> 23:37.000]  And that's a violent confrontation with these people. Again, that's just historically what you have to do in the face of tyranny and the face of oppression.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  But we'd like to avoid that. We don't want a violent confrontation. We know what that would look like.
[23:42.000 --> 23:51.000]  And that's not even necessarily an assured victory. I mean, we've got Putin announcing today they're launching two new doomsday planes in case of a nuclear war,
[23:51.000 --> 24:01.000]  because Putin understands that if the American globalist corrupt regime actually gets questioned and loses their seat dominating the world like they have been,
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  then they'll just launch a nuclear war. That's why they were able to get Trump out of the White House because they threatened them and they said,
[24:06.000 --> 24:13.000]  look, if you don't leave and you actually lead this American populist resistance against us, we're just going to blow the planet up.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  And Trump didn't want that to happen on his watch. You can say that's a mistake. You can say it's a good thing. That's how they got him out of the White House.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  He knew he won.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  And Owen, and Owen, I'm really glad you bring that point. That's the point I've been to make that ever make.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  The globalists saw populist rebellions in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, and in North America.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  So they panicked and they'd always had on the shelf for population control to release a virus to have a global clamp down.
[24:36.000 --> 24:43.000]  That's Operation Lockstep. So this is just their first measure. If we keep fighting them, they're going to release even more deadly weapons or start a nuclear war.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  And that's what they always go to presidents with, not just Trump, but they went to others with it and said, if you don't do what we want,
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  we're going to start a giant war. So exactly. Why don't we just arrest the CFR and Richard and Haas and all these people?
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  Why do we keep letting people like Charlie Munger say he wants to set up a malice regime in America?
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  Why is Justin Trudeau not in jail saying he wants to turn Canada into China?
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  I mean, these are declarations of war against humanity, people.
[25:08.000 --> 25:16.000]  Well, here's the good news, Alex. Five years ago, most people would have never heard of any of these individuals.
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  And so we're speeding the timetables up. Now everybody knows who Anthony Fauci is and wants him arrested.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  Now everybody knows the diabolical thoughts and actions of Bill Gates and want him arrested.
[25:26.000 --> 25:33.000]  So the worm is turning there. But as you said, they have all of these things in their back pocket to bring their slaves to heal.
[25:33.000 --> 25:39.000]  But Alex, here's the other option in the question you asked, the two options historically.
[25:39.000 --> 25:49.000]  And that is peacefully and politically use democracies and vote these people out of power, vote people into power who want to do something about this.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  But there's the hiccup. They steal our elections. Who knows the last time we had an actual election in this country?
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.000]  Who knows the last time Americans actually decided their fate politically with the vote at the ballot box?
[26:01.000 --> 26:07.000]  And that's why you see the Democrats so up in arms and panicked right now about these vote audits coming out,
[26:07.000 --> 26:15.000]  about the push to end the Dominion voting machine rigging of our elections, because they know that's their ultimate power over us,
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  is the belief that, hey, we can still go vote. We can still peacefully and politically overturn this stuff.
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  We just have to make our voices heard, get to the polls and beat them in a democracy. They rig all the elections.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  So they've already beaten us there because we don't even have free and fair elections. And that's right over here.
[26:33.000 --> 26:41.000]  That's right. But as you said, the good news is Trump really won in the count of votes by 70% real internal numbers are coming out.
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  The world is rejecting the globalists. They're rejecting the neoliberals.
[26:45.000 --> 26:53.000]  They're rejecting George Soros, who now with Bill Gates is going to be over the UN global testing regime and control the contact tracer apps.
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  I mean, what a nightmare. George Soros with the Clinton Foundation and Bill Gates to control your medical files, they're not going to get away with this.
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  I'm just so ashamed of the average leftist subserviently wanting a vaccine pass and wanting to get all the shots and just buying into the fraud
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  and pretending like they're part of the establishment. It's these people.
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  It's a proletariat left going along with this pretending like they're part of the ruling class that is going to destroy us.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  We have to realize communism is a tool of the ruling class to suppress and wage war against the people.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  It is a tool of the ruling class. It was created by British intelligence to get rid of their Tsar cousins. It is the enemy.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  Russia had it for 80 years controlling them and finally kicked it out partially. That's why they hate Russia.
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.000]  We need to arrest the oligarchs and put their asses in prison just like Russia has done and we need to move forward.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  If we don't do that, we have no future going.
[27:44.000 --> 27:53.000]  And I think when you see what happened in St. Louis County where they just had a vote of seven people on a board, just I, yeah, or nay, do we have a man-nated mask
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  and they fived the two said no. That's the real America.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[28:04.000 --> 28:21.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[28:21.000 --> 28:33.000]  Orson slaves are just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[28:33.000 --> 28:43.000]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[28:43.000 --> 28:52.000]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world. And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery go to evil.
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  It is a spiritual battle and end full wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  Good, bro.
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the import.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  Honor, talk to you.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  Awesome.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom. So, just number one for a few of you.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  I like that one. It works. It's not a joke.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  Absolutely.
[30:21.000 --> 30:29.000]  If you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  So, please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support us. God bless.
[30:56.000 --> 31:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  We're back here live.
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  Owen Troyer sitting in studio, Alex with us on the phone.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  He thinks he's about to say goodbye, but I don't think he's going to be able to because I'm about to bring up a couple stories here.
[31:28.000 --> 31:35.000]  But I'm not sure you've seen yet, Alex, that are really indicative of the times that we're living in.
[31:35.000 --> 31:39.000]  First, you have this story out of the Rolling Stone.
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.000]  I specialize in toilet play and I can't do it with people who are unvaccinated.
[31:44.000 --> 31:49.000]  So bragging about how they like to have sex around the area where they defecate.
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  They don't know, but they need you to be vaccinated to do it.
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  But here's the kicker. It's all about these dominatrixes, as they call them, who dominate their sexual partners,
[31:58.000 --> 32:03.000]  saying they have to be vaccinated and it's part of their dominatrix strategy to dominate them with the vaccine.
[32:03.000 --> 32:10.000]  Alex, this is the entire globalist paradigm boiled down into one perverted story.
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  They are the dominatrix of culture. They're the dominatrix of society.
[32:15.000 --> 32:22.000]  They're the dominatrix of civilization wanting to dominate us with their vaccines in some sort of weird sexual torture,
[32:22.000 --> 32:28.000]  masochism ritual, and they don't even realize that the story in the Rolling Stone
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  meet the dominatrixes who are demanding their submissives get vaccinated.
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  That's us. We're the submissives of the New World Order.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.000]  Then you have a New York Times story. What's the best way to protect sex workers?
[32:41.000 --> 32:48.000]  And then it promotes and says it's a good thing for 13-year-olds to be prostitutes.
[32:48.000 --> 32:57.000]  All in the news today, Alex.
[32:57.000 --> 33:02.000]  Absolutely, Owen. Do you guys have me on air now?
[33:02.000 --> 33:03.000]  Yes, you are live.
[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  Okay, great. Absolutely, Owen.
[33:06.000 --> 33:11.000]  They call it their New World Order, and now when people come to the preschool and say,
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.000]  why are you teaching my three-year-old about how to give oral sex,
[33:16.000 --> 33:18.000]  they say, we're in a new world now.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  And so all these organizations and groups are just behaving in criminal action
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.000]  to overwhelm us and break our will right now and just bring this in.
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.000]  And absolutely, toilet play means they like to play with poop.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  So this is a religion. The media and the government are the high priests,
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  and all the left that are in the religion, and they take the sacrament that humans are dirty, humans are bad,
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  and it's all a sick cult. These people have been turned over to a dark spiritual energy.
[33:47.000 --> 33:53.000]  I mean, if you randomly go to the Facebook or the Instagram pages of people posting that they got their shot,
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  we're not editing these to find freaks.
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.000]  It looks like a giant spaceship with a million clowns landed or something.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  I mean, it looks like something out of a Rob Zombie nightmare movie.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  You cannot copy this psychotic, crazy look that they've got. You can't fake it.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Why does Brian Stelter look like a Satanic demon?
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  Why is he so sanctimonious? Because that's the choker-like spirit of these people,
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  and they want to watch the world burn.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  They want to pull it down while we're in straight catches and can't resist them.
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  So, yes, this is a spiritual, planetary, demonic possession.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  Call it a radio channel. They tune us to whatever you want to call it.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  The globalists are trying to forcibly force our consciousness down into this satanic bandwidth
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  and fully control us because, to them, what Ed Buck did, Ed Buck's lawyer argued
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  that him doing black magic rituals, trying to suck the spirits of black men,
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  was just a fun thing he did. It's okay that a couple of them died.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  That's actually in the LA Times today during the trial.
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  They're defending it as a lifestyle.
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  I think we get desperate black men who didn't want drugs and say,
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  I'll give you $200 to inject meth, but then give them lethal doses of it
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  to then give them other drugs to reanimate them.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  And he said, I'm doing a ritual to suck their energy.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  That's who these people are. And yes, they're sucking our energy in mass.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  They know exactly what they're doing. This is all a gigantic satanic ritual.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  And look at this exact quote because this ties directly into Drag Queen Storytime
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  and everything Info Wars has been warning you about.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  This is, again, from the New York Times.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Candy first traded sex at age 13. Notice how they massage that.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Oh, traded sex. No, she was made a sex slave.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  But oh, she traded sex, as they say.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  And then this is where it all ties into the Drag Queen Storytime pedophile time.
[35:44.000 --> 35:52.000]  To survive, she decided to lie about her age taking refuge with a group of older transgender women
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  that's perverted pedophile men who became her mentors.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  They taught her how to support herself through sex.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  And so, I mean, there it is all right there, Alex.
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  They're coming out of the ground. They're crawling out of hell.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  I mean, this is the demonic satanic takeover that we've been afraid of.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  Well, in Revelation, it says that the public will become like zombies
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  and that the gates of hell will be open and that they'll be basically triple the demons on the earth
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  at the River Ward. I think we're seeing the beginnings of this.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  Folks, you've seen nothing yet.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  It's going to be people with torches coming to your house, banging on the door,
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  just like in Sodom and Gomorrah, demanding your children.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  I mean, that is who they are. That is what they're doing.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  And it's happening in other cultures. It's happening in other societies, and it's why the societies fall.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  You can say it's spiritual. You can say it's something ingrained and are subconscious.
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  If you're a sick psychologist, but at the end of the day, how crazy is it, Owen?
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  And thank God, the listeners keeping us on air and all the great affiliates, everybody, because we've been vindicated.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  How incredible is it that we're now living in the New World Order, still on air barely,
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  the same Democratic Party law firm that has sued Remington into bankruptcy.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  Remington offered him $33 million, even though they're bankrupt, because nobody really buys Remington anymore.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  The U.S. military doesn't buy any more.
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.000]  And they said, no, we want a billion dollars and 200 million for each family member,
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  because Adam Lanz's mother gave him a semi-automatic rifle. It's Remington's fault.
[37:25.000 --> 37:32.000]  That's the same group suing us in key jurisdictions with the express goal of taking us off the air.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  See, they're going after the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, because once they've got that,
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  once they've got that, we're chained down under their control, and they go to work on us.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  And what's the common thread there with what we're seeing today from the medical tyranny?
[37:45.000 --> 37:51.000]  Big pharmaceutical drug manufacturers where, I mean, they don't give you the numbers,
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  because they don't want to talk about this in the news, but I mean, as far as we know,
[37:55.000 --> 38:01.000]  whenever we have the research done, every major mass shooter was on some form of major,
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  big pharmaceutical, psychotropic drugs, including Adam Lanz.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  You can see that the pills he was taking just sucked the soul out of him.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  He's just a mindless zombie, because he's taking these pills all day,
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.000]  and it even says as the side effects, suicidal thoughts, dangerous tendencies, all this stuff.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  And the media never reports on that angle. Same old why?
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  Because the media is funded by big pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  I tend to make that. I mean, I don't want to give away everything, but, you know,
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  the Lord works in mysterious ways. That's all the information that's going to be coming out.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  And I mean, I have to leave it at that. And just a lot of other things are going on.
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  But yeah, it's the drug companies that are actually funding the anti-gun movement,
[38:38.000 --> 38:43.000]  because they don't want their drugs to be blamed. They want to blame the animal tool.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  But let me just say this one, and I'm going to let you get back to your report work.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  History is happening now, right in front of us.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  And everybody's got to be more active now than ever.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  The globalist thought that they would have already gotten further in their plan.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  It's not going well for them. As bad as things look, as bleak as things are,
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  it could be a lot worse. We weren't supposed to be on air. Others weren't supposed to be on air.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  At this point, we are on air. And people now know, wait, the vaccine doesn't work.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Wait, people take the vaccine, spread it worse than others.
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  Wait, I still got to wear a mask. Wait. And people know the politicians aren't following their own rules.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  They know it's all bull. And so this is really going to backfire on them.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep this broadcast on air.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  Folks, I've got a lot of plans, a lot of tricks up my sleeve. The enemy's got us under surveillance.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  But I don't want to give away some of this stuff on air, but believe me, believe me.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  Imagine you got a big ship in the fight and you're in a big war.
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  You got to have other ships ready in case one gets burned up and destroyed. And that's fine.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  But they're going to be very, very frustrated if they ever think they're going to take out this Death Star
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  that's blowing up their new order of operations.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  But as soon as they blow this one up, three more come flying back around the other side of the planet.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  And so I'm just telling you folks, pray for us.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  Support us. But we are working around the clock in ways you don't even notify these people.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  I am working 18 hours a day. So is Owen. So is our crew.
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.000]  So I want to thank you all for defending us because we're doing this together.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  We're in this together.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  I want to encourage everybody to go to infoworkstore.com and get the X2 before it sells out to 60% off.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  How to get the new concentrated fiber greens or the highest quality you can find anywhere for 1995.
[40:19.000 --> 40:26.000]  And please get the mypilla.com promo code Alex to get 66% off, up to 66% off on all their best-selling products.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  It's like 25% to 66%, but most of it's about 50% off.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  All the pillows, all the sheets, all the beds, human beds, dog beds, cat beds.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  Of course, all the pillows are the towels at mypilla.com and just use promo code Alex and check out.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  So I got to do and you get the massive discount, the very best discount out there.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  And that's how we're funding the operation.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  Again, get books, get films, get t-shirts.
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.000]  You can also order right now the privacy pocket for 50% off and get a whole bunch of prepositions.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[41:08.000 --> 41:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[41:18.000 --> 41:26.000]  Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com, you get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com, but only for one more week.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that's it.
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  They won't do this sale again until November and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  This is insurance you can eat.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supplies all ready for you at infowarstore.com.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  Or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Again, infowarstore.com.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  So take action now while you still can.
[41:56.000 --> 42:06.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that it's criminals are extremely pathological.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  Well, guess what?
[42:16.000 --> 42:28.000]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist, a globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[42:28.000 --> 42:37.000]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[42:37.000 --> 42:43.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement edition to infowarstore.com.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[43:18.000 --> 43:29.000]  Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[43:29.000 --> 43:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health. Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[43:47.000 --> 43:59.000]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95. That's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.000]  A privacy pocket at infowarstore.com. We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off $14.95.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[44:32.000 --> 44:39.000]  We've got a private label with info wars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them.
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  And I want you to buy friends and family of these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[44:53.000 --> 45:22.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[45:23.000 --> 45:32.000]  Alright, some final words from Alex Jones here before he says goodbye and then we have some special reports.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  Alex on the phone line, go ahead.
[45:35.000 --> 45:42.000]  Well, it's just this. I did shoot a very important special report where I coherently lay out the basic facts we already did here today.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  It's going to air in the second or third segment that you're taking over.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  But listen, listeners, don't take info wars for granted.
[45:48.000 --> 45:59.000]  And I'm telling myself that and the info wars is our listeners, the info wars is our callers, it's our affiliates, it's our reporters, it's our guests, it's our host.
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  This is such an important family and I'm telling you, we've changed history together.
[46:03.000 --> 46:09.000]  So if we've been able to do this together, think we can do it in the future as our credibility explodes.
[46:09.000 --> 46:18.000]  Okay. And if people begin to research themselves, don't just take this as stuff we claim, but go and find out for it for themselves.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  Evil has been building quietly and preparing for a long, long time.
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.000]  And now it's out in the open. It's launching its assault because we were taking the planet back from globalist.
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  And there was a Christian awakening happening outside of the churches that tried in the system.
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.000]  So the enemy has completely unclothed. But listen, if you're not a Christian, I'm not attacking you. I'm not judging you.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  I'm just saying there is good and evil in this universe.
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  The globalists are going after real Christians. Christianity predicted all of what's unfolding right now.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  And I'm just saying good and evil is a very real thing.
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.000]  And here's the deal. Going along with the globalists only makes you poorer and more unhappy and more pathetic.
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.000]  Why would anyone want to submit to them when everything they say is a lie and a fraud?
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.000]  They're doing this again to discredit our republic.
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.000]  Blame America for what's about to happen worldwide.
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.000]  Blame the virus for the worldwide economic collapse that the globalists have engineered called the Great Reset.
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  We have the enemy plans. We have their confessions. We have their future battle plans.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  And here's the deal. They're very OCD.
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.000]  Their criminals, especially mastermind types, are very methodical in their criminology.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  They are going to continue to execute the plans as they've been doing.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  That's why it's so easy to predict what they're going to do, okay?
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  And so, again, things are just going to get worse until we wake up and say no to this.
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  This is a takeover plan. This is dehumanization. This is total enslavement.
[47:45.000 --> 47:53.000]  And now the fields in people's minds are fertile for planting seeds of truth and getting people to move and getting people to take action.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  Just last week, Owen was on there and so was I saying they're about to bring back the mass mandate.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  Then they're going to try to bring in a mandate and say,
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  if you want to get on any airplanes, you got to have an injection.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  And now what is Biden saying?
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  And just sit back and think about what they're saying.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  You must take an experimental shot, but they've lied to us about it every front.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  It's been linked to all these deaths and illnesses where all the top scientists predicted it because blood clots it does.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  Most of these vaccines are being pushed on us, are banned in other countries.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  And then they gaslight us and act like we're crazy and we're bad.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  When we said it won't protect us and we won't want it and now we've been proven right.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  So here's the problem with patriots.
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  We'll tell people something and then move on because we're not trying to grandstand.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  We're not trying to get people's faces.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  They're in our faces now, folks.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  And we're going to have to get aggressive.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  And I mean, it's serious.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  And I mean, probably start blocking highways like Black Lives Matter does, not get anybody killed,
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  but have serious demonstrations to take over media events peacefully, to get up on stages live,
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.000]  to do whatever it takes to the right to the edge of legality to stop this from going to a shooting war.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  Because believe me, folks, listen to me carefully.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  They know in their actuaries, in their battle plans, in their war games,
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  that if they send out enough millions of contact tracers to the wrong houses and mess with the wrong people,
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  that folks are going to get hurt.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  We don't want that.
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  When they end up killing some of these contact tracers, they get aggressive because some of these are criminals that are getting hired.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  They're going to then start sending armed police and then calling everybody that doesn't take the shots of the contact tracers terrorists.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  That's the next phase.
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  They've already set an official battle plan that by about June, we have the whole plan.
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  And so we better get aggressive now ahead of that and say no lockdowns and no contact tracers and say,
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  we know your plan, we call you out.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  Bill Gaslight, if it doesn't matter, the public's listening.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  You've got to go hardcore with the truth now.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  Just a good news.
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  You watch a lot of these shows now, sounds just like Alex Jones, not just they're copying me.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  They're going and checking everything I say and everything you say.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  And they're finding out it's true and they care about their families.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  So you tune in to talk radio now.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  Sounds like Alex Jones.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  You tune into all these shows.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  It sounds like I'll enjoy it because we're all seeing the same thing.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  We're in this together.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  It's not about having the biggest show.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  It's not about being right.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  It's about defeating the new world order for our children.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  Because yeah, you could say the average leftist is so corrupt and evil.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Let them take their shots and get sick and die.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  We're going to have to take care of the sick and dying liberals, but to collapse society.
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  Plus that's not Christlike.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  But here's the real reason I'm sad for liberals.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  The children of these people, the two-year-olds, the five-year-olds, the ten-year-olds,
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  they don't know any better.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  They're being born into bondage and brainwashing and evil.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  They're the real target.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  We have to take things back and be strong for the children or God is not going to respect us.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  And when we face God at the white throne judgment, God will say, I do not know you.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  Because if you have God in you, you will burn with desire to stop this.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  You will be completely driven to stop this.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  People ask how I have so much energy.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  My God!
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Satanic, total, world government takeover, forced inoculations, run by pedophiles.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  What the hell, people?
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  We don't have much time to stop this.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  This is serious business.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  So go rebuke your churches when they don't talk about this.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  Go rebuke your schools.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  When they try to put masks on your kids, pull them out of there.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  Stop complying.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  Compliance is death.
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  Oh, and takeover.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  I love you and I love the crew.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  All right, Alex.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  And we'll be hearing again from Alex coming up in the next hour with a special report that he has booked
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  and tried to get some R&R on your vacation.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  Please, Alex, we beg you.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  Lord knows you need it.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  And, you know, let me just say this too, as Alex said at the beginning of this segment,
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  because, I mean, again, we don't even think about it this way.
[51:19.000 --> 51:26.000]  But we pretty much laid out exactly what they were going to do.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  I mean, hell, I literally laid out exactly what they were going to do,
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  just like you saw the clips from Alex Jones at the beginning of the broadcast.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  And I said, they're going to tell you the hospitals are overwhelmed.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  They're going to bring back the mask mandates.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  Then they're going to mandate the vaccines.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  They've done all of it.
[51:41.000 --> 51:48.000]  And the fact that they did it a lot sooner than I thought they did tells me that they're not going to get the FDA approval that they want.
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  For whatever reason, the FDA seems to want to keep its hands clean of this vaccine.
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  So maybe it's people at the FDA like, you know what, I don't want this blood on my hands.
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  Maybe for the first time in decades, the FDA actually cares about the American people and doesn't want to poison them.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  But the fact that they're announcing mandatory vaccines in New York,
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  mandatory vaccines in California,
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  mandatory vaccines for government workers ordered by the White House,
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  the fact that they basically sped through their hospitals or overwhelmed narrative
[52:23.000 --> 52:30.000]  to get to the forced mask mandates to now get ready to tell you that, oh, no, everybody's going to have to get a vaccine.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  It's going to be mandatory without the FDA approval.
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  That means that they are really not banking on that FDA approval.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  Again, I'm stunned by that.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  We know this whole thing has been planned out.
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  We know the FDA is just as corrupt as the CDC.
[52:45.000 --> 52:52.000]  But for whatever reason, it seems like the FDA wants to keep its hands clear of this vaccine.
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.000]  So they just went ahead and put it into high gear and said, well, okay,
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  maybe we're not going to get FDA approval when we want.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  So let's just go ahead and just mandate the vaccines anyway.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  Nobody's heard of the Nuremberg Code.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  Nobody understands that these are experimental.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  So let's just go ahead and do it.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  And people are so stupid and brainwashed that they're just going to go along with it.
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  And now we have total tyranny, medical tyranny, total imprisonment and slavery worldwide.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  So that's where they're going.
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.000]  But see, here's the frustrating thing.
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.000]  People are born or we're trained.
[53:25.000 --> 53:29.000]  We are trained in America, mainstream media and entertainment and everything,
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  to exist or understand the sports matrix.
[53:34.000 --> 53:43.000]  So you can be watching a football game on Sunday afternoon and the top color commentary guy
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  for NFL football games, say it's Tony Romo.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  And he can be sitting there and say, okay, the offense is in an eye formation.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  And the back just moved to the right.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  And that means they're going to run a play action fake to the right and roll out to the left
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  and throw the ball deep downfield and get the first down.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  And then they snap the ball.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  The guy goes to the right.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  They roll out to the left, throws the ball downfield caught by the receiver first down.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  And you're like, wow.
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  Wow, Tony Romo must see the future.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  He must be a genius.
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  How did he do that?
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  No, he knows the playbook.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  He exists in football.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  He played football.
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  He lives in the football world.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  So he just sees the play that they've ran 30 times.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  He knows what their playbook is.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  He's seen them run it in practice.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  He's seen them run it in the game.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  So he just says, here's the play they're about to run.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  Let's watch them run it.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  And then they run it.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  And there's no miracle.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  There's no mystery to that.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  That's just a guy that lives in the sports matrix and understands what play they're about to run.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  That's what we do here at Info Wars.
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.000]  It's not a miracle or a crystal ball for us to come up here and predict all this stuff.
[54:57.000 --> 55:04.000]  But because people don't exist in the geopolitical matrix and they're not trained to understand the geopolitical matrix,
[55:04.000 --> 55:12.000]  it seems like magic that Info Wars can predict all this stuff decades or years or months or weeks or days in advance.
[55:12.000 --> 55:18.000]  Folks, we just see the pattern, know the playbook, know the operating procedure,
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.000]  and it's really not even that difficult.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  So understand that.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  We're not getting lucky guessing these things.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  It's not a miracle.
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.000]  They're running a play, they're running a formation, they're running an agenda,
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  and we just know what it is so it's easy to call out and say, oh, there it is.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  There they are.
[55:41.000 --> 55:48.000]  They're about to bring back the masks, and then they do it because it's the play.
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  Jacob in Ohio.
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  Welcome.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  Go ahead.
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  Good, bro.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  Great last caller.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[55:56.000 --> 56:02.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  Go ahead.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  The X2 does wonders.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  They recommend it to everybody.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  You're on the fence about it.
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.000]  Get off the fence.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  Get the product.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  Support the Info Wars.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Tyler in Maine.
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  You're on the year.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  Thanks for holding.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  Go ahead.
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  It's an honor.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  Awesome.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was to say I love the product.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Well, it definitely works.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  It's not a joke.
[56:40.000 --> 57:06.000]  Absolutely.
[57:06.000 --> 57:32.000]  Dr.
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.320]  Alois Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that train the Cozzerville Institute in Germany
[57:37.520 --> 57:40.800]  And fours will continue to set fast they fight this I don't know how long we can
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.940]  The enemy's coming for a small now. God bless and good luck. I would begin get right with God right now
[57:45.940 --> 58:02.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[58:02.500 --> 58:20.420]  You know I don't talk about just let me know
[58:20.420 --> 58:37.780]  Think about how diabolical the CDC is where on the same day they admit that the
[58:37.780 --> 58:42.260]  vaccinated people are the ones causing the outbreak and the vaccinated people
[58:42.260 --> 58:47.340]  are the ones causing the mutations of the COVID virus to make it more deadly
[58:47.340 --> 58:52.140]  that's that's the CDC announcing it CDC director now says new data shows
[58:52.140 --> 58:57.740]  breakthrough cases and vaccinated people can spread as much as virus as
[58:57.740 --> 59:06.580]  unvaccinated and then they come out and say but we need vaccine passports that's
[59:06.580 --> 59:12.300]  the only pass forward so they admit the vaccine is not effective they admit the
[59:12.300 --> 59:17.580]  vaccine is causing the spread to be worse and then they come out and say the
[59:17.580 --> 59:24.260]  only answer is the vaccine and that's Rochelle Walensky at the CDC and then
[59:24.260 --> 59:32.940]  they even have they even have the cone is to come out and say well we're gonna do
[59:32.940 --> 59:37.420]  the masks again but it's only gonna be two weeks two weeks to slow the spread
[59:37.420 --> 59:43.620]  what was that a year and a half ago when does the pandemic ever end well it never
[59:43.620 --> 59:51.220]  ends don't you see the pandemic never ends and for politicians and government
[59:51.220 --> 59:57.220]  bureaucrats they love the pandemic because it gives them more power and I
[59:57.220 --> 1:00:00.820]  guess to the brainwashed minions of the mainstream media and the Democrat
[1:00:00.820 --> 1:00:05.740]  Party I guess they just like going along with the pandemic because even in
[1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:10.580]  their tiny little worthless lives they feel that it gives them power over you
[1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:15.020]  oh they can bitch at you if you don't get a vaccine oh they can bitch at you if
[1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:21.180]  you don't wear a mask and that's the greatest joy of their of their day they
[1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:29.740]  love telling you to wear the mask they love telling you to take that vaccine so
[1:00:29.740 --> 1:00:34.780]  that's their empowerment that's why they go along with it they don't care that
[1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:40.620]  it's enslaving and killing them they get empowered by it because they'd
[1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:46.420]  rather have that excuse to go out and dominate you than actually be free or
[1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:50.340]  stand up for freedom and truth themselves
[1:00:50.860 --> 1:00:56.740]  CBS Sacramento higher COVID rate found in some counties with higher
[1:00:56.740 --> 1:01:05.020]  vaccination rate yep yep and remember we had the doctors on over a year ago
[1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:12.660]  and and just consistently since then all saying the same thing if they roll out
[1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:19.620]  a vaccine for this it's going to cause worse mutations and now it is
[1:01:19.620 --> 1:01:28.180]  Israel is a perfect example that we covered it yesterday how the CDC and
[1:01:28.180 --> 1:01:32.980]  the White House launched a travel advisory or or announced a travel
[1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:37.180]  advisory from Israel stage 3 saying Israel's got way too big of an outbreak
[1:01:37.180 --> 1:01:41.940]  of COVID and Delta so we're stopping anybody coming in from Israel and then
[1:01:41.940 --> 1:01:49.100]  in the same interview or the same announcement they say but we need to do
[1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:53.260]  the exact same vaccine distribution that Israel had so they admit the vaccine
[1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:56.420]  doesn't work they admit Israel has a horrible outbreak and they banned
[1:01:56.420 --> 1:02:00.020]  travel from Israel but then they say Israel's done a good job with the
[1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:09.380]  vaccines now that's not even to mention the tremendous irony that the southern
[1:02:09.380 --> 1:02:18.700]  border is just wide open and I've got another news story on that today too
[1:02:18.700 --> 1:02:23.060]  La Jolla police say hotel is housing migrants with COVID-19 released by
[1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:26.900]  border patrol and the police chief comes out in the press conference says we had
[1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:34.660]  no idea that this was going on does somebody want to tell him does anybody
[1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:42.740]  want to tell him hey buddy I got bad news for you there's dozens of hotels on
[1:02:42.740 --> 1:02:47.580]  the southern border of Texas that are filled with illegal immigrants that have
[1:02:47.580 --> 1:02:53.180]  COVID and this has been going on for months so hate to break it to you bud
[1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:57.740]  but we covered that months ago ladies and gentlemen Owen Schroyer here the
[1:02:57.740 --> 1:03:01.940]  host of the Info Wars War Room and I am very excited about our latest
[1:03:01.940 --> 1:03:06.300]  supplement addition to infowarstore.com now I've been supplementing with

[1:03:56.780 --> 1:04:03.140]  Humanity is being held hostage a worldwide medical tyranny controlled
[1:04:03.140 --> 1:04:08.100]  with a fortune 500 the UN is being permanently put in place we must resist
[1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:12.500]  its criminal establishment of global dominance or we will be slaves for
[1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:17.100]  generations and more importantly our children will be slaves we are now at
[1:04:17.100 --> 1:04:19.820]  the crossroads
[1:04:19.820 --> 1:04:28.020]  what have I told you that you could predict the future what have I proved
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:32.700]  to you that if you do the right research you can predict the future and more
[1:04:32.700 --> 1:04:36.940]  importantly you can change the future don't need a mask the mask is about
[1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:40.500]  compliance because they know Canadians like to do what they're told so they
[1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.540]  tell you have to wear a mask next they're gonna tell you have to contact
[1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:46.940]  trace then they're gonna tell you you have to take the vaccine and because
[1:04:46.940 --> 1:04:49.900]  Canadians like to do what they're told they're hoping that everyone just complies
[1:04:49.900 --> 1:04:54.660]  and then guess what kids once you take your vaccine like a dumb person that
[1:04:54.660 --> 1:04:58.580]  doesn't know any better they're gonna tell you a story the vaccine isn't as
[1:04:58.580 --> 1:05:01.820]  effective as we thought it was gonna be so now you still got to wear your mask
[1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:05.500]  still got to get contact trace still have all the restrictions and social
[1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:09.260]  distancing and still take your vaccine and then what did you get out of all of
[1:05:09.260 --> 1:05:13.020]  this you got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel your business
[1:05:13.020 --> 1:05:16.980]  was closed they took your rights and freedoms they forced the vaccine on you
[1:05:16.980 --> 1:05:21.380]  and what happened the same amount of people died everything is the exact same
[1:05:21.380 --> 1:05:25.340]  and now they're gonna put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till
[1:05:25.340 --> 1:05:29.060]  July of next year so they can do the same thing again bring you from July
[1:05:29.060 --> 1:05:33.420]  August and September getting you off lockdown but just to bring you back on
[1:05:33.420 --> 1:05:37.260]  lockdown again if you idiots haven't figured it out yet it's a perpetual
[1:05:37.260 --> 1:05:42.100]  cycle that you never get out of and it's a way to take your rights your freedoms
[1:05:42.100 --> 1:05:46.540]  close your business take your wealth why so you become dependent on government
[1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:50.860]  why if you're independent the government works for you like it's supposed to if
[1:05:50.860 --> 1:05:54.340]  you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every
[1:05:54.340 --> 1:05:57.980]  month because they closed your business on you now the government doesn't work
[1:05:57.980 --> 1:06:02.900]  for you the government rules you so instead of a middle class we have the
[1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:07.100]  government upper class and the lower class dependents that rely on the
[1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:11.740]  government to survive in other words we have a slave class the clip you just saw
[1:06:11.740 --> 1:06:16.100]  us from a year ago it's Canadian activist Chris Skye how was he able to
[1:06:16.100 --> 1:06:20.900]  specifically exactly predict what would happen and in the longer video he
[1:06:20.900 --> 1:06:24.940]  specifically even predicted the time frames in which it would happen months
[1:06:24.940 --> 1:06:28.580]  and months before Chris Skye made his prediction I made my own predictions
[1:06:28.580 --> 1:06:31.820]  that came a hundred percent true we'll play that clip in a few minutes again
[1:06:31.820 --> 1:06:36.060]  how was I able to do that because the globalists do control the planet to the
[1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:41.020]  great extent they set worldwide policy I can't predict when my neighbor's gonna
[1:06:41.020 --> 1:06:45.340]  have a heart attack I can't predict if your fifth grader is gonna break their
[1:06:45.340 --> 1:06:49.100]  arm in the next year falling out of a tree because those are little micro events
[1:06:49.100 --> 1:06:53.380]  but when you talk about the big giant events the globalists really are in
[1:06:53.380 --> 1:06:57.380]  control this planet and we had all the documents and all the admissions from the
[1:06:57.380 --> 1:07:02.340]  United Nations and the Davos group from Klaus Schwab on their plan they said
[1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:06.900]  once they got one lockdown in they would then lighten the lockdown only to bring
[1:07:06.900 --> 1:07:11.820]  it back and over time tighten it down more and more and more so there were no
[1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:18.460]  freedoms left and now they've come out as of yesterday the CDC run by all the
[1:07:18.460 --> 1:07:23.580]  big bill gates and founcy money and have said you are going to have to wear
[1:07:23.580 --> 1:07:27.860]  masks basically forever children everybody else and those that have been
[1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:32.580]  supposedly vaccinated against COVID-19 with his experimental shots you are
[1:07:32.580 --> 1:07:38.140]  just as likely to transmit it to others maybe even more likely to transmit new
[1:07:38.140 --> 1:07:42.660]  variants to others how do you turn the entire planet earth into a prison planet
[1:07:42.660 --> 1:07:47.660]  you simply declare having a cold and act of terrorism and they're saying that
[1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:50.100]  now they're saying if you're not inoculated this experimental shot
[1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:53.340]  you're like a drunk driver you're like a murderer you're like a terrorist and
[1:07:53.340 --> 1:07:58.340]  now Microsoft is putting out video games called stay Homer where the Chinese
[1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:02.740]  military and the US military go around and kill peaceful protest men women and
[1:08:02.740 --> 1:08:07.260]  children because they're terrorist and super spreaders this is the pretext to
[1:08:07.260 --> 1:08:11.500]  track and control you via a phone via an app that then becomes the casual
[1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:16.340]  society and the worldwide program for the social credit score and it's now
[1:08:16.340 --> 1:08:20.580]  official and thousands of companies across the United States are now saying
[1:08:20.580 --> 1:08:23.700]  you're not coming into our business you're not coming into our hotel you're
[1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:27.820]  not coming into our restaurant you're not coming into this area unless you have
[1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:31.980]  had this injection into your body and then it's expanding to other
[1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:35.500]  corporations other businesses and Biden's looking at mandating it for all
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:40.980]  federal employees you can't do that you can't mandate an approved FDA shot with
[1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:44.100]  all their problems in history in the federal law in Nuremberg code but this
[1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:48.700]  is experimental this violates the very heart of the Nuremberg code and our own
[1:08:48.700 --> 1:08:53.660]  federal and state laws so we're at the crossroads and they've lied to us at
[1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:57.460]  every step of the way they're now saying you got to wear masks forever they're
[1:08:57.460 --> 1:09:01.260]  now saying sorry the vaccines don't work but you got to have more vaccines and
[1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:05.020]  people that have had the vaccines are just as likely or more so to give it to
[1:09:05.020 --> 1:09:09.380]  you oh but then those that don't take it you're even worse terrorist you shouldn't
[1:09:09.380 --> 1:09:13.660]  have a job or even have your children that's Kathleen Sebelius Obama's former
[1:09:13.660 --> 1:09:18.300]  health and human services said this is all being announced by the mega
[1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:21.580]  corporations and by the blue cities and the blue states and other globalist
[1:09:21.580 --> 1:09:27.660]  enclaves around the world to hold humanity hostage and make us accept a
[1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:33.020]  worldwide ID tracking system on our phones which class swab of the UN admit
[1:09:33.020 --> 1:09:38.100]  under the social credit score they want to announce by next year we'll track
[1:09:38.100 --> 1:09:41.140]  everywhere you go and what you do and every purchase you make and put it into
[1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:46.620]  your carbon score and tax you according to how much carbon you use so this is
[1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:50.460]  the end game everything from this point on goes over the edge of a cliff
[1:09:50.460 --> 1:09:55.940]  everything accelerates now this is all classically illegal it's all classic
[1:09:55.940 --> 1:10:01.060]  tyranny it's incredibly dangerous and we need governors and legislators and
[1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:06.940]  pastors and business owners and citizens to come up with a plan maybe an upside
[1:10:06.940 --> 1:10:11.420]  down flag of America or something because we are in distress and that upside
[1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:15.860]  down flag means we understand what's going on we understand humanity's under
[1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:21.260]  siege and we understand this is all a scam and a fraud and a crisis they've
[1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:24.220]  created it's impossible to get out of because there's always going to be new
[1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:27.540]  flu viruses they're always going to be new cold viruses there's always going to
[1:10:27.540 --> 1:10:31.180]  be new coronaviruses there's always going to be labs run by Fauci with new
[1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:34.420]  stuff to release and now they've trained us to get on our knees and say that
[1:10:34.420 --> 1:10:38.260]  we're not essential and go into our homes and just sit there all the
[1:10:38.260 --> 1:10:41.660]  amazons and the walmarts and the targets take over because there's also
[1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:47.780]  that incentive depending on the corporation the fortune 100 during the
[1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:51.860]  last year and a half of global lock downs double their profits some of them
[1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:56.300]  double their overall stock value and some tripled it I mean we're talking
[1:10:56.300 --> 1:11:02.060]  companies making hundreds of billions of dollars extra each we're talking CEOs
[1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:07.460]  and owners whose wealth went up 50 60 70 billion apiece because they're set up in
[1:11:07.460 --> 1:11:10.980]  the infrastructure to keep operating they're essential they have a supply
[1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:15.900]  chains but your small business your community your church are all going to
[1:11:15.900 --> 1:11:20.860]  fall apart and here we're going to be in a depression and have them dictate to
[1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:24.180]  the social credit score of the universal income how we live our lives they
[1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:27.420]  already admit that if you don't take all these shots you won't have a job you
[1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:32.060]  won't get your your your welfare check I mean it's not coming it's here and how
[1:11:32.060 --> 1:11:37.780]  many times did I warn you over and over and over again because again it's in
[1:11:37.780 --> 1:11:42.580]  operation lockstep it's in all their documents they think we're so stupid
[1:11:42.580 --> 1:11:47.100]  they lay all this out and really if humanity puts up with this don't we
[1:11:47.100 --> 1:11:52.020]  really deserve then what happens to us so yes adults that go along with this and
[1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:55.940]  who don't care and who are so stupid when the Darwin Awards and deserve to be
[1:11:55.940 --> 1:11:58.540]  basically killed by these poison injections that we now know are designed
[1:11:58.540 --> 1:12:01.980]  to cause blood clots all over the body but you know who doesn't deserve it the
[1:12:01.980 --> 1:12:05.020]  children the one-year-olds the five-year-olds the six-year-olds the
[1:12:05.020 --> 1:12:11.340]  ten-year-olds it's up to us to protect them and to lead them to the truth and
[1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:15.900]  we have a responsibility all of us to start having a discussion about what
[1:12:15.900 --> 1:12:19.340]  do we do when the globalist are casting us as the criminals casting us as the
[1:12:19.340 --> 1:12:23.220]  dirty humans they got to cover our ugly faces and that are germ spreaders when
[1:12:23.220 --> 1:12:26.980]  all the studies show that nine up or seven time our germs sharing that makes
[1:12:26.980 --> 1:12:30.380]  us healthier and if you're not exposed to other people's germs you get sick and
[1:12:30.380 --> 1:12:35.740]  die that's the real science would see they say oh no there's a new science out
[1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:39.740]  sake said that's why you've now got to wear a mask and that's why the vaccines
[1:12:39.740 --> 1:12:41.820]  don't work but they still work you got to take them
[1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:45.620]  science is about asking questions not having a scientific dictatorship of
[1:12:45.620 --> 1:12:49.820]  corporations bully and control all the real doctors and scientists who by the
[1:12:49.820 --> 1:12:53.060]  way are saying the opposite of what they're saying I'm saying what all the
[1:12:53.060 --> 1:12:56.620]  real scientists and experts and Nobel Prize winners are saying all of them it's
[1:12:56.620 --> 1:13:00.700]  crazy I'm actually proud of the scientific community but you have the globalist
[1:13:00.700 --> 1:13:04.180]  the big corporations that have hijacked that community and are now taking over
[1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:07.780]  with the medical dictatorship the world economy and where we can go and what we
[1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:12.220]  can do and locking us on our homes it will foreign enemy came and took over
[1:13:12.220 --> 1:13:16.020]  the United States and then orders to stay on our homes at night we wouldn't put
[1:13:16.020 --> 1:13:19.860]  up with that but when the UN the big corporations do it in the name of this
[1:13:19.860 --> 1:13:24.940]  virus they cooked up we do do it you never get out of this type of control by
[1:13:24.940 --> 1:13:28.860]  bowing down you only get out of it by saying no and rebuking it and exposing
[1:13:28.860 --> 1:13:35.860]  it we either expose and prosecute the ringleaders of this Bill Gates Fauci and
[1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:39.460]  others or they're gonna continue to expand this program and that's the most
[1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:43.900]  important thing I'm gonna say here today just like Domino's we know what's
[1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:48.540]  coming next in their plan and that's gonna be new even more hardcore
[1:13:48.540 --> 1:13:53.660]  viruses they're gonna release to see if we'll stay on our homes and quietly die
[1:13:53.660 --> 1:14:02.820]  your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or
[1:14:02.820 --> 1:14:06.940]  in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is
[1:14:06.940 --> 1:14:11.260]  unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more
[1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:15.660]  important than ever to use every tool we've got well ladies and gentlemen if

[1:17:10.980 --> 1:17:14.500]  world collapsing because the ongoing lockdowns that are now in place and the
[1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:17.220]  UN organizing hundreds of millions of people which they say they're gonna
[1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:20.500]  bring here to flood the United States in Europe as a political tool to bring us
[1:17:20.500 --> 1:17:25.020]  to our knees it's gonna mean contact tracers coming to your house demanding
[1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:30.060]  coming your home with armed police and then taking you away to emergency COVID
[1:17:30.060 --> 1:17:34.460]  centers even if you've tested negative on their fraudulent machines and yes it
[1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:38.860]  means COVID camps for people who refuse the inoculation that's being announced in
[1:17:38.860 --> 1:17:41.900]  the UK it's being announced in Israel it's being announced in Australia and
[1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:46.100]  they're now even beginning to do it in places of northern Europe we shot a big
[1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:50.660]  report on that with witnesses yesterday let's at Band-Aud video so this thing
[1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:54.620]  just gets worse and worse and worse the more we submit and each new stage of the
[1:17:54.620 --> 1:17:58.060]  program is completely obvious just like we told you they're gonna blame the
[1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:01.940]  unvaccinated when the vaccine doesn't work how did we say that over a year ago
[1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:07.180]  because we know the enemy plan I'm gonna shoot another report this afternoon
[1:18:07.180 --> 1:18:13.220]  let's go to tell what the world will look like in two years if we don't start
[1:18:13.220 --> 1:18:17.300]  turning the tide back now and saying no so to all the legislatures and all the
[1:18:17.300 --> 1:18:20.460]  corporate owners who aren't globalist and everybody out there who thinks you're
[1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:24.260]  safe on the fence you're not safe on the fence you got to get off the fence now
[1:18:24.260 --> 1:18:28.740]  this is a very cancerous hardcore authoritarian rule government takeover
[1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:32.660]  plan that has been well thought out but if you were awake to the plan and awake
[1:18:32.660 --> 1:18:37.380]  to how it operates it's very easy to defeat if people simply again awaken
[1:18:37.380 --> 1:18:41.580]  and start resisting it in nonviolent ways the problem is they're assaulting us
[1:18:41.580 --> 1:18:44.500]  physically with these deadly shots they're violating our rights trying to
[1:18:44.500 --> 1:18:48.740]  coerce us to take them and so we do have a right to defend ourselves and I'm not
[1:18:48.740 --> 1:18:52.500]  calling for violence right now I'm just simply saying that that we're entering a
[1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:57.700]  wheelhouse where the gloves are off I don't want any violence because they're
[1:18:57.700 --> 1:19:01.420]  probably gonna stage false flags against themselves to make the whole medical
[1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:05.500]  tyranny group look like victims that's why they've gotten the new Homeland
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:08.340]  Security report put out two months ago by Biden that anyone that's against
[1:19:08.340 --> 1:19:12.340]  lockdowns is a terrorist they're already branding us as terrorists as they kill
[1:19:12.340 --> 1:19:16.420]  us as they poison us as they lock us up as they say we're not essential as they
[1:19:16.420 --> 1:19:20.020]  rob us as they implode us as they impoverish us through economic and
[1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:23.700]  cultural warfare so we have to be like Gandhi and Jesus Christ to Martin Luther
[1:19:23.700 --> 1:19:28.780]  King and and and and point that out to the public and be peaceful but also point
[1:19:28.780 --> 1:19:32.540]  out that once we take the government back there will be trials just like
[1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:35.460]  Nuremberg for the individuals that did this and they will pay it's very
[1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:38.620]  important for the globalist to be uncomfortable it's very important for
[1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.380]  them to know that they will be held accountable it's very important for them
[1:19:41.380 --> 1:19:45.500]  to know that we're aware of their plan the only way we can counter this evil is
[1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:48.500]  if you take action you aren't just part of the equation you were basically the
[1:19:48.500 --> 1:19:52.420]  entire equation no you'll sing if a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there
[1:19:52.420 --> 1:19:55.940]  to hear it did it make a sound it's up to you to take this report and get it out
[1:19:55.940 --> 1:20:00.900]  this is a life-and-death situation things are deteriorating very very fast we've
[1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:03.940]  now confirmed that this is their most vicious takeover plan that they've
[1:20:03.940 --> 1:20:07.180]  launched and all I can say is you better get right with God as well and take
[1:20:07.180 --> 1:20:11.660]  action when you still can't they have never guessed the right flu virus for
[1:20:11.660 --> 1:20:14.740]  the mutation of what the main flu is the next year and it's always a whole bunch
[1:20:14.740 --> 1:20:18.540]  of flues dozens and dozens of them and then it does nothing to protect you
[1:20:18.540 --> 1:20:24.980]  from the next flu if it's not the exact flu that's why they never ask why they
[1:20:24.980 --> 1:20:28.380]  don't have a vaccine for the common cold because it's too varied because there's
[1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:32.620]  thousands of them and because you have to get it exactly right and viruses are
[1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:35.620]  always mutating but you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine they
[1:20:35.620 --> 1:20:39.420]  want you willingly to go take whatever it is that's going to be in there now
[1:20:39.420 --> 1:20:43.100]  Fauci has come out of you just join us we're gonna play the clip again first
[1:20:43.100 --> 1:20:47.580]  here in a moment and said hey we're gonna surveil people we're gonna cycle into
[1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:51.620]  other seasons next year you won't be able to go out either so they'll run into
[1:20:51.620 --> 1:20:54.260]  the middle of summer and then let you have a month or two and then clamp it
[1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:57.340]  back down but there'll be special apps they're announcing you'll be tracked
[1:20:57.340 --> 1:21:01.300]  China was the model they're gonna roll it out like they just got these ideas but
[1:21:01.300 --> 1:21:05.100]  it's all pre-planned by the Rockefeller Foundation below Melinda Gates the
[1:21:05.100 --> 1:21:10.860]  tabletop exercises predicting COVID-19 in November when it was already launched
[1:21:10.860 --> 1:21:13.980]  in China I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one
[1:21:13.980 --> 1:21:20.980]  and if we fail this test we're gonna be ruled by the threat of unending
[1:21:20.980 --> 1:21:27.300]  invisible bio weapons they're gonna tighten down the restrictions loosen
[1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:33.140]  them by the summer and then release new strains immediately that aren't even as
[1:21:33.140 --> 1:21:36.700]  bad as the current strain they'll say they're worse fear monger and then
[1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:41.020]  clamp down even stronger and that's what they've done in Italy it's what they've
[1:21:41.020 --> 1:21:44.980]  done in other areas where they've been beta testing like Spain and now moving
[1:21:44.980 --> 1:21:49.180]  towards Australia so this is all formulaic it's all heavily scripted and
[1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:51.780]  we know their plan
[1:21:56.980 --> 1:22:04.220]  info wars tomorrow's news today and we are back here now live in the info
[1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:10.580]  wars world headquarters in Austin Texas and it's too bad we don't have a real
[1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:16.580]  legitimate media in this country that is able to get into the White House press
[1:22:16.580 --> 1:22:22.540]  gaggle every day and call all these hypocrisies and tyrannies to task on
[1:22:22.540 --> 1:22:27.860]  Jen Psaki other than Peter Ducey who's I mean you know Peter Ducey is good and
[1:22:27.860 --> 1:22:30.940]  he asked the questions but he's not really that hardcore but at least he's
[1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:36.060]  there at least he's getting the questions in and so naturally you know
[1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:39.380]  whoever's up there whether it's sake or whoever they choose next is gonna be
[1:22:39.380 --> 1:22:44.060]  floundering and flipping and flopping around like a fish out of water on this
[1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:49.820]  because there is no consistency there's all kinds of illogic and mostly just
[1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:55.340]  lies so here's Peter Ducey asking the one person in there who's not a Democrat
[1:22:55.340 --> 1:23:01.540]  activist asking Saki about all of this and here she is trying her best to make
[1:23:01.540 --> 1:23:08.140]  sense of it still then why do vaccinated people need to put the masks back on
[1:23:08.140 --> 1:23:12.140]  well here first of all I would say again just to go back to this chart which I
[1:23:12.140 --> 1:23:17.900]  will handily point to again if you were vaccinated you're vaccinated your light
[1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:23.140]  you can save your life and I think the clear data shows that this pandemic is
[1:23:23.140 --> 1:23:27.860]  killing is hospitalizing is making people very sick who are not vaccinated
[1:23:27.860 --> 1:23:32.260]  that can still continues to be the case regardless of what the mask guidance
[1:23:32.260 --> 1:23:37.180]  looks like the vaccines work which this sign says that they do then why do
[1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:41.700]  people who have had the vaccine need to now wear masks the same as people who
[1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:47.380]  have not had it because the public health leaders in our administration have
[1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:51.740]  made the determination based on data that that is a way to make sure they're
[1:23:51.740 --> 1:23:55.980]  protected their loved ones are protected and that's an extra step given the
[1:23:55.980 --> 1:24:00.220]  transmissibility of the virus that people that they're advising people today
[1:24:00.220 --> 1:24:03.740]  they're changing their guidance they're changing their their advice to the
[1:24:03.740 --> 1:24:07.060]  American public their public health advice based on evolving data and an
[1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:11.700]  evolving historic about guidance that very virus that's exactly what they
[1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:15.360]  should be doing is your message to Americans who are feeling whiplash right
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:19.620]  now why should they trust the same group of health officials who just two
[1:24:19.620 --> 1:24:24.260]  months ago told them they don't have to wear a mask anymore inside because our
[1:24:24.260 --> 1:24:28.860]  goal is to save their lives and our responsibility and the responsibility of
[1:24:28.860 --> 1:24:36.180]  public health officials is to continue to provide updated guidance you know it's
[1:24:36.180 --> 1:24:40.820]  funny she never even answered Peter Ducey's question did you notice that
[1:24:40.820 --> 1:24:49.900]  she never even answered the question this White House is a joke man oh my gosh
[1:24:49.900 --> 1:25:00.220]  what a monster what a monster Jen Psaki is the willing foot soldier the
[1:25:00.220 --> 1:25:06.980]  willing voice box of the corrupted bought and paid for New World Order
[1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:15.660]  White House and Jen Psaki just sits there and tells lie after lie after lie
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:24.980]  covers up for all the nonsensical illogical double standard non scientific
[1:25:24.980 --> 1:25:32.300]  BS that comes out of our politicians and our health officials mouths the
[1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:36.780]  vaccine works but wear the mask the vaccine works but vaccinated people are
[1:25:36.780 --> 1:25:40.700]  spreading the disease the vaccine works but now you need to get three and four
[1:25:40.700 --> 1:25:47.380]  and five booster shots and the average liberal out there they know it's all a
[1:25:47.380 --> 1:25:52.700]  lie and they don't even care they just want to have an excuse to tell you to
[1:25:52.700 --> 1:25:56.980]  wear a mask and take a vaccine so many people say to me Alex please stop being
[1:25:56.980 --> 1:26:02.540]  so negative well for me admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a
[1:26:02.540 --> 1:26:07.820]  root canal is not negative it hurts it stinks it's got pus coming out of it I
[1:26:07.820 --> 1:26:12.300]  go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative I'm not living in denial and so
[1:26:12.300 --> 1:26:17.020]  think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we'd feel yet but now
[1:26:17.020 --> 1:26:21.340]  it's come to the surface that's actually a positive thing and so yeah Trump did
[1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:25.740]  an overall a great job they stole the election we can't get down about that we
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:31.700]  have forced them out in the open so now they're trying to suppress us because
[1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:35.340]  they know they've been exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying oh
[1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:38.100]  we're a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners
[1:26:38.100 --> 1:26:42.700]  they're trying to suppress us let our light of truth shine and tell everybody
[1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:46.820]  what's happening your own website your own show my show other articles other
[1:26:46.820 --> 1:26:51.380]  videos just keep sharing however you can and realize we're an information war
[1:26:51.380 --> 1:26:57.020]  we're gonna win this together and the fight starts in fours dot com there's
[1:26:57.020 --> 1:27:03.820]  one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologist all agree on and that
[1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:07.980]  it's criminals are extremely pathological even more the general
[1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:11.660]  public they do the same things over and over again and criminals like to
[1:27:11.660 --> 1:27:17.380]  commit the same types of crimes over and over again well guess what it was
[1:27:17.380 --> 1:27:24.580]  Anthony Fauci a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the
[1:27:24.580 --> 1:27:27.540]  mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually kill more
[1:27:27.540 --> 1:27:32.980]  people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[1:27:32.980 --> 1:27:36.300]  that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create auto
[1:27:36.300 --> 1:27:41.900]  immune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then break down and
[1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:46.260]  would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the COVID-19
[1:27:46.260 --> 1:27:49.860]  and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your
[1:27:49.860 --> 1:27:54.140]  immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV that's right ladies
[1:27:54.140 --> 1:27:58.780]  and gentlemen we here at info wars are proud to announce the first ever

[1:30:45.860 --> 1:30:52.380]  thing has been planned out well in advance they always knew they'd bring
[1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:57.060]  back the mask mandate they always knew they'd bring back the shutdown they
[1:30:57.060 --> 1:31:01.060]  they always knew that they would eventually force this vaccine even though
[1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:06.020]  it's still still experimental and an emergency use authorization right now
[1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:18.260]  for a virus that has a 99.9% survivability rate so we're not even in
[1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:24.380]  emergency we never were the emergency is globalism the emergency is one world
[1:31:24.380 --> 1:31:30.700]  government the emergency is medical tyranny not COVID but let me just focus
[1:31:30.700 --> 1:31:36.540]  and see if I can't get through this stack of news so that you can know the
[1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:44.380]  truth about what's going on when it comes to the CDC masks and COVID USA
[1:31:44.380 --> 1:31:52.060]  today new data suggests vaccinated individuals could have higher levels of
[1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:58.540]  virus and infect others amid the surging cases driven by the Delta
[1:31:58.540 --> 1:32:01.820]  variant of the coronavirus the vaccinated people are the ones that
[1:32:01.820 --> 1:32:06.500]  created the Delta variant and now anybody who's honestly looking into it
[1:32:06.500 --> 1:32:11.220]  knows that that's the truth Biden lied Fauci lied everybody who said the
[1:32:11.220 --> 1:32:17.500]  vaccine protects you lied CBS Sacramento higher COVID rate found in some
[1:32:17.500 --> 1:32:24.220]  counties with higher vaccination rates yep but they're still saying now in
[1:32:24.220 --> 1:32:29.300]  California you have to have the COVID vaccine in order to do anything go to a
[1:32:29.300 --> 1:32:34.340]  restaurant go to a bar go to work doesn't matter the vaccine is neither
[1:32:34.340 --> 1:32:39.420]  safe or effective CDC director now says new data shows breakthrough cases and
[1:32:39.420 --> 1:32:45.060]  vaccinated people and that those vaccinated people can spread as much of
[1:32:45.060 --> 1:32:49.860]  the virus as the unvaccinated and in fact they spread the virus more than the
[1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:55.460]  back the unvaccinated CDC director Rochelle Walensky says new mask wearing
[1:32:55.460 --> 1:33:00.460]  guidance and more vaccinations could halt rising coronavirus
[1:33:00.460 --> 1:33:06.540]  cases in a couple of weeks in a couple of weeks and the CDC announces
[1:33:06.540 --> 1:33:12.220]  vaccinated people must wear masks indoors so there's your two weeks to stop
[1:33:12.220 --> 1:33:16.540]  the spread once again we're still in the original two weeks to stop the spread
[1:33:16.540 --> 1:33:20.340]  here and a half later what a joke
[1:33:20.340 --> 1:33:24.940]  kendalini and from NBC reporting new data suggests that fully vaccinated
[1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:29.500]  individuals are not just contracting COVID but could be carrying higher levels
[1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:35.620]  of the virus than previously understood facilitating spread and then that's
[1:33:35.620 --> 1:33:42.460]  their excuse so it's incredible so any any fair-minded person that doesn't
[1:33:42.460 --> 1:33:46.540]  understand what's going on just says hey wait a second I'm vaccinated why do I
[1:33:46.540 --> 1:33:49.900]  have to wear the mask again so this is their excuse well you have to wear the
[1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:52.780]  mask because vaccinated people are still spreading the disease and still
[1:33:52.780 --> 1:33:56.980]  getting sick and then you would say well then if the vaccine doesn't work why
[1:33:56.980 --> 1:34:02.260]  do I have to get it they say because you're in a deadly pandemic so it's
[1:34:02.260 --> 1:34:06.020]  just cycle of misinformation and propaganda that you can never escape
[1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:12.940]  until you choose to just leave and admit that it's nothing but lies and
[1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:17.660]  propaganda CDC director vaccine passports may very well be the path
[1:34:17.660 --> 1:34:22.900]  forward that's forced vaccines it's mere experimental vaccine violation of the
[1:34:22.900 --> 1:34:27.420]  Nuremberg code and if we still believe in the Nuremberg code anybody who forces
[1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:31.820]  you to take an experimental injection is punishable by the death penalty I don't
[1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:34.500]  know if we're still going off the Nuremberg code or if we're deciding to be
[1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:39.300]  the Nazis now you'd have to ask the CDC that maybe Peter Ducey will bring that
[1:34:39.300 --> 1:34:47.380]  up to Jen Psaki more bots on Twitter so remember last week we showed I may
[1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:52.100]  even cover it yesterday too how you had tens of thousands of bots on Twitter
[1:34:52.100 --> 1:34:56.700]  saying we're being crushed by COVID I just got out of the ICU I just got out
[1:34:56.700 --> 1:35:01.780]  of the ER it's nothing but COVID patients we're all dying from COVID just
[1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:06.260]  tens of thousands of these bot accounts some of them even with verified
[1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:09.700]  checkmarks and they're doc some of them doctors too who knows if these are even
[1:35:09.700 --> 1:35:13.300]  real people and so you know that that's when you know it's propaganda that's
[1:35:13.300 --> 1:35:16.980]  when you know it's fake news Twitter doesn't censor that by the way now you
[1:35:16.980 --> 1:35:21.980]  have the latest fake news bot thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets
[1:35:21.980 --> 1:35:27.260]  saying this exact same thing anti-vaccine rhetoric is dangerous vaccine
[1:35:27.260 --> 1:35:32.740]  hesitancy and refusal threatened public health and assault lawmakers and others
[1:35:32.740 --> 1:35:37.740]  and is otherwise unacceptable stop anti-vax violence hashtag vaccines work
[1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:43.300]  so now you have tens of thousands of these tweets being sent out by bots
[1:35:43.300 --> 1:35:50.100]  total propaganda hey if the vaccine is so safe and effective why do you need to
[1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:53.740]  propagandize me into taking it hey if it's such a deadly disease why do you
[1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:56.660]  have to keep reminding me how dangerous it is why wouldn't I just know that from
[1:35:56.660 --> 1:36:00.020]  living my life no it's all lies
[1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:04.620]  Facebook critics are protesting the company's handling of COVID-19
[1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:09.260]  disinformation even though they're censoring everybody so I mean I don't
[1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:12.780]  know what you want them to do they just it's not enough to just censor free
[1:36:12.780 --> 1:36:17.340]  speech they want they want anybody who's reporting the truth about vaccines to
[1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:20.980]  die is what they really want because Facebook is already censoring it so
[1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:23.860]  what are these people really want they want you dead hey we just want to
[1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:27.700]  protect your life wear a mask take a vaccine but if you don't well I think
[1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:34.620]  you should die that's your modern-day liberal and so they're out in front of
[1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:40.180]  the Facebook office in DC with these body bags and it says Facebook disinfo
[1:36:40.180 --> 1:36:43.940]  kills that's that's right out of Biden's mouth actually he didn't know what he
[1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:46.980]  said at the time but now it's announced this trend so they have all these body
[1:36:46.980 --> 1:36:53.980]  bags I'm curious though I'm curious if these activists with these body bags
[1:36:53.980 --> 1:36:58.540]  wonder who funded all this I'm curious are they gonna go outside as the CDC with
[1:36:58.540 --> 1:37:03.100]  the how many body bags would they need now for the vaccine deaths that would be
[1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:08.380]  a fun image how about that because they all about their protests and their
[1:37:08.380 --> 1:37:11.860]  images right and now they're doing the body bag treatment in front of Facebook
[1:37:11.860 --> 1:37:16.980]  it's just so stupid but these aren't smart people were dealing with their
[1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:21.580]  brainwashed minions of the New World Order they are minions of the devil of
[1:37:21.580 --> 1:37:30.220]  Satan so why don't we have somebody take what is the number now 12,000 that we
[1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:36.180]  know of 12,000 body bags and put them in front of the White House and say here's
[1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:40.220]  how many people died of the vaccine hey you can still love the vaccine but hey
[1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:44.380]  let's let's have a little demonstration here's 12,000 body bags these are all
[1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.660]  the people that died from the COVID vaccine according to the Health and
[1:37:47.660 --> 1:37:53.220]  Human Services official website of vaccine adverse reactions bears I've
[1:37:53.220 --> 1:37:56.100]  shown the charts the numbers keep continue to go up because they keep
[1:37:56.100 --> 1:38:01.020]  making people take this vaccine I mean let's do it or maybe go in front of a
[1:38:01.020 --> 1:38:07.340]  CDC office or a World Health Organization office and just put 12,000 body bags out
[1:38:07.340 --> 1:38:10.820]  there and that will properly illustrate how many people have died from the
[1:38:10.820 --> 1:38:16.740]  vaccine they love their demonstration they love their optics well that can go
[1:38:16.740 --> 1:38:23.620]  both ways couldn't it so I'd love to see somebody of course we don't have a big
[1:38:23.620 --> 1:38:27.180]  you know billionaire donor like George Soros who probably paid for those body
[1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:33.780]  bags to go do this or whoever whoever it is why don't we have somebody take
[1:38:33.780 --> 1:38:41.380]  12,000 body bags and put them outside of the White House or outside of a
[1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:45.060]  World Health Organization office or outside of a CDC office to illustrate
[1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:49.820]  how many people died from the COVID vaccine and then Facebook would declare
[1:38:49.820 --> 1:38:53.420]  that misinformation and censor it but that's not enough for the left even
[1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:56.700]  though Facebook is engaged in censorship they still say vaccine
[1:38:56.700 --> 1:39:03.060]  misinformation disinformation kills not as much as the vaccine kills
[1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:10.100]  better call Saul star gets COVID vaccine that was a few months ago and then oh
[1:39:10.100 --> 1:39:18.460]  Bob Odenkirk who is the guy who got the COVID vaccine hospitalized after
[1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:24.540]  collapsing on better call Saul set so Bob Odenkirk gets the vaccine few weeks
[1:39:24.540 --> 1:39:31.060]  later collapses on the set of his show 100 I mean what are the odds that that's
[1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:42.220]  from the vaccine though 100% 99.9% 99.8% 98% yet another example somebody gets
[1:39:42.220 --> 1:39:47.340]  the vaccine and then dies or somebody gets the vaccine and then collapses it's
[1:39:47.340 --> 1:39:51.860]  probably gonna come out he had a blood clot just like 60% of the people to get
[1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:56.620]  the vaccine end up having blood clots but I'll tell you who's that five-star

[1:44:25.380 --> 1:44:33.060]  all right let me continue here on the covid news front this is a big one right
[1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:38.300]  here ladies and gentlemen this is the dangerous one and this is the one that
[1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:45.220]  tells you they do have the plan in place to go door to door with forced
[1:44:45.220 --> 1:44:50.500]  vaccines because they've already launched their safety net department of
[1:44:50.500 --> 1:44:57.020]  justice declares covid-19 vaccine mandates are legal now again this is
[1:44:57.020 --> 1:45:03.260]  not an FDA approved vaccine it is still in the trial process right now as we
[1:45:03.260 --> 1:45:10.060]  speak it's only the only reason these anybody's allowed to give you this
[1:45:10.060 --> 1:45:17.460]  vaccine is because of the emergency use authorization act which has really
[1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:21.780]  there should be some sort of a limit on that there there should be some sort of
[1:45:21.780 --> 1:45:25.820]  a time based on that there should be more standards on that there's not we
[1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:32.300]  were never in an emergency but but here's the self-fulfilling prophecy they
[1:45:32.300 --> 1:45:38.620]  make a virus in a lab they then release it on the world they then use the media
[1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:42.980]  to scare the entire planet that this is the deadliest virus in world history and
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:48.020]  then they get their emergency use authorization to give you this experimental
[1:45:48.020 --> 1:45:58.220]  vaccine and so it doesn't matter if the virus is 99.9 percent
[1:45:58.220 --> 1:46:02.940]  survivable which it is and we have that data they're still in the trial phase of
[1:46:02.940 --> 1:46:06.660]  this vaccine they still have the emergency use authorization that should
[1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:11.300]  have been revoked that should have been removed we're not in an emergency but the
[1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:18.780]  big lie persists and so now the Justice Department says it's legal to mandate
[1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:25.580]  vaccines no it's not and now you have the most corrupt Justice Department in the
[1:46:25.580 --> 1:46:36.060]  history of America in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code and so it's time for
[1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:40.220]  an investigation to be launched into the Department of Justice into Merrick
[1:46:40.220 --> 1:46:46.700]  Garland and it's time for Nuremberg trials 2.0 to come out with the old
[1:46:46.700 --> 1:46:51.260]  Nuremberg Code as the backdrop and everybody involved in these vaccines
[1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:56.380]  and mandating these vaccines needs to be brought in for trial and investigated
[1:46:56.380 --> 1:47:00.180]  and if it's found they're in violation of the Nuremberg Code then they should
[1:47:00.180 --> 1:47:04.940]  suffer the death penalty according to the Nuremberg Code I didn't write the
[1:47:04.940 --> 1:47:11.020]  Nuremberg Code I wasn't alive when the Nazis were experimenting with with Jews
[1:47:11.020 --> 1:47:14.460]  and coercing them into medical experimentation without telling them
[1:47:14.460 --> 1:47:20.380]  but the world decided that was a bad thing had the Nuremberg trials wrote
[1:47:20.380 --> 1:47:26.180]  the Nuremberg Code said you cannot force anybody you cannot coerce anybody you
[1:47:26.180 --> 1:47:32.780]  cannot mandate anybody be a part of a medical experiment and right now that is
[1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:36.860]  what is happening in the world that is what our government is doing to us that
[1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:40.460]  is what the French government is trying to do that is what all these corrupt
[1:47:40.460 --> 1:47:44.980]  governments are trying to do right now as we speak force you into a medical
[1:47:44.980 --> 1:47:49.580]  experiment known as the COVID-19 vaccine that is still an experimental phase
[1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:53.860]  killing tens of thousands of people and now the Department of Justice is in
[1:47:53.860 --> 1:48:00.540]  direct violation of the Nuremberg Code and should be treated as such but again
[1:48:00.540 --> 1:48:03.940]  that's not gonna matter we don't live in the same times we don't have any
[1:48:03.940 --> 1:48:08.100]  justice anymore in this planet it's it's one side of justice whatever the
[1:48:08.100 --> 1:48:12.740]  globalist want to do they do whatever the Democrat Party wants to do they do
[1:48:12.740 --> 1:48:19.340]  and so yeah this is an open shut case everybody involved in forcing you to
[1:48:19.340 --> 1:48:23.820]  take a COVID-19 vaccine is direct violation of the Nuremberg Code and
[1:48:23.820 --> 1:48:29.180]  according to the Nuremberg Code that's punishable by death that's not
[1:48:29.180 --> 1:48:32.780]  misinformation that's just fact but go ahead and write up your stories and
[1:48:32.780 --> 1:48:38.300]  talk about that big misinformation as more than 10,000 people die from this
[1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:42.140]  vaccine the number will be over 20,000 by the end of the year who knows where
[1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:45.620]  that number will cap at once this is all said and done we still don't know the
[1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:50.100]  long-term effects of this vaccine again I just covered in the last segment and
[1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:54.820]  an actor who got the vaccine a couple months ago just collapsed on his set
[1:48:54.820 --> 1:48:59.140]  by blood clots so there's gonna be a lot of people that aren't even getting the
[1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:03.260]  negative side effects yet because it the ticking time bomb that is this
[1:49:03.260 --> 1:49:08.500]  experimental vaccine just hasn't blown up yet but here's why this is
[1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:12.660]  significant this just tells you this is what the Justice Department has just
[1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:18.060]  told you they know that all this everything they're doing with this
[1:49:18.060 --> 1:49:23.460]  vaccine is totally illegal again you have to invert everything the New World
[1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:26.380]  Order tells you you have to invert everything the Biden administration
[1:49:26.380 --> 1:49:30.220]  tells you you have to invert everything our politicians tell you right now so
[1:49:30.220 --> 1:49:34.820]  when they say that it's legal to mandate vaccines that means it's illegal and
[1:49:34.820 --> 1:49:41.460]  they know it so this is just cover knowing that they're gonna mandate these
[1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:47.580]  vaccines hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from them and now
[1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:50.980]  they're just gonna say well yeah you killed a hundred thousand people with
[1:49:50.980 --> 1:49:55.300]  these mandatory vaccines and then the people that did it whether it's
[1:49:55.300 --> 1:50:03.220]  politicians or doctors or whoever it is they now have the cover thanks to the
[1:50:03.220 --> 1:50:07.420]  Department of Justice to say well it was legal you can't sue me I was trying to
[1:50:07.420 --> 1:50:13.220]  stop a pandemic and they're hoping that there's no lawyers out there they're
[1:50:13.220 --> 1:50:17.940]  hoping that the American people or the people of the world out there have no
[1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:22.140]  idea what the Nuremberg code is and won't bring the Nuremberg code up in
[1:50:22.140 --> 1:50:26.980]  this great debate of forced sterilization or forced death known as the
[1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:32.900]  COVID-19 vaccine so they invert reality and they say it's perfectly legal to
[1:50:32.900 --> 1:50:38.020]  mandate this experimental vaccine even though it's not legal it's in violation
[1:50:38.020 --> 1:50:45.820]  of the Nuremberg code it's in violation of just any any basic medical ethics to
[1:50:45.820 --> 1:50:49.980]  force somebody to take an experimental vaccine when we know that it's killing
[1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:53.060]  people when we know that if you've had COVID you have the antibodies forever
[1:50:53.060 --> 1:50:56.260]  when we know that if you've had COVID and you get the vaccine it's even more
[1:50:56.260 --> 1:51:00.460]  deadly when we know that for some age groups the vaccine is already more
[1:51:00.460 --> 1:51:07.100]  deadly than COVID now they have just written off they have the right to kill
[1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:12.220]  you with a vaccine so the Department of Justice declares medical tyranny to be
[1:51:12.220 --> 1:51:17.740]  legal well look at the Department of Justice declares euthanization to be
[1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:22.300]  to be legal if the Department of Justice says coerced euthanization is
[1:51:22.300 --> 1:51:26.060]  legal does that mean it's legal if the Department of Justice says murder is
[1:51:26.060 --> 1:51:29.540]  legal does that make it legal if the Department of Justice says you can
[1:51:29.540 --> 1:51:33.460]  rape somebody if you want that's legal does that make it legal
[1:51:33.460 --> 1:51:41.080]  of course not but now they feel they have their safety net so to me this
[1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:47.480]  says they are not getting the approval from the FDA on the timetable they want, if ever.
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:53.080]  And so now they're pretending that the Department of Justice is the FDA and they're saying,
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:56.200]  yep, you can mandate vaccines.
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:52:00.180]  So when they mandate them in California and they mandate them in New York and tens of
[1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:05.440]  thousands of people die from the vaccines, now they have their legal cover.
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:08.840]  They already have their legal cover with the secret vaccine courts.
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:11.360]  They can't sue vaccine manufacturers.
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:14.800]  And now they have their legal cover to say, well, the Department of Justice said that
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:17.920]  it's legal, so I'm just going to mandate these vaccines.
[1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:21.360]  And now you won't be able to sue me in court saying that it was illegal to do it.
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:23.760]  See the Department of Justice is on my side.
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:26.480]  Totally illegal, totally corrupt.
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.160]  Everybody should be afraid of this.
[1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:33.840]  So that's where we're at there.
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:38.560]  Twitter censors the nation of Islam for criticizing mRNA vaccines, but not for being
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:39.560]  anti-Semitic.
[1:52:39.560 --> 1:52:41.280]  You got to love that.
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:42.640]  You just got to love that.
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:46.240]  So the nation of Islam can exist on Twitter and, you know, call for the death of all Jews
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:49.520]  and wipe Israel off the map and all that good stuff.
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:55.880]  But oh, if they say something about the vaccines that Twitter doesn't like, then they get banned.
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:52:59.440]  Isn't that, isn't that fun?
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:04.120]  And then the La Jolla Police Department, apparently months behind Info Wars, they don't even know
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:05.480]  what's going on in their own city.
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:10.320]  That should shock you if you're in La Jolla, that your police are that inept, but that's
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:11.320]  just the truth.
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:15.840]  La Jolla police say hotel is housing migrants with COVID-19 that have been released by Border
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:21.040]  Patrol and they say they had no idea it was going on.
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:26.040]  How can the La Jolla police have no idea this is going on when Info Wars broke this news
[1:53:26.040 --> 1:53:30.440]  months ago and I was on the ground in the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley?
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:35.280]  I mean, how many hotels did we go to that were filled up with COVID positive people that
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:39.720]  were released by Border Patrol, five, six, seven, eight.
[1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:40.720]  I mean, we lost count.
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:41.720]  There were so many.
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:47.840]  We were following the buses all around town, filling up hotels, entire hotels with COVID-19
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:50.520]  positive illegal immigrants that had been released.
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:55.240]  And remember, we would go to these hotels and the hotel owner would come out and threaten
[1:53:55.240 --> 1:54:00.440]  me and get in my face and threaten me and then called the police on me.
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:02.840]  And think about that.
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:04.760]  That's how big of a joke this is.
[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:07.480]  I went to these hotels.
[1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:11.960]  I covered that these were all COVID positive patients in the hotels released by Border
[1:54:11.960 --> 1:54:18.680]  Patrol and the owners of the hotels called the police on me and they still didn't know
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:19.840]  what was going on.
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:21.920]  Did they not believe me?
[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:23.320]  Did they think I was making it up?
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:28.080]  I mean, literally the cops would come and I'd say officer, these are all illegal immigrants.
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.120]  They've all tested positive for COVID and they've all been released by Border Patrol.
[1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:34.640]  What are you doing here looking at me?
[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:39.200]  So even though info horse told the police this was going on, they still didn't believe
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:40.200]  us.
[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:44.680]  But now I guess they believe it since they've seen it for themselves.
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:48.320]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:52.480]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.760]  people to starve to death and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:54:57.760]  world.

[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:22.840]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.

[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:30.280]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:35.280]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.

[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:48.840]  Never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at infowarstore.com.
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:57:11.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:17.880]  From Tunisia to Italy to Greece to Thailand and all parts beyond, humanity is pushing
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:24.280]  back against the botched overreach agenda, targeting our fundamental individual rights
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:30.200]  threatened by the COVID hypocrisy.
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:39.240]  The police are standing down and joining protesters in some protests while delivering
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:42.360]  the brutal totalitarian bidding in others.
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:47.680]  Meanwhile, the leaders of the crackdown on human freedom reveal their own incompetence
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:48.680]  and detachment.
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:58:15.480]  If you want to participate in X, Y or activities, you've got to show you're vaccinated.
[1:58:15.480 --> 1:58:24.120]  So back in the United States, the message from the Biden administration has driven
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:29.280]  those expressing their First Amendment to be beaten in the street by the zombies of
[1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:30.280]  Marxism.
[1:58:30.280 --> 1:58:36.600]  So as a child survivor of the Nazi reign of terror, I learned indelible lessons about
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:39.440]  the nature of evil.
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:46.240]  I know the consequences of being stigmatized and demonized as a spreader of disease.
[1:58:46.240 --> 1:58:56.480]  We were required, as Germans know, to wear a yellow star of David to identify us, to
[1:58:56.480 --> 1:59:04.520]  segregate Jews, exclusionary laws barred the family from normal life, from attending ordinary
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:07.520]  activities.
[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:10.400]  Our property was impounded.
[1:59:10.400 --> 1:59:17.520]  We were forbidden to participate in all educational, religious, cultural gatherings.
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:21.480]  Travel was forbidden for Jews, so there was no escape.
[1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:30.440]  These painful memories from my childhood sensitized me to the threat posed by current restrictive
[1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:32.200]  government dictates.
[1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:38.040]  Under the Nazi regime, moral norms were systematically obliterated.
[1:59:38.040 --> 1:59:42.840]  The medical profession and institutions were radically transformed.
[1:59:42.840 --> 1:59:49.640]  Academic science, the military, industry and clinical medicine were tightly interwoven
[1:59:49.640 --> 1:59:52.000]  as they are now.
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:56.240]  Consider the question of what would be ideal from the perspective of the pharmaceutical
[1:59:56.240 --> 1:59:58.040]  industry at the moment.
[1:59:58.040 --> 2:00:03.760]  It would be ideal if vaccines were recommended for all people, irrespective of their age,
[2:00:03.760 --> 2:00:08.480]  irrespective of whether they had already had COVID-19, and irrespective of whether or not
[2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:09.760]  they were pregnant.
[2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:14.560]  And it would be essential that there were no safe and effective alternatives to the vaccine,
[2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:18.600]  because if there were safe and effective alternatives, the emergency use authorizations
[2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:21.920]  that allow the administration of the vaccines would evaporate.
[2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:24.280]  I've been through outbreak after outbreak.
[2:00:24.280 --> 2:00:29.720]  I've never seen anything like this integration, harmonization and enforcement.
[2:00:29.720 --> 2:00:37.680]  I mean, it is overtly authoritarian, and it's coming down from above, and it's coordinated,
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:44.800]  and they've developed a bunch of different vehicles to reinforce this dominant narrative
[2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:50.560]  and make it so that no other information is available to people, so that people behave
[2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:56.920]  the way that the Health and Human Services and World Health Organization want them to
[2:00:56.920 --> 2:00:57.920]  behave.
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:00.720]  This is behavior control.
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:03.000]  It's really PsiOps is what's happening.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:08.400]  It's applied psychological operations to control people and their behavior so that they will
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:14.800]  accept these products, which are still experimental, based on technology that has never been deployed
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:16.480]  at this level.
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:22.800]  And as the data are coming out, it's becoming more and more clear that these products are
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:24.960]  not completely safe.
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.720]  Before you got sick, if you would have had a chance to get the vaccine and prevent this,
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:30.720]  would you have taken the vaccine?
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:31.720]  No.
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:32.720]  So you would have gone through this.
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:33.720]  I've gone through this.
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:34.720]  Yes, sir.
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:36.680]  Don't shove it down my throat.
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:44.920]  That's what's local, state, federal administration is trying to do, to shove it down your throat.
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  What are they shoving?
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:49.080]  No, they're shoving the fact that that's their agenda.
[2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:50.680]  John Bound reporting.
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:00.480]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:01.480]  Go ahead.
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:02.480]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:03.480]  Good, bro.
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:04.480]  Great last caller.
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:06.480]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:11.480]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:12.480]  and absurdity.
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:14.480]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:16.040]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:17.040]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:18.040]  Go ahead.
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:19.040]  Hey, Alex.
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:20.040]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:22.320]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:23.960]  The X2 does wonders.
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:26.360]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:29.200]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:31.200]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:32.200]  Thanks for holding.
[2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:33.200]  Go ahead.
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:34.200]  Hey, Alex.
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:35.200]  It's great to be on with you.
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:36.200]  It's an honor.
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:37.200]  Honored to talk to you.
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:38.200]  Awesome.
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:42.200]  So, personally, I wanted to do is say I love the product, alpha power, even at 29.
[2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:47.040]  She asked my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:48.040]  for a few of you.
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:49.040]  Well, it definitely works.
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:50.040]  It's not a joke.
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:51.040]  Absolutely.
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:03:05.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Shroyer.
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:25.440]  We're now into hour number three of the Alex Jones show today.
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:33.600]  We're going to have a special report coming up from Alex Jones here at the bottom of the
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:35.520]  hour.
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:41.000]  Let me just pivot onto this because I've got more vaccine news, but I think we get the
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:44.200]  point on that for the most part.
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:48.000]  Well, now I'm looking at this stack over here.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:54.600]  Still some pretty big stuff there, but let me just turn my attention over to this stack
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:04:00.160]  of news, which is the other big story for today, and that's the big Democrat show hearing
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:05.360]  that went on yesterday, and ask yourself this.
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:13.640]  Ask yourself this, why did they find it necessary to do the January 6th show hearing yesterday,
[2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:19.560]  even though they've already arrested 550 people, thrown them into the Democrat gulags, and
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:20.720]  are torturing them right now?
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.440]  Yes, the Democrats have political prisoners that they're torturing right now.
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:28.760]  That's your loving, tolerant, anti-police state Democrat party that has political prisoners
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:33.120]  being tortured in jail right now, but why?
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:41.680]  Why would they be doing this?
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:49.000]  And I have the answer now, and I thought I had this video clip, but perhaps I don't.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:53.080]  That's okay because I know what was said anyway.
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:59.280]  So the anti-Trump Black Lives Matter Democrat activist police officer, who also has major
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:04.840]  Democrat attorneys representing them, who has also been pictured with Nancy Pelosi,
[2:05:04.840 --> 2:05:10.760]  who wears all the Democrat propaganda, who tweeted in support of the riots in the summer
[2:05:10.760 --> 2:05:13.960]  of 2020, officer Dunn.
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:26.960]  You don't have a more phony, lying dirtbag in the DC police as officer Harry Dunn.
[2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:28.640]  He is the worst.
[2:05:28.640 --> 2:05:33.960]  That's why the Democrats selected him to be the voice box of the big lie from January
[2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:34.960]  6th.
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:39.000]  And he says he gets called the N-word, but doesn't produce the body cam video evidence,
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:41.760]  audio evidence, because he made that up too.
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:46.600]  He's the Jussie Smollett of the DC police force.
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:50.940]  And it's so pathetic that they don't even hide who he is.
[2:05:50.940 --> 2:05:55.640]  You can still go see all of his anti-cop tweets.
[2:05:55.640 --> 2:05:59.120]  You can go see all of his Democrat party tweets.
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:01.960]  You can see that his lawyer is a top Democrat lawyer.
[2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:04.320]  You can see him hanging out with Nancy Pelosi.
[2:06:04.320 --> 2:06:08.400]  They don't even hide it, and I've got the receipts right here.
[2:06:08.400 --> 2:06:10.600]  And I'll get to that in a second.
[2:06:10.600 --> 2:06:21.880]  But he was the one that made the analogy, and he said, if somebody hires a hit man,
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:28.040]  if somebody hires a hit man to commit murder, not only is the murderer the one that made
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:32.680]  the hit arrested and charged, but so is the one that hired the hit man.
[2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:33.960]  And of course, what is he saying?
[2:06:33.960 --> 2:06:38.280]  He says that the January 6th protesters were sent there by a hit man, and that hit man is
[2:06:38.280 --> 2:06:40.480]  Donald Trump.
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:42.320]  That's what this is really all about now.
[2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:47.760]  So this isn't even about January 6th, this hearing.
[2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:49.560]  They already have all their political prisoners.
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:52.120]  They already have hundreds of more that they plan on arresting.
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:58.480]  They'll have thousands of people rotting in jail cells being tortured by Democrats before
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:06:59.680]  this is all said and done.
[2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:00.680]  That's their plan.
[2:07:00.680 --> 2:07:05.680]  The Democrat party's gone full Nazi, rounding up the Jews, except in this case, it's Trump
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:06.680]  supporters.
[2:07:06.680 --> 2:07:08.520]  And they all fake cry up there, too.
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:11.880]  It's all fake, it's all theater.
[2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:16.800]  And the only reason they had those hearings yesterday is because they're trying to bring
[2:07:16.800 --> 2:07:19.720]  it back to Donald Trump.
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:22.760]  And they want to charge Donald Trump with murder for it.
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:25.880]  That's why they lied about Officer Sicknick yesterday.
[2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:29.840]  That's why they continue to tell the big lie that Trump supporters murdered somebody that
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:33.040]  day when that's not what happened.
[2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:36.280]  And by the way, they remember how they lied and said it was armed, and there were people
[2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:37.280]  with guns.
[2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:38.280]  That was a lie.
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:40.520]  They lied about that.
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:45.840]  So they really just want to, they want this to end up with charges on Donald Trump.
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:47.080]  That's what this is really all about.
[2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:50.680]  They're afraid that Donald Trump may run again.
[2:07:50.680 --> 2:07:55.320]  They're afraid that they can't bring him in in the Southern District of New York or with
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:00.920]  the corrupt New York Attorney General or all these corrupt DAs and PAs that they have in
[2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:03.840]  New York paid for with Soros.
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:07.080]  And so they're afraid they're not going to be able to arrest Trump and end Trump with
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:09.480]  their corrupt law enforcement in New York.
[2:08:09.480 --> 2:08:16.280]  So now they're going with the D.C. January 6th angle, bringing back all their big lies.
[2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:20.160]  And they hope that this eventually will be blamed on Trump and that that means they can
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:23.280]  arrest Trump for the whole thing inciting an insurrection.
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:26.760]  That's what they really want, if not murder.
[2:08:26.760 --> 2:08:29.160]  That's what this is really all about.
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:33.280]  They've already got all their arrests and thousands of more political arrests planned
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:35.040]  in the future.
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:39.280]  They've already got the full force and power of law enforcement to go after all their political
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:40.680]  enemies.
[2:08:40.680 --> 2:08:45.040]  They've already gone full oppressive, full authoritarian, full tyrannical regime as far
[2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:48.360]  as the Democrat Party is concerned against Trump supporters.
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:51.480]  But now they want Trump.
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:53.200]  And that's what this is all about.
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:58.320]  And that's why all the police officers that you saw up there who are who are in are a
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  shame to the badge, who are a shame to the uniform.
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:07.160]  These police officers are an embarrassment to the uniform, to the badge, and to the United
[2:09:07.160 --> 2:09:08.480]  States of America.
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:13.800]  But their Democrat Party operatives, they hate Donald Trump, they hate America, so they're
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:16.400]  down with the program.
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:18.000]  So that's what this is all about.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.600]  Their hatred for Donald Trump, their hatred for America, and they think that this is going
[2:09:23.600 --> 2:09:28.920]  to be their big come up moment to finally arrest Donald Trump.
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:31.840]  That's what this is all about.
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:38.280]  And so, but let's go to the receipts now.
[2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:41.080]  Let's go to the receipts now.
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:47.560]  And of course, I'll show you how, I mean, it's not, it's unintentional irony.
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:49.800]  Are the cops good or are the cops bad?
[2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:55.040]  Because for 364 days of the year, according to the Democrat Party in the left, the cops
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:56.600]  are bad.
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:01.080]  But yesterday, the cops were good because they had their right corrupt cops saying the
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:03.360]  things they wanted to say on national TV.
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:05.360]  So for one day, the cops were good.
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:10.520]  Or I guess the cops were maybe good on January 6th, too, maybe, I don't know.
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:15.000]  The cops are only good when they're working for a Democrat Party agenda.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:16.800]  Every other day of the year, the cops are bad.
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:20.280]  Kill a cop, murder a cop, kill a pig, whatever, the Democrats are all behind it.
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:24.520]  But oh, when they can use cops for their message, then they love cops all of a sudden.
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:26.120]  But I digress.
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:32.800]  We have all the receipts here from all of these corrupt police officers, but specifically
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:37.360]  the one that they really liked using up there, Officer Harry Dunn.
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:44.160]  So here's the big Democrat lawyer, Mark Zayed, who had all, who tried to do all kinds of
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:48.080]  cases against Donald Trump, took a bunch of L's, but he's still there.
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:53.800]  Very proud of my Capitol Police officers, Dunn and Gannel today, as well as Fanon and
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:54.800]  Hodges.
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:58.280]  They call for defending democracy as they stole the election.
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:02.200]  So they steal the election, and then they lie to the American people about it, and this
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:05.520]  corrupt lawyer says that it's all good.
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:19.400]  But here's the receipts for Officer Harry Dunn.
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:24.360]  He says he supported the riots in Kenosha, said, why is murder an appropriate response
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:28.920]  to property damage, but property damage isn't appropriate response to murder?
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:30.200]  So he doesn't stand with the police.
[2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:31.560]  He's not a police officer.
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:33.880]  He's a Democrat party operative.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:39.320]  He celebrates the riots in Kenosha that led to multiple people being shot and killed,
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:42.280]  and including police officers being injured.
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:44.160]  And he says it's an appropriate response.
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:51.120]  What happened in Kenosha was an appropriate response.
[2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:59.000]  Here's Officer Harry Dunn celebrating when Donald Trump had to be rushed off the stage
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:04.680]  during a campaign event because a radical leftist charged the stage and threatened to
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:05.760]  kill him.
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:08.000]  There's Harry Dunn celebrating that right here.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  Here he is celebrating Donald Trump being rushed off the stage because a deranged leftist
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  attacked him.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.440]  Again, this is not a police officer.
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:19.040]  This is a Democrat party operative.
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:23.200]  Here's Harry Dunn denying that Trump ever won the election and saying, nope, it was
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:29.560]  actually Trump lost, but Obama's my real president.
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:35.120]  Here he is saying how racist America is, saying Trump's racist, saying how he stands with
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:37.520]  Ilhan Omar.
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:40.120]  Here he is attacking Donald Trump again.
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:44.600]  Again, I mean, I have all the receipts here, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:46.120]  Just understand.
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:49.200]  Harry Dunn is not a police officer.
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:53.600]  Harry Dunn is a Democrat party activist that the Democrats have launched against Donald
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:54.600]  Trump.
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:13:02.480]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its
[2:13:02.480 --> 2:13:05.600]  criminals are extremely pathological.
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:09.520]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again and criminals
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:13.840]  like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:21.440]  Well, guess what, it was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist's globalist that ran the rollout
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:25.800]  of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:31.680]  people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:36.120]  go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:41.480]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:42.480]  the road.
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:46.560]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:51.880]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:54.160]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:57.320]  But I'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service.
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:03.240]  I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:08.200]  United States and sources of materials all over North America and from Africa as well,
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:09.200]  which he's proud of.
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:12.800]  He would get the good cotton and then they put it together here in the United States.
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:15.760]  And that is Mike Lindell.
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:17.280]  Mike Lindell is a patriot.
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:18.880]  Mike Lindell is fighting.

[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:13.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:17.640]  I come to you with very grave news, but at least now the enemy's out in the open.
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:22.320]  We've confirmed all over the world the United Nations is directing a program to arrest people
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:28.280]  who refuse to be inoculated with the experimental Nuremberg violating COVID-19, so-called vaccines.
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:33.120]  Yes, they're now coming to begin arresting us and taking us to giant emergency centers
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:34.920]  that have been built all over the world.
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:16:04.760]  This is the new world order out on the open.
[2:16:04.760 --> 2:16:14.440]  You know, they're informed about the side effects of the vaccine, a lot of people don't
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:15.440]  want it.
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:18.880]  You know, a lot of people are getting it just because they feel forced to and people
[2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:28.280]  that do not want it, they're being put into detention camps.
[2:16:28.280 --> 2:16:30.840]  The plan of tyrants is always simple.
[2:16:30.840 --> 2:16:33.920]  Have complete power and control over the population.
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:37.840]  And if you have the power to target anybody you want the population and claim that somehow
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:42.800]  they're a criminal or somehow they're diseased, then you truly have set up a dictatorship.
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:46.480]  And that's what's happening now, a worldwide medical dictatorship.
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:50.400]  It's now being confirmed across the world under UN Directives.
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:54.960]  New lockdowns have begun that are starving to people en masse by the tens of millions.
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:59.920]  The last lockdown already starved over 20 million extra people the UN admits with an
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:05.200]  additional 280 plus million set to starve to death once this new lockdown gets going.
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:08.400]  So in the first world, we just sit at home and watch Netflix and get deeper debt.
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:14.000]  But that's just part of the new huge breaking developments taking place across this planet.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:20.720]  Under again United Nations Directives in Australia, in Canada, in the UK, in Germany, in France
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:22.360]  and many other areas.
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:27.320]  They are arresting people by the thousands and thousands and thousands because their
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:32.720]  smartphone had secret government and other apps on it that claims they came in contact
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:36.680]  or may have come in contact with someone with COVID-19.
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:40.720]  And so the government shows up at your house, takes you in a van to a quarantine center
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:46.800]  for a week, two weeks, three weeks, sometimes longer and in many cases forces medical treatments
[2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:47.800]  on you.
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:49.840]  This is what the UN said a year ago was the Holy Grail.
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:53.880]  Dr. Ryan, the head of the UN Rapid Reaction Force said, we want to go in the houses where
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:56.520]  the COVID is and take these families out.
[2:17:56.520 --> 2:18:05.360]  It is a more cost-effective intervention to separate some individuals from society than
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:08.520]  separate everybody in society from each other.
[2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:14.200]  However, where there is not a good handle, where there hasn't been a good understanding
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:20.400]  of disease transmission, where enough has not been invested in core public health interventions
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:25.840]  such as case finding and contact tracing, then social distancing measures may be your
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:29.640]  only option to create distance between individuals.
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:35.200]  I'm also announcing the formation of strike force seasons, which will see 22 detectives
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:41.120]  work from now until whenever it concludes identifying as many people as possible who
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:45.160]  attended today's incident and have them charged.
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:50.880]  President will outline five areas his team is focused on to get more Americans vaccinated.
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:56.120]  One targeted community by community door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:19:00.520]  by ensuring they have the information they need on how both safe and accessible the vaccine
[2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:01.520]  is.
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:08.080]  By partnering with local leaders, governors, mayors, doctors, school administrators, employers,
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:16.320]  faith leaders, and community organizers, leaders that people know and trust, one shot
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:19.160]  at a time, one person at a time.
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:21.080]  You need to react quickly.
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:22.760]  You need to go after the virus.
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:24.840]  You need to stop the change of transmission.
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:27.480]  You need to engage with communities very deeply.
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:29.320]  Community acceptance is hugely important.
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:30.480]  You need to be coordinated.
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:31.920]  You need to be coherent.
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:36.560]  You need to look at the other sectoral impacts of schools and security and economic.
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:42.880]  That's one of the reasons we initiated these strike forces to go into communities and work
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:47.880]  with them to determine what they need, to take a localized, specific approach that works
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:49.720]  with elected officials and communities.
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:53.560]  Meantime, cities and counties are staffing strike teams to help vaccinate people who
[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:57.160]  cannot get to clinics and drive through sites on their own.
[2:19:57.160 --> 2:20:00.160]  King Fives' Ted Lantonite followed a crew from the Seattle Fire Department.
[2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:01.160]  He joins us live.
[2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:05.200]  And, Ted, we're hearing that they're working seven days a week on this, right?
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:11.400]  Yeah, Mark, that's what it takes to vaccinate the most at-risk patients as quickly as possible.
[2:20:11.400 --> 2:20:13.920]  You have to go right to their homes.
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:17.280]  Anyone who's involved in emergency response will know this.
[2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:23.400]  If you need to be right before you move, you will never win.
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:28.040]  Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.
[2:20:28.040 --> 2:20:30.640]  Speed trumps perfection.
[2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:35.840]  Even though they know it's based on the PCR test, it's almost 100 percent false positives.
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:40.080]  They can then again turn it up to any level they want to disappear whoever they want,
[2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:41.680]  and then it gets worse.
[2:20:41.680 --> 2:20:47.520]  This is then used as their entire contact tracing system as the basis of a worldwide surveillance
[2:20:47.520 --> 2:20:53.120]  system and a social credit score in Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' own words to track
[2:20:53.120 --> 2:20:58.360]  and trace every purchase you make and everything you do, and to charge you carbon credits on
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:20:59.360]  a carbon allotment.
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:01.000]  So, understand this.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.840]  They are arresting people all over the world because the computer or the contact tracing
[2:21:05.840 --> 2:21:11.200]  system, which EPS claims you got near somebody, while borders of the U.S. and Europe are
[2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:14.320]  wide open to influxes of people who aren't even being tested.
[2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:18.640]  Now, all of that's huge news, but here is the biggest news.
[2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:24.520]  We have confirmed that in France, and we have confirmed that in areas of northern Europe,
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:29.360]  they are telling the general population that if you do not take the so-called COVID inoculation
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:33.560]  that is an experimental vaccine that violates the Nuremberg code, you won't just be locked
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:34.560]  in your house.
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:35.660]  You won't just have your kids taken.
[2:21:35.660 --> 2:21:38.080]  You won't just not be able to go to your job.
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:39.680]  This is what they're saying on CNN.
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:42.960]  You don't want to do it here in the United States, what Governor Newsom is saying.
[2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:43.960]  No.
[2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:47.040]  They're saying they're going to take you and indefinitely lock you up in a facility because
[2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:50.720]  you're a dangerous spreader because you didn't let them take over your immune system and
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:55.400]  put this into your body when it's experimental and they've had to put advisories on it that
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:57.400]  causes blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes.
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:21:58.960]  I mean, this is it.
[2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:02.600]  Everything we always said, they'll release a virus, they'll create fear, they'll promote
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:03.600]  forced inoculations.
[2:22:03.600 --> 2:22:09.240]  So, I'm here at Lake Tahoe on a workcation and doing a lot of research, meeting a lot
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:14.880]  of people, went out fishing and swimming yesterday, rented a boat with a captain, and he began
[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:18.800]  to tell me about his family in Europe, because he was born in Northern Europe and lives here
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:24.640]  most of his life, that is being told, you will go to a code facility if you do not take
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:25.640]  these injections.
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:29.240]  And then, of course, the injections don't work because the tests are all fake.
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:31.960]  People are still going to get cold, still going to get flu, so it's an endless problem
[2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:32.960]  that can never be defeated.
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:38.440]  And then I'll show you a clip out of France where, again, they're beta testing it on 20-somethings,
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:43.160]  locking them up as well just because they claim that the tracker system on their phone
[2:22:43.160 --> 2:22:44.920]  claims they came in contact with someone.
[2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:49.240]  This is the perfect pretext for roundup, for control, and for total surveillance, and it's
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:50.840]  not coming, it's here.
[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:54.240]  And the second lockdowns are being announced around the world and being prepared here in
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:55.240]  the United States.
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:57.280]  We never really left the main lockdown.
[2:22:57.280 --> 2:23:02.100]  If they get us back into phase two, we will never leave it, it will only get more intense.
[2:23:02.100 --> 2:23:04.440]  That is the United Nations and the globalist unplanned.
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:07.720]  So please, take this report, research it for yourself, and understand.
[2:23:07.720 --> 2:23:10.760]  We must declare independence against medical apartheid.
[2:23:10.760 --> 2:23:15.200]  We must declare independence against medical dictatorship and tyranny, and the Fortune
[2:23:15.200 --> 2:23:19.080]  100 corporations that control the UN and the media that are selling this giant lie.
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:21.120]  It is science to ask questions.
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:23.160]  It is science to have medical choices.
[2:23:23.160 --> 2:23:28.120]  It is science that it's my body, my choice, and what they're doing is a revolution of
[2:23:28.120 --> 2:23:30.000]  genetic engineering against humanity.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:33.280]  So please, get this report out to everyone you know and understand.
[2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:34.280]  Lockdown two is here.
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:37.840]  It's already starving the third world to death and impoverishing us, and if we don't
[2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:41.480]  stand up and say no and declare independence against us, we get what we deserve.
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:55.120]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the Info War.
[2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:57.120]  Your voice counts.
[2:23:57.120 --> 2:24:02.120]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:24:02.120 --> 2:24:04.720]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:06.240]  They know you're angry.
[2:24:06.240 --> 2:24:10.520]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:11.520]  we've got.
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:15.760]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can
[2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:20.000]  then take those alerts, those articles, and those live feeds, both the regular shows and
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.440]  special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:41.720]  Or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:46.200]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:53.760]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:24:56.680]  The Bio Security State is here.
[2:24:56.680 --> 2:25:02.600]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:07.720]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the Communist dictatorship
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:13.480]  of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:19.160]  for every person in the country all the way out to 2024, and that in 2024, you will again
[2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:25.080]  take two shots, and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:26.800]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:28.960]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:33.280]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:34.280]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:39.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf, Alois
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:43.080]  Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:44.080]  in Germany.
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:45.880]  And full wars will continue to set fast.
[2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:46.880]  They fight this.
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:47.880]  I don't know how long we can.
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:50.840]  The enemy's coming for us all now, and God bless, and good luck.
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:53.440]  I would again get right with God right now.
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:57.760]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long, because they're supercomputers
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:01.800]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:05.760]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:10.280]  I still have one, because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:15.480]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:17.360]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:20.040]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:26.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off $14.95.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:29.320]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:35.560]  We've got a private label within Full Wars on them for $14.95, because I want you to
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:40.320]  get them, and I want you to buy friends and family, these systems, to educate them about
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:42.280]  what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:45.320]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:48.240]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:50.560]  not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:53.520]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:57.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room, and I am very
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:01.560]  excited about our latest supplement addition to infowarstore.com.
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:07.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time,
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:12.600]  and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com.
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:15.680]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:21.120]  According to this, organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:26.960]  cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:30.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:34.600]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health, and we've packed
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:38.840]  it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:42.640]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:47.480]  I suggest that you do the same thing, and right now, it's at an introductory price
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:55.880]  of $19.95 that's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:28:13.880]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:19.680]  Listeners and viewers know that I'm on vacation, and believe me, I want to be on vacation, but
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:21.280]  I can't be.
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:26.760]  Because even the nice boat we rented, the nice captain driving it, has incredible reports
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:31.520]  of people being put in detention centers who are refusing the vaccine.
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:36.160]  He doesn't want to be on camera, and I actually went online and looked up the fact that the
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:39.000]  government of this country was proposing this just two weeks ago.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.280]  Well, what they propose is what they're already doing, and remember the UN said a year and
[2:28:42.280 --> 2:28:46.920]  a half ago, we want to go in people's houses and take their children and others away.
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:48.800]  They want that ultimate power of control.
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:53.200]  These are not regular vaccines, it violates the Nuremberg code, this is so insane, and
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:56.000]  this gentleman is from Scandinavia.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.120]  He's lived here in the United States most of his life.
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:02.080]  His family in Denmark right now that are calling him, telling him this information.
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:06.160]  So we're just going to shoot him from the side here, and he's going to lay out the
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:08.720]  information that he is learning and what he's finding out.
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:12.880]  So please tell us what is unfolding in your home country.
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:18.200]  So yeah, people that are refusing the vaccine are being put into camps.
[2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:19.200]  It's unbelievable.
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:24.200]  There's no, there's no sense or rhyme or reason to it, you know, I don't know what to say.
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:25.200]  It's a...
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:26.200]  Well, I mean, tell us...
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:27.200]  I'm happy I'm not over there.
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:30.720]  Tell us about your family, what they're telling you is happening.
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:35.120]  You know, they're informed about the side effects of the vaccine, a lot of people don't
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:36.120]  want it.
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:39.680]  You know, a lot of people are getting it just because they feel forced to, and people that
[2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:43.920]  do not want it, they're being put into detention camps.
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:48.640]  And when they call you up specifically, what do they say?
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:53.760]  They're saying that they pretty much are being manipulated into getting the vaccine.
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:30:00.520]  You know, there's a lot of alternate motivation, you know, and behind getting it, there's travel
[2:30:00.520 --> 2:30:05.080]  restrictions, travel bans, people that don't have it, certain areas that you can go in
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:06.920]  that you can't go in.
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:07.920]  What are the details?
[2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:11.120]  They say people they know are being taken to camps?
[2:30:11.120 --> 2:30:13.240]  Not currently, but that's just kind of where it's going.
[2:30:13.240 --> 2:30:17.200]  You know, that's the pressure that they're feeling.
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:20.440]  So are they specifically being told you'll be sent to camps?
[2:30:20.440 --> 2:30:21.440]  Exactly.
[2:30:21.440 --> 2:30:24.720]  Because that won't put words in your mouth, specifically, you told me that's what they're
[2:30:24.720 --> 2:30:26.640]  saying is starting to happen.
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:27.640]  Specifically what are they saying?
[2:30:27.640 --> 2:30:29.280]  This is important.
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:31.440]  People that are not vaccinated will be put into camps.
[2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:32.880]  So that's what they're currently telling them?
[2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:33.880]  Yep.
[2:30:33.880 --> 2:30:34.880]  Exactly.
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:35.880]  Is this on the news or?
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:38.080]  I don't, you know, I'm not sure.
[2:30:38.080 --> 2:30:41.480]  This is, it's just, right now it's just talk, it's just hearsay.
[2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:45.280]  And that's how authoritarianism works is a year ago was when we might not let you go
[2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:46.280]  to stores.
[2:30:46.280 --> 2:30:48.240]  Now it's, oh, we are going to basically lock you up.
[2:30:48.240 --> 2:30:49.240]  We need mandates.
[2:30:49.240 --> 2:30:51.400]  I mean, this is all over the world with you and directing it.
[2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:52.400]  Yep.
[2:30:52.400 --> 2:30:53.400]  Exactly.
[2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:54.400]  Yeah.
[2:30:54.400 --> 2:30:55.400]  What does your family think of this?
[2:30:55.400 --> 2:30:56.900]  I mean, they're still not going to get vaccinated.
[2:30:56.900 --> 2:31:00.760]  You know, they're going to do everything they can to avoid, avoid all that.
[2:31:00.760 --> 2:31:04.760]  You know, it's to them, it's a life or a matter of life and death.
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:09.280]  And you know, well, my point is this is an assault on people.
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:14.320]  This is experimental, it violates international and national law and it's got all these side
[2:31:14.320 --> 2:31:15.320]  effects.
[2:31:15.320 --> 2:31:17.520]  Now they've got the PCR tests, this fake and all these side effects.
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:20.520]  And then it turns out India is not even 10% vaccinated because they know what's going
[2:31:20.520 --> 2:31:21.520]  on.
[2:31:21.520 --> 2:31:22.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:31:22.520 --> 2:31:27.560]  There's no proof, you know, there's, there's no proof that this is helping anyone.
[2:31:27.560 --> 2:31:29.920]  It's, you know, a lot of people are dying.
[2:31:29.920 --> 2:31:34.720]  You can't even really look up, you know, the death rate for, you know, if you try to look
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:39.200]  up online, how many people have died from the, from the vaccine, you know, you can't,
[2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:40.520]  it's hard to even find a straight answer.
[2:31:40.520 --> 2:31:41.520]  Here's an example.
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:43.000]  Last week, it's an official graph.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:49.560]  The mayor of Austin put a graph up saying 100% of Austin by the fall will be in intensive
[2:31:49.560 --> 2:31:50.560]  care.
[2:31:50.560 --> 2:31:52.200]  Well, I thought half Austin took the shot.
[2:31:52.200 --> 2:31:53.920]  You have everybody else as a taken.
[2:31:53.920 --> 2:31:57.680]  It's a way to terrorize and have total control and make us take in our bodies what they want
[2:31:57.680 --> 2:31:58.680]  when they want.
[2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:00.120]  And it's all based on giant lies.
[2:32:00.120 --> 2:32:01.120]  Yeah.
[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:04.760]  People that are refusing the vaccine are being put into camps.
[2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:11.880]  These facilities that are, you know, trying to, trying to separate the, the, the people
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:16.600]  that think for themselves and the people that are manipulated by their government, you
[2:32:16.600 --> 2:32:20.320]  know, it's, it's, it's a crazy thing.
[2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:24.200]  And I feel like it's not the, not the last of it, I feel like it's going to spread,
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:29.720]  you know, hopefully it gets, hopefully people catch on, you know, and start thinking for
[2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:35.160]  themselves, but honestly, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.
[2:32:35.160 --> 2:32:41.800]  Think media has complete control of everyone at this point and it's a, yeah, it's a wild
[2:32:41.800 --> 2:32:42.800]  world.
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:46.960]  How surreal is it to get calls from your family like that?
[2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:50.120]  I mean, it's hard to believe, honestly, it's hard to believe that that's happening in,
[2:32:50.120 --> 2:32:51.120]  in Scandinavia.
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:59.960]  You know, it's, I've been in Denmark and seems to be a pretty free, free state for the most
[2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:03.200]  part, but to hear that that's happening, a place where, you know, our friends and family
[2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:05.040]  live in, it's hard to believe.
[2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:09.000]  Well, the Rockefeller Foundation, the last 50 years, studied things and figured out the
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:13.760]  way to have an authoritarian takeover would be a virus or a medical tyranny and a big
[2:33:13.760 --> 2:33:14.760]  panic.
[2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:18.040]  And they wrote a plan 11 years ago called Operation Walk Step that predicted all this.
[2:33:18.040 --> 2:33:22.720]  And now the Rockefeller Foundation is in full control of the US COVID response and the UN.
[2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:26.440]  Bill Gates was their front man, but they've removed him now and they're in direct command.
[2:33:26.440 --> 2:33:28.880]  Yeah, I buy that 100%.
[2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:33.600]  Well, I just feel sorry for the average hardworking American.
[2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:37.880]  It's just out here trying to have a good time and has no idea what's creeping up on them.
[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:40.080]  That's why they put the lockdown on and took it off.
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:43.120]  So the next time we think, oh, the new lockdown is okay, it'll go away.
[2:33:43.120 --> 2:33:47.040]  But no, the next lockdown is going to be permanent, ladies and gentlemen, in fact, in Canada,
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:49.880]  many other areas, it's all ready, permanent.
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:51.440]  I appreciate you taking time to talk to us.
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:53.240]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:54.240]  I think that's it.
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:59.600]  You know, just we'd tell people to think for themselves, you know, look things up.
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:04.160]  Just don't, don't trust media and, you know, don't, don't put poison in your body if you
[2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:06.760]  don't, if you're not sure what it is.
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:07.760]  That's a damn good advice.
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:10.040]  You were saying your family's really concerned about the side effects, which I think are
[2:34:10.040 --> 2:34:11.040]  the main effects.
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  Exactly.
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:16.200]  Yeah, it's, I mean, that's, that's exactly why they're, they're advising everybody to
[2:34:16.200 --> 2:34:17.200]  get it.
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:19.480]  It's not, if they cared about your health, they wouldn't motivate you with doughnuts
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:22.120]  and talk, free tacos for getting vaccinated.
[2:34:22.120 --> 2:34:23.120]  Absolutely.
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:26.040]  I mean, just see how beautiful everything is out here.
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:29.120]  And folks have to understand to protect all the freedom our forebears fought for.
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:31.800]  We've got to stand up now, in my view.
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:32.800]  Absolutely.
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:33.800]  Thanks for talking to us, sir.
[2:34:33.800 --> 2:34:34.800]  The situation is absolutely tragic.
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:44.200]  You see, in the last month, through the French faith, without COVID, partying COVID,
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:51.080]  it's here that we take a number of young people who are not in contact, who are positive
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:57.520]  and that we place here, in these centers, of this establishment, which is an agricultural
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:04.200]  establishment that was converted for the occasion, a kind of golden prison, with, you see,
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:09.480]  the delimitations everywhere, with young people who have no right to go out, who are completely
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:11.640]  isolated from the rest of the establishment.
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:16.800]  There is, over there, on the other side, Pareti, young people, very young people.
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:19.800]  It's a holiday colony that would be in the right party over there.
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:25.400]  We are so dangerous, why do we put young people just next to COVID cases and positives?
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:29.920]  In any case, the positives here, the COVID cases, they have no right to go out, they
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:32.120]  have no right to see their families.
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:37.280]  So going out, it's going to take with tweezers, but you're going to see their contribution that
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:39.080]  we did, and we're going right away.
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:40.080]  I'll take you with me.
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:45.920]  And so, they are locked up here, there?
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:46.920]  COVID?
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:47.920]  Yes.
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:52.920]  The COVID of these quarantine zones has been requested by the state to make a quarantine
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:55.400]  zone for people who come back from vacations or what.
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:57.960]  Is it free of charge or not?
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:35:58.960]  No.
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:35:59.960]  No?
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:00.960]  No.
[2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:03.560]  No, even the colony is not free of charge.
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:04.560]  Really?
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:05.560]  No, we know.
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:06.560]  And why?
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:07.560]  Because of COVID.
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:13.280]  Because of COVID, we can see that there is COVID, here they are, they have to open the
[2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:14.280]  windows.
[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:15.280]  Not good?
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:16.280]  We can go in.
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:17.280]  Are you going to go in?
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:18.280]  Yes.
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:19.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:20.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:21.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:22.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:23.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:24.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:25.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:26.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:27.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:28.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:29.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:30.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:30.280 --> 2:36:31.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:32.280]  Go ahead.
[2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:52.240]  So here is COVID in day and night.
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:55.720]  What's this?
[2:36:55.720 --> 2:37:04.720]  in separate rooms, and he took it out to do sports, but with a mask if they are young.
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:06.720]  So they are young for the most part, right?
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:08.720]  Yes, yes, they are young.
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:11.720]  They were between 0 and 25 years old.
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:12.720]  They are not younger?
[2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:14.720]  No, not at all.
[2:37:14.720 --> 2:37:20.720]  They are not younger, because in here there are young people who are also much younger.
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:23.720]  Do you think they are young?
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:24.720]  No.
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:26.720]  And they have the right to see their parents and everything?
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:27.720]  No.
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:28.720]  They have no right to see their parents?
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:29.720]  No.
[2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:30.720]  So they are isolated from their parents?
[2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:31.720]  Yes.
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:32.720]  And they are placed here by the prefecture?
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:33.720]  Yes, all the time.
[2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:36.720]  It is the prefecture that decides to take them and to place them here?
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:37.720]  All the time.
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:39.720]  And they react like this?
[2:37:39.720 --> 2:37:41.720]  They are cut off from their parents?
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:42.720]  They do not see their parents?
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:43.720]  They do not see their family?
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:47.720]  When they are older, they do not see them.
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:50.720]  How long do they stay here?
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:55.720]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[2:37:55.720 --> 2:38:00.720]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:04.720]  And it has caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:11.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that is ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:14.720]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:22.720]  Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com, you get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com, but only for one more week.
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:25.720]  They have told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that is it.
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:31.720]  They will not do this sale again until November and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:32.720]  This is insurance you can eat.
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:40.720]  It is the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supply is all ready for you at infowarstore.com or call toll free.
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:43.720]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:49.720]  Again, infowarstore.com, 10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week.
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:51.720]  So take action now while you still can.
[2:38:53.720 --> 2:38:58.720]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:08.720]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:17.720]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves, worse than slaves.
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:25.720]  It is just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:28.720]  and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:34.720]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:38.720]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:42.720]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:47.720]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:51.720]  It is a spiritual battle and infowar is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:39:56.720]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet.
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:02.720]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:04.720]  I don't care about beating the new world order.
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:08.720]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:11.720]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:13.720]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:16.720]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end.
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:19.720]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:22.720]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:25.720]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:28.720]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:30.720]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:36.720]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:38.720]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:41.720]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:44.720]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:40:44.720 --> 2:40:47.720]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:52.720]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:40:58.720]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead.
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:00.720]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good.
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:04.720]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:10.720]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:12.720]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:15.720]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.720]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product.
[2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:22.720]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:26.720]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the infowar.
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:29.720]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:31.720]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:32.720]  Honor, talk to you.
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:39.720]  Awesome. So, personally, I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:45.720]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few years.
[2:41:45.720 --> 2:41:47.720]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:42:14.720]  Absolutely.
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:17.720]  It's been a week.
[2:42:17.720 --> 2:42:19.720]  And then it comes out again.
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:22.720]  And then there are tests.
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:23.720]  You have to do the tests.
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:27.720]  You have to do the tests and if they are negative, they can go back.
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:32.720]  And if they are positive, they stay.
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:35.720]  Because it seems that there are some who are there for a long time, we said.
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:37.720]  It's still not enough time.
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:48.720]  It all depends. If the person, she arrives, she is in contact and after a week, she is positive with Covid.
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:51.720]  She takes it for 10 days more.
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:53.720]  But after, we don't force them.
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:42:55.720]  She takes it for 10 days more.
[2:42:55.720 --> 2:42:56.720]  Yes, she is confined.
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:42:59.720]  It's still a term, a prison.
[2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:01.720]  No, but that's my term.
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:06.720]  And you, personally, how do you react to that? Do you think that's normal?
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:09.720]  Well, there is still a lot of respect.
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:12.720]  After, we do our work.
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:15.720]  But why do they stay here, not in their families?
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:19.720]  And that, they have to bring to the prefecture.
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:23.720]  And the profile of the young people who are here between 20 and 25 years old, what is that as a profile?
[2:43:23.720 --> 2:43:25.720]  It's students, it's people who are lost.
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:27.720]  It's people from the street.
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:28.720]  No, not at all.
[2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:32.720]  There, we had people who, it's young people who worked in Jean Camry.
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:37.720]  It seems that they could not see their families. So that confirms you that once they are here, they do not see their families?
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:40.720]  Ah, no. They can call them.
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:42.720]  Call them, but not to see them of course.
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:43.720]  No, not to see them.
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:44.720]  Ah, yes.
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:47.720]  I imagine that it must be tragic, like a situation, no?
[2:43:47.720 --> 2:43:50.720]  They are double-witted these young people today.
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:51.720]  Yes.
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:52.720]  They are double-witted these young people today.
[2:43:52.720 --> 2:43:53.720]  Yes, yes.
[2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:54.720]  They are double-witted these young people today.
[2:43:54.720 --> 2:43:55.720]  Yes, yes.
[2:43:55.720 --> 2:43:56.720]  They are double-witted these young people today.
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:43:57.720]  Yes, yes.
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:43:58.720]  No, but after, it's like that.
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:00.720]  And at the entrance, they told you that it would accelerate, of course.
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:02.720]  Yes, there, I do not know.
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:04.720]  Do you still plan an additional organization?
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:07.720]  There, they are making additional rooms and all that, or how it happens?
[2:44:07.720 --> 2:44:10.720]  There, I can not tell you because I do not have the responsible.
[2:44:10.720 --> 2:44:11.720]  Yes.
[2:44:11.720 --> 2:44:13.720]  And the responsible, what is it called?
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:15.720]  The responsible, it's called...
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:16.720]  Okay.
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:18.720]  And he works at Profecture, what is it?
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:20.720]  No, he works at the Red Cross.
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:21.720]  He works at the Red Cross?
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:22.720]  Yes.
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:23.720]  Because it is the Red Cross, in fact, that is called that?
[2:44:23.720 --> 2:44:25.720]  Yes, it is the Red Cross.
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:27.720]  It is a Red Cross center here?
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:28.720]  Yes.
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:32.720]  So it is the Red Cross that, under the orders of the architecture,
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:33.720]  orchestrates a little the whole.
[2:44:33.720 --> 2:44:34.720]  There you go.
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:35.720]  And tells people the whole.
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:38.720]  He will look for young people at home and bring them here, in fact.
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:39.720]  There you go.
[2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:41.720]  That's it, it's the Red Cross.
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:42.720]  Wow.
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:44.720]  Tell me, there you go.
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:46.720]  Still curious about this thing.
[2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:47.720]  I do not hide that...
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:49.720]  I do not know, but it's cool.
[2:44:49.720 --> 2:44:50.720]  Well, go ahead, Madame.
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:52.720]  Thank you very much, infinitely for your testimony.
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:53.720]  I am the salary.
[2:44:53.720 --> 2:44:54.720]  Yes, I imagine.
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:55.720]  Where is the salary?
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:44:56.720]  Oh la la.
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:44:58.720]  And they had to recruit people here?
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:44:59.720]  Or was it easy?
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:02.720]  Well, I do not want to say.
[2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:04.720]  But you, how did it happen?
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.720]  You presented your candidature.
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:08.720]  Well, I thought I was going to leave the land,
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:10.720]  and I'm going to work on the Red Cross.
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:11.720]  Ah, the Red Cross, right away?
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:12.720]  Yes.
[2:45:12.720 --> 2:45:14.720]  And they immediately looked for...
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:16.720]  You knew they were looking for young people?
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:17.720]  Yes, yes, that's it.
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:19.720]  And then, will they recruit other people?
[2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:21.720]  There are recruitments in court?
[2:45:21.720 --> 2:45:23.720]  No, I do not know.
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:24.720]  You do not know?
[2:45:24.720 --> 2:45:26.720]  No.
[2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:27.720]  Yes.
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:30.720]  And it's been open for a long time, this center, like that?
[2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:33.720]  Since last week.
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:34.720]  Since last week, it's been open?
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:36.720]  Yes, because I started last week.
[2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:37.720]  And before, it was closed.
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:38.720]  It was a high school high school.
[2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:39.720]  It was a high school high school here.
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:41.720]  It was once repositioned.
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:42.720]  Repositioned.
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:43.720]  That's it.
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:45.720]  That's the word that was first repositioned.
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:46.720]  Yes.
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:47.720]  For COVID patients.
[2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:50.720]  It was affected by that, under the Red Cross,
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:52.720]  with the years of prefecture.
[2:45:52.720 --> 2:45:53.720]  Yes.
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:54.720]  Very well, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:46:23.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:27.720]  I'm going to start the video there with the Alex Jones report.
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:31.720]  Is available at info wars.com.
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:37.720]  And I've got some other news when it comes to COVID that I can kind of clear up here,
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:42.720]  but this is going to be my final segment before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:46:42.720 --> 2:46:45.720]  And then I will be back hosting the war room,
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:49.720]  fulfilling my normal host duties from three to six p.m.
[2:46:49.720 --> 2:46:53.720]  So I'll get into more of this then.
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:57.720]  But you see, they had to the globalist,
[2:46:57.720 --> 2:47:09.720]  the new world order had to find a way to justify putting in internment camps,
[2:47:09.720 --> 2:47:13.720]  readying them for political distance and political prisoners.
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:17.720]  And COVID has been the perfect excuse for that.
[2:47:17.720 --> 2:47:23.720]  So just like all these other massive power grabs that COVID has resulted in,
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:26.720]  that's just yet another.
[2:47:26.720 --> 2:47:29.720]  And, you know, people see that and they're kind of like,
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:32.720]  oh, you know, that's an eye-opening thing.
[2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:36.720]  But you have to understand it's all been by design.
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:39.720]  And so, hey, you know, maybe now it's for unvaccinated people
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:41.720]  and some people will go along with it.
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:44.720]  And then later, hey, you didn't vote for this person.
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:47.720]  We're going to say you have some sort of a mental health problem.
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:50.720]  And so we're going to put you in there too.
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:53.720]  And, you know, the list is just going to go on and on and on.
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:55.720]  Any reason to throw you in.
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:47:59.720]  And that's why we have to stop this now.
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:01.720]  Must be stopped now.
[2:48:01.720 --> 2:48:08.720]  Let me just do this before we go to this last break here in the third hour.
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:13.720]  And then Paul Joseph Watson takes over because I didn't finish my coverage.
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:24.720]  From the sob story method acting January 6 hearing that went on yesterday.
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:32.720]  Here's just some of the headlines that prove that Democrats didn't care about police then
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:36.720]  and they don't care about police now.
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:41.720]  And the only reason why they brought those Capitol Police officers up there
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:44.720]  for the hearing is because they're not actually police officers.
[2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:48.720]  They're Democrat Party operatives and activists.
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:52.720]  And again, if you've been listening to me for a long time,
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:57.720]  you may recall when I've been in the DC jail multiple times
[2:48:57.720 --> 2:49:02.720]  and I get arrested for my political activism in DC.
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:07.720]  And again, I'll just tell you when I was brought in,
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:14.720]  when I was riding in on paddy wagons, when I was waiting and getting processed,
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:18.720]  when I was sitting in cells, I really don't even want to say this
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:21.720]  because I don't want to put a target on these officers back,
[2:49:21.720 --> 2:49:24.720]  but I mean, you deserve to know what's going on.
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:27.720]  I was told exactly what goes on and that there's essentially,
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:30.720]  I shouldn't say a civil war inside the DC police,
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:36.720]  but let's just say there are good men and women inside the DC police, Capitol Police,
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:41.720]  and they're well aware that a lot of their leadership are Democrat Party activists
[2:49:41.720 --> 2:49:45.720]  and they're well aware that some of their fellow officers are Democrat Party activists.
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:47.720]  And I mean, they apologize to me.
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:50.720]  They're like, oh, and I'm sorry we had to do this to you.
[2:49:50.720 --> 2:49:53.720]  We're run by the Democrat Party.
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:58.720]  I mean, flat out I was told that.
[2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:02.720]  And I was, you know, I had a wink and a nod on some other things too
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:04.720]  that they didn't want to say in so many words,
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:11.720]  but yeah, I was told that Democrat Party runs the DC police,
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:14.720]  specifically the ones that put down the orders,
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.720]  and you can tell who's who when I walk in there
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:18.720]  and the ones that want to treat me like garbage
[2:50:18.720 --> 2:50:21.720]  and the ones that want to scowl at me and laugh at me and torture me,
[2:50:21.720 --> 2:50:24.720]  versus the ones that actually care and know that I was wrongfully imprisoned
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:26.720]  and were trying to be nice to me.
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:29.720]  It was very obvious who was who.
[2:50:29.720 --> 2:50:32.720]  And like I said, there were a couple that were real cordial and open
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:34.720]  and they just said, here's the deal, man.
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:38.720]  You're in a Democrat Party cell.
[2:50:38.720 --> 2:50:40.720]  That's what this is.
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:44.720]  And so yesterday they just showed you who they are.
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:48.720]  They just showed who the Democrat Party activists in the DC police are.
[2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:50.720]  But here you go.
[2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:52.720]  Just some of the headlines the Democrats didn't want to talk about
[2:50:52.720 --> 2:50:54.720]  or have hearings on.
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:57.720]  These are the police officers shot during the riots,
[2:50:57.720 --> 2:50:59.720]  daily call of story from last summer,
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:02.720]  and it gets into the dozens of the police officers that were injured
[2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:05.720]  and even killed during the Democrat riots of 2020.
[2:51:05.720 --> 2:51:08.720]  Democrats didn't bat an eye.
[2:51:08.720 --> 2:51:11.720]  Las Vegas police officer paralyzed after protesters
[2:51:11.720 --> 2:51:13.720]  shoot him in the head.
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:16.720]  More than 100 New York Police Department officers
[2:51:16.720 --> 2:51:19.720]  injured in the protest since June 10th.
[2:51:19.720 --> 2:51:21.720]  Again, these are from last summer, these headlines.
[2:51:21.720 --> 2:51:29.720]  Federal officers in Portland may have been permanently blinded by lasers.
[2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:34.720]  Cop reports to roll call one day after being shot in Louisville riots.
[2:51:34.720 --> 2:51:36.720]  OK, those were just from last summer.
[2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:40.720]  Now, Dana Lesh has put together an incredible piece
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:42.720]  and she put a lot of work into this.
[2:51:42.720 --> 2:51:46.720]  So it's worth sharing all 26 pages here as I go to break
[2:51:46.720 --> 2:51:48.720]  and Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:52.720]  Oh, no, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, is that who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[2:51:52.720 --> 2:51:54.720]  I'm sorry, guys, my earpiece went out,
[2:51:54.720 --> 2:51:56.720]  so I don't even know what's going on.
[2:51:56.720 --> 2:52:01.720]  But so we have Dr. Andrew Kaufman actually hosting the fourth hour.
[2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:02.720]  That's great.
[2:52:02.720 --> 2:52:06.720]  But before we do that, Dana Lesh put this together.
[2:52:06.720 --> 2:52:10.720]  The left's many January 6th, a compendium.
[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:14.720]  The left trying to hold January 6th as relative to the years
[2:52:14.720 --> 2:52:17.720]  of lawless violence and destruction is the original what aboutism.
[2:52:17.720 --> 2:52:22.720]  And in this 26 page report, she gets into all the leftist riots
[2:52:22.720 --> 2:52:26.720]  when they burned DC, burned Portland, burned New York,
[2:52:26.720 --> 2:52:29.720]  burned Philadelphia, shot police officers,
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:32.720]  attacked police officers, killed police officers,
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:34.720]  paralyzed police officers,
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:37.720]  and how it was celebrated in the media at the time.
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:41.720]  But one event, one event is treated differently than all the rest.
[2:52:41.720 --> 2:52:42.720]  And you know what?
[2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:45.720]  I'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service.
[2:52:45.720 --> 2:52:49.720]  I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:52.720]  and has thousands of employees here in the United States
[2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:54.720]  and sources of materials all over North America
[2:52:54.720 --> 2:52:56.720]  and from Africa as well, which he's proud of.
[2:52:56.720 --> 2:52:58.720]  That's where you get the good cotton
[2:52:58.720 --> 2:53:00.720]  and then they put it together here in the United States.
[2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:03.720]  And that is Mike Lindell.
[2:53:03.720 --> 2:53:05.720]  Mike Lindell is a patriot.
[2:53:05.720 --> 2:53:06.720]  Mike Lindell is fighting.
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:12.720]  He is bold and he's got his products in stock ready to ship to you.

[2:53:25.720 --> 2:53:27.720]  or animal beds for dogs and cats
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:31.720]  or the great towels or the pillows that they're best known for.
[2:53:31.720 --> 2:53:33.720]  And he's done great. His people are great.
[2:53:33.720 --> 2:53:36.720]  They've really come through and taken us out of the red into the black.
[2:53:36.720 --> 2:53:38.720]  So thank you all for shopping at mypillow.com
[2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:43.720]  up to 66% off with promo code Alex.
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:12.720]  We ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:15.720]  and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV
[2:54:15.720 --> 2:54:19.720]  and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:21.720]  that would actually go attack the t-limbs besides the body
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:24.720]  and create autoimmune disorders.
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:28.720]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down
[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:30.720]  and would be non-lethal down the road.
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:33.720]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:37.720]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:40.720]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:55:09.720]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[2:55:10.720 --> 2:55:25.720]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:27.720]  I want to thank Alex for inviting me on.
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:31.720]  I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman and I'll be your guest host for the next hour
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:35.720]  and I have some exciting news and some exciting things to talk to you about today.
[2:55:35.720 --> 2:55:40.720]  I'm going to be focusing on the Federal Drug Administration, the FDA
[2:55:40.720 --> 2:55:43.720]  and their emergency use authorization process
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:47.720]  because there's been some recent news with respect to the PCR
[2:55:47.720 --> 2:55:51.720]  as well as the vaccines and I'm going to help you understand
[2:55:51.720 --> 2:55:57.720]  the legal and historical context for this very important issue
[2:55:57.720 --> 2:55:59.720]  that's affecting your rights right now.
[2:55:59.720 --> 2:56:06.720]  So if we could bring up the first slide please.
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:09.720]  So what we have here and I'm not sure if it's up there it goes
[2:56:09.720 --> 2:56:13.720]  is an announcement that the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control
[2:56:13.720 --> 2:56:19.720]  and Prevention is withdrawing its emergency use authorization request
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:25.720]  to the FDA for the PCR tests that were originally approved
[2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:27.720]  in February of 2020.
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:31.720]  Now this is quite significant because after that date
[2:56:31.720 --> 2:56:35.720]  these tests will no longer be allowed to be used
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:42.720]  and the PCR test has been the most widely used so-called diagnostic test
[2:56:42.720 --> 2:56:46.720]  for COVID-19 across the world and especially in the United States
[2:56:46.720 --> 2:56:50.720]  and as we know all of the tyrannical policies that restrict your rights
[2:56:50.720 --> 2:56:55.720]  and require you to participate with unapproved medical interventions
[2:56:55.720 --> 2:56:58.720]  are based on the results of this test.
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:01.720]  So why is it going to be withdrawn?
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:06.720]  Well the truth of the matter is that there are two different ways
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:09.720]  to get your product on the market for a medical device
[2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:12.720]  and this test is a medical device.
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:14.720]  One way is the emergency use authorization
[2:57:14.720 --> 2:57:18.720]  and there are specific time-limited criteria.
[2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:22.720]  But to have your device on the market permanently to be able to sell
[2:57:22.720 --> 2:57:25.720]  you need to get formal FDA approval
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:31.720]  and the manufacturers of this test realized that they would not be able
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:36.720]  to even apply for FDA approval because they do not meet the criteria.
[2:57:36.720 --> 2:57:44.720]  As I've stated many times the PCR test scientifically is not really suited
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:47.720]  for diagnosing clinical disease.
[2:57:47.720 --> 2:57:52.720]  But aside from that this particular test has never undergone what's known
[2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:54.720]  as validation studies.
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:58.720]  Now validation studies are what actually prove that it measures
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:01.720]  what you think that it measures.
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:04.720]  So why don't we go to the next slide please.
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:11.720]  And here what we're showing is one of the FDA EUA authorization letters.
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:16.720]  So each time a product receives this emergency use authorization designation
[2:58:16.720 --> 2:58:19.720]  which is different from FDA approval
[2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:23.720]  they issue a letter to the manufacturer giving them this approval.
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:29.720]  And so here's an example of one of the PCR diagnostics from Ipsum Diagnostics LLC
[2:58:29.720 --> 2:58:32.720]  that was issued on April 1, 2020.
[2:58:32.720 --> 2:58:36.720]  And I want to show this to illustrate some important things that it says.
[2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:41.720]  So first of all if you look at the highlighted text under indication at the top
[2:58:41.720 --> 2:58:46.720]  you'll see that it is approved or authorized for qualitative detection
[2:58:46.720 --> 2:58:51.720]  of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2.
[2:58:51.720 --> 2:58:54.720]  Now nucleic acid is another word for RNA or DNA.
[2:58:54.720 --> 2:58:59.720]  But what this is specifying is that it can only detect genetic material
[2:58:59.720 --> 2:59:05.720]  that is said to be from this virus but cannot detect the actual virus
[2:59:05.720 --> 2:59:12.720]  and also cannot detect the clinical state of being in a disease due to a virus.
[2:59:12.720 --> 2:59:14.720]  And the next slide please.
[2:59:14.720 --> 2:59:21.720]  If we look further down in this authorization letter, you see the highlighted text again
[2:59:21.720 --> 2:59:26.720]  that is based on the totality of scientific evidence available at the time this was granted
[2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:33.720]  that quote, it is reasonable to believe that your product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19.
[2:59:33.720 --> 2:59:40.720]  So you can see that there is only the reasonability of a belief, not a fact or not knowledge
[2:59:40.720 --> 2:59:48.720]  that the product may, which also means or may not be effective in diagnosing COVID-19.
[2:59:48.720 --> 3:00:14.720]  So you can see that this is not very strict criteria.
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:24.720]  Organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout,
[3:00:24.720 --> 3:00:26.720]  organic quinoa sprout.
[3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:29.720]  Ladies and gentlemen all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:33.720]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health
[3:00:33.720 --> 3:00:38.720]  and we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[3:00:38.720 --> 3:00:41.720]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:46.720]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:55.720]  price of $19.95 that's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:00:55.720 --> 3:01:08.920]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:13.000]  I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, filling in today.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:20.640]  So as I was stating before the break, we have this language in the authorization letter
[3:01:20.640 --> 3:01:28.600]  that puts a lot of doubt about if this product actually can successfully diagnose COVID-19
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:34.000]  and we'll know that it's not required to prove that it can diagnose this condition in order
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:37.040]  to get this authorization letter.
[3:01:37.040 --> 3:01:40.960]  So let's go on to the next slide.
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:45.520]  Now here we have the specific requirements from the FDA.
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:52.360]  Now to get approval of IVD, which is in vitro diagnostics, that's any diagnostic test done
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:55.760]  in the laboratory, there are two pathways.
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:02:01.680]  Now the 510K is the abbreviated pathway, so it's the easiest way to get such a device
[3:02:01.680 --> 3:02:05.800]  approved, so I thought I would highlight that in this example.
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:11.800]  And you can see that the FDA requires, among other things, the analytical specificity and
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:16.760]  sensitivity of an in vitro diagnostic in order to be approved.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:18.120]  So what is that?
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:21.200]  Let's go to the next slide, please.
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:27.920]  So I found an article here from the NIH that discusses what sensitivity and specificity
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:33.760]  are and essentially what they are are statistics that are based on the error value or the error
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:39.840]  rate of the test, and the sensitivity is how well it can detect something that may not
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:41.840]  be common.
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:47.840]  And the specificity is if there is a positive result, is it very specific or does it give
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:48.840]  false results?
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:55.120]  So these are essentially ways to measure accuracy or error.
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:03:01.120]  Now you'll see in the second column here that this article is specifically talking about
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:09.960]  tests in ophthalmology and it states, quote, a lot of this high-tech explosion involves
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:16.800]  diagnostic tests, regrettably there is sometimes a tendency to use tests just because they
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:20.640]  are available or because they are high-tech.
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:26.280]  Now this is a very key point here because we have PCR tests are very high-tech in terms
[3:03:26.280 --> 3:03:34.080]  of molecular biology and according to the FDA there have been approximately 600 different
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:39.640]  diagnostics and therapeutics applied for emergency use authorization to the FDA.
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:43.520]  So this is quite a prolific field and a big money grab.
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:45.640]  If we could go to the next slide, please.
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:52.040]  So this article further goes to state that in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity
[3:03:52.040 --> 3:03:56.280]  you need to have a gold standard.
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:04:02.240]  Now it says the gold standard is the best single test that is considered the current
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:06.800]  preferred method of diagnosing a particular disease.
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:11.520]  So what we have to do is take our proposed diagnostic test that we're applying to the
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:18.800]  FDA for and compare it to a gold standard in order to obtain the sensitivity and specificity
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:20.480]  calculations.
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:23.360]  And please advance to the next slide.
[3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:28.960]  Also you can see in the second column, sorry this should be one before I went too far,
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:33.960]  it talks about validity and validity is the name for the study where you would compare
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:36.120]  this to a gold standard.
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:38.800]  And what it says here, it defines the validity.
[3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:45.040]  It is the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure.
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:46.400]  So that's really key.
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:52.560]  So we have an experimental test, we're going to apply to the FDA, but we have to do a validation
[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:56.560]  study to show that it measures what we say it's going to measure.
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:05:02.600]  And in order to do that, we have to compare it to a gold standard and then use that comparison
[3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:09.040]  to calculate the error rate as well as sensitivity, specificity and other variables.
[3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:10.720]  Okay, next slide.
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:15.200]  So what is the gold standard in virology?
[3:05:15.200 --> 3:05:18.920]  Now we can't see this whole slide, but we have, I'm going to read two quotes because
[3:05:18.920 --> 3:05:21.080]  I have two separate articles here.
[3:05:21.080 --> 3:05:28.760]  Now the first is from an article about bovine viral diarrhea virus and it says, quote, virus
[3:05:28.760 --> 3:05:36.360]  isolation is a basic reliable and widely used method for diagnosis of BVDV infection and
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:41.520]  remains the gold standard for the virus diagnostics.
[3:05:41.520 --> 3:05:49.080]  Okay, now we go to the second article which is looking at cytomegalovirus and I put a
[3:05:49.080 --> 3:05:53.600]  quote at the end right there, culture is the gold standard.
[3:05:53.600 --> 3:05:58.880]  Now culture and isolation are actually two names for the same experiment and this is
[3:05:58.880 --> 3:06:06.640]  the experiment that I have criticized immensely as being not a valid way to identify a virus.
[3:06:06.640 --> 3:06:12.520]  However, according to mainstream virology, this is the gold standard of how they identify
[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:13.920]  a virus.
[3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:20.480]  So if you are going to be able to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of such a
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:26.360]  diagnostic test like the PCR, and by the way, this applies to all of the diagnostic tests
[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:32.480]  that have been put forth and have received emergency use authorization, that they would
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:37.840]  all have to be compared to a gold standard in order to determine all of these variables
[3:06:37.840 --> 3:06:43.240]  about their error, and that would require comparing them to virus isolation according
[3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:45.440]  to their own standards.
[3:06:45.440 --> 3:06:51.240]  Now this study has never not once been done.
[3:06:51.240 --> 3:06:58.680]  So in other words, they don't really have any basis whatsoever to get approval for
[3:06:58.680 --> 3:07:04.560]  the PCR test, so they have no choice but to withdraw their emergency use authorization
[3:07:04.560 --> 3:07:10.960]  application because when it expires, they will not be able to get approval.
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:16.520]  So this is quite significant and now I want to show you how this applies to the research
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:23.760]  on the Delta variant because this has been the big news story, the big point of fear
[3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:30.800]  across the world that this alleged Delta variant came from India and is spreading across the
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:37.480]  world and specifically it is the fault of the unvaccinated that this even exists.
[3:07:37.480 --> 3:07:39.440]  So next slide please.
[3:07:39.440 --> 3:07:49.200]  I want to point you to a video that I recently did which has been put up on this website
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:07:57.400]  on Band.tv and I did this with Sayer G and I explain exactly how they sequence the genome
[3:07:57.400 --> 3:08:04.960]  in this video and I explain what variants are and essentially my main point is that
[3:08:04.960 --> 3:08:12.120]  they never had a virus where they could take the genetic material and look at it in its
[3:08:12.120 --> 3:08:16.120]  totality and perform a sequence.
[3:08:16.120 --> 3:08:24.720]  But what they did was they took 56.5 million small pieces of DNA from one patient, only
[3:08:24.720 --> 3:08:30.800]  one and they put those into a computer and the computer, even though it didn't know the
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:36.000]  source of each of the 56 million little pieces like did they come from a bacteria, did they
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:40.560]  come from a different virus, did they come from a human, did they come from a yeast or
[3:08:40.560 --> 3:08:46.080]  a fungus or an amoeba, they had no idea but the computer still was able to put them together
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:50.480]  into what they call an in-silico genome.
[3:08:50.480 --> 3:08:55.160]  And this is a computer simulation of a genome and it's purely theoretical.
[3:08:55.160 --> 3:09:02.400]  And what variants are is when they try to repeat this experiment by taking the sample
[3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:10.080]  from the lung fluid or from a nasopharyngeal swab which is from the nose and they essentially
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:16.040]  repeat this process and put it into the computer and they compare it with the so called index
[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:19.240]  sequence that was the first one like this published.
[3:09:19.240 --> 3:09:25.160]  And what happens is that every time they do this experiment they cannot get the exact
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:30.840]  same results and the reason that they cannot obtain the same results is because it's not
[3:09:30.840 --> 3:09:36.240]  a valid study, in other words it's theoretical, it doesn't represent the real genetic sequence
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:40.200]  of an organism, only a computer generated sequence.
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:47.000]  So each time the sequence doesn't match exactly, it's slightly off and in order to account
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:53.920]  for this they call each one a new variant and then they arbitrarily it seems designate
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:57.520]  which variant is causing the problem.
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:03.280]  Now they've named many, many of these, there have been tens of thousands of different variants
[3:10:03.280 --> 3:10:08.520]  that have been identified and it seems that this is the way that they justify many of
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:09.520]  the policies.
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:15.200]  For example, they state that the variant is brought about by unvaccinated people so they
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:18.560]  use it as a way to get more people to vaccinate.
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:24.000]  They can also require people who are already vaccinated to take additional measures because
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:29.420]  they say that it won't be, they won't be protected from the Delta variant.
[3:10:29.420 --> 3:10:35.360]  So when we come back after the break I'm going to take an in depth look at one of the papers,
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:41.640]  the most recent study put out that claims that this Delta variant is so dangerous and
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:46.120]  in fact that it breaks through people who are vaccinated.
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:51.400]  So I'm very excited to present that to you and we'll be back right after this break.
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:56.760]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:10:58.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  Good, bro.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  Great last caller.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:03.760]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement, it's basically the only
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:07.640]  way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:10.440]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone and...
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:13.760]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire, Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[3:11:13.760 --> 3:11:15.200]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:18.240]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product.
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:22.280]  The X2 does wonders, they recommend it to everybody, you're on the fence about it, get
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:25.120]  off the fence, get the product, support the M4.
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:27.840]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:30.400]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on, Lizzie, it's an honor.
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:31.400]  Honour, talk to you.
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:32.400]  Awesome.
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:38.200]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29, if you
[3:11:38.200 --> 3:11:43.400]  ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one for a few
[3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:44.400]  of you.
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:49.400]  I like that one, it works, it's not a joke, yeah.
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:51.640]  Absolutely.
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:55.280]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:11:59.440]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra
[3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:03.520]  people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:04.520]  world.
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:07.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:11.520]  ready to ship while you still can at 20, 20 prices.

[3:12:54.640 --> 3:13:01.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:31.280]  Hello, and welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:34.520]  I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:41.240]  Before the break, we have been talking about PCR testing and emergency use authorization,
[3:13:41.240 --> 3:13:44.640]  and we were just getting into the Delta variant.
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:51.240]  I had given a description about how these genome sequencing experiments are done and
[3:13:51.240 --> 3:13:57.840]  how the Delta variant is essentially a made-up computer simulation of a strain.
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:03.600]  Let me add that since I was talking about the gold standard among the virologists of
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:09.720]  doing a virus isolation or tissue culture experiment, there have been no attempts at doing this
[3:14:09.720 --> 3:14:14.280]  type of experiment for any of the variants that I have found.
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:19.680]  I want to take you to the next slide, which is a study that recent, this is the most recent
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:26.280]  study, and I have it in front of me here, entitled Transmission Event of SARS-CoV-2
[3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:31.800]  Delta Variant Reveals Multiple Vaccine Breakthrough Infections.
[3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:39.400]  This was done by doctors at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.
[3:14:39.400 --> 3:14:45.760]  What they said, and this is right here, oh, you can't, can you see it in this example?
[3:14:45.760 --> 3:14:51.600]  So I have a different version of this publication, but what it says here is that this study,
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:57.480]  quote, suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion.
[3:14:57.480 --> 3:15:02.640]  Immune evasion means that it can make people sick who are already vaccinated.
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:09.200]  So you see that they have to very carefully hedge their language to say suggests and may
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:16.080]  because they can't draw any clear conclusions from this poorly done scientific publication
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:17.760]  and study.
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:23.120]  So I want to give you the key points of how you can interpret this, and obviously it is
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:32.000]  very fear inducing to see that people now who put all their trust in a brand new so-called
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:38.280]  vaccine have to now be afraid of getting the Delta variant, and we know that the news media
[3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:43.360]  is blaming this on the unvaccinated that the Delta variant even exists.
[3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:50.440]  So we have a situation here that is potentially going to pit the vaccinated against the unvaccinated.
[3:15:50.440 --> 3:15:52.800]  So what are the key points of the study?
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:16:01.520]  So the first and most important point is that they used PCR testing to determine who was
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:05.040]  ill and who had COVID in this study.
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:11.880]  Now we know from the previous segments that the PCR test is not shown to actually diagnose
[3:16:11.880 --> 3:16:20.240]  COVID or SARS-CoV-2, and there has been no PCR specifically developed for the Delta variant
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:26.600]  that has been even given the emergency use authorization, let alone any approval.
[3:16:26.600 --> 3:16:29.560]  We know that the PCR test has not been validated.
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:35.880]  So any research based upon PCR analysis is thereby invalid.
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:41.240]  Now they also use the genome sequencing, which is also theoretical, and they use the same
[3:16:41.240 --> 3:16:43.160]  procedure that I described earlier.
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:16:46.720]  So that is also invalid.
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:51.120]  Now what they did was they followed people at a wedding.
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:55.920]  So I wonder if the investigators were guests at this wedding and got the idea to do this
[3:16:55.920 --> 3:16:56.920]  study.
[3:16:56.920 --> 3:17:03.600]  So two people from India came to the wedding and they tested positive, sorry, negative
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:10.120]  on the invalid PCR before they left India, and then they got sick a few days after the
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:14.640]  wedding and supposedly they passed this on to four other people.
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:18.440]  Now this wedding was not a wedding where human rights are respected.
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:25.160]  In fact, all the guests for this wedding were required to be vaccinated.
[3:17:25.160 --> 3:17:30.720]  So the couple that came from India got their vaccine just 10 days before they came to the
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:31.720]  wedding.
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:40.360]  Now, of course, it didn't point out that any of the other guests when they got vaccinated,
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:46.400]  but we know that there were 92 guests and six of them fell ill.
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:53.760]  So they say that this is because the Delta variant, which they only identified using
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:59.600]  invalid testing protocols, was brought over by the couple from India and then spread to
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:04.520]  four other people at the wedding with whom they admitted having close contact with.
[3:18:04.520 --> 3:18:10.880]  Now since all of the people at this wedding were vaccinated, why wouldn't we consider
[3:18:10.880 --> 3:18:15.140]  that the vaccines could actually be the cause of their illness?
[3:18:15.140 --> 3:18:21.200]  Now if they reported the timing of when the people who fell ill received their vaccines
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:26.360]  compared to when the other guests who did not fall ill received their vaccines, we could
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:27.360]  see.
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:33.160]  So for example, if all six people were vaccinated within two weeks of the wedding and they're
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:38.640]  the only ones who got sick and the other people were vaccinated months earlier, then we would
[3:18:38.640 --> 3:18:44.800]  know that the vaccines were the cause of these illnesses, but this was not even considered.
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:50.960]  And this really follows a trend in medicine, that investigators who perform medical research
[3:18:50.960 --> 3:18:56.440]  and this is especially true of doctors, but also of PhD research scientists, they never
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:02.520]  consider that their treatment may actually be the cause of a negative outcome.
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:10.520]  This is something that is a big blind spot in this research and clearly needs to be addressed.
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:15.560]  Now another fatal flaw of this experiment is that there is no control group.
[3:19:15.560 --> 3:19:21.880]  So in other words, there's no other wedding where no one was vaccinated to see if any
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:27.680]  of those people got sick and of course that would also tell us if the illness was caused
[3:19:27.680 --> 3:19:34.200]  by the vaccine because we would expect no one at the other wedding to be ill.
[3:19:34.200 --> 3:19:41.560]  So this is an example of the very poor quality of research that we have that is being used
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:51.120]  to manipulate and justify all the policies that we are facing here in this pandemic situation.
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:19:58.560]  So we really need to take a careful look at the systems that are put in place and most
[3:19:58.560 --> 3:20:06.360]  of these systems are justified by the goal of protecting the public health and they disregard
[3:20:06.360 --> 3:20:13.160]  anything about the individual situation or the individual's rights.
[3:20:13.160 --> 3:20:21.440]  So we have all kinds of fake news and then we have of course the censorship that is coming.
[3:20:21.440 --> 3:20:29.800]  So recently the Surgeon General of the United States gave a speech in which he talked about
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:35.600]  the major importance of misinformation and really this is because people are not running
[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:37.040]  to get the vaccine.
[3:20:37.040 --> 3:20:41.960]  Pretty much everyone who wanted to get these vaccines I think has received them.
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:46.760]  Some people may do it out of convenience but essentially there's not going to be any more
[3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:47.760]  huge numbers.
[3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:55.240]  So they want to combat misinformation thinking that people speaking, giving their scientific
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:21:01.080]  opinion is actually a problem and during that conference he announced that none other than
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:09.120]  the Rockefeller Foundation, a group that we all know and love, has decided to fund millions
[3:21:09.120 --> 3:21:16.240]  of dollars to essentially help develop technology to further censor voices like you'll hear
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:21.720]  on this show across social media and other digital platforms.
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:28.760]  So we can see that our rights are being infringed upon in many different ways and information
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:34.040]  wars or info wars is one of the big battlegrounds.
[3:21:34.040 --> 3:21:37.980]  So when we come back we're going to shift gears and we're going to talk more about the
[3:21:37.980 --> 3:21:43.080]  vaccine situation in the context of emergency use authorization.
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:47.320]  Let me remind you that you're watching the Alex Jones show and I'm your guest host Dr.
[3:21:47.320 --> 3:21:48.320]  Andrew Kauffman.
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:51.000]  We'll see you in a few.
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:59.320]  You know listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:21:59.320 --> 3:22:02.280]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:06.600]  and for word of mouth and we're all in this together and you know it gets old having to
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:10.200]  come to you and say hey I got great products please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:22:10.200 --> 3:22:13.680]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:22:13.680 --> 3:22:18.320]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:22.040]  almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:26.800]  and as this whole new world order comes out and we open our credibility is going up that's
[3:22:26.800 --> 3:22:30.400]  why we've got to be taken off air that's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:34.800]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi free.
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:38.960]  You can't have info wars has been proven right be on air with all the craziness that's about
[3:22:38.960 --> 3:22:43.480]  to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you all and get
[3:22:43.480 --> 3:22:48.200]  an infowarstore.com get some great 2020 election shirts supplements and so much more.
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:52.040]  Wonderful products and they support the infowar thank you.
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:58.600]  The bio security state is here it's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans
[3:22:58.600 --> 3:23:00.840]  are dirty bad and evil.
[3:23:00.840 --> 3:23:05.960]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada who says he admires the communist dictatorship
[3:23:05.960 --> 3:23:11.720]  of GCP and wishes to make Canada the same has announced that they're buying vaccines
[3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:17.400]  for every person in the country all the way out to 2024 and that in 2024 you will again
[3:23:17.400 --> 3:23:23.280]  take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[3:23:23.280 --> 3:23:27.840]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation they developed this whole plan with Bill Gates they're now
[3:23:27.840 --> 3:23:31.920]  implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:32.920]  Foundation.
[3:23:32.920 --> 3:23:38.240]  Of course the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf Alois Hitler
[3:23:38.240 --> 3:23:42.640]  and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany
[3:23:42.640 --> 3:23:46.200]  and full wars will continue to set fast they fight this I don't know how long we can.
[3:23:46.200 --> 3:23:50.200]  The enemies coming for us all now God bless and good luck I would again get right with
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:51.680]  God right now.
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:56.040]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:00.320]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do but because
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:04.560]  they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate I still
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:09.680]  have one because this Trojan horse this Promethean fire has a lot of power but when I'm not using
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:15.720]  it I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com we
[3:24:15.720 --> 3:24:20.000]  finally got them back and stopped the highest rated it's at almost all types of androids

[3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:17.800]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your guest host Dr. Andrew Kaufman and
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:24.320]  today we've been talking about the PCR test emergency use authorization the delta variant
[3:26:24.320 --> 3:26:34.920]  and now we're going to ship into vaccine mandates we could please have the next slide and right
[3:26:34.920 --> 3:26:39.840]  here we have been hearing and this is one of the things that frankly bothers me the
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:47.680]  most about what's going on in the world right now but we have employers we have governments
[3:26:47.680 --> 3:26:55.120]  we have universities and schools we have school systems we have hospitals and healthcare organizations
[3:26:55.120 --> 3:27:03.000]  all calling for mandates for their employees students and associates and sometimes customers
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:10.300]  to get this experimental vaccine so let's go back and talk a little bit more about the
[3:27:10.300 --> 3:27:17.880]  emergency use authorization next slide please because every product that is being marketed
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:24.520]  and sold in the context of this pandemic is only been granted emergency use authorization
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:31.320]  there are no products that have actually been approved as safe and effective by the FDA
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:39.120]  so what is emergency use authorization so under an EUA FDA may allow the use of unapproved
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:46.360]  medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency so it's
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:52.000]  unapproved products in an emergency to diagnose treat or prevent serious or life threatening
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:58.440]  diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met including that there
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:06.440]  are no adequate approved and available alternatives okay so let's look at this really closely
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:12.440]  because this is the context from which all of these products including the vaccines and
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:18.720]  now we're really talking here about the vaccines and I want to explain that these are not traditional
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:26.000]  vaccines in fact the dictionaries of the world had to modify their definitions of vaccines
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:32.760]  to include this current technology now what these are is these are genetic based therapies
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:37.400]  or gene therapies and there are different kinds I know that many of you have heard a lot of
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:44.520]  information about this but there are the mRNA so-called vaccines which an example would
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:52.240]  be Moderna and then there are DNA also vaccines of which an example would be the Johnson and
[3:28:52.240 --> 3:28:59.920]  Johnson and there are some nuances that differentiate these technologies from each other but essentially
[3:28:59.920 --> 3:29:07.960]  these are all a brand new vaccine technology never been used before and in fact there are
[3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:14.280]  almost no gene therapies at all that have been granted approval for use so we are basically
[3:29:14.280 --> 3:29:22.920]  combining two technologies here vaccines and gene therapy so there is no precedent for
[3:29:22.920 --> 3:29:28.200]  this but nonetheless let's look at the next slide because we let's see is there actually
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:33.280]  an emergency now the federal government and the Department of Health and Human Services
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:38.760]  still maintain their emergency status and they've been renewing it every 90 days however
[3:29:38.760 --> 3:29:47.040]  among the states you can see from the map in the middle that solid blue or dark gray
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:52.600]  means that those states are open and no longer have a state of emergency declared and you
[3:29:52.600 --> 3:30:01.360]  can see that it is practically every state except Hawaii so we have all of the states
[3:30:01.360 --> 3:30:07.720]  have lifted their states of emergency and that signifies that there is no longer the
[3:30:07.720 --> 3:30:16.600]  required context for EUA authorization according to the states now the Health and Human Services
[3:30:16.600 --> 3:30:24.920]  department needs to get in line with all of the states because that is their job okay
[3:30:24.920 --> 3:30:33.520]  so if we go to the next slide let's look at the other criteria is there an alternative
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:39.320]  treatment that is safe and effective and I want to point here to this is a review article
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:44.840]  now I don't know how it's possible to have a review article in such a short time because
[3:30:44.840 --> 3:30:49.720]  we've only experienced this pandemic for a year and a half and a review article means
[3:30:49.720 --> 3:30:55.240]  it's reviewing all of the studies that have already been done and in this case they have
[3:30:55.240 --> 3:31:00.920]  not just a review but it's a meta analysis and that is a very powerful mathematical
[3:31:00.920 --> 3:31:05.960]  technique when they take multiple studies but not just the studies they actually take
[3:31:05.960 --> 3:31:11.640]  all of the data or the results from those studies and put them in one set of results
[3:31:11.640 --> 3:31:17.560]  like combining them and then they analyze that and meta means that it's beyond the results
[3:31:17.560 --> 3:31:23.720]  of any individual study this is like a summary of all the research on the topic and we have
[3:31:23.720 --> 3:31:29.320]  one here for Ivor Mectin in the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in such a short
[3:31:29.320 --> 3:31:35.320]  time and it said that there were 18 randomized controlled treatment trials now if we compare
[3:31:35.320 --> 3:31:44.760]  that with any of the vaccines that have been given authorization they've only had one trial
[3:31:44.760 --> 3:31:49.960]  randomized controlled trial and it didn't even look at the important outcomes but here
[3:31:49.960 --> 3:31:58.040]  we have 18 different RCTs that were combined into a meta analysis and if we read the conclusions
[3:31:58.040 --> 3:32:04.240]  this is what it said meta analysis based on 18 randomized controlled trials treatment
[3:32:04.240 --> 3:32:11.440]  trials of Ivor Mectin in COVID-19 have found large statistically significant reductions
[3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:17.560]  in mortality time to clinical recovery and time to viral clearance now not one study
[3:32:17.560 --> 3:32:24.280]  of the vaccine used mortality as an endpoint so we don't even know if lives are saved but
[3:32:24.280 --> 3:32:31.920]  here we know from Ivor Mectin that there is a large reduction in mortality so a large
[3:32:31.920 --> 3:32:38.680]  life-saving benefit and time to viral clearance furthermore results from numerous controlled
[3:32:38.680 --> 3:32:43.560]  prophylaxis trials now that is prevention so that is actually the same thing that the
[3:32:43.560 --> 3:32:50.480]  vaccine is designed to do report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with
[3:32:50.480 --> 3:32:58.680]  the regular use of Ivor Mectin so we see here that not only is Ivor Mectin proved to be
[3:32:58.680 --> 3:33:07.800]  effective at preventing COVID-19 infections but also not only can treat it and make you
[3:33:07.800 --> 3:33:13.520]  recover faster but actually saves lives and this has been proven by a meta analysis which
[3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:20.400]  is a very very powerful analysis so we see that the two criteria required for emergency
[3:33:20.400 --> 3:33:27.280]  use authorization that neither of them have been fulfilled when we look take a closer
[3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:34.600]  look at what the research shows now I'm going to shift to a very shocking but important
[3:33:34.600 --> 3:33:42.440]  document next and this is on the next slide now this is an opinion paper that came out
[3:33:42.440 --> 3:33:51.960]  on this issue of mandating the experimental vaccines for employers so we have Donna Johnson
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:59.800]  who is the acting assistant attorney general prepared this opinion as of July 6 and it's
[3:33:59.800 --> 3:34:05.760]  called whether section 554 of the food drug and cosmetic act prohibits entities from
[3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:11.760]  requiring the use of a vaccine subject to an emergency use authorization so what that
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:21.840]  really means is can employers or schools require in order to receive certain services or to
[3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:28.440]  be employed can they require their employees or students to receive this experimental vaccine
[3:34:28.440 --> 3:34:37.200]  that has not been approved by the FDA and what they concluded or what Miss Johnson concluded
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:45.280]  was that actually employers can do this but it's really fascinating the reasoning and
[3:34:45.280 --> 3:34:50.160]  we're going to certainly go into detail but one of the things that it needs to be clear
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:54.960]  is that you have to look just at the context of this opinion so first of all this is an
[3:34:54.960 --> 3:35:01.920]  opinion it has not been adjudicated in a courtroom setting okay this is prepared by the deputy
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:08.400]  counsel to the president in order to advise the president on policy decisions okay so
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:15.400]  this is not binding in court so in other words if you were an employee required by your employer
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:21.600]  to get the vaccine you could still sue them this opinion does not have any effect over
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:26.960]  any individual so we need to take it very carefully with a grain of salt and I'm also
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:32.240]  going to look a little bit into the background of Donna Johnson who prepared the report to
[3:35:32.240 --> 3:35:37.880]  see what her motivations might be so we're going to explore this further and then talk
[3:35:37.880 --> 3:35:45.360]  a bit about about human subject research when we come back and this is the Alex Jones show
[3:35:45.360 --> 3:35:51.240]  and I'm your guest host Dr. Andrew Kaufman we'll see you in a few I'm up here working
[3:35:51.240 --> 3:35:56.640]  on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something I am so blessed
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:36:00.760]  and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years it is
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:05.000]  truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:09.440]  of this show I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you whether you are old
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:13.720]  whether you are Hispanic white black it doesn't matter you got red blood and if you love freedom
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:19.000]  and justice and if you love our innocent children we are brothers and sisters together
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:23.560]  and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and it's
[3:36:23.560 --> 3:36:28.600]  crazier things are I want to keep working under the future but again that's really up
[3:36:28.600 --> 3:36:34.120]  to you and up to God so please I hope God works through you and puts a message in your
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:37.880]  heart to support us but again that's up to you and your relationship with God I just
[3:36:37.880 --> 3:36:42.160]  want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:46.760]  just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:50.480]  God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse God bless.
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:56.440]  The world is awakening the world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm they
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:02.400]  are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the CFR the trilateral commission
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:09.240]  the Bilderberg group the bohemian grove the club of Rome and so even though it seems like
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:15.560]  the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:21.720]  because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open so as bad as these times
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:26.520]  are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning you've
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:32.760]  got a trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice that is invincible
[3:37:32.760 --> 3:37:39.040]  that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in God to lead
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:42.920]  God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and realize you've
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:48.520]  got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you we will never back down from the globalist
[3:37:48.520 --> 3:37:56.320]  and we will never surrender humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:38:01.080]  been trained to submit do what you're told that's all going to pass but if you study
[3:38:01.080 --> 3:38:04.600]  authoritarians if you say the globalists you understand that they reach a point where all
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:09.160]  the training is just beta and you go into the point of being called being totally enslaved
[3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:13.000]  and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid they are now making that
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:17.520]  move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:23.320]  us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:28.440]  under such a load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping that
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:34.760]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate change
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:39.560]  as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying and Bill Gates are saying but fleeing the year-long
[3:38:39.560 --> 3:38:45.520]  lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:54.960]  IMF and World Bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:38:56.960]  Jacob in Ohio welcome go ahead.
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:38:57.960]  Hey how's it going Alex?
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:38:58.960]  Good bro.
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:38:59.960]  Great last caller.
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:02.560]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:07.520]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:08.520]  and absurdity.
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:10.560]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone and.
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:12.560]  Alright Eric in New Hampshire.
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:13.560]  Eric thanks for calling go ahead.
[3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:15.280]  Hey Alex thanks for taking my call.
[3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:18.320]  If I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:22.360]  The X2 does wonders they recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:25.160]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the IMF award.
[3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:27.960]  Tyler in Maine you're on the year thanks for holding go ahead.
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:30.360]  Hey Alex it's great to be on with you it's an honor.
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:31.360]  Honor talk to you.
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:32.360]  Awesome.
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:38.280]  So first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product alpha power even at 29 if you
[3:39:38.280 --> 3:39:43.360]  ask my better half she loves it and it helps in the bedroom so just number one for a few
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:44.360]  of you.
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:45.360]  It definitely works it's not a joke.
[3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:46.360]  Absolutely.
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:40:14.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:20.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your host doctor Andrew Kaufman and before the
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:27.960]  break we were talking about the judicial opinion of the deputy counsel to the president Donna
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:37.080]  Johnson about whether it is legal according to the food drug and cosmetic act to have
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:45.240]  employers or universities and schools require or mandate vaccination as a condition of employment.
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:55.720]  And so I want to explain the major point of this opinion paper which is that in the food
[3:40:55.720 --> 3:41:02.280]  drug and cosmetic act sections 564 which describes the emergency use authorization requirements
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:11.160]  and procedures that there is language that says that people who would receive the experimental
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:18.760]  authorized product should be informed of certain things and that they should have the quote
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:24.600]  the option to accept or refuse administration of the product.
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:31.680]  Now what the main argument is in this position paper is that it's only the responsibility
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:39.600]  of the drug companies themselves to actually let the person accept or refuse but a third
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:46.720]  party such as an employer or a university they can require the person to accept because
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:51.360]  they are not specifically named in the FDA's documents.
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:55.480]  Now this is quite interesting that they would parse it this way.
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:42:02.800]  Now they also stated that this argument only applies to the specific section of the law
[3:42:02.800 --> 3:42:09.240]  governing emergency use authorization and in other words it doesn't take into account
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:16.640]  any other federal state or local laws or international treaties.
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:25.460]  And we have a hierarchy of law in the United States which is that treaties are the highest
[3:42:25.460 --> 3:42:31.480]  because our country is participating in that and it supersedes United States law and then
[3:42:31.480 --> 3:42:37.440]  of course the Constitution is the second most important and then the United States code
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:43.320]  after that of which this language that I've read is part of.
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:51.040]  Now I want to draw your attention to the next slide because this issue has been tried in
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:52.520]  court before.
[3:42:52.520 --> 3:43:02.760]  So we have a case here now this is called Dovey Rumsfeld and it's from 2003 and what
[3:43:02.760 --> 3:43:08.840]  we have here is essentially that we had a service member who was required to receive
[3:43:08.840 --> 3:43:15.480]  an experimental anthrax vaccine and they sued the federal government asking for an emergency
[3:43:15.480 --> 3:43:20.680]  injunction in other words that they would give not require them to take the vaccine
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:26.680]  which was not FDA approved as safe and effective and the court ruled in their favor and granted
[3:43:26.680 --> 3:43:33.240]  the injunction saying that they could not be required unless there was a presidential
[3:43:33.240 --> 3:43:34.240]  waiver.
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:38.520]  Now I want to explain this a little bit because we're talking about here not a regular United
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:45.080]  States citizen or a regular individual or man or woman like you or I but we're talking
[3:43:45.080 --> 3:43:51.960]  about a service member and when you enlist into the armed forces you essentially sign
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:57.720]  away your rights and you become a subject of the armed services and no longer are you
[3:43:57.720 --> 3:44:00.000]  a free citizen of the United States.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:05.120]  So what they're saying here is even though you're not even a free citizen you're a subject
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:10.760]  of the armed services that they can't even force you to take an experimental vaccine
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:14.600]  unless there is a specific presidential waiver.
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:19.360]  And subsequently there was actually some additional legislation passed that the presidential
[3:44:19.360 --> 3:44:27.240]  waiver can only be granted when there is a direct threat to national security that would
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:31.240]  not be protected unless the waiver was granted.
[3:44:31.240 --> 3:44:37.680]  So just to summarize here we have even service members according to the courts cannot be
[3:44:37.680 --> 3:44:42.480]  mandated to have this injection.
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:47.760]  Now let's go to the next slide and take a little bit of a closer look at Dawn Johnson
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:50.840]  who is the author of this opinion.
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:56.440]  And we can see from CPS News if we look at the heading here because she has served under
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:45:03.720]  prior Democratic administrations quote Obama renominates pro-abortion Dawn Johnson to Justice
[3:45:03.720 --> 3:45:05.120]  Department Post.
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:11.320]  Now Dawn Johnson who is a professor at Indiana University and graduated from Yale Law School
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:16.920]  she has a long track record of being a big advocate of civil rights in fact she even
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:20.000]  worked for the ACLU in the past.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:26.160]  She teaches constitutional law at the law school and has been a major major advocate
[3:45:26.160 --> 3:45:30.080]  for pro-choice and abortion rights.
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:36.680]  Now it's quite interesting to look at the juxtaposition and the hypocrisy in these two
[3:45:36.680 --> 3:45:44.240]  policies because she spent her career protecting the right to choose for our body the privacy,
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:50.480]  the integrity of our bodies that we can choose for ourselves because that is the basis of
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:54.680]  the Roe v. Wade decision that protects abortion rights.
[3:45:54.680 --> 3:45:59.280]  Now she has issued an opinion saying the exact opposite.
[3:45:59.280 --> 3:46:08.360]  Now she says it's perfectly okay to force a experimental medical treatment on people
[3:46:08.360 --> 3:46:13.960]  for employers as long as it's not the manufacturer of the product themselves.
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:21.080]  Now imagine if employers were concerned about overpopulation and they decided that all their
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:27.160]  employees who became pregnant would have to get an abortion or be terminated from employment
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:35.800]  because that's precisely the situation that she has said is legal and okay to carry out.
[3:46:35.800 --> 3:46:42.080]  So this is quite a shocking and surprising change of direction.
[3:46:42.080 --> 3:46:47.480]  But let's go further to the next slide because really what we're talking about here is we're
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:53.920]  talking about forcing the experimental or the use of an experimental treatment on the
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:46:58.680]  population here and whether it's by a government, whether it's by the manufacturer or whether
[3:46:58.680 --> 3:47:02.080]  it's by an employer, it is still the same procedure.
[3:47:02.080 --> 3:47:11.760]  So here we have aspects of the Nuremberg Code because the Nazis did extreme amounts of experiments
[3:47:11.760 --> 3:47:15.960]  on their population and they did this without consent of course.
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:22.040]  And because of these atrocities there was a trial and the results of the trial were
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:27.880]  made into the Nuremberg Code and one of the main provisions of the Nuremberg Code is to
[3:47:27.880 --> 3:47:36.280]  prohibit experimentation on people without their voluntary consent.
[3:47:36.280 --> 3:47:43.840]  And it says that it is absolutely essential to have their consent and in fact as a researcher
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:50.160]  myself in academic medicine and in medical school I learned about this when I had to
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:55.320]  do a special training with what's called the IRB or Institutional Review Board.
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:48:01.160]  And this is a network of boards that regulate and approve human subject research and they're
[3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:07.080]  set up at every academic institution, every hospital, every place that does human research
[3:48:07.080 --> 3:48:10.400]  in the entire United States and beyond.
[3:48:10.400 --> 3:48:15.060]  And I had to undergo this training where I learned that the Nuremberg Code was actually
[3:48:15.060 --> 3:48:21.080]  the reason why we were very, very careful about doing research on human subjects.
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:29.720]  Now if you will go to the next slide because in the United States we have written this
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:34.400]  and by the way there's also the Declaration of Helsinki which is another document that
[3:48:34.400 --> 3:48:37.040]  sort of follows up on the Nuremberg Code.
[3:48:37.040 --> 3:48:42.640]  But in the United States we have the Belmont Report which was prepared in 1979 and this
[3:48:42.640 --> 3:48:46.000]  is what set up the Institutional Review Boards.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:51.640]  And there's a quote on the right because some people may say that this experimental vaccines
[3:48:51.640 --> 3:48:59.800]  are not actually human research that they are a real treatment and this paragraph speaks
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:01.940]  specifically to that fact.
[3:49:01.940 --> 3:49:08.320]  So the fact that a procedure is quote experimental in the sense of new, untested or different
[3:49:08.320 --> 3:49:11.840]  does not automatically place it in the category of research.
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:14.480]  That's what I was talking about.
[3:49:14.480 --> 3:49:19.000]  Radically new procedures of this description should however be made the object of formal
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:23.240]  research at an early stage in order to determine whether they are safe and effective.
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:30.200]  So radically new procedures like a gene therapy vaccine.
[3:49:30.200 --> 3:49:37.680]  So in other words this quote directly applies to the current experimental vaccines that
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:45.160]  even though they are not regulated as research among the general population they actually
[3:49:45.160 --> 3:49:52.280]  meet the criteria because the radically different technology that has been previously untested
[3:49:52.280 --> 3:49:54.600]  never used before.
[3:49:54.600 --> 3:50:01.200]  So people I want to you know just reiterate that we are in a time here when the major
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:09.040]  treaties the major human rights declarations and even our own laws and codes and statutes
[3:50:09.040 --> 3:50:14.480]  are being directly violated and it's being done out in the open and government officials
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:20.280]  are actually saying that it's okay that they violate the law and they use trickery like
[3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:26.160]  in this opinion document where they only look at it in the context of that one law.
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:32.240]  They don't look at it under any other statutes like the developmental disabilities or sorry
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:34.520]  the disabilities act.
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:38.520]  So thank you for listening to this complete and long discussion today.
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:58.080]  I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman for the Alex Jones show.
