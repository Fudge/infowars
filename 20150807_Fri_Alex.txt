[00:00.000 --> 00:13.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.320 --> 00:22.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.080 --> 00:33.560]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday August 7th 2015 it was quite a
[00:33.560 --> 00:36.440]  debate last night we're going to be talking about that primarily but we're
[00:36.440 --> 00:39.960]  also going to be joined by Alex Jones who is investigating the globalist
[00:39.960 --> 00:44.080]  takeover of Europe because it's not just Europe of course it is going to be
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.320]  coming here as well interesting that we didn't have any questions at all last
[00:47.320 --> 00:52.080]  night about the secretive trade deals that transatlantic and trans Pacific
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.160]  partnerships that we have not seen but of course the Congress's rubber stamped
[00:56.160 --> 01:01.800]  that through without any inspection from our Congress or any say so about how
[01:01.800 --> 01:04.520]  they're going to amend it they're not going to be allowed to amend it that was
[01:04.520 --> 01:10.640]  just ran through no discussion really except for Rand Paul that's why I like
[01:10.640 --> 01:14.320]  to see him in the debate so it's a very good back and forth between Rand Paul
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.440]  and Chris Christie of course Chris Christie was there as the anti-Paul as
[01:18.440 --> 01:23.880]  the attack dog I think they managed to get him just barely into the top 10 so
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.480]  he could fulfill that role Fox News has a very strong agenda we're going to talk
[01:28.480 --> 01:33.520]  about that of course they got the most amount of time by far last night I think
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.800]  it was we'll talk about we have the exact figures here but it was well over a
[01:38.800 --> 01:44.000]  third of the time they were on the hero here's exactly 30 31.7% of the
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.120]  time you had the anchors talking and I tell you the beginning of it was just
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.120]  amazing not only looking like a beauty contest but really more like a sports
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.280]  contest but they paraded the candidates out there after they had the big stadium
[01:58.280 --> 02:02.160]  and the rah-rah-hoo-hoo you know they have the candidates paraded out there
[02:02.160 --> 02:07.280]  like beauty contestants looking very uncomfortable and you could see Megan
[02:07.280 --> 02:11.760]  Kelly really kind of enjoying it are you guys nervous I know you don't like
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.160]  standing there wave to the audience and they would do everything dutifully just
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.800]  as Megan Kelly told them to do but it was a great visual there for how
[02:19.800 --> 02:24.480]  presidential candidates in this country really are puppets of the powerful in
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.800]  this case they were under the thumb of the Fox News crew of course it was a
[02:29.800 --> 02:33.120]  record audience they say it was not only the most watched primary debate in
[02:33.120 --> 02:38.760]  history it was twice as big as a previous record holder 16% of US homes of
[02:38.760 --> 02:43.240]  television sets tuned in it's the highest rated Republican primary do well
[02:43.240 --> 02:49.080]  in 2011 and 2012 only 5% of households tuned in so this is more than three
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.360]  times number of people that watched the last election cycle and of course we'll
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.920]  look at how they selected their particular candidates they definitely had
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.520]  their sights on Donald Trump and the more they attacked him the better he
[03:03.520 --> 03:06.080]  looked and we're gonna play clips of that as well
[03:06.080 --> 03:10.720]  Takari Jackson is going to be joining us along with Joe Biggs Leanne McAdoo we're
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.200]  gonna have comments from our news staff here we're also going to take your
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.760]  comments on Twitter because there's a lot of comments we'd like to get in so
[03:18.760 --> 03:23.080]  we're gonna have a round table discussion here and we're going to
[03:23.080 --> 03:26.840]  look at comments from you I was live tweeting it last night it was actually a
[03:26.840 --> 03:33.000]  lot of fun somebody commented and asked me if I was drunk said well if I did
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.440]  drink it's times like this I wish I did drink because especially the very first
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.840]  debate the junior varsity debate was unbelievably dull very much like the one
[03:43.840 --> 03:46.960]  that was on Monday night very constrained there was no audience there was no
[03:46.960 --> 03:52.440]  energy to it it was just a repetition of planned speeches nevertheless Carly
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.720]  Fiorina is definitely the darling of Karl Rove and Fox News they've done
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.880]  everything they could to make her larger telling everybody in the audience
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.120]  that she had won the debate then conducting their audience poll and
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.400]  surprise surprise they fed back exactly as it been told like a lot of little
[04:10.400 --> 04:15.760]  Homer Simpson sitting on the couch watching the the news watching the
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.360]  debate and then being told what they think and then regurgitating that back
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.720]  into their machines that's exactly the purpose of Frank Luntz and Donald Trump
[04:24.720 --> 04:30.120]  had some great takedowns of Frank Luntz and Megan Kelly you gotta love it when
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.680]  he does that we're gonna play all this for you as well as Alex Jones live and
[04:34.680 --> 04:39.120]  coming up right after the break a report about what's going on in the Vatican
[04:39.120 --> 04:42.960]  that's where the mask has come off for the globalist agenda Alex Jones will be
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.520]  with us right after the break stay with us

[05:17.200 --> 05:22.840]  up info wars.com Megan Kelly calls out Donald Trump for sexist remarks from his
[05:22.840 --> 05:27.920]  Twitter history you called women you don't like fat pigs dogs slobs and

[05:33.600 --> 05:38.000]  entire crowd laughed presidential hopeful Donald Trump told reporters that he felt
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.440]  the questions Ozam weren't appropriate and the Fox News host Megan Kelly
[05:42.440 --> 05:47.720]  especially behaved very badly last night's GOP debate was always predicted
[05:47.720 --> 05:53.440]  to be the Donald Trump show but the fact that Rand Paul got less than half the
[05:53.440 --> 05:59.160]  speaking time again illustrates how easy it is to freeze out certain candidates

[08:27.520 --> 08:41.560]  Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show this Friday June 8th 2015 I'm David
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.040]  night your host and of course last night was the debate the GOP debate that
[08:46.040 --> 08:50.040]  everybody was anxiously waiting for to see how Donald Trump would do and of
[08:50.040 --> 08:54.440]  course they went straight for the jugular some of the first questions
[08:54.440 --> 08:59.000]  on Fox News it was a huge debate as I mentioned in the last segment they had
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.240]  three times the audience that they did in the 2011-2012 debates 16 percent the
[09:05.240 --> 09:09.480]  United States with television sets tuned in well what did they see well for the
[09:09.480 --> 09:15.560]  most part they saw the Fox reporters steering the debate the way they wanted
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.160]  to not only during the debate but after the debate as they brought in Frank
[09:20.160 --> 09:26.000]  once last night if we look at who got the most time Donald Trump got ten and a
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.600]  half minutes and then followed after that by Jeb Bush with eight and a half
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.520]  minutes then Mike Huckabee with six and a half minutes and it were found falls
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.520]  down rapidly until of course the very bottom is Rand Paul with just over five
[09:39.520 --> 09:44.640]  minutes and of course he got about 15% less than Scott Walker who is above him
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.920]  in number nine place Chris Wallace Megan Kelly and Brett Bear however spoke for
[09:49.920 --> 09:56.560]  31 minutes and 53 seconds about 31.7 percent of the time and we're going to
[09:56.560 --> 10:00.240]  take a look at what Megan Kelly has to say but first I just want to give you a
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.840]  feel for the content of the questions if you were watching the debate last night
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.200]  it's kind of hard to see anything much of any substance I think the really the
[10:10.200 --> 10:13.360]  only substantive discussion that was there we can we can look at the
[10:13.360 --> 10:17.040]  observations going back and forth with what they had to say what it tells us
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.840]  about the candidates but for the most part most of these questions were
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.160]  personal questions they weren't policy questions for example they come out the
[10:25.160 --> 10:28.600]  first thing they do is ask them to take a GOP loyalty oath that was targeted
[10:28.600 --> 10:31.560]  towards Donald Trump and we'll play that for you then they come back the next
[10:31.560 --> 10:35.560]  question is one on electability to Carson then they have a question to
[10:35.560 --> 10:41.160]  Rubio explain to Jeb Rubio why you who've never held executive office should
[10:41.160 --> 10:44.720]  hold executive office then he comes back and he says well if we're going to
[10:44.720 --> 10:49.200]  play the resume game Hillary Clinton wins it's like really really you think
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.800]  Hillary Clinton's got a great resume she's got a great rap sheet she doesn't
[10:52.800 --> 10:58.400]  have a great resume but of course it was a great pivot for Rubio because he then
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.960]  came back and said well I'm one of you I'm a poor person I grew up without a
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.120]  lot of money I'm like the average American only problem is he's not a
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.800]  natural-born citizen his parents were not citizens even though he was born in
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.680]  the United States he's qualified to be a senator if people elect him I wouldn't
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.480]  vote for him but he's he's not qualified under the Constitution under
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.720]  natural-born citizenship as are neither is Cruz or Jindal for that fact then they
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.760]  come into Jeb Jeb are you your own man Jeb comes in he says well in Florida
[11:30.760 --> 11:36.600]  they called me Jeb and I earned it at which point we have to ask what does one
[11:36.600 --> 11:42.000]  do to earn the title Jeb and what does that mean that you earned the title
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.120]  Jeb that's going to be the first thing we're going to take a look at what is
[11:46.120 --> 11:50.280]  going on is he really the pro-life candidate that he puts himself out
[11:50.280 --> 11:55.280]  there to be next thing they come back to Trump Trump you embody the war on
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.200]  women and that's a back-and-forth with Megan Kelly and Donald Trump then to
[11:59.200 --> 12:03.240]  Cruz Paul says you're more divisive than to Christie you've had nine downgrades
[12:03.240 --> 12:08.040]  and credit in New Jersey 44th and growth now that's starting to get to an
[12:08.040 --> 12:14.160]  issue because if you notice all of the Democrat I'm sorry all the governor
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.120]  candidates people who've had the office of governor they'll tell you how they
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.360]  created more jobs than God did in six days and of course he has a very
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.960]  difficult record to defend on that of course all the Republican and Democrat
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.960]  who ran and who are holding a federal office as a senator will tell you that
[12:33.960 --> 12:37.280]  they have all this foreign policy experience they've looked ISIS in the
[12:37.280 --> 12:41.760]  eye and ISIS is blinked and they're the guy who can take you to war and you
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.000]  should be going to war that's what all of the federal candidates will tell you
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.920]  all the gubernatorial candidates will tell you how they created jobs and they
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.520]  cut taxes then finally they go to Walker and we start to get to a real issue they
[12:53.520 --> 12:58.960]  say you don't make exceptions for the life of the mother and on abortion so
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.360]  here we are eight questions before we get to something that is really an issue to
[13:03.360 --> 13:07.160]  talk about we talk about we have a loyalty oath we talk about electability
[13:07.160 --> 13:13.320]  are you your own man are you an executive you don't like women you're
[13:13.320 --> 13:20.960]  divisive really this is the substance of the debate absolutely pathetic but we
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.400]  can discern some of the issues in this even though they don't really talk about
[13:24.400 --> 13:30.600]  them if you guys got that clip ready for Jeb let's get that ready take a look at
[13:30.600 --> 13:33.800]  these articles that are on info wars.com today Texas launches a criminal
[13:33.800 --> 13:38.600]  code probe into gruesome and barbaric planned parenthood fetal organ
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.840]  harvesting claims now of course the governor of Texas is starting a criminal
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.480]  probe planned parenthood has been hit with a defamation charge from the
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.000]  organization that did the video investigations meanwhile what is our
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.560]  Republican leadership doing the people who in most cases got elected
[13:57.560 --> 14:02.640]  office campaigning to stop abortion well Mitch McConnell says planned
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.280]  parenthood should be funded see this is one thing there's no debate about with
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.880]  the elites in the Republican Party and that is that we don't rock the boat we
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.000]  don't take money away from planned parenthood Mitch McConnell moved swiftly
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.360]  on Thursday that's yesterday to shut down any possible conservative attempt to
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.720]  block funding for planned parenthood they says that McConnell would rather
[14:25.720 --> 14:28.880]  have a possibly criminal organization like planned parenthood continue to
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.120]  receive money from the federal treasury than to risk a bad news cycle writes
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.200]  Breitbart they say McConnell explained that a vote last week seeking to define
[14:37.200 --> 14:40.400]  planned parenthood allowed senators to be on the record against this
[14:40.400 --> 14:43.240]  organization says what are you what are you complaining about you got to come
[14:43.240 --> 14:46.640]  out and say that you don't like planned parenthood but we're not going to do
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.280]  anything about it see that's the way McConnell and Boehner actually operate
[14:51.280 --> 14:56.440]  you can go on the record and say that you are opposed to this but don't expect
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.720]  that we're going to do anything about it don't expect that we're going to shut
[15:01.720 --> 15:07.200]  down the government if Obama insists on continuing to give taxpayer money to
[15:07.200 --> 15:12.600]  people that we know are enticing women to have abortions and then selling the
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.800]  baby parts that's precisely what is happening but let's listen to what Jeb
[15:17.800 --> 15:24.240]  Bush says when he presents himself as the pro-life candidate from Florida
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.920]  welcome back gentlemen we're gonna move on now to discuss some social issues
[15:27.920 --> 15:32.520]  across the board Governor Bush let's start with you many Republicans have
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.120]  been outraged recently by a series of videos on planned parenthood you now
[15:37.120 --> 15:40.120]  say that you support ending federal funding for this organization however
[15:40.120 --> 15:44.880]  until late 2014 right before you started your campaign you sat on the board of a
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.920]  Bloomberg charity that quite publicly gave tens of millions of dollars to
[15:48.920 --> 15:52.800]  Planned Parenthood while you were a director how could you not know about
[15:52.800 --> 15:57.720]  these well publicized donations and if you did know how could you help a
[15:57.720 --> 16:01.240]  charity so openly committed to abortion rights I joined the Bloomberg
[16:01.240 --> 16:05.360]  Foundation because of Mike Bloomberg's shared commitment for meaningful
[16:05.360 --> 16:09.560]  education reform that's why I was on it we never had a debate about the
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.720]  budget it was presented and we approved it not item by item here's my
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.920]  record as governor of the state of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood I
[16:18.920 --> 16:25.680]  created a culture of life in our state we were the only state to to appropriate
[16:25.680 --> 16:29.720]  money for crisis pregnancy centers we expanded dramatically the number of
[16:29.720 --> 16:34.600]  adoptions out of our foster care system we created we did parental
[16:34.600 --> 16:38.920]  notification laws we ended partial birth abortion we did all of this and we
[16:38.920 --> 16:42.800]  were the first state to do a choose life license plate now 29 states have done
[16:42.800 --> 16:47.000]  it and tens of millions of dollars have gone to create a culture where more
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.520]  people more babies are adopted did you know no I didn't know but it doesn't
[16:51.520 --> 16:54.920]  matter I was working on this board because of the education my record is
[16:54.920 --> 16:59.720]  clear okay that record is he was working on the board with Bloomberg because of
[16:59.720 --> 17:05.960]  education and what was he doing there he was promoting Common Core now they
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.480]  gave ten million dollars to Planned Parenthood but of course he says that
[17:09.480 --> 17:12.400]  they did all these other things there at the state we got license plates that
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.000]  say I'm pro-life and whatever I don't know how much money the state of Florida
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.320]  was giving Planned Parenthood that he stopped giving them but personally when
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.840]  he's director of a charity that gives ten million dollars to them something is
[17:23.840 --> 17:29.160]  up now let me tell you what's up with this deadstate.org has a good article
[17:29.160 --> 17:34.360]  Jeb Bush would rather you forget that his grandfather helped to found Planned
[17:34.360 --> 17:40.000]  Parenthood the connections of the Bush family are very very deep and long with
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.560]  Planned Parenthood can you name any historical figure who helped Planned
[17:43.560 --> 17:47.720]  Parenthood kick off its first fundraising campaign back in 1947 if you
[17:47.720 --> 17:52.440]  first guessed some progressive liberal icon you'd be wrong it was Prescott
[17:52.440 --> 17:57.360]  Bush and when I look at him saying that he's pro-life I remember that he was
[17:57.360 --> 18:04.880]  governor when Terry Shavo was executed by a probate judge in Florida and Jeb
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.320]  Bush would not lift a finger to help her neither with his brother who was
[18:09.320 --> 18:14.280]  president either one of them could have and should have helped instead they set
[18:14.280 --> 18:19.440]  idly by why people who tried to give her water who tried to give her food were
[18:19.440 --> 18:26.080]  arrested and taken away her husband wanted her taken off of life support her
[18:26.080 --> 18:29.480]  family said we will take care of her they took her off of life support she
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.200]  continued to live she was mentally damaged but they said that she could
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.400]  communicate with them but you want to talk about somebody being pro-life you're
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.400]  going to sit there and watch a handicapped woman be starved to death and
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.160]  arrest the people who try to feed her is that pro-life that's the way the Bush
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.400]  is to find it it is no surprise to me to understand that his grandfather
[18:49.400 --> 18:54.400]  Prescott Bush was one of the founders of Planned Parenthood here's some more
[18:54.400 --> 18:59.200]  information first resurfacing in a 2005 article in San Francisco Gate it reveals
[18:59.200 --> 19:04.480]  that their that their grandfather and their father the Bushes Prescott Bush
[19:04.480 --> 19:07.600]  was treasure of the organization in its early years I say the political
[19:07.600 --> 19:11.440]  repercussions hit him hard Prescott Bush was knocked out of it expected
[19:11.440 --> 19:15.600]  victory for the Senate seat in Connecticut in 1950 after a syndicated
[19:15.600 --> 19:20.200]  columnist Drew Pearson declared that had been made known that Bush was a leader
[19:20.200 --> 19:25.120]  in the birth control society that's the old name of Planned Parenthood and back
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.200]  in those days people understood what that was about and then they go on to
[19:30.200 --> 19:38.080]  show a letter in 1972 from George H. W. Bush to the president of Planned
[19:38.080 --> 19:41.600]  Parenthood my congratulations to you and your colleagues on your family planning
[19:41.600 --> 19:47.280]  stamp efforts like this that would help further such worldwide at things of such

[24:31.680 --> 24:37.200]  watched the debates the last election cycle the highest rated debate twice as
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.160]  high as a previous record and of course primarily it was because of Donald Trump
[24:42.160 --> 24:46.840]  and we're going to have the first back and forth in terms of the loyalty oath
[24:46.840 --> 24:49.640]  we're going to play that in just one moment but before I do I just want to
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.560]  let you know as a thank you to our audience we extended free shipping this

[25:44.360 --> 25:50.040]  stock at info wars life.com you can take advantage of that right now let's go
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.120]  back to the debate and of course the debate began with something that I
[25:54.120 --> 25:59.760]  thought was pretty amazing as well as pretty childish the whole thing looked
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.720]  like a sporting's contest from the very beginning they have this big arena they
[26:03.720 --> 26:07.800]  actually even self-consciously talked about how much it was like a sports
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.600]  contest they even had a sweet 16 bracket they had the weather report
[26:12.600 --> 26:15.840]  essentially they had some ladies standing there with a map that had red
[26:15.840 --> 26:19.480]  areas on it I fully expected to hear her say that there was going to be a
[26:19.480 --> 26:23.440]  Democrat front moving up from the south and west expected flooding over the
[26:23.440 --> 26:29.800]  entire nation but then they go with a very first question to this loyalty oath
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.640]  essentially asking them are you going to stay in the Republican Party if you
[26:34.640 --> 26:38.800]  don't win the nomination of course this was targeted directly at Donald Trump
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.800]  and he didn't back down this is what happened gentlemen we know how much you
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.440]  love hand-raising questions so we promise this is the only one tonight the
[26:50.440 --> 26:57.160]  only one is there anyone on stage and can I see hands who is unwilling tonight
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.880]  to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and
[27:01.880 --> 27:08.400]  pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person again we're
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.120]  looking for you to raise your hand now raise your hand now if you won't make
[27:13.120 --> 27:22.320]  that pledge tonight and you got to give him credit for the guts to have this and
[27:22.320 --> 27:24.920]  I think that's why it didn't really stick all their attacks on him
[27:24.920 --> 27:30.320]  Republican primary I fully understand the place where the RNC will give the
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.400]  nominee the nod I fully understand and that experts say an independent run
[27:35.400 --> 27:38.960]  would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another
[27:38.960 --> 27:44.440]  Clinton you can't say tonight that you can make that pledge I cannot say I have
[27:44.440 --> 27:49.640]  to respect the person that if it's not me the person that wins if I do win and
[27:49.640 --> 27:53.840]  I'm leading by quite a bit that's what I want to do I can totally make that pledge
[27:53.840 --> 27:59.600]  if I'm the nominee I will pledge I would not run as an independent but and I am
[27:59.600 --> 28:05.800]  discussing talking about a lot of leverage we want to win and we will
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.400]  win but I want to win as the Republican I want to run as the Republican nominee
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.520]  so tonight you can't say if another one of these what's wrong I mean what's
[28:15.520 --> 28:23.440]  wrong this is Rand Paul buys and sells politicians of all stripes he's already
[28:23.440 --> 28:28.480]  hedging his bet on the Clintons okay so if he doesn't run as a Republican maybe
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.880]  he supports Clinton or maybe runs as an independent okay but I'd say that he's
[28:32.880 --> 28:36.480]  already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politician well I've
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.920]  given plenty of money yeah and it turns out that that's not true he says at one
[28:40.920 --> 28:44.080]  point says well most of people on the stage I've given a lot of money to and
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.880]  he says points to Rand Paul he says I've given him a lot of money well the fact
[28:47.880 --> 28:51.600]  is they've we've had a lot of organizations do the fact check actually
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.960]  he didn't he gave $500 to Jeb Bush he gave essentially zeroed everybody else
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.840]  who's on the stage with him including Rand Paul zeroed him Rubio put out he
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.280]  says most of people on stage I've given a lot of money to he tweeted this out he
[29:04.280 --> 29:10.360]  says not me not me to be clear you supported Charlie Christ and that's
[29:10.360 --> 29:13.200]  absolutely true now the question the reason this comes up of course we've
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.680]  mentioned this as well are the deep ties that Donald Trump has had to the
[29:17.680 --> 29:22.600]  Clinton family the phone calls that they had in May just before he entered the
[29:22.600 --> 29:26.200]  race the amounts of money that he's given to them the Clinton Foundation
[29:26.200 --> 29:29.680]  according to Politico got a hundred thousand dollars from Donald Trump in
[29:29.680 --> 29:34.880]  addition to $25,000 to Democrat candidates in 2006 and of course is he
[29:34.880 --> 29:40.000]  buying influence he says well you know when I talk to them they do things for
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.960]  me and they do think like what she came to my wedding he gave all that money to
[29:44.960 --> 29:48.720]  the Clinton Foundation so she'd come to his wedding right stay with us we'll be
[29:48.720 --> 29:54.440]  right back with a report we're on March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:54.440 --> 30:04.280]  the GCN radio network Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards wants all those bogus
[30:04.280 --> 30:09.480]  videos released at once spoken like someone who really wants to know how
[30:09.480 --> 30:14.440]  much dirt they have on her so she can get her story straight the Center for
[30:14.440 --> 30:18.680]  Medical Progress has hours more footage in the can and is deliberately
[30:18.680 --> 30:23.000]  drip feeding it to the public to keep the issue of organ harvesting from
[30:23.000 --> 30:28.720]  aborted fetuses in the headlines and Planned Parenthood hates it Richards
[30:28.720 --> 30:33.760]  took to Twitter yesterday to complain about the method saying leaking one at a
[30:33.760 --> 30:40.160]  time is playing politics of course this method is being used to maximize impact
[30:40.160 --> 30:44.120]  as it rightfully should releasing them all at once would amount to a little
[30:44.120 --> 30:48.720]  more than outrage of the day status and then it'll be quickly swept under the
[30:48.720 --> 30:54.160]  rug not this time Planned Parenthood follow this story and the slow

[33:14.120 --> 33:22.400]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:22.400 --> 33:37.080]  August 7th 2015 the day info wars goes inside the walls of Vatican City to
[33:37.080 --> 33:43.840]  investigate the unprecedented moves by the new pope to openly promote planetary
[33:43.840 --> 33:49.960]  world government carbon taxes and wealth redistribution all of this coming
[33:49.960 --> 33:55.360]  from the leader of an organization that's tax exempt worldwide and is one of
[33:55.360 --> 33:58.960]  the biggest property owners on the planet and as one of the most wealthy
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.000]  private banks the Vatican Bank lecturing the middle class of the planet that they
[34:04.000 --> 34:11.040]  need to pay more taxes to quote help the poor this is an globalist agenda 101 we
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.560]  got the Copenhagen Treaty for climate change five years ago and the whole
[34:16.560 --> 34:20.520]  thing was planetary government basically double taxes on the third world but was
[34:20.520 --> 34:25.600]  sold as helping the third world under the carbon tax initiatives that Lord
[34:25.600 --> 34:29.880]  Moncton others have actually worried out and broken down a billion people in a
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.400]  decade will starve to death already 35 million people roughly half of them
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.160]  children starve to death each year most third-world population spend about 45
[34:40.160 --> 34:45.480]  percent of the discretionary income on food in a global depression which this
[34:45.480 --> 34:49.440]  system will cause and what's designed to cause designed to create quote zero
[34:49.440 --> 34:56.280]  growth that's code word for negative new dark age implosion you will see 45 go
[34:56.280 --> 35:02.200]  up to 50 55 60 70 percent of income towards food when it passes 50
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.640]  historically riots break out all over the world that's why this is so serious
[35:07.640 --> 35:13.160]  so as we look out on the ancient city of Rome where we get the word romantic when
[35:13.160 --> 35:17.440]  we look out on this city carbon taxes will hurt this city big time it'll hurt
[35:17.440 --> 35:22.640]  terrorism it'll hurt power prices it'll hurt the average Roman who's already on
[35:22.640 --> 35:27.080]  the verge of depression and even the mayor of Rome says the city may collapse
[35:27.080 --> 35:32.840]  but if you look south of here to Africa or east of here to the Middle East it is
[35:32.840 --> 35:39.800]  a death sentence to have carbon taxes raised and this same pope hasn't said a
[35:39.800 --> 35:45.520]  word about Planned Parenthood and its vivisection of babies it hasn't said a
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.760]  word about the organs selling he hasn't said a word about anything that past
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.680]  popes would have so I want to be clear this is a clear break from previous
[35:54.680 --> 35:58.200]  popes folks who wanted me to criticize the Vatican or they wanted me to defend
[35:58.200 --> 36:03.320]  it I don't take sides I just covered the fruits of the tree and anyone can look
[36:03.320 --> 36:09.440]  at this new pope and say it's like having well Phil Castro doesn't promote gay
[36:09.440 --> 36:15.960]  marriage so I guess worse than Phil Castro and again I'm not bashing quote
[36:15.960 --> 36:19.400]  gay people out there the point is is that the religion of Christianity and
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.080]  the institution of marriage is about men and women and it's okay for men and
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.520]  women to have their institutions other people can have theirs this is a complete
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.000]  cultural takeover so whether it's abortion or marriage first thing you
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.240]  did a couple years ago when Pope Francis got in the first Jesuit Pope by the way
[36:39.240 --> 36:47.000]  was to say quote Catholics need to start stop obsessing on abortion so much
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.640]  we'll see that was one of the great fruits that I could look at Catholics
[36:50.640 --> 36:55.800]  and say at least they're fighting abortion worldwide and and and Planned
[36:55.800 --> 37:00.800]  Parenthood now that's just all gone and so again we're going to go into the
[37:00.800 --> 37:06.960]  Vatican we're gonna go in just in a public tour and investigate and then use
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.400]  the backdrop to try to illustrate what's happening and educate people and
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.480]  really try to spur a debate about this I mean we've seen other treasonous
[37:14.480 --> 37:19.280]  seditious activities by the church under the sky the last three years getting
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.580]  bishops to haul free legals to pour in to the United States and aiding and
[37:23.580 --> 37:27.680]  abetting them to get IDs and driver's license I mean I can't go to the church
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.680]  in Mexico and have them do that for me as an American and again that's part of
[37:31.680 --> 37:38.400]  the globalist agenda the Catholic Church fully now is behind the New World Order
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.880]  push for planetary government they are pushing the agendas 100% and of course
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.440]  it was previous pups that fought communism this pope is is is 180 degrees
[37:48.440 --> 37:51.760]  the opposite direction of previous pups I mean it's that simple and I know
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.520]  there's all these criticisms of the last four or five and I get it I've studied
[37:55.520 --> 38:01.520]  it but you notice mainstream media pretty much attacked those people this is
[38:01.520 --> 38:05.480]  about blackmail the Catholic Church is clearly been taken over you see what
[38:05.480 --> 38:10.000]  you wanted to about it before had its problems but now being infiltrated by
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.840]  the globalists by their sex cults their pedophile cults that infest every major
[38:13.840 --> 38:19.240]  group just look at the news they are now able to blackmail the last pope to have
[38:19.240 --> 38:23.600]  him run off to a nearby castle where he basically lives in absentia where he
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.000]  basically lives like you know Napoleon on Alba where he lives you know in
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.160]  exile and now the church just does whatever basically MSNBC says I mean
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.840]  the Catholic Church is now like a religion of MSNBC it's the religion of
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.440]  Rachel Maddow I mean you might as well have Rachel Maddow as the Pontiff with
[38:44.440 --> 38:53.520]  the hat on speaking from the great black throne ex Cathedral and that's it
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.200]  they're God and so the one world religion is here notice world governments
[38:57.200 --> 39:02.240]  being promoted by the Pope planetary taxes I mean it's just unprecedented to
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.720]  see all of this happening the new order is death it's global taxes it is a new
[39:07.720 --> 39:11.280]  dark age of control with the elite above the law and exempt that's why we're
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.160]  here documenting all of this and we've got tons of great HD footage interviews
[39:15.160 --> 39:18.080]  all over Rome we'll be putting together a mini documentary when we get back to
[39:18.080 --> 39:23.600]  Austin Texas for inforce not only news and the syndicated radio TV show but
[39:23.600 --> 39:27.440]  it's important that we say no to the globalist and put a clear choice out
[39:27.440 --> 39:31.240]  there to stand up for private property stand up for family to stand up for the
[39:31.240 --> 39:37.440]  unborn stand up for the innocent to stand up for basic culture that the new
[39:37.440 --> 39:42.280]  world order like the the Borg are trying to overwrite so we're going into the
[39:42.280 --> 39:45.160]  Vatican ladies and gentlemen I don't expect I'll be banned from entering but
[39:45.160 --> 39:51.000]  who knows I might be I've been speaking ill of the Pontiff that is this
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.080]  basically it's like having a Soviet president as the head of the Vatican or
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.000]  something I mean it's like having it's like having cruise chef or something as
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.760]  the as the new pope just unbelievably outrageously in your face globalism and
[40:06.760 --> 40:10.640]  it's just starting because we've now reached the point of no return we've
[40:10.640 --> 40:14.440]  now reached the event horizon of going into world government going into the
[40:14.440 --> 40:19.600]  new world order the good news is people are now awake the Patriots for 50 years
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.120]  warned us it's all coming true so our credibility is very very high your
[40:23.120 --> 40:26.760]  credibility is high as listeners and activists get out there expose the
[40:26.760 --> 40:31.120]  tyranny for every action under Newtonian physics there is an opposite and equal
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.480]  reaction or equal and opposite reaction and so understand you have power as well
[40:36.480 --> 40:40.880]  and now is the time to bring light and salt to the earth now is the time to
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.560]  bring light to the world now is the time to expose what's happening because the
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.560]  people are good and the people of Rome are good the people of Barcelona are
[40:48.560 --> 40:52.880]  good the people of Texas are good the people of you know Africa are good the
[40:52.880 --> 40:57.080]  people of every city state around the world just want freedom and and and I
[40:57.080 --> 41:02.000]  close with these tax exempt globalists behind these walls led by this new world
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.760]  order puppet it is just outrageous that they would be above the law it is
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.400]  outrageous that they would be tax exempt and live like the most opulent kings of
[41:11.400 --> 41:17.080]  history greater than Roman emperors on the very hills were you know Rome ruled
[41:17.080 --> 41:24.000]  with the very loot of the Roman temples hauled in to build st. Peter's facility
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.720]  here is just again unprecedented the hypocrisy the paradox is just mind
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.880]  blowing they say a picture tells a thousand words video tells a million
[41:33.880 --> 41:37.880]  words Alex Jones signing off for now next time we'll be reporting from inside
[41:37.880 --> 41:44.760]  the Vatican for info wars.com the front lines of truth journalism and again
[41:44.760 --> 41:50.240]  that's Alex Jones reporting from Rome from the Vatican area and as we pointed
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.440]  out many times this is part of the globalist agenda to take over and to
[41:55.440 --> 42:00.320]  justify world government. Schellenhuber that the Pope put on to his Scientific
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.280]  Advisory Council has long been a depopulationist isn't it amazing to see
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.240]  the Catholic Church leader distance himself from this debate that's going on
[42:11.240 --> 42:17.880]  in America not only over what marriage is but especially over these videos that
[42:17.880 --> 42:20.920]  are showing up in Planned Parenthood. This is something that the Catholic
[42:20.920 --> 42:24.280]  Church has always thought as a matter of fact the fellow who did this
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.280]  investigation was motivated because of his Catholic faith to do this and yet the
[42:28.280 --> 42:32.760]  Pope and the official Catholic Church has largely been out of this but they're
[42:32.760 --> 42:39.440]  not silent about setting up a global governance because of man-made global
[42:39.440 --> 42:42.920]  warming. As I said yesterday if you really think the predominant effect on
[42:42.920 --> 42:49.360]  the climate is man-made then why do we still have seasons okay think about that.
[42:49.360 --> 42:53.360]  I want to get back to the debate that we had last night and I want to move on to
[42:53.360 --> 42:57.000]  another topic and of course this is one that is dear to my heart if you've ever
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.560]  listened to me you know that I care very deeply about the loss of individual
[43:02.560 --> 43:07.600]  liberty that we have had in this country in the name of the war on terror in the
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.160]  name of the war on drugs and of course it's only getting worse with the
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.720]  war on terror and one of the candidates that popped up last night that is being
[43:15.720 --> 43:22.320]  touted by Fox News relentlessly and continuously as Carly Fiorina and I
[43:22.320 --> 43:25.920]  was really amazed after watching the first debate when they started pumping
[43:25.920 --> 43:29.400]  her I turned to my wife and I said really what did she say she said well
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.640]  she had a pretty good take down to Donald Trump it's like okay well maybe I
[43:32.640 --> 43:35.720]  know that Fox News doesn't like Donald Trump and they made that very clear in
[43:35.720 --> 43:43.360]  the debate but it's far more than that folks she has some very deep ties to the
[43:43.360 --> 43:47.880]  NSA the CIA the surveillance state we'll talk about that but first what do you
[43:47.880 --> 43:52.200]  need to know about Carly Fiorina this is from the Daily Telegraph they say well
[43:52.200 --> 43:57.360]  she once served as an advisor for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign hmm
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.440]  she also was the one of the most powerful women in corporate America from
[44:01.440 --> 44:08.520]  1999 to 2005 she was CEO at Hewlett Packard she helped engineer a highly
[44:08.520 --> 44:13.280]  criticized merger with Compact Computer that resulted in large layoffs the
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.960]  company's stock price dropped more than 50% during her tenure and she was pushed
[44:18.960 --> 44:25.240]  out by the board of directors not exactly a stellar history here if you're
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.400]  going to count yourself as a business expert so she's got six years as a CEO
[44:30.400 --> 44:36.360]  thanks the company stock 50% folks that's pretty pretty serious lots of
[44:36.360 --> 44:39.080]  layoffs and she gets pushed out but here's the thing that I'm really
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.240]  concerned about although she's never held an elected office or served in a
[44:43.240 --> 44:48.000]  cabinet position after her departure former CIA director Michael Hayden
[44:48.000 --> 44:55.440]  selected Ms. Fiorina to chair the CIA's external advisory board in 2007 she
[44:55.440 --> 44:59.000]  warned Mr. Hayden that his spy agency would need to adapt to the public's
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.960]  expectations of privacy he said she's contributed a great deal now she knew at
[45:06.960 --> 45:10.520]  that time what was going on with the dragnet surveillance she had no problem
[45:10.520 --> 45:15.120]  with it she's telling him here's how you can spin it here's how you can adapt to
[45:15.120 --> 45:20.720]  their expectations not why don't you follow the Constitution back on June
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.680]  11th she appeared on Fox News Channel's special report and she was questioned by
[45:24.680 --> 45:28.200]  Judge Napolitano he asked her about her role in helping to create the massive
[45:28.200 --> 45:32.480]  surveillance program while she was head of Hewlett Packard and then later when
[45:32.480 --> 45:37.040]  she joined the CIA's advisory board he said one of the things you did Carly
[45:37.040 --> 45:41.600]  when you ran HPN in the years after was to help them and then director general
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.680]  Michael Hayden to set up the most extensive spy apparatus in the world
[45:45.680 --> 45:49.200]  one that is capable of intercepting every phone call every email every text
[45:49.200 --> 45:52.880]  message of everyone in the United States are you proud of where that spy
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.400]  system has gotten us today should it be dialed back she says well yes I would
[45:57.400 --> 46:01.760]  dial it back somewhat but I think it's a bad idea to give up all the
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.400]  responsibility of collecting the data to phone companies because they don't have
[46:06.400 --> 46:13.800]  the ability to do it as well as the government yeah there you go more of it
[46:13.800 --> 46:18.120]  and we just need to the only problem is that the the telephone companies aren't
[46:18.120 --> 46:23.520]  doing it well enough and what she said last night she went full-on for
[46:23.520 --> 46:28.800]  information sharing she went full-on for taking down encryption for breaking
[46:28.800 --> 46:32.160]  down cyber walls as she pointed out she said in the debate last night we're
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.080]  gonna play that clip for you she said these barriers that are up there these
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.960]  cyber walls they need to be taken down by Google and Apple we need to force
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.360]  them take them down because it makes it harder for law enforcement to do their
[46:43.360 --> 46:49.600]  job and see that's the primary concern of all politicians it's how do we make it
[46:49.600 --> 46:55.200]  easier for law enforcement to do their job that is the hallmark of a totalitarian
[46:55.200 --> 47:02.280]  state we have lost our focus on liberty we have lost our focus on the Bill of
[47:02.280 --> 47:07.080]  Rights the prohibition the rule of law all we want to do is make it easier for
[47:07.080 --> 47:12.360]  the security state and as I've said many times if your only concern is maximum
[47:12.360 --> 47:17.320]  security you'll find yourself living in a maximum security prison here's Carly
[47:17.320 --> 47:22.360]  Farina's comments last night on the surveillance state Carly Farina the FBI
[47:22.360 --> 47:28.040]  director Comey says that terrorists can thrive here at home because they go dark
[47:28.040 --> 47:33.360]  and they recruit behind the cyber walls that are built by American companies
[47:33.360 --> 47:40.120]  like Google and Apple Comey says this is a big problem but Rand Paul says that
[47:40.120 --> 47:44.440]  the government forcing these companies to bring down those walls would be a big
[47:44.440 --> 47:48.760]  privacy issue and a dangerous way to go on this you've been a tech leader in
[47:48.760 --> 47:55.400]  this country which side are you on well let me say first that it is disturbing
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.960]  that every time one of these homegrown terrorist attacks occurs and as your
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.880]  question points out there occurring with far too great frequency it turns out
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.280]  we had warning signals it turns out we knew something was wrong it turns out
[48:10.280 --> 48:15.320]  some dot wasn't connected and so the first thing we have to do is make sure
[48:15.320 --> 48:20.720]  that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.000]  possibilities and symptoms we even had warnings about the Boston Marathon
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.080]  bombers and yet the dots weren't connected so we need to get on a
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.840]  different mindset secondly I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber
[48:34.840 --> 48:40.000]  walls not on a mass basis but on a targeted basis but let me just say that
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.840]  we also need down to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting that
[48:44.840 --> 48:49.720]  Russia is erecting we need to be very well aware of the fact that China and
[48:49.720 --> 48:55.160]  Russia are using technology to attack we need to be aware that we even want to
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.720]  spy on China and Russia but especially here in America we need to get those
[48:59.720 --> 49:03.760]  cyber walls torn down and that's what CISPA has always been about and they've
[49:03.760 --> 49:09.120]  reintroduced it calling it CISA it's still cyber information sharing where
[49:09.120 --> 49:12.680]  they are giving legal immunity to the corporations leaning on them to get that
[49:12.680 --> 49:17.040]  information but as Carly points out she doesn't really want to be dependent on
[49:17.040 --> 49:20.280]  these corporations to get the information she wants the government to go get it
[49:20.280 --> 49:25.680]  directly no discussion whatsoever no concern of individual liberty of the
[49:25.680 --> 49:29.880]  Fourth Amendment or anything else now they had Chris Christie in that debate
[49:29.880 --> 49:34.320]  last night and you understand the reason Chris Christie made that cut as low as
[49:34.320 --> 49:39.720]  his poll numbers are was because they wanted him as the anti Rand Paul and
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.160]  we're going to play that clip once we get back after the break but they wanted
[49:44.160 --> 49:47.520]  somebody who is going to go head-to-head with Rand Paul and they've been going
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.000]  back and forth in the press well before this debate they knew exactly where this
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.520]  was going to go and they pushed that at the very beginning we're going to have
[49:55.520 --> 49:59.080]  that back-and-forth exchange and we're going to talk about what is really
[49:59.080 --> 50:04.720]  behind that when we come back from the clip and of course that is the fundamental
[50:04.720 --> 50:10.720]  question does Christie misunderstand the Fourth Amendment or does he just have
[50:10.720 --> 50:16.040]  contempt for it and of course the answer is he has contempt for it when you hear
[50:16.040 --> 50:21.160]  Carly when you hear Chris Christie say we need to have all the information we
[50:21.160 --> 50:25.160]  can get and no matter how many times they fail whether it is 9-11 or the
[50:25.160 --> 50:28.000]  Boston bombing they want to tell us these are terrorist events that they
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  could have stopped we have been told by NSA whistleblowers like William Benny
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.520]  and Thomas Drake and others repeatedly that everything that they had enough
[50:36.520 --> 50:40.000]  that they could have stopped it but they didn't and that everything that they're
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.440]  collecting the way they're doing is simply making the haystack bigger and
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.000]  more difficult to find the needle and that's not really what the purpose of
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.640]  this is about it is total information awareness on the American people
[50:51.640 --> 50:55.480]  destruction of our way of life and our rule of law stay with us we'll be right
[50:55.480 --> 51:02.960]  back with that quote so I say the market lunch look you know I keep hearing from
[51:02.960 --> 51:06.520]  the government that you know they're worried someday ISIS may get here and

[56:08.000 --> 56:14.160]  to attack the Fourth Amendment to push the surveillance state this is a great
[56:14.160 --> 56:18.300]  back-and-forth it is something I think is the most substantive part of the
[56:18.300 --> 56:21.780]  debate let's play that clip right now because I'm the only person on this
[56:21.780 --> 56:27.080]  stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act who have gone
[56:27.080 --> 56:30.880]  before the federal the foreign intelligence service court who has
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.040]  prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.000]  September 11th I was appointed US Attorney by President Bush on September
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.280]  10th 2001 and the world changed enormously the next day and it happened in
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.960]  my state this is not theoretical to me I went to the funerals we lost friends of
[56:48.960 --> 56:52.400]  ours in the Trade Center that day my own wife was two blocks from the Trade
[56:52.400 --> 56:55.840]  Center that day at her office having gone through it that morning when you
[56:55.840 --> 57:00.200]  actually have to be responsible for doing this you can do it and we did it
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.400]  for seven years in my office respecting civil liberties and protecting the
[57:04.400 --> 57:08.760]  homeland and I will make no apologies ever for protecting the lives and the
[57:08.760 --> 57:12.960]  safety of the American people we have to give more tools to our folks to be
[57:12.960 --> 57:16.760]  able to that not fewer and that just the secret court not just the Patriot Act
[57:16.760 --> 57:20.200]  see them to do it the right way as president that is exactly what I'll do
[57:20.200 --> 57:27.080]  Megan may I respond go ahead sir the Republicans love that as red meat for
[57:27.080 --> 57:31.200]  the Republican base I want to collect more records from terrorists but less
[57:31.200 --> 57:37.600]  records from innocent Americans the fourth amendment was what we fought the
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.520]  revolution over John Adams said it was a spark that led to our war for
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.680]  independence and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights and I will
[57:46.680 --> 57:53.080]  continue to stand for the Bill of Rights and Megan Megan that's a that you
[57:53.080 --> 57:57.440]  know that's a completely ridiculous answer I want to collect more records
[57:57.440 --> 58:12.400]  from terrorists but less records from other people when you're sitting in a
[58:12.400 --> 58:16.720]  subcommittee just blowing hot air about this you can say things like that when
[58:16.720 --> 58:20.560]  you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people then what
[58:20.560 --> 58:27.840]  you need to do is to make sure is to make sure that you fundamentally
[58:27.840 --> 58:33.280]  misunderstand the Bill of Rights every time you did a case you got a warrant
[58:33.280 --> 58:38.840]  from a judge I'm talking about searches without warrants indistriminately of
[58:38.840 --> 58:43.360]  all Americans records yeah he fundamentally that's the one thing I
[58:43.360 --> 58:47.000]  disagree with Rand Paul about is that he doesn't fundamentally misunderstand it
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.600]  he has contempt for it when he takes a note to the Constitution most of the
[58:50.600 --> 58:55.320]  info wars radio listening audience is aware of the high quality affordable

[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:29.520]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.640]  we're gonna be joined from Rome by Alex Jones who is there now investigating
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.480]  the globalist takeover of Europe we're also gonna be joined by others in the
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.520]  nightly news by Jakari Jackson by Joe Biggs by Leanne McAdoo with their

[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.240]  comments in the third hour we want to get your comments and your questions for
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.200]  us but we're gonna talk about what we saw at the debate we've been talking
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.680]  about the various issues I have to say that that exchange that we're playing in
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.320]  the last segment and we ran out of time in that last segment that was I think the
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.720]  center point of the debate because that's about the only time you're going to
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.320]  see the Republicans talk about if the government has gone too far in the
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.040]  surveillance state we saw Chris Christie bragging about his credentials
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.840]  saying that he has prosecuted the only one there who's prosecuted people under
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.520]  the Patriot Act he's gone to the FISA court you know that secretive Star
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.120]  Chamber court they created is supposed to be the foreign intelligence
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.960]  surveillance act that was set up by the church committee because of abuses of
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:40.800]  our intelligence community by the CIA by the NSA but now they use it as a rubber
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.360]  stamp for surveillance against everyone in the United States as Rand Paul has
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.360]  pointed out they go to the FISA court and they say I've got a search warrant
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.120]  here that I want to listen to Mr. and Mrs. Verizon I've got another one for Mr.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.840]  Mrs. AT&T and so on and so forth that's the way this has happened now and so
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.720]  Rand Paul is saying get a search warrant use the Fourth Amendment people have a
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.840]  right for privacy and their person their home their effects they have
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.520]  completely turned this upside down you know they invented the right to
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.760]  abortion out of the Fourth Amendment saying that that gave people a right of
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:23.600]  privacy isn't it ironic that they can't find any other use of privacy from the
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.640]  Supreme Court except for an abortion the rest of our obvious privacy rights are
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.800]  totally ignored let's play a little bit of that clip at the very end because we
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.920]  didn't get that just before we went to the break and I think you need to hear
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.720]  it again anyway let's play that listen senator you know when you're sitting in
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.680]  the subcommittee just blowing hot air about this you can say things like that
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.760]  when you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people then
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:52.320]  what you need to hold it there right there when you're blowing hot air see
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.560]  he had just said it's the Fourth Amendment get a search warrant go before
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.560]  a judge what do you do when you go before a judge you say I have a specific
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.320]  reason to go after this specific person for this and this specific place and
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.040]  time that's what the Fourth Amendment was for and Rand Paul is right that's why
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.800]  we fought the Revolutionary War it's one of the main abuses of power by the
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.920]  government at that time but for Chris Christie if you talk about the Fourth
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.440]  Amendment or the Bill of Rights you're just blowing hot air because that's
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.760]  what he's been doing that giant windbag and the rest of the GOP have been
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.240]  blowing hot air in your face talking about how they love the Constitution and
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.800]  the Bill of Rights as they shred it in front of your face saying you don't want
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.280]  any liberty you just want security and I'll provide it for you here's there's
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.320]  the rest of that let's continue on with that here's the problem governor you
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.640]  fundamentally and misunderstand the Bill of Rights every time you did a case you
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.840]  got a warrant from a judge I'm talking about searches without warrants
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.280]  indistriminately of all Americans records and that's what I fought to end I
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.440]  don't trust President Obama with our records I know you gave him a big hug
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:09.840]  and if you want to give him a big hug again go right in and you know you know
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.480]  senator Paul senator Paul you know the hugs that I remember are the hugs that
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.040]  I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th those are the
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.960]  hugs I remember and those had nothing to do and those had nothing to do with
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.080]  politics unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.440]  Senate then putting them on the internet within a half an hour to raise money for
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.820]  your campaign and while still putting our country at risk
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:38.720]  he's running he's waving the bloody flag of 9-11 yes we all know that people
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.280]  died at 9-11 the question is why and we've had NSA whistleblowers tell us
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.240]  that it was because of the same things that they that they're now defending
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.880]  stay with us we're gonna have Alex Jones joining us reporting live from the
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:05:00.600]  gates of the Vatican right after the break stay with us this is Joe Biggs
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:06.080]  with info wars.com now last night we had the first GOP debate it was a very
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:12.360]  heated debate between the GOP and Donald Trump Trump to Megan Kelly I don't have
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.520]  time for political correctness and neither does this country
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.120]  Megan Kelly calls out Donald Trump for sexist remarks from his Twitter history
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.560]  you called women you don't like fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.640]  Trump replied with no only Rosie O'Donnell and everyone in the entire crowd
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.560]  laughed presidential hopeful Donald Trump told reporters that he felt the
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.920]  questions pose him weren't appropriate in the Fox News hosts Megan Kelly
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:45.160]  especially behaved very badly last night's GOP debate was always predicted
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:50.640]  to be the Donald Trump show but the fact that Ray and Paul got less than half
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.840]  the speaking time again illustrates how easy it is to freeze out certain

[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:20.520]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Friday August 7th 2015 I'm David
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:26.160]  Knight in Austin and we take you now live to Alex Jones who's reporting from the
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.320]  gates of the Vatican City Alex that's right my friends and I'm gonna be
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.760]  breaking down the developments and what we learned inside in the detailed
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.480]  special tour of the Vatican today but before we get to that we'll obviously
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.680]  cover the latest news breaking analysis and what's unfolding as we kick off the
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.760]  second hour but remember the word Vatican has nothing to do with Christianity
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:55.840]  but the goddess basically the word Vatican comes from who could tell the
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.160]  future and the group that came before the Romans actually worshipped at a
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:07.440]  holy site where the Vatican is built today the goddess of the Vatican or it
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.720]  translates into a longer word but means Vatican in Latin and so that's what
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.000]  Google and the New World Order and the NSA want to be able to do is basically
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.520]  control the future by mass manipulating the population and surveilling us to be
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.520]  able to then project and predict the future and then of course dominate and
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.640]  control the future and it's so amazing to live in the day in age growing up as a
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.080]  child you know hearing that someday you'll hear a poke call for world
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:43.080]  government and world taxes and a world religion and when you hear that it means
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.080]  that's the false prophet whether that's true or not boy how did all these
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.520]  preachers I've listened to on the radio in Dallas when my mom was driving me
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.720]  back and forth to school or to the grocery store how did that now come
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:00.240]  true I mean whether it's biblical whether it's it's it's it's people
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:08.120]  predicting the future whether it's prophecy it's happening and we're
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.440]  talking about world government of an unelected group of private central banks
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:20.520]  taxing everything we do being fed in to the United Nations into the IMF into the
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:25.600]  World Bank and then Vatican City itself just literally a quarter mile from me
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.880]  the walls are just through the woods right there is the most sovereign state
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.080]  in the world and the Pope is still the only true completely sovereign monarch
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:40.760]  because no laws apply they tell you this inside the Vatican no laws apply no
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.480]  taxes no regulations absolutely infallible in their words with the two
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.840]  keys one temporal earthly power one the power over souls they believe the Pope
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:57.200]  himself can say excommunicate and you're going to hell so we're talking God on
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.160]  earth and now that God on earth is saying world governments the answer and
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.320]  don't talk about abortion anymore as the new papa said a few years ago when he
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.880]  got in he said Catholics obsess over abortion too much you can actually
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.920]  that's the quote obsessed he said in the Latin you can pull it up so stop
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:22.760]  obsessing sell those baby parts the papa will help the papa the papa will
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.760]  push the world government on you so I'll be breaking that down on the next
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.000]  segment and again I believe that most Catholics I know are really good
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.880]  hard-working smart people and I just treat by its fruits these are people
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.440]  fighting corruption fight evil so I've not sat here in judgment saying the
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.840]  Catholic Church is evil Catholic Church is apostate the Catholic Church is the
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.240]  devil I'm just a Christian I'm not a Protestant I'm not a Catholic I'm not a
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:51.360]  Calvinist I'm sorry I don't believe you know total pre destination I do believe
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.440]  God is inclined towards certain people and then certain people are you know
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.000]  blessed if they take those blessings in their hands but at the same time you
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.600]  got a judge a tree by its fruits and and I'm just non-denominational nonpartisan
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.880]  I just love life love justice this new pope is an abomination and people are
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.400]  shocked by the fact that I never get into you know religious attacks here on
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.160]  air they've gotten political a guy that says he's above the law who says he has
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:23.520]  the keys that Christ basically handed down you know to St. Peter well I mean
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.800]  this guy's the opposite of what St. Peter talked about that's all I know
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.960]  that's why Catholics across the board are freaking out right now because this is
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.560]  an unprecedented time to be alive and it's like when Pastor Hague who I really
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.600]  like on a lot of fronts really good preacher preaches a lot of good stuff
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.720]  put a book out you know and basically said Jesus didn't come to be the Messiah
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.160]  but was a rebel I mean that guy's a Protestant had to be exposed so I just
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.280]  tell it like it is you can sit there make up your own mind if I'm wrong but
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.040]  this is outrageous and I'll tell you most people Catholic agnostic Christian you
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.200]  know whatever Protestant they're really freaked out about what's happening now
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.720]  continuing here David we're gonna skip this network break so we have more time
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.840]  because I want to get your take on this when I get more into it this has to be
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.000]  met head-on because quite frankly the reason I've not criticized the Catholic
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.320]  church the last 20 years on air was I really weighed the good they did versus
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.120]  the bad and the fact that the people I knew fighting the New World Order fighting
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.040]  the fellow reserve fighting abortion were disproportionately Catholics a lot
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.480]  of folks the John Burks society you name it and they just were doing so much
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.760]  good when the Pope comes out and calls for world government carbon taxes it'll
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.720]  kill a billion people conservatively in Lord Moncton's own analysis the next
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.920]  decade it's got to be met head-on and it's got to be met met truthfully point
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.600]  blank that if Pope Francis isn't the devil he might as well be okay so I'm
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.200]  gonna get more into that coming up in a moment now continuing here ladies and
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.560]  gentlemen there's a new video in info wars dot com hopefully we have time so
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.000]  we're really want to focus in on these unborn children that won't make Francis
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.680]  happy says I'm obsessing on it I'm just a human that loves innocence just
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.080]  instinctively in a spiritual level I have to fight for him I'm sorry Papa sorry
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.920]  Mr. Jesuit I apologize actually I don't apologize with you he's here right now
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.120]  he's like a half mile from me right now and we pull stunts where he lives in a
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.320]  one-bedroom apartment now instead of his armored palace oh so that's okay no give
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.120]  up the trillions you want the middle class to pay more taxes you'll come out
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.560]  for the unborn and say that's the main focus here when when if you actually
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.400]  push for it we could probably overturn it and save millions of lives a year but
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.440]  no it's okay because you're a communist I'm sorry I'm ranting here there's a new
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:50.120]  video that makes me so angry fetus organs 15 years ago when I saw this video
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.520]  five six hours ago posted info wars.com was like a punch in the stomach because
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.520]  you've heard me on airsafe for 20 years I've told you they're selling people's
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:04.200]  organs killing the fetuses harvesting them then when I saw that video I'm like
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.080]  oh I remember that video I remember George Woolley the local Catholic guy on
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:13.760]  access TV Republican activist in Austin I know he's like a precinct chair or
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.520]  something how much he and George in years we should have in mind though I
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.080]  should have protested abortion clinics with he aired that video 15 I think it
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:28.600]  was about 16 years on access television says the food like having their arm
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.440]  yeah I'm sorry David go ahead sorry we yeah we just had a freeze there for a
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.920]  moment but you're back with us Alex I just started to come back in it looks
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.840]  like the thank you so much absolutely the absolute thank you the miracle of
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:44.120]  Skype I am back here but I digress there's this new video it was a punch in
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.240]  the stomach as I get mad at myself I'm just on air saying I've known about this
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.040]  for 20 years you know we've seen research we've seen documentation and I
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.920]  don't go back and dig up where I saw it or where I heard it and then here's just
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.520]  one of the examples but people sitting around on video going we'll get to the
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.960]  baby parts we'll get to the organs you know we've got them all blood typed out
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.960]  that new video which is an old video is up on info wars.com so so the truth is
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:13.480]  coming out some people say well this is old video who cares or or or you know if
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.960]  it's been going on forever that that gives it precedent so what no people's
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.680]  consciences are now feared to a point that either they're going to go along
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.840]  with this or their hearts are open and they're gonna stand up against it and
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.240]  more people are standing up against it right now the poll numbers show that
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.680]  that's why this old news is becoming new news is because more people are now
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.960]  investigating it more people are now exposing it we tell people 16 17 years
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.920]  ago this was going on and they said there's no way you're crazy just like
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:48.120]  my dad who's a physician told me when I went to get my driver's license he said
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.920]  don't sign the organ donor card and I said why and he goes the word is from
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.760]  surgeons I know at some hospitals they won't save you because they can get a
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.040]  couple hundred thousand dollars that was back in you know the early 90s like
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.160]  1990 it's 1989 or so I guess when I got my driver's license excuse me and then
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.080]  later I saw it on 60 minutes that Dallas and Chicago were the two cities
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:13.200]  they had in the show were killing people and taking their organs and I was like
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:18.400]  whoa wow my dad really knows what he's talking about so people are in denial
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.600]  about this but as it's exposed it forces them to admit that this is
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.680]  happening it forces them to admit it's unfolding so number one there's that new
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:33.720]  video number two then I get into the really important news here Trump was
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:40.280]  given twice as much time during the debates then Rand Paul and all the other
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.160]  people respectively some of them some of me was given even more than twice the
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.120]  time I want to be clear I love what Trump's saying telling Megan Kelly
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:53.120]  shut up you know I'm gonna say whatever I want political correctness is killing
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.680]  this country we don't have time for it I love him saying cut income tax is about
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.640]  40% down to the average rate being about 10 15% the economy would just roar
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:09.320]  Kennedy cut it by 50% in the medium rate and less than some of the others but
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:14.240]  overall 50% for the largest tax rate for the middle class I mean just
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.360]  absolutely made the economy explode biggest coffer increases that they'd
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.560]  ever seen because it just speeds the economy up the problem is it doesn't
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.520]  give them a gun economy they can control the globalist already have tax
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.360]  exemption through the regulations they've written so they get more power and
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.120]  control because it's an unlevel playing field if we had fair taxes they'd be
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.680]  very low because the elite don't want to pay high taxes it's very simple I know
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.520]  you know that we've got to get that word out so I like what Trump saying but
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.120]  even zero heads or some smart cookies they're saying is he a Democrat wolf in
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.080]  sheep's clothing posing as a paleo-conservative well regardless it
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.320]  shows how popular this message is and going against political correctness and
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.280]  going against intimidation so when Rand Paul who I admire who I've known for
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:02.400]  20 years 20 years comes out and complains that Trump was given double
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.800]  time they are giving him double time because they think they can destroy him
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.320]  later but the main reason they're doing it is because of ratings and if you are
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.040]  making the incendiary comments which are needed because we're facing tyranny if
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.840]  you were being hardcore and if you were being aggressive like Trump you would
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.000]  be in his position right now we know you we can trust you so and we're months
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.280]  into this and I know Rand Paul listens to the show I know his people do get
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.920]  aggressive get in their face throw the firebombs at the enemy politically
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.120]  that's what you need to do and you've been doing it on Planned Parenthood you
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.960]  been doing it on the attack on Syria you've been doing it on so many issues
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.080]  on on the Patriot Act you've taken some incredibly bold stance but you've got to
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.480]  feed them the meat potatoes that they need on the imploding borders and the
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.960]  global is taking over I know they've sold you as a libertarian to be oh we need
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.880]  good immigrants oh it's okay blah blah blah I get we need good immigrants but
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.000]  the criminals and the people above the law and the the anchor babies you need
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.200]  to expose that that's not fair that's wrong and people across the board
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.400]  including Hispanics and major polls if they're asked should we pay for anchor
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.800]  babies say of course not because they know their tax money is going to it just
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.720]  like we shouldn't pay for people's abortions with tax money or their sex
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:20.080]  changes I'm not against why everyone have a sex change don't make me pay you
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.960]  want to kill your baby don't make me pay okay so so that's what this comes down
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.400]  to is common sense get hardcore on the social issues be a real paleo
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.280]  conservative constitutionalist a libertarian stands up for individuals
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.360]  including the littlest most defenseless ones that's what Rand Paul needs to do
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:41.360]  people need to call him and give him a donation but when you do it say no more
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.120]  donations if you don't get like Donald Trump and get hardcore explode out to
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.480]  the front get aggressive you will dominate stop listening to the
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.840]  establishment Republicans we know what you have on your staff they're not all
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.120]  bad some of them aren't now continuing here here's the really big news there's
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.240]  video up on info wars calm hopefully next hour if we have time we'll play a
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:05.120]  clip of this because this is really big and I want to get David Knight's take on
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:09.600]  this here in just a moment again we just skipped this network break I'm Alex
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:16.880]  Jones reporting via Skype from outside the gates of Vatican City where the so
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:23.680]  called or Babylon excuse me the Pope Francis is residing excuse me I got
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:29.600]  things I thought was mr. Maddow for a minute but continuing here looking at
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.920]  these notes I've written down unprecedented video up on info wars calm
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.200]  with the State Department spokesman says quote they do not know the legal
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:43.680]  authority that the president has and where it comes from to order us forces
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.240]  to attack Syrian troops that's a close quote that video is on info wars calm
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.600]  this is unprecedented that they would even admit this I mean we're talking
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.800]  about the announcement last week it starts this week to bomb Syrian forces
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.720]  two and a half years ago military said they wouldn't be part of this general
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.040]  Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went there and said you can't do it
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.600]  Congress said you know we need to look at this funding the radical Islamists
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.560]  that are the Free Syrian Army to attack 90 plus percent or ISIS we've had Colonel
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.880]  Chafer on they are al-Qaeda based it is a takeover army of Saudi Arabia against
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:23.000]  peaceful Syria it is a war crime it is pure evil it is so bad and now it's just
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.160]  not even a big political issue before they tried to sell they got chemical
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.680]  weapons they used them on their people wasn't true it was the al-Qaeda forces
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.480]  even the UN had to admit that because al-Qaeda put up videos celebrating it
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.240]  they bragged about it okay I mean because they're not controlled they're just
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.480]  stirred up and released so they released that video and it all came out the
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.440]  Syrians didn't do it Syria said we'll give up our chemical weapons the US has
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.520]  them Europe has them but we'll just give ours up just leave us alone that wasn't
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.040]  enough and then now two and a half years ago like it's not even an issue they're
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:55.760]  like oh by the way start next week that was last week we're gonna start bombing
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.640]  any Syrian forces that have valiantly fought for five years against al-Qaeda
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:04.840]  and Saudi Arabia down to the Banner ISIS so Obama won't bomb ISIS he says
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:10.440]  missiles aren't the answer but he will bomb Assad forces that are fighting in
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.520]  hardcore street battles against these vicious murdering scum they've been
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.320]  pushing back the rebels so that makes them incredibly angry that makes the
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.440]  State Department in our wicked baby killing devil worshiping narcotics
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.320]  trafficking criminals that have hijacked this government makes them sway
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.080]  or people stand up against their al-Qaeda forces that are blowing up
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:33.120]  churches throwing priest off buildings you know all the rest of this garbage
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.520]  chopping nuns heads off raping people but forcing fathers a suicide bomber
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:45.080]  they'll kill their whole family all of this is going on and now Obama has come
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.240]  out and said we're just gonna start attacking and they said what authority
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.840]  do you have he said I don't need the authority you know I got it out of a
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.840]  basically out of fracker jacks box or I guess he found it you know when he was
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.760]  on the toilet I mean I don't know where he found it it's called dictatorial where
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.200]  do you find the power he just announced to shut down hundreds of more power
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.800]  plants and put carbon taxes on us outside of law where he finally authority
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.960]  to dissolve the borders two years ago and pay to have people shipped in and
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.640]  give them secret vouchers and order the media not to cover but but we broke it
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.520]  with drudge and forced it out there in fours comm and drudge report calm help
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.680]  make a national story New York Times had admit yeah the government completes
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:22.720]  this but like process but it's good it's liberal so so that's what's going on we
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.520]  have the president preparing a full-out aerial bombardment against the country
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.880]  to be the air support for all force for al-Qaeda remember Rand Paul talked about
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.560]  that remember Ted Cruz talked about it we as a listening group as activists need
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.480]  to get that out again and try to foil this criminal act again at least slow it
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:42.800]  down as much as we can we've done it before can we do it again that's up to
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.080]  the military folks that are listening but this is all about lawlessness it's
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.000]  all about groups that are above the law the UN the captured Vatican you name it
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.640]  but there it is the video and info wars calm they don't know where the
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.600]  authority comes from just like they don't know where any of this authority
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.640]  comes from for him coming after our guns or him running fashion furious of the
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.440]  IRS persecuting people the authority comes from dictatorial activity and a
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.360]  lapdog controlled media that's willing to go along with this I mean what's wrong
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:19.240]  with you people so continuing it's all about being above the law it's all
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.520]  about them thinking they can get away with anything and that's why as a
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.120]  society we're in so much trouble that's why when we see the Texas Attorney General
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.640]  you heard it here for months ago has now been indicted because he encouraged two
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:38.000]  people as an investment advisor before he was in his position now to invest in
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.600]  a company and didn't tell him that he was a member of it I mean that's crooked
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.000]  toenail type corruption that's having dust on the window seal and a white
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.280]  glove West Point inspection I'm not defending it I think it's a little
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.960]  unscrupulous he paid a thousand dollar fine for not remembering to file because
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.040]  he kind of quit doing that business when he got born to government a few years
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.160]  ago and got successful and then he kind of just on the side did a few other
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.600]  deals I mean my I forget to pay bills sometimes I'd bounce checks not that
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.360]  often maybe once a year I mean I just had one the other day that I've an
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.360]  automatic payment that stopped and I forgot and there were I mean you know
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.480]  the FBI call that wire fraud you know the way these laws are written and so
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:23.640]  he is now going to be put in prison I predict they've got a whole showboat
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.560]  group just department run through the state and that intimidates everybody
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:32.320]  else hey you want to fight Obama on the open borders on the pay for abortion
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:37.240]  taxpayers on gay marriage in Texas on shutting down power plants we're going
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.720]  to throw your ass in jail because we're not going to let Governor Abbott who was
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.920]  the Attorney General work with his friend to defend Texas we're going to
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.040]  throw you all in jail that's why I'm predicting next they'll indict the
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.120]  governor and why not stop there why not indict any you know any Tea Party people
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.560]  because this is what it is they can do fast and furious they can do Benghazi
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.520]  Hillary can take money from foreign dictators the State Department and give
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.760]  them billions in weapons and just do it publicly I mean they can just it's the
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:09.600]  equivalent of them chopping up 500 children on the White House lawn with
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:16.200]  machetes and barbecuing them or throwing them down you know woodchippers and then
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.520]  the Attorney General punched a 15-year-old punk in the face who was
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:26.360]  being obnoxious at a dinner's I mean it's illegal to get up and punch some rude
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.720]  kid at some restaurant who's throwing food at somebody and tells your wife to
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.720]  go to hell yeah it's illegal technically to punch him in the face is it
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.600]  illegal to chop up 500 children with machetes and then lick the blade no so
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:45.440]  so so commit the giant massive crimes nakedly in front of everyone and then
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.040]  run around arresting Republican governors and Republican Attorney Generals
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.600]  and it's not that the Republicans are perfect the Republican leadership has
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.040]  teamed up with the Democrats to mop up and to even get rid of the two-party
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.400]  system and have a one-party ruling clique that's the point is there's a
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:07.160]  massive consolidation taking place right now ladies and gentlemen and it is full
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:13.200]  bore and folks have been told join with it go along with it submit to it and so
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.160]  it's a very very dark time to be alive David we're gonna go to break I'm gonna
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.480]  come back with about five more minutes with you and go back and forth with some
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.880]  analysis and get your take on this situation and I don't mean to get
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.920]  vitriolic and aggressive about the Pope it's just that if we had somebody like
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.520]  that fighting for the lives of children or fighting against carbon taxes we could
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.320]  win this Pope John Paul II wasn't perfect a lot of Catholics criticized me
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.880]  but I say his record seemed pretty good but at least he fought coming you know
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.080]  he didn't run around promoting gun control I mean this Pope is so bad it just
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.040]  really hurts me that he could be a champion for children and for sovereignty
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.640]  and for families and instead he's like a basically Hugo Chavez took our worst I
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:03.320]  mean Fidel Castro you know the the the the the Pope a half mile from me David
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.640]  taking us out to break I just really get aggressive because we've got put in a
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.080]  trance where we just put up with more and more how far will this go David I
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.040]  well Alex you know you were talking about what's going on with the Vatican
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.800]  and earlier in the program we talked about how Jeb Bush campaigned as the
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:25.040]  pro-life candidate saying well we let him have pro-life licenses and yet his
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:30.320]  grandfather was running the very first Planned Parenthood fundraiser back in
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.240]  1947 George HW Bush was very much involved with the president of Planned
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:39.640]  Parenthood in the 70s this is something that's happening not with just the
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.160]  leadership of the Catholic Church something is happening with the
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:47.280]  leadership of the GOP who says that they stand for pro-life we'll be right back

[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:31.240]  disgusting animals Trump replied with no only Rosie O'Donnell and everyone in the
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:35.200]  entire crowd laughed presidential hopeful Donald Trump told reporters that
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:39.800]  he felt the questions posed him weren't appropriate in the Fox News host Megan
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.720]  Kelly especially behaved very badly last night's GOP debate was always
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.960]  predicted to be the Donald Trump show but the fact that Ray and Paul got less

[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:14.440]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight in Austin and joining me
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.520]  now in this segment is Leanne McAdoo we've been talking to alex jones who is
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.680]  reporting live just outside the gates of the Vatican City as alex is pointing
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:43.200]  out even though the Catholic Church has stood firmly on the right to life stood
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.040]  firmly against abortion we now have a pope who says you just need to get over
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.000]  this obsession we see the same thing happening in the GOP as we're pointing
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.240]  out Jeff Bush saying that he is the pro-life candidate nevertheless he was
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.160]  director of Bloomberg organization that gave ten million dollars to Planned
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.480]  Parenthood his father was working with them on fundraisings back in the 1970s
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:12.160]  and his grandfather was running the very first fundraiser back in 1947 that's
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.120]  what we're up against the takeover at the top of these organizations where the
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.080]  grassroots really wants to see something happen whether it's pro-life or
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.320]  whether it is trying to get back our freedom and our liberty and yet we're
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.600]  being taken over at the top joining us now from the Vatican City is alex jones
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:34.680]  alex that's right David Knight and and I was just thinking during the break that
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:39.080]  I intend to come on air and be smooth and lay out the facts but I start
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:46.600]  hyperventilating and getting upset and then I realized that's good the
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:53.240]  info wars is because we have a heart we care we know we're being conquered by
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:59.680]  an evil death cult we know we're being taken over we understand it and it's a
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:04.280]  normal to act like an anthill that's been stomped on when you're under attack
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:09.400]  but shifting back into what you were just covering just like we cover in the
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.400]  film in game and I plug in game every day it's free online blueprint for global
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:17.960]  enslavement because we have the documents we have the quotes we have their
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.200]  own statements eight years ago and people weren't talking about this how
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.540]  Planned Parenthood was the eugenics society how they took over how they
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:31.960]  funded Hitler what their mission is what they're doing how the other break-off
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:35.920]  groups are the ones poisoning the water engineering the GMOs to reduce her
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:40.800]  fertility folks if they're selling baby parts for decades secretly and selling
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.240]  their organs and keeping babies alive and harvesting them that's all come out
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.040]  of course you heard it here before I'm not bragging I mean we don't make stuff up
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.760]  think about the David Knight piece we put together two years ago the men brain
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.480]  put together where he and I talked about all this where we tied into soil in
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.880]  green and so the good news is this stuff was hidden except for insiders and
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:06.280]  really smart folks just like 30 years ago nobody knew the Federal Reserve was
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.680]  private now everybody does in polls over 90 percent the good news is it's
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:15.200]  coming out this type of evil can't continue they're now trying to go big
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.480]  deal we sell baby parts what do you think we're gonna do throw them in the
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.760]  trash worth a lot of money so next you counter okay give the women $200,000 for
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.400]  the baby parts so there's a lot of ways to get them so now that's why get these
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.280]  evil demons don't care about their kids so because you weren't told they were
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.840]  selling the parts you didn't give consent see there's a lot of angles to this
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:40.040]  and more than one way to skin a cat and and even if you're for abortion and I
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.120]  get some of the quasi arguments out there I don't judge everybody that's for
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.920]  it I get the deception I understand the excuses I understand the lies I've been
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.680]  involved in them at a distance you know when I was in late high school and in
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:57.720]  college with a few girlfriends that had them and I learned about it after the
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:04.720]  fact so so I'm not here judging anybody I'm saying above the whole abortion
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:10.280]  debate above that is the real social engineering that's going on and when I've
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.320]  talked to so many so-called liberals they go of course there's too many poor
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.080]  people we got to get rid of them well then why do you try to make the public
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.800]  dependent why try to dumb the public down why do you because they want us in a
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.720]  servile dumb down position so they can carry out secret scientific experiments
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:34.240]  on us taxes regulate us dumb us down I mean one out of three kids by 2025 even
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:40.160]  the CDC predicts in 2025 10 years from now this isn't some distant Buck Rogers
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.000]  one out of three will have a neurological disorder from vaccines they just say
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.840]  you'll have a neurological disorder and that's not a big huge story it's just
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.400]  well one out of three won't be able to talk it'll be in diapers for their whole
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:56.240]  life everything's fine though we love you by the way we're a Nazi death cult
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.120]  just warned to kill you and your family that loves the Ku Klux Klan but
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.720]  everything's okay and then they've got all these liberal publications going
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.920]  Alex is a racist talking bad about Planned Parenthood I mean they've had
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.520]  the last month that I've seen without looking five articles out of Raw Story
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:16.320]  and Salon and all these White House connected groups going Margaret
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:23.320]  Singer wasn't racist she was a swig are don't just racist okay so listen to him
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.200]  Margaret Singer loves you and your family and Hillary Clinton says she's a
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:31.360]  great lady she admires so this is the garbage we're talking about and then
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.840]  they're cutting off our resources to bring this whole plan in and again the
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.800]  Bush's Prescott Bush was the number one lawyer at Brown Brother Harriman and he
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:46.200]  was a senator and they were going to indict him with the McCormick-Dickstein
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.800]  committee investigation for what they'd done a few years before in the mid-30s
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.320]  trying to hire General Smedley Butler the Marine Corps to lead a 400 plus
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.160]  thousand man team I have the film reels in endgame of him saying this and it's
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.600]  congressional record the Bushes were gonna lead with Butler a 400 plus
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:10.920]  thousand man team to bring in fascism merge with Hitler now the decision was
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.200]  made at the British level to double cross Hitler and in fairness the Bushes
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.040]  they've been told that was the plan with the British intelligence was to give
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.880]  them Europe than the rest of the world would be British Empire under the US and
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.400]  a lot of racists love this thing less is wonderful they were gonna have race
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:30.640]  laws they were gonna put poison in the food and water of the minorities they
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.520]  were gonna carry out with a do to everybody just against minorities and
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:37.680]  then the plan was made after Hitler was defeated this is all basically
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.680]  declassified if anybody wants to go research it to just do it to everybody
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:46.480]  and when my dad was at UT as a high school student in their advanced plan
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.800]  to program if they called him in and said oh listen this isn't racist we just
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.200]  want the smartest people to be part of a covert eugenics program and he never got
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.400]  deeper into it because you know his dad had been in World War two and he thought
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.960]  that was pretty horrible and they said well listen you know the even the head
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.680]  professor said I'm Jewish and this is okay you know we're not doing this like
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.160]  Hitler this is gonna be done to the general public you know and we're just
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.280]  gonna have a ruling elite they didn't get into poisoning everybody and stuff
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.840]  but you know that was there so if you want to know what you're under this whole
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.180]  Planned Parenthood saying and selling the baby parts and keeping the babies
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:24.360]  alive to sell their organs as I told you before it came out they did from our
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:29.320]  sources this is a window into it gets a lot worse they're gonna kill babies and
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.320]  sell their organs secretly you think they're gonna jack your water well the
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:40.080]  White House science are in 1974 41 years ago the year I was born he's current
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.760]  White House science are but I was born 41 years ago John P. Holdren wrote a
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.560]  1,100-page book Ecoscience it's online for free now and they talk about putting
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.880]  stuff in the water to reduce your IQ and to lower your fertility well guess what
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.320]  they do and I know I harp on this at nauseam as I stand out here in record
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:05.920]  hot just global warming Roman heat 98 degrees you know just literally a a half
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:09.000]  mile from the Vatican that's right there you know how cameras are they make
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.600]  stuff look smaller I mean the dome is just right there on the wall is just
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:17.040]  down the street literally 200 yards away and I sit here and I look at this and I
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.840]  see how they feed on us and how the globalist operate and just every fiber
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:27.360]  of me I guess we need to make an in-game part to and just lay it all out and the
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.640]  Nuremberg documents and listen they didn't just get this eugenics stuff from
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.400]  the Nazis the Nazis got it from the West England the US they made it even
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:40.400]  worse and then in Nuremberg they took what the Nazis had and incorporated it
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.120]  into how we operate not just at NASA not just in the CIA as everybody knows but
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.440]  they incorporated it into the banking they incorporated into regulations the
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:54.720]  1968 gun control act it was used to preservation of firearms that discovered
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.720]  this is word-for-word except for like seven words have been changed from
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:04.360]  Reich to United States stuff like that is the Nazi gun control act that they
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:10.000]  repast and it was senator Dodd not the current one but the previous one senator
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  Dodd you can look this up that that that was a lawyer at Nuremberg and just took
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.040]  it and made it US law which had been previous Weimar Republic then recertified
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:29.400]  by the Nazis to be technical so so I mean we literally live under the EU was a
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.920]  Nazi blueprint and guess who was at the Treaty of Rome in 57 and supported the
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.960]  EU the Vatican guess who's not a member of the EU is exempt from it they want
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.560]  you under the EU but the men that have hijacked the church is regardless it's
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:52.760]  been hijacked they aren't exempt they are above it they don't have to follow it
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:58.360]  only you and your family that's what's happening that's the fraud because if
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.520]  they were under all this if they were under the taxes and regulations if they
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:07.840]  were under all this hellish stuff then they wouldn't like it but it's okay you
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:11.880]  know who is a spokesman for the Vatican now and who works for him and is part of
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.800]  the Swiss Guard the guy that helped launch the Iraq war with lies Tony Blair
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:20.360]  so you can say what you want about the Vatican in the past it undoubtedly stopped
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.160]  radical Islamic takeover of Europe it undoubtedly did a lot of good things I
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:27.240]  must have either just obsesses old answers the Vatican is the fount of all
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:32.640]  evil it's bad people that run the US bad people that run banking in England bad
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.280]  people that have hijacked the Vatican it because then you can't debate whether
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.960]  it was good or bad before this is what's going on and where is the Papa
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.880]  who's supposed to protect the little sheep where is he exposing the eugenics
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:50.040]  well I'll tell you they took out the last pope who certainly wasn't perfect
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.880]  Benedict right as the blackmail admittedly was even in the London Guardian
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.560]  Associated Press that blackmail was being used even came out mainstream news of
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.480]  the pedophile raids inside the Vatican that basically infiltrated and took it
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:06.400]  over a sex cult and that now are blackmailing everyone in it to submit
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.360]  to them so you're gonna hear more and more stuff you may hear the pope come
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:13.200]  out and say hand your five-year-olds over to you know guys on the street or
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.720]  you're going to hell I mean you may see him out there with a rainbow flag you
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.960]  know when a leather outfit on South Park with a lemmy winks I mean there is no
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:27.000]  what I'm not kidding I mean there is no telling what you're gonna see because
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.440]  that's what this is turned into and that's what some fully out of giant seagull
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:36.680]  flying by right here let us even get some food but continuing ladies and

[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.920]  to get out of the trance we need to stop submitting to the tyranny of the new
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.080]  world order you know the great Roman people who come from those hills out
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.040]  there those volcanic hills outside home who were the 2,700 years ago found at
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:59.560]  this great city they need to find their fighting spirit and not be slaves to
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.320]  this and take back their society as well I don't care where you come from who you

[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.320]  products at infowarstore.com as we go out to break David will tell you about I
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.440]  know we've extended free shipping was just in the month of July it's not gonna
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:08.680]  run through this weekend it will end Monday morning so free shipping does in
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.880]  Monday morning have a lot of other specials that are gonna be ending David
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.000]  can talk about some of those specials in a moment but David more and more I
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  realize it is about getting out of the trance it is about getting angry I used
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.400]  to see network you know 30 years ago and think from 1976 and think you know the
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:27.400]  answers get up say you're mad you know I don't know how to fix all the problems
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.000]  but I'm angry I think no that's not true but really it is get your blood pumping
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.760]  realizes a problem get aggressive stop submitting the tyranny stop going along
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:40.080]  and vote with your dollars to support freedom spread the word about evil by
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.800]  exposing it promote what's good word-of-mouth will bring down the new
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:48.520]  world order of velvet revolution David Knight absolutely Alex and I think we
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.680]  saw that to some degree last night with Rand Paul as you pointed out he needs to
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.760]  take a libertarian argument and come after the open border I think one of the
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:59.480]  ways to do that is to say we all stand for equal protection of the law however
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.480]  illegals are being incentivized to come here and basically there is no law for
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.000]  them they are given legal immunity even when they're violent criminals are given
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.320]  state tuition and every state benefits that we don't see and we cannot afford
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.240]  and this is a libertarian argument we cannot afford this cloward and piven
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:21.480]  strategy of creating a vast welfare state and then bringing in people who are
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.840]  going to go on that welfare state no other country does that and we should
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:28.480]  not be compelled to support that we need to get angry about that I think that's
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.000]  the tech that I would certainly take perhaps you'll do that but I think we
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.200]  had some of the best back and forth last night nevertheless with Rand Paul and
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.520]  Chris Christie understanding that they brought Chris Christie in as a pit bull
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.240]  for the police state to take on the very issues that the new Rand Paul would
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.600]  take on to attack those issues to attack Rand Paul I've got Leanne McAdoo
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.240]  with me and we're going to talk about what happened with Carly Fiorina as well
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:57.080]  as Donald Trump before we do as Alex was pointing out we've extended free

[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.440]  products that we sell at infowarslife.com well Leanne it was interesting last
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:55.440]  night I think really we could see that they had the guns out for that shit I'll
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.880]  go and I finished it yes thank you Alex that's Alex from reporting from the
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:07.000]  gates of the Vatican right outside the Vatican talking about how the they're
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.360]  now talking about a different agenda than they have throughout the history of
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.760]  the Catholic Church and we see that within the Republican Party as well
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:20.840]  certainly Fox had an agenda their agenda was to try to take down Donald Trump and
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.000]  I think one of the things that caused them there's a couple reasons I think
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.200]  they were pushing Carly Fiorina they have announced her over and over and over
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:33.000]  and over and over again as the winner and I think the two things that they liked
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.760]  about it number one she succinctly came after Donald Trump and number two I
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.920]  don't think most people in the public really realize the close ties that
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:45.720]  Carly Fiorina has with Michael Hayden and the CIA and the surveillance state
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:49.960]  she's been an advisor for them after she left Hewlett Packard she was an advisor
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.120]  for them while she was there and that's really what's behind this they are
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.440]  really pushing this surveillance state the war state the prohibition state you
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.240]  can see this everywhere we've had Megyn Kelly forcing vaccines on people saying
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.760]  sometimes you just need big brother they are selling big brother to us all the
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.280]  time not just with mandatory vaccines Fox News is selling us big brother big
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:14.640]  war all the time and so they had Carly Fiorina coming after Donald Trump your
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.960]  comments well I thought she did an excellent job like you said very
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:22.480]  succinct and you've made this point as well just showing how he has flip-flopped
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:27.160]  on so many things so what is going to actually make him change his stripes if
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:33.360]  he becomes the big guy there in the big chair and I think as well Fox News
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:38.480]  realizes he can take down the Republican Party basically if he runs as an
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:42.800]  independent as well as the war on women yes they started out the main debate
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.400]  with a loyalty pledge and that was directed directly at Donald Trump when
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.280]  we come back we're going to play Carly Fiorina's take down of Donald Trump
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.400]  that Fox News loved and we're going to talk about the issues behind that and
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.880]  there are some real issues with it we'll be right back Leanne McAdoo

[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.520]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me now is Leanne
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.400]  McAdoon we've been talking this program about the debate last night it was a
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.000]  big debate three times the number of people to watch the debates back in
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.640]  2011 and 12 twice the number of the previous record for debate and there's
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:38.000]  one reason for that and that's Donald Trump everybody tuned in to see the
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.320]  fireworks and there were a lot of fireworks right and of course one of
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:46.800]  the things that was very interesting about that discussion were the donations
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:51.400]  that Donald Trump has made to Democrats and the way he responded when they asked
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.480]  him what he thought he was going to get for this money right yeah and it's just
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:01.120]  he is unabashedly a crony capitalist he admits it he says I pay for favors and
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.720]  what is gonna make him change when he's the guy sitting in the chair he's gonna
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.520]  say all right go ahead and pay me and I'll do some favors for you I run the
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:14.880]  country now exactly that's been my point all along he points out look I'm a
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.600]  self-made man I've made all these billions and I'd say well you need to
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.680]  look at how he made the bill the billions in some respects he was a bully
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.840]  capitalist trying to run other people out of business using the government to
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.280]  take their property for his private use using imminent domain the other thing
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.280]  that should concern us is all this money that he's been passing around and he
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:37.960]  didn't shy away from that whatsoever why is it going to save anything to elect a
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:42.680]  crony capitalist to president it doesn't save anything it just begs the question
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:47.040]  as to why he wants to be there is it for his own personal gain it's not because
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.920]  of principles and I think all this back and forth as to whether he's a
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.160]  Democrat or whether he's Republican they're trying to figure out where he
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.400]  is on issues is he going to do the same thing to us that we've seen from Mitch
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.400]  McConnell from John Boehner pledging to the Republican base that they're going
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.000]  to do something on one issue when they get elected they do exactly the opposite
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.520]  we've now had Mitch McConnell say look you've had your vote on Planned Parenthood
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.920]  we're done we're not gonna move any further on this we're done same thing we
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.080]  hear from John Boehner are we gonna hear that from the Donald Trump is he
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:18.520]  gonna just move along yeah well and and just the fact that he wouldn't take the
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.600]  pledge that to me right there I was like he's a ringer I mean he he knows that
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.720]  it could potentially give the election to the Democrats but he doesn't care
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:31.840]  he's already hedged his bets with Clinton you know by the way he knows if
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.160]  she's in she's still gonna be you know giving him those favors that he's
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:39.320]  already paid up for exactly and as we pointed out before he got he gave a
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:43.240]  hundred thousand dollars to the Clinton Foundation the he gave twenty five
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:48.200]  thousand dollars to Democrat candidates in 2006 we've had some of the people who
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.280]  are looking at this political fact went back and so well no he's giving more
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:54.400]  money to the Republicans there's a point out when we showed the graph you can see
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.000]  that he has stepped up dramatically his contributions in the last five years and
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.080]  made them exclusively Republican prior to that he was giving more money to the
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:08.040]  Democrats in most years as you can see that right there he's had a set had
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:11.640]  essentially a blue period and now he's entered his red period just like Picasso
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.480]  what kind of a picture does that paint one of the things that he said when
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:17.880]  they question him on what are you going to get for all that money and he came
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:21.360]  back and said well Hillary Clinton I said be at my wedding and she came to my
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:25.440]  wedding there you go you give the Clintons a hundred thousand dollars and
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:30.200]  she will appear at your wedding I mean really does he really think that that's
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.480]  all that we expect that he's getting from her yeah and then we're seeing the
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:40.000]  same sort of passion for Trump like we saw build up for Obama so all these
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.920]  people saying yeah simply because he is speaks his mind and he's doesn't have a
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:47.640]  filter and he's not politically correct and people sort of like that
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:53.760]  transparency but he is this the corporate you know oligarch that we are
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:57.920]  saying we don't he's buying out the very politicians that we've been
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.920]  complaining about you know our country has now been are bought and paid for by
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.440]  him about identity politics when and you see it and that's the thing that is so
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.720]  so disturbing is that you see it just as much in either party you see people not
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.560]  concerned about what he's going to do or his positions on issues but you see
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:20.600]  them concerned about who he is and if you look at those questions the first
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:24.680]  seven out of eight questions were identity politics so about the person
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.600]  they weren't about any issues stay with us we'll be right back with Leanne

[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.000]  Alex Jones
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.480]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in studio is
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:31.920]  Leanne McAdoo we've been talking about the debate last night we're going to
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:35.920]  address some of your questions on Twitter on the real Alex Jones Twitter
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:40.480]  account but before we do we want to play this clip from last night's debate where
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:45.480]  they talked about the contributions that Donald Trump is taking what does that
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.120]  give him and who is he taking money from here's that clip I will tell you that
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:54.680]  our system is broken I gave to many people before this before two months
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:58.440]  ago I was a businessman I give to everybody when they call I give and you
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.360]  know what when I need something from them two years later three years later I
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:07.240]  call them they are there for me so what that's a broken system what you get from
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.400]  Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi well I'll tell you what I said be at my
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:15.800]  wedding and she came to my wedding you know why she had no choice because I
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:20.960]  gave I gave to a foundation that frankly that foundation is supposed to do
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:24.960]  good I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:33.200]  world it was just one second on this though we we spent a lot of time
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:36.720]  talking about Hillary Clinton and pitting us back and forth let's be clear
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:39.560]  we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject because
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.800]  everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touch is more messed up today
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:47.440]  than before she and we have many questions to come okay let's hold it
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.040]  right there the question I guess Leanne is Donald Trump running for president
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.160]  or is he running for godfather going back to what he says I gave to many
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:58.120]  people before this when I call I give when they call I give and you know what
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.800]  when I need something from him two years later three years later I call them
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:05.480]  right and me a favor yeah and does he plan on fixing that broken system
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.000]  exactly he offers himself as exhibit a and says the system is broken he plays
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.760]  in the set in the broken system so put him in charge of the broken system
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:17.800]  because he knows how to manipulate it better than anybody else is there any
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.560]  sense of a rule of law is there any sense that there's too much power and
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.360]  money in Washington and any of that no there isn't he plays the game so what
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.480]  game is he playing right now who is he supporting who sent him in here is he a
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.520]  dark horse or is he a stalking horse yeah he's talking horse for the Clinton
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.840]  they're the ones who called him let's play this clip from Carly Fiorina she
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.960]  varies succinctly summed up a lot of the questions that people have and that's
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.600]  one of the reasons I think that Fox News lifted her up but of course we also
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:54.200]  know there's another gender there as well she's part of the Apologists for
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.760]  the police state that's another reason why Fox News wants to elevate Carly
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.960]  Fiorina let's play that clip if you guys got that ready let's play that clip of
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:09.480]  Carly Fiorina with the talking about Donald Trump question because it's true
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:14.040]  really of all of you on this stage that like it or not Donald Trump is there's a
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.560]  huge disparity between the poll numbers that you have and the poll numbers that
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:21.160]  he has given also the fact that Rudy Giuliani said he thought that there may
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:27.040]  be some Reagan qualities to Donald Trump so Carly Fiorina is he getting the
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:33.240]  better of you I don't know I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.760]  jumped in the race any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton I didn't
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.320]  maybe it's because I hadn't given money the foundation or donated to his wife's
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:46.200]  Senate campaign here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:50.280]  he is the party's frontrunner right now and good for him I think he's tapped
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:56.640]  into an anger that people feel they're sick of politics as usual you know
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:00.400]  whatever your issue your cause the festering problem you hoped would be
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:04.920]  resolved the political class has failed you that's just a fact and that's what
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.600]  Donald Trump tabs into I would also just say this since he has changed his mind
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.360]  on amnesty on health care and on abortion I would just ask what are the
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.960]  principles by which he will govern exactly and I would also say you know
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:22.120]  she says well Donald Trump is a frontrunner good for him I would say
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.880]  that Carly Fiorina is Fox News's frontrunner good for her we've had a
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:32.040]  failure not only of the system but we've had a failure of the rule of law and
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:37.200]  she supports that she supports this massive surveillance state and I can
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:42.000]  tell you that all of the candidates that we heard last night are supporting war
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.840]  prohibition surveillance the usual list of items that we hear except for Rand
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:50.800]  Paul and that's where we had the one argument thank you so much for joining
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.920]  us we're going to be joined when we come back with other members of the
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:57.920]  nightly news we're going to talk about the debate and the issues that came up
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.280]  foreign policy and other issues stay with it Joe Biggs with info wars.com now
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:08.120]  last night we had the first GOP debate it was a very heated debate between the
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:13.640]  GOP and Donald Trump Trump to Megan Kelly I don't have time for political
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:18.160]  correctness and neither does his country Megan Kelly calls out Donald Trump
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:22.600]  for sexist remarks from his Twitter history you called women you don't like
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:28.480]  fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals Trump replied with no only
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:33.160]  Rosie O'Donnell and everyone in the entire crowd laughed presidential hopeful
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:36.640]  Donald Trump told reporters that he felt the questions posed him
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:41.040]  brand appropriate in the Fox News host Megan Kelly especially behaved very
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:46.600]  badly last night's GOP debate was always predicted to be the Donald Trump
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:52.080]  show but the fact that Rand Paul got less than half the speaking time again
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.360]  illustrates how easy it is to freeze out certain candidates this is Joe Biggs

[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.480]  it was pretty amazing to watch it I remember when the thing first started
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:36.960]  out I was telling my wife I said this looks like a sports contest this doesn't
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:41.440]  and it was really the first 10 minutes before they actually started at the top
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:45.560]  of the hour they were really hyping it up like it was some kind of a sports
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.680]  contest you saw the big stadium there the face the Facebook logos everywhere
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:53.760]  yeah you made they made the guys parade up there and stand there I said wow if
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:56.560]  they make them stripped down to their swimsuits I'm turning this off it was
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:01.520]  almost NBA or NFL draft level the way it was presented to the viewing public
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.200]  but it like Biggs was saying last night we were watching the debate and he said
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.160]  this can be the highest rated debate ever because it's a entertainment show at
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:12.080]  this point because you have the entertainment aspect you of course
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.520]  Trump is a businessman but he's also reality TV star so it's kind of like
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.840]  having Kim Kardashian up there talking about foreign policy people are going to
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:23.880]  tune in and watch it and by far Trump was by far the most entertaining person
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:29.080]  on that stage yeah I think he won purely from an entertainment standpoint the
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:35.320]  fact that it was the GOP versus Donald Trump that's the way I see it
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.640]  and Fox News versus Donald Trump they clearly were going after him the very
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:45.920]  first questions personally yeah and the first seven out of they went seven
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.120]  questions talking to them personally you know what is what about you not even
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.200]  about their policies not even about their records but tell us about you and
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:57.120]  the very first one was obviously targeted towards Donald Trump they knew
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.720]  that he wasn't going to to do that and to his credit he didn't do it but of
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:05.000]  course that also raises issues many people is he a stalking horse for
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.720]  Hillary Clinton or somebody else that's that's what a lot of people are
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:15.120]  concerned about yeah I mean the the second debate was was dog and pony but
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.840]  the first one I've got to go back to the first one really quick we got to talk
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.520]  about Lindsey Satan Graham that's what I call him this guy this guy was asked
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.920]  questions about Planned Parenthood and what did he give an answer to how he
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:31.280]  would stop Planned Parenthood he would send 25,000 troops to Iraq and Syria and
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.720]  then if you didn't stand by that decision you didn't deserve to be president of
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:40.440]  the United States he was then asked about border security and this man said
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:46.560]  that he would fix border security by sending 25,000 troops to Iraq and Syria
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:51.680]  that's the answer to everything I mean what's gonna happen if we ask him how
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.560]  to fix a tire well I'm gonna send 25,000 troops Joe to Iraq and Syria and
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:59.920]  then I'm gonna get a lot of money for the military industrial complex and then
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:03.640]  I'll hire one of those illegal guys that can they come across the the border that
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:07.000]  we build and I'll have him fix my tire for me that's right it's the old thing
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.400]  is like when the only till you've got is a hammer everything looks like a nail
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.240]  yeah well his same solution for everything is sending troops to the
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:17.800]  Middle East hammering him into a war let's play have you guys got that clip
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:22.600]  ready about Lindsey Graham let's play that clip if you do yeah go ahead let's
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.520]  play that clip they asked him about this conversation will no doubt go to the
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:32.000]  war on women and that cutting funding to this group could be a very broad brush
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.720]  against all of you or anybody who holds this nomination as being against women's
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:41.720]  health against these organizations that people will say provide positive things
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:46.400]  for many women I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.800]  stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies let's take the money
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:55.000]  that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:00.280]  health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn the only way
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:06.080]  we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president you want
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:10.520]  to see a war on women come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan folks I've been
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:16.040]  there 35 times I'll show you what they do to women these mythical air let's hold
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.120]  it right there let's hold it right there yes so you want to see a war on women
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:22.520]  come with me we'll got a war on women and we'll go against men went men and
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:25.400]  children as well yeah well I guess I guess if we kill everyone often they
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.720]  can't have abortions I guess that's how his how he's gonna stop abortions we'll
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:35.200]  just we'll just completely ahead of time as we're talking about this ISIS thing
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.480]  I'm very glad that Rand was there to just have the argument under the argument
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:42.600]  when he was talking about it when he said he didn't come out and say let's
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.840]  bomb Syria and do all this other stuff he said let's stop funding ISIS yes can
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:50.520]  we just stop this one thing can we put this away and I'm not saying I'm
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.480]  completely convinced by Rand at this point I'm glad he brought up this issue
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:57.680]  because they just want to blow it up turn it into a parking lot but he said if
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:00.960]  we stop giving these guys the airdrop grenades if we stop giving them a
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:04.760]  billion dollars of our own Humvees to ride around in they would be a lot easier
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:09.520]  to kill that's right and we got this article today from RT US says Assad is
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:14.400]  the quote root of all evil unquote after the first drone strikes launch from
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:20.440]  Turkey Rand Paul has said it we've had others say we don't need to be Al Qaeda's
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:23.960]  Air Force in Syria but that's what they've been pushing for now for years
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:28.080]  trying to find some pretense to go into Syria calling them the root of all evil
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:31.640]  that just reminds me of George HW Bush when he's going after Manuel Noriega and
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:37.040]  he kept calling him strong man strong man Noriega yeah I mean it was it didn't
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:40.000]  call you came up with this new term strong man whatever that means but of
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.880]  course Noriega had been involved with George Bush in the CIA Noriega was
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:49.120]  involved in the assassination of General Torrey A host and in Panama they put him
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:54.840]  in position there running drugs working with a CIA and then evidently he got too
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:57.800]  big a head and he decided he would kind of branch out and go into business for
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.520]  himself so then they had to go after Manuel Noriega but now we're talking
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:05.160]  about the moderate rebels in Syria remember we've got moderate Al Qaeda we've
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:09.440]  got moderate ISIS that we've created those are the good guys who are pro
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.400]  pro US rebels so if Jeb becomes president that means Assad will be part of the
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.120]  axis of evil yeah we'll continue that on don't know what that means but it's just
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.800]  amazing to go back and see this happen over and over again and what you were
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:26.880]  talking about jacari that was Brett Bayer talking to Paul and he says you
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.920]  recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican Hawks again trying to set
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:35.080]  Paul outside of the Republicans you know pit all the Republicans against him and
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.080]  and really quite frankly all the rest of the Republicans there are pushing for a
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:43.880]  war they are pushing for arming ISIS what Paul said only ISIS is responsible
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:47.120]  for terrorism only ISIS is responsible for the depravity how we're going to
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:51.240]  defeat ISIS I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:54.520]  ISIS he says I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:59.040]  Clinton as well as some Republicans like Lindsey Graham who want to send arms to
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:04.360]  the allies of ISIS ISIS rides around in billion dollars worth of US Humvees it's
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:08.600]  a disgrace we stop them by not funding them we stop them by not arming them and
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:11.840]  of course that is the solution I guarantee you if Trump and not had been a
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:17.320]  part of this GOP debate that Rand Paul would have had a extremely great
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:20.720]  chance of winning this entire debate because he gave real answers real
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:25.120]  solutions to real problems real issues with America whereas everything else was
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.640]  his dog and pony show exactly and that's why they didn't give him the time to
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:31.800]  talk because when he started speaking they'd cut him off or Megyn Kelly would
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:36.000]  jump in and chime in with her you know Fox panel discussion well I believe that
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.360]  they'd put Chris Christie in there to be a pit bull to attack Rand Paul and that's
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:43.120]  what we saw as most of the back and forth between Chris Christie and Rand Paul
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:48.320]  we have a Twitter comment from Starkey Joe one he says were you angered when
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:53.360]  Chris Christie stooped low talking about giving hugs to 9-11 families how
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:58.320]  manipulative he says exactly wrapping the bloody shirt not questioning what we
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:02.720]  could have done to stop this and we've had an essay whistleblowers like Drake
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.760]  and Benny saying look they had the information they could have stopped this
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:10.680]  if they wanted to they're using this as a pretense to make a larger haystack
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:13.880]  which makes it even harder for us to find the needle that we want to find in
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.920]  the heart of haystack but they said they were people who actually support the
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:23.840]  Constitution unlike Chris Christie who says you're just a bag of hot air if you
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.720]  talk about the Fourth Amendment shouldn't even talk about it it's a
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.160]  I mean I'm not surprised he did that I guess that's the best answer I can give
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.120]  you know these guys always do anything they can to evoke this emotion I was
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.040]  there and I saw it happen and all this and maybe they did I'm not saying they
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.320]  didn't but that doesn't mean that because you hug the victims you have more
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:47.000]  insight or care into the people who have been affected by these
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.960]  tragedies than anybody else that's right your comments yeah I mean I completely
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:57.160]  agree with both of you I mean this guy is trying to use bring up 9-11 again just
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:02.120]  so we can continuously spy on people illegally how many times are we gonna
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:06.920]  play that card how long is this gonna go how long are people going to give up
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:11.400]  their security and the false hope that they're going to somehow be and I love
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:15.320]  not safer and I love what he said Rand's response like you need a warrant you need
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:18.760]  a fourth amendment and he was like well how are you gonna stop people to anybody
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:21.720]  who hasn't been keeping track the NSA couldn't stop a bunch of trannies from
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.240]  attacking their own facility how they're going to stop ISIS a much more organized
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:31.920]  well-funded well organized machine from doing any attacks it's like having a
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:41.440]  dictionary with no alphabet alphabet to tell me out here that's not alphabetized
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:44.800]  so it's pretty much the same thing you have all this metadata but you can't
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:48.360]  put it in any type of order you have to have some way to dig through all this
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:53.000]  information exactly but we need to look at the Constitution as if it really
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.520]  mattered there's a reason that we have a rule of law there's a reason that we
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:59.320]  demanded to have search warrants that they had to be specific about what they
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.160]  were looking for there was a reason that you had to find some you had to charge
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.600]  people with a crime find them guilty before you could take their property and
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:10.520]  now we're talking about not only just stealing people's property without
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:13.520]  charging them or finding them guilty as we've done under the war on drugs but
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:18.240]  now in the war on terror we're talking about incarcerating people indefinitely by
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:22.800]  the military without even charging them that's what's being floated out there
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:27.320]  now with this pre-crime aspect looking for violent extremists we've seen the
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:31.640]  bill introduced by McCall we've seen Wesley Clark floating that issue we've
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:34.800]  seen that this is where this is going that's what we're concerned about with
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:39.320]  Jade Helm with Geospatial Intelligence it's all about casting a giant dragnet
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:42.960]  getting everybody's information putting it into a computer program and then
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.280]  whoever the computer program identifies you grab that person throw them in jail
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:51.600]  because someday they might do something violent order because we know
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.440]  computers never glitch they never freeze upper that's right they will this

[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.600]  welcome back to the Alex Jones job a good night and joining me now in studio
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.040]  is Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson we watched the debate last night we've
[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:22.200]  been talking about some of the foreign policy issues let's talk a little bit
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:27.200]  about the issues of the back-and-forth between Donald Trump and Fox News clearly
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:31.640]  they were after Donald Trump and Donald Trump came after them after the debate he
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.200]  tweeted out wow Megan Kelly really bombed tonight people are going wild on
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:40.280]  Twitter funny to watch he said Fox viewers give low marks to bimbo Megan
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:45.960]  Kelly will consider other programs you know I saw a an article saying that
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.640]  Donald Trump had said we need to get rid of anchor babies and when I saw that
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:52.840]  my first glance at that I thought he said Donald Trump says we need to get
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:57.880]  rid of anchor babes psychological thing because I've seen so much of this back
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:01.240]  and forth between the two of them and of course and he also lashed out at Frank
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:07.080]  Luntz and Frank Luntz I really don't like what Fox News does in terms of
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:11.720]  manipulating the audience they go out and they select people they have their
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:15.080]  oh look we we watch the graph this is their reactions as they're going up who
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:18.000]  are these people that they've selected and a lot of people on Twitter notice
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.960]  that as well many of the Twitter comments we have such as this one from
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:26.400]  John D. Phil says who gave Fox News the authority to set up guidelines for
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:29.760]  residing a third party and many other people have things to say about Megan
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:33.560]  Kelly just the way they attack Trump pretty obvious things so even the
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:37.440]  viewers know that they were definitely gunning I think big set of best is the
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:42.200]  GOP versus Fox versus Donald Trump yeah it's pretty much what it was
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:46.080]  let's look at what he said about Frank Luntz he says Frank Luntz this is Donald
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:51.360]  Trump speaking tweeted out Frank Luntz is a low-class slob to my office looking
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:56.840]  for consulting work and I had zero interest now he picks anti-Trump panels
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:02.400]  Frank Luntz your so-called focus groups are a total joke yes they are don't come
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:07.320]  to my office looking for business again you are a clown one of the things I did
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:10.720]  like that uh that Trump was talking about was how all these politicians try
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:13.640]  to be politically correct about everything they said the big problem in
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:18.120]  this country has is being politically correct I've been challenged by so many
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:21.920]  people and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness and to be
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:25.240]  honest with you this country doesn't have time for that either this country's
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.600]  in big trouble and we don't win anymore we lose to China we lose in Mexico we
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.520]  lose to everybody so that's something that's very true everyone's so worried
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.960]  about being politically correct trying to say the right thing so they can fit
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:40.360]  in with the right group when sometimes you just need to go out there and be
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:44.480]  blatantly honest that's one of the reasons they're tired of professional
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:48.520]  politicians yeah exactly but they're fed up with the political correctness you
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:52.480]  know I don't know if you guys follow the top gear very very popular worldwide
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.800]  show out of BBC Jeremy Clarkson with somebody who just laughed at the
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:01.720]  political correctness and of course the BBC found a way to get rid of him they
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.640]  were anxious when he had a altercation with one of the employees regardless of
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:08.240]  what you think about that altercation the reason they got rid of Clarkson was
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:11.280]  because they couldn't stand him laughing at their political correctness and
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:14.920]  that's what Donald Trump does he may do it very awkwardly like he's calling
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:18.800]  people clowns and bimbos and saying you're a fat slob low-class slob you
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:25.160]  know and again look at this we watched because this is the this is the year
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:28.880]  that Back to the Future 2 was talking about they did it in 1985 the first
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:33.400]  episode they go back 30 years to 1955 the second installment they go 30 years
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:37.520]  ahead to this year 2015 and you know Lexus just came out with a hoverboard
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:40.520]  says anything else told the fame let's watch Back to the Future 2 again we're
[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:47.240]  watching it we're rolling on the floor laughing because Donald Trump is Biff as
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:51.680]  an adult I mean you go back to 2015 Biff's even got his casinos and his
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:55.520]  towers and there's a clip there you can see that clip right there and there's
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:01.720]  even a clip where he's standing in his office talking to Michael J. Fox and
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:07.760]  behind him there's a big poster of Biff in a suit and that's where he really it
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:12.040]  looks like Donald Trump but you can that's coming up and I can just hear
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:17.840]  Donald Trump addressing Megyn Kelly hello hello they fly banging her that
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:21.880]  there's the picture by their side is that Donald Trump in the background or is that
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:26.080]  Biff Tannen I don't know I think this is amazing the predictive program how did
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.800]  they know that Donald Trump was going to be running for president in 2015 when
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:37.080]  they did this movie 30 years ago wow that's quite the image there you go
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:41.760]  we also have another Twitter question this one from Casey Barry 92 and they
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:44.800]  wanted and this person wants to know which person do we think is going to
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:50.240]  fall to the VP status first I say Ted Cruz would be the well I think the
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:54.040]  person that is running I think you got a race for vice president between Carly
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:29:00.280]  Fiorina and Marco Rubio you know Marco Rubio is very well polled polished guy
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:03.760]  that they've got there who I don't think is qualified to run as I said he
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:07.400]  Cruz and Jindal I don't think meet the qualifications of a natural born citizen
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:12.000]  but I don't like his politics either but Carly Fiorino would also be an obvious
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.040]  choice for them because they obviously were pushing her very much with Fox News
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:20.160]  Karl Rove and all these people are pushing her she's got close connections to
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:25.920]  the CIA well as a very end though too on Hannity we'll talk about this next on
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:30.360]  the next segment but Ben Carson or not been Carson but Marco Rubio was asked
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:33.760]  about security in America and he said he would fix the illegal immigration
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:41.200]  problem with arming the airport yeah we'll be right back Joe Biggs and
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:44.440]  Jacari Jackson we'll talk about that debates last night a little bit more
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:54.340]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:30:03.600]  GCN radio network this is Joe Biggs with info wars dot com now last night we had
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:09.840]  the first GOP debate it was a very heated debate between the GOP and Donald
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:14.840]  Trump Trump to Megan Kelly I don't have time for political correctness and
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:19.280]  neither does this country Megan Kelly calls out Donald Trump for sexist
[02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:23.640]  remarks from his Twitter history you called women you don't like fat pigs
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:30.360]  dogs slobs and disgusting animals Trump replied with no only Rosie O'Donnell and
[02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:34.520]  everyone in the entire crowd laughed presidential hopeful Donald Trump told
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:38.920]  reporters that he felt the questions posed them brand appropriate in the Fox
[02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:44.160]  News host Megan Kelly especially behaved very badly last night's GOP debate was
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:49.560]  always predicted to be the Donald Trump show but the fact that Rand Paul got
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:55.360]  less than half the speaking time again illustrates how easy it is to freeze out
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:31:01.000]  certain candidates this is Joe Biggs with info wars dot com another major health

[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:34.360]  in austin joining me live in the studio are joe biggs and jacari jackson and
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:37.960]  we're going to be going to paul joseph watson in the uk in just a moment he's
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:42.680]  going to give us his comments about the debate watching it from the uk of course
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.720]  we had several people on twitter commenting about ben carson why he
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:50.800]  wasn't given more time at one point ben carson was they didn't talk to him for
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:53.960]  quite a while and he goes they'd only talked to him once he said i didn't
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:56.640]  think you were going to come back to me ever again well what they said in that
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:00.040]  first question i thought was interesting because it told us more i think
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:04.960]  really about fox news than it tells us about ben carson here's what the question
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:08.200]  said they said you've suggested the Baltic states are not part of NATO just
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:11.000]  months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and the
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:15.280]  government and israel etc etc and i'm listening to this and i'm thinking what
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:18.120]  is he running for is he running for president of the united states is he
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:23.680]  running for emperor of a worldwide empire and of course the latter would be
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:27.600]  what fox news is saying why does he know need to know the political parties in
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:30.920]  israel if he doesn't know the constitution those are the questions and
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:35.840]  the concerns that i had about ben carson is his vacillation on the right to keep
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:40.120]  him bare arms the fact that he's made comments about how people in rural areas
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:43.640]  yeah they should have firearms but not people in cities they really don't need
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:48.800]  them and then coming down hard against informed consent and for mandatory
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:54.160]  vaccines that to me betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about the
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:57.440]  constitution about individual liberty about the purpose of the federal
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:00.440]  government he's flip-flopped quite a few times on the second amendment so that
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:03.720]  kind of makes me a little nervous as to what's going to happen once if you were
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:07.280]  to get in that position and actually be president but he stick with how he views
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:11.160]  it now is he for the second amendment or is he going to go back to saying that
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:14.520]  every gun needs to be registered we need to have this huge database we're gonna
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:17.960]  do all this we're gonna force vaccine so i don't know i'm not sold on me seems
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:21.240]  like a nice guy the fact that he's not a professional politician he was able to
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:24.640]  come in there and when he was act actually given time to talk he kind of
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.920]  hunted and himself very well i thought so yeah you know when they're when
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:31.320]  they're talking to him about playing playing geography quizzes you know do
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:34.000]  you know about the Baltic states do you know about the political parties in
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.640]  israel and everything i mean if you're talking about running a worldwide
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.480]  empire which is what they want then you're going to ask Caesar you know do
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:44.520]  you know about gall do you know about germania you know what what are you
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:47.320]  going to do about the vandals you know you're gonna ban spray paint or whatever
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:50.960]  i mean that's the kind of concerns that we see in the kind of topics that are
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:54.680]  brought up by fox news are not going to talk about individual liberty they're
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:58.200]  not going to talk about the constitution except to call it a bunch of hot air when
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.760]  you talk about like chris christie now in terms of the time that everybody is
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:06.560]  getting of course it wasn't ben Carson who really got the shaft on time it was
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:11.360]  ran paul and paul joseph watson had an article talking about that earlier today
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:14.720]  thanks for joining us paul let's go to paul joseph watson now in the uk
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:19.840]  paul your comments on the debate last night well yeah i put that article out
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:24.400]  earlier about ran paul getting less than half the time that donald trump got and
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:29.560]  basically the point i'm making is ran paul was the only anti-establishment
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.320]  candidate really and i mean i'm not a fan of everything he says but if you look
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:38.080]  at the entire field before donald trump came along rand was the only truly
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:44.040]  anti-establishment candidate so then trump arrives with this populist bluster
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:47.760]  which if you look at his actual history in his statements even going back just
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:53.280]  two four six years is complete baloney so then they set trump up as the
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:57.520]  establishment candidate and in fact i've got a video up on info wars.com right
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:04.000]  now called is trump a hillary plan because if you look at the polls trump is
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.320]  way ahead of the other gop candidates but he has no chance whatsoever of
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:12.520]  defeating hillary clinton in a head-to-head before trump arrived on the
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  theme ran paul was basically had the best chance out of all the gop candidates
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:23.120]  of defeating hillary now still people like scott walker are tied with hillary
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:27.720]  so he would have a chance in a hypothetical head-to-head-to-head but trump
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:33.920]  is twelve percent behind hillary even at the height of his popularity and while
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:39.360]  hillary is under investigation by the fbi so given that trump received this you
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:45.120]  know mysterious phone call back in may shortly before he made his announcement
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.760]  i think he's a ringer i think he's a stooge for hillary clinton i really think
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.280]  that's what's going on well you know paul he gave the clinton foundation over
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:57.080]  hundred thousand dollars but it was just to get her to come to his wedding that's
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:03.800]  what he said last night i mean you can get an obviously he's donated money to
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:08.600]  other people but then you look at his statements about how kind and generous
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:12.200]  he's been and in fact they're in the video you look at bill clinton's
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:15.760]  statements about how kind and generous he's been then he gets a phone call
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:20.160]  right before his presidential announcement from bill clinton and there's
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:24.960]  an article in the hill which says if bill clinton had told him all these
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:29.280]  things to do and that's what you would expect trump to do you know attack other
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:34.600]  GOP candidates personally alienate hispanic voters he's done all these
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:39.200]  things that someone like clinton would have told him to do if his intention was
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:43.840]  to sabotage the GOP race and ensure that hillary is going to come out on top
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.640]  because remember bill deberg before bill deberg we released the article where
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:54.040]  hillary's top advisor who also advised obama was at bill deberg and we basically
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:59.200]  made the prediction that she was the elite pick and that's exactly what's
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:03.880]  going on if you know if conservatives want hillary clinton to become president
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:08.120]  then they should keep supporting donald trump because that's exactly what's
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:12.120]  going to happen well it's not only that but he's also a stalking horse for jeb
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:16.480]  bush because jeb bush last night was talking about how he will they ask
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:20.280]  him questions about the foundation that he was a director of with bloomberg
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:24.160]  giving ten million dollars to plan parenthood and he said oh well it was
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:27.600]  just because we were really it wasn't that I thought it was to promote
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:30.400]  education well what was the education was promoting that was the other thing
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:35.360]  that was talked about common core so here's a guy promoting abortion with
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.360]  plan parenthood as we mentioned earlier in the program both his father and his
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.120]  grandfather were closely tied to plan parenthood he's talking he's pushing
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:48.080]  common core he's pushing open borders so when you got donald trump out there
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:51.840]  personally attacking people were coming across rather than talking about our
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:57.920]  enticement our open borders then that opens up the an area for jeb bush to
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:02.200]  look like a good guy the good guy out of the GOP so he's really a stalking horse
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:06.240]  for jeb bush as well he makes a republican party look bad but then he
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:10.320]  makes jeb bush look like a quote-unquote compassionate conservative which was the
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:16.920]  beard that his brother ran with yeah and you know it's the same with bush as you
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:20.520]  mentioned with Trump you know bush made a lot of populist statements that
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:23.640]  resonated with a lot of people you know we're not gonna be the global policemen
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.320]  same as Obama you know we're gonna reverse the Patriot Act we're gonna
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.200]  shut down Guantanamo Bay we're gonna get get out of all these wars and
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:35.460]  basically trumps running on the same populist platform but there's no
[02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:40.640]  substance whatsoever and in fact you know the big reaction is oh look how
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:45.680]  evil fox news is baiting Donald Trump well actually they give him they gave
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:50.840]  him the platform to do what he does best which is firing back with these witty
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.920]  retorts and giving him the opportunity to make more of these you know populist
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.120]  statements and making politically incorrect statements rather than actually
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:07.400]  focusing on his record which is you know is not conservative yes four years ago
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:12.480]  he was he was anti-abortion he was pro open borders and they don't grill him on
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:18.600]  it and Trump claims that he suddenly quote politically evolved okay you
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:23.400]  politically evolved from a liberal to a conservative between the ages of what
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:30.200]  18 to 30 maximum Donald Trump is 69 you don't just suddenly flip from being a
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:35.240]  liberal to a conservative when you're 69 years old unless there's another
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:40.600]  agenda going on and yes it's partly his ego why he wants to become president at
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.680]  all but I think it's partly because you know he's been sent to sabotage the whole
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:48.080]  process well you got Tea Party conservatives and the Tea Party was
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:52.480]  really founded as an opposition to crony capitalism that was one of the core
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:57.160]  things about it and yet here they are coalescing so many of them behind someone
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:01.560]  who has unabashedly been a crony capitalist and said hey the system's
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:05.320]  broken I'm using the system the way I want I'd give money to these guys I give
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:09.080]  it left and right I'm a businessman that's the way I do business in America
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:12.920]  than saying when I need a favor I call him in two or three years I mean he
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:18.720]  really does sound like the godfather not somebody who is running for president
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:23.800]  yeah and it's not only the Clintons you know Clinton Senate campaign and the
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:28.720]  Clinton Foundation who he's donated to you know look at who else he's given
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:34.680]  money to Chuck Schumer the big gun control guy Harry Reid probably don't
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:38.880]  have to remind listeners about you know what he said about the Clive and Bundy
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:43.720]  supporters last year calling them domestic terrorists he donated money to
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:48.200]  Anthony Weiner as well amongst all these other top Democrats not moderate
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:53.560]  Democrats but extreme left-wing Democrats that push all this anti-conservative
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:57.880]  crap and then he suddenly turns around and says I've I've politically evolved
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:04.480]  and become a conservative at the age of 69 I simply don't believe it I don't
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:08.920]  either what do you guys think about what what Paul is saying here I'll give you
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:11.920]  guys a chance to jump out he made some excellent points just like he was saying
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:17.120]  how your political ideology evolves when you make the point that he's not in that
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:21.080]  18 to 30 range I think that is very suspect but you know it's not just
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:25.280]  Trump it's many of these guys that I take exception with talking about the
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:29.320]  records on many other things not just the things that we've mentioned here you
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:32.200]  know one of the things that I was looking at I'm curious to get your take on
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:37.640]  Paul you have a very different political system you have very lively debates in
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.280]  the House of Commons there and when anybody here in the United States like
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:47.000]  Ted Cruz came out and pointed out that Mitch McConnell had lied about the
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.560]  Trans-Pacific Partnership and these these trade deals he was escoriated by the
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:56.880]  leadership there how do people in Britain react about this sports and
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:01.160]  weather entertainment debate system that we've got here last night I mean I was
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:04.600]  absolutely appalled about it and I'm used to seeing that kind of stuff here in
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:11.720]  America what's the reaction in the UK and in Britain I think British people
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:15.440]  quite used to seeing that for everything in relation to how you know
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:21.320]  Americans respond not just politics so it's nothing out of the ordinary the
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:26.760]  kind of debates that we saw before the UK election earlier this year that they're
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:30.720]  not obviously dressed up in the pageantry that you have over there they
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:34.280]  were quite lively but I don't think it would be a surprise to people who live
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:38.640]  in the UK as to the whole you know spectacle that surrounds these kind of
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:43.880]  debates but apparently it was Fox News's most popular broadcast ever they're
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:49.120]  talking about 24 million people who watched it so from that standpoint I
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:53.120]  guess at least it might reinvigorate some people who are on the fringes who
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:57.960]  are not really interested in politics and it might get them back involved well
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:00.800]  you know what we've seen in the previous discussions what we saw in the
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:04.800]  junior varsity debate in the afternoon and what we saw in the New Hampshire
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:11.760]  debate on Monday were some very staid and tired controlled discussions where
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:14.920]  they were where they got up there and just read talking points that they had
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:20.200]  prepared ahead of time this debate they engaged in some very lively back and
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:25.040]  forth debating and of course we had that back and forth between Chris Christie
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:31.080]  and Rand Paul my take on all this Paul I want to get your take on it is I think
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:35.640]  that they brought Chris Christie and simply as the pit bull to go after Rand
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:41.720]  Paul while Megan Kelly went back and forth with with Donald Trump I think they
[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:45.440]  really wanted to have someone there who is going to go head-to-head with Rand
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:47.880]  Paul that's what we saw with the fireworks going on back and forth
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:52.840]  between those two well yeah they had obviously they had Trump right in the
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:57.280]  center that's always you know a ploy to throw the most attention on whoever's
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:01.800]  right in the center Rand Paul was right off on the on the wing so you know
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:07.800]  physically he was removed from the the spotlight and in fact someone pointed
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:12.200]  out that even though Rand Paul had according to some accounts less than
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:18.320]  five minutes talk time in comparison to Donald Trump's 11 minutes almost half
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:22.760]  of that was other people talking over him yeah so he didn't even get a full
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:26.600]  five minutes he basically got two and a half minutes to talk but the things that
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.680]  Ron Paul said were better control right the things that Ron Paul actually said
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.880]  though were actually legitimate answers were legitimate things about what our
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:40.200]  country needs whereas like with Trump and all that it was just this like I said
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.240]  it was just personal attacks it was Fox News trying to attack this person
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:48.360]  Donald Trump trying to attack again it went away from a debate and it went
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:52.080]  into this whole like comedy skit it was like a skit from Saturday Night Live and
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:56.360]  almost half expected for these candidates to walk out wearing NASCAR jackets with
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:01.280]  all their sponsor logos on it because that's the way they promoted this you
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:06.240]  know show today it was like a comedy show yeah absolutely one of the fact
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:09.720]  checks that we saw in a course what most of the gubernatorial candidates will do
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.200]  is they'll come out and talk about how many jobs they create and so now we're
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:16.880]  seeing fact checks about this where Jeb Bush says we created 1.3 million jobs
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:20.520]  we led the nation seven out of the eight of those years it's like well no not
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:24.320]  actually Scott Walker then comes out we said I came in with an unemployment rate
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:29.080]  of over 8% now it's down to 4.6% and so forth and so on this is what we see from
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:32.720]  the gubernatorial candidates throwing out these numbers every one of them
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:37.400]  created more jobs than anybody else did and also Christie saying that you think
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:41.360]  it's bad now you should have saw it when I first got there yeah cuz he just said
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:45.400]  yeah well Jersey's always been bad Jersey's always been bad what do you
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:50.400]  expect yeah the low low achiever right there but then of course what we see
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:55.200]  from Donald Trump is he inflates his net worth according to many people they
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:00.000]  say that he put it out there as having a net worth of ten billion dollars but
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.400]  then the fact checkers say well no maybe it's three or four billion I've seen
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:08.200]  other things that put it at seven billion is this really what's important you
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:11.600]  know this is what we see each time we come through and it really bothers me
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:14.200]  to see these Republican candidates out there all the time about how they
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:19.280]  created jobs it's like well if you reduce taxes if you reduce regulation which
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:23.960]  most of these guys have not really done then you can have an environment there
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.920]  where some other people can put their money at risk and they can work hard
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:32.520]  and then they create jobs but I hate to see these politicians it really great
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:36.920]  so me especially to see Republican politicians taking credit for jobs that
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.720]  are created we even had Jeb Bush talking about how many jobs he was going to
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:44.560]  create in the future I mean he didn't even get to the point where he was
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:49.480]  talking about any jobs he had created he's got a figure that he's going to
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:52.600]  create if he becomes president in the future this astronaut also a lot of
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:55.880]  these are government jobs that come to these various states especially you know
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:59.280]  states like here in Texas you get a lot of government jobs down here well we had
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:05.120]  Obama say I had this many jobs saved or created okay because he says well yeah
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:07.840]  these are people it would have been laid off and it's like how can how can you
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:10.520]  even measure that that's a metric that you can't come up with it's just like
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:14.400]  Jeb Bush talking about his future jobs as you're gonna have well it seemed like
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:17.720]  all the candidates up there were shooting from the hip with their replies
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:21.720]  except for Jeb Bush it seemed like everything he had he stuck with a script
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:25.280]  it was already pre-written out and he just rolled with that it was this
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:30.600]  cookie-cutter political response he's well-coached do you guys have that clip
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:34.480]  about Jeb Bush where he said they call me Jeb that was the most ridiculous thing
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:40.320]  when I saw that I said I don't know this guy may actually be dumber than W
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:44.760]  at one point they're the very first question to Jeb Bush is how do you
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:48.760]  distinguish yourself from your brother and from your father and so he's what's
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:52.560]  to say that he's his own man well they call me and he says this he says I've
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:56.320]  got a record in Florida I'm proud of my dad I'm certainly proud of my brother in
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:01.440]  Florida they called me Jeb because I earned it now what does that even mean
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:04.640]  you know what does it mean when they call you Jeb I don't want to ever know about a
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:08.720]  man named Jed I don't want to earn it I don't want to earn a Jeb at all I don't
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:11.760]  even know what that means I want to get off that path of earning a Jeb nobody
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.680]  called him on it I rolled out of my chair laughing at that point it's like
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:20.960]  what in the world is he talking about so yeah he also puts himself out there as
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:25.000]  a pro-life candidate we've talked about that a great deal in this in this
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.920]  program about the Bush family's involvement with Planned Parenthood it
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:34.720]  takes more than just okaying a driver's license plate that says I'm pro life to
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:38.960]  be pro life your family supports it from the get-go the Bush family is
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:42.400]  essentially like the Bill Gates family they've been in this thing from the very
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:48.200]  beginning and that's that's the simple truth folks we've got a lot of masks that

[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:11.520]  created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government
[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:14.920]  officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:19.040]  radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:23.320]  invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:27.520]  cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:31.960]  incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID stronghold to share my inventions and
[02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:35.800]  blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out

[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:14.640]  go back to Paul Joseph Watson Paul your comments on the debate we have this is
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:18.300]  the last segment we have with you I just want to get your final comments on
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:23.760]  this well there's an article out of Bloomberg today Fox News couldn't kill
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:28.680]  Trump's momentum and may have only made it stronger so there was there was all
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:33.200]  this you know stuff about oh Fox News is really gonna go after Trump Meg
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:37.880]  Meg and Kelly's gonna throw the misogyny card at him giving him the
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:42.480]  opportunity to be politically incorrect you know everyone in the audience
[02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:46.400]  whoops and hollers they they're not grilling him on the fact that he's
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:51.520]  pro-abortion and pro-open borders if they actually did that it would expose
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:56.200]  Donald Trump for the ringer that he is so it's a claim that Fox News is going
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:01.840]  after him is complete BS because now his popularity has only so that's why they
[02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:06.040]  call him you know Teflon Trump because when people attack him it only makes
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:11.800]  him stronger so instead of analyzing and grilling his actual record they try these
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.640]  you know feminist talking points which are not gonna resonate with
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:20.120]  conservative audiences so you know again if you actually grill him on his record
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:24.640]  and his flip-flopping then he would lose a lot of support but for the moment
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:29.160]  that's not gonna happen and in fact he's only getting more popular thanks to
[02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:33.320]  Fox News well of course they like to skew everything towards personalities it's
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:37.360]  all about identity politics it's all about personalities they want to invite
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:42.240]  these back-and-forth conflicts because that makes for an exciting news program
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:46.040]  but as one of the comments here on Twitter says why didn't any other
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:49.240]  candidate defend and declare the Constitution and go after Christie
[02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:53.360]  besides Rand Paul of course we wouldn't had anything of any substance they have
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:57.640]  such a narrow range of issues that they talk about as you were talking about
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:04.680]  before Joe Lindsey Graham when he was talking every solution was let's invade
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:08.400]  the Middle East send a massive number of troops the Middle East no matter what
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:11.280]  the situation even takes a question about abortion and turns that into
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:15.720]  invading the Middle East yeah Trump was also asked about his declaration 15
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:19.960]  years ago that he backed a single-payer health care system and I did a spies by
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:23.640]  Republicans they could work at a different age what is this age you're
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:27.240]  talking about here also citing success of the program in Canada and Scotland
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.200]  Trump added he backs private insurance now but Paul interjected the Republican
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:34.840]  Party has been fighting against the single-payer system for decades so I
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:38.320]  think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:44.360]  payer exactly when you look at all of these different issues Trump is arguing
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:47.480]  for exactly the same policies that the Democrats are arguing for which makes
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:51.920]  perfect sense as to why he would support so many Democrat politics until
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:55.640]  about five years ago when he stopped making contributions to the Democrats
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.960]  and he started making heavy exclusive contributions to Republicans trying to
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:03.840]  build connections and inside the Republican Party and allies there well a
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:07.440]  lot of people who are also contributing money to Hillary Clinton are also given
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:10.560]  money to Jeb Bush actually a lot of those people are giving more money to Jeb
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:14.240]  Bush so that's a very interesting exact going on as well the same group of
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:18.280]  bankers we've got the Goldman Sachs family it's not really a game of throne
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:20.760]  as long as they get one of them in there they don't care they know they're gonna
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:23.800]  get what they always do that they always have both sides of it well that's it for
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:28.280]  today's show thanks for joining us Paul Joseph Watson the UK Joe Biggs and
