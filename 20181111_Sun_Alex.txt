[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show 1111 the 11th day of
[00:23.000 --> 00:33.000]  November 2018 as we plunge forth into the next leg of the space time continuum as we go back to the
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  future. We're gonna be here for the next two hours live as we are every Sunday then counter think
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  with Mike Adams hard-hitting investigative journalist full hour of that right after we end at
[00:46.000 --> 00:53.000]  five o'clock central standard time boy do we have some amazing news and some entertaining news to
[00:53.000 --> 01:02.000]  cover as well I'm gonna try to be a good boy here today because we've already spent two days here on
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  air and with one of the biggest news stories well the biggest news story in the country on Thursday
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.000]  that was admitted and on Tuesday it was still one of the top five stories you wouldn't think China
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  threatened to nuke us or attack our ships in the South China Sea is a big deal no it's it's the
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  entire corporate media committing political and journalistic suicide in front of everybody saying
[01:25.000 --> 01:33.000]  that we doctored a tape of Jim Acosta in front of God and country in the whole world shoving the
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  interns hand down and jerking the microwave all we did was zoom it in and so then every channel in
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  the country basically decided to say we doctored it your radio listeners were showing side by
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  side and of course the president came out on Friday and said he looked at our tape and the other
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  tape and nothing's doctor we zoomed it in that's all we did was zoom it in which is not doctoring
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  it is clarifying it really but this is bigger than just Jim Acosta in full war so this or this petty
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  issue it's that Stephen Colbert and all the other late night comics got the exact same script and
[02:11.000 --> 02:20.000]  the exact same words said the exact same thing Jimmy Kimball you name it now it doesn't matter to
[02:20.000 --> 02:31.000]  them that more than 20 top professors and experts in digital editing have come out and said no they
[02:31.000 --> 02:38.000]  did not doctor the video they blew it up when they uploaded it dropped a few frames which the eye
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  can't even see which is normal interlacing skip frames different systems you can take an HD video
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  try to upload it sometimes it skips frames but when you're using cruddy video it happens but the
[02:49.000 --> 02:57.000]  point is is that they show the video like the emperors new clothes like nineteen four two plus
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  two whatever they say they show the video on all these TV shows and then say look at the editing and
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  then they show the exact same video oh I forgot to tell you guys to do this place there's a bunch of
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  these and I meant to send it to you I sent one to Paul so I'll pull it up for my text there
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  sort of noticing a new trend yesterday because it's the anatomy of their next level line they were
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  saying Jones released totally doctored footage of costa didn't even touch her and we're not going to
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  show you the video it's so horrible Dallas morning news LA Times New York Times and I'm looking
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  where there's articles in the digital age and no video imagine a time-life books or you're at the
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  grocery store you know you're checking out they've got the Grand Canyon in beautiful photos you buy it
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  there's no photos the Grand Canyon inside these are articles about our hoax video so the new thing was
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  the public wasn't buying it Thursday and Friday to say that it was a hoax video because people
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  watched it said that's the same video they'll go look side by side clearly fake it's exactly the same
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  Paul's a little gray because he downloaded and reuploaded again everybody knows about generations
[04:09.000 --> 04:18.000]  and video but it was that now the new thing is they don't show the video there it is it reads like
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  satire Trump's press secretaries lying to us about the press and that we can accept she must be fired
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  she must be fired that's the talking point and then you they hear about the fake video where I
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  where we say that you know he chopped her head off or whatever none of that is in there they don't show
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  you the video like we're doing over and over again so this is next level deception folks where they
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  they go just trust us it's doctored but we're not gonna show it to you for your own best interest
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  they have reached cloud cuckoo land this shows they've reached cloud cuckoo land now the really big
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.000]  news is coming up the poll watches responded to this and so much more and the Florida attempt to
[04:56.000 --> 05:02.000]  steal the election there and Arizona it's all coming up living in volcano may sound more dramatic
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.000]  than it really is the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big
[05:08.000 --> 05:15.000]  island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe
[05:39.000 --> 05:47.000]  measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[05:59.000 --> 06:17.000]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  we're live we're broadcasting worldwide on this live Sunday edition I'm here every Sunday
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  4 to 6 p.m. central with a live broadcast I return weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central I'm Alex
[06:41.000 --> 06:51.000]  Jones and I am the most lied about most demonized most attacked person in the world after
[06:51.000 --> 06:59.000]  Donald John Trump and why is that well it's because I'm promoting free countries I'm promoting free
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  market I'm promoting Americana and I predicted accurately pretty much everything that's come true
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  the last 20 years and the establishment is scared to debt that you're paying attention they're
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  scared to death that you're listening they're scared to debt that humanity's choosing free will
[07:14.000 --> 07:24.000]  and their own destiny and that's that's where we are let me just read you a few of the headlines
[07:24.000 --> 07:33.000]  then I'll plunge right into it I have a whole stack here Florida deja vu as state election
[07:33.000 --> 07:42.000]  hit by chaos fraud accusations that's yahoo news now this is Broward County that's had the same
[07:42.000 --> 07:51.000]  elections head for something like 30 years and every election in Florida that's close she then
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  holds up that election and then finds ballots to make the Democrat win and she's been found
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  in court to have been engaged in direct election stealing twice and another four or five times
[08:04.000 --> 08:16.000]  evidence of quote massive incompetence I'll explain that again they don't find 18 wheelers
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  and big trucks full of balance for people that won by big margins if a Democrat has lost
[08:22.000 --> 08:30.000]  by a small margin she always says hold the horses and even a day after state law says you
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  can't bring new balance in she brings in big old juicy trucks and people say where they come from
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  and she says I'm not saying then they have election judges come in and watch them count them
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  and large portions of them are thrown out ballots are ballots that had just been punched out
[08:46.000 --> 08:56.000]  now that's not me saying that that's the Miami newspapers and again you've got how many counties
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  in Florida but it's Broward County where the police stand down for a mass shooting it's Broward
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  County that Al Gore tries to steal the 19 2000 it's it's over and over and over again it's
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  every time and then we point this out and they say we're crazy so let's let's hit that first
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  and I'll get into all the other news here it is for today Javu as state election hit by chaos
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  fraud accusations and every time it's Broward County and they've sent in state investigators
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  and others they the fuckers video will play later congressman Matt Gates went to it from
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  Florida and they had the police grab him because there's new trucks pulling up a day after
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  they can't take new ones in and they're just like we're gonna arrest you get out of here
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  don't worry about it we're gonna take these in here and count them he's like well if I
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  like the law we don't care that video is on him for wars dot com and news wars dot com so
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  it's but but every time there's a mountain of evidence just call it a conspiracy theory
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  Florida election recount underway tensions rise from tweets he's watching Florida closely
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  people trying to steal elections the media calls that a conspiracy theory and it goes on
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  from there Democrat lawyers object to non-citizen Florida ballot being thrown out lawyers for
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Gilliam Nelson pushing for illegals to vote in US election they're publicly calling for
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  it and then people are being honest when they voted because they thought they were supposed
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  to vote if they weren't citizens and they're finding all these ballots that say I'm not a
[10:35.000 --> 10:45.000]  citizen and they're like doesn't matter they're still good yes you heard me right that's a
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.000]  zero hedge article with links to local news with the Democrats admitting well of course
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  we let non-citizens vote whoops this is Miami Herald whoops there it is whoops there it is
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  Brenda Snipes the only woman that seems to get to really count the votes deciding wins
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  our county office mixed bad provisional ballots with good ones but they said they're going
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  to let them go through no one guess what the provisional ballots happen to be for Democrats
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  it's just magic some ballots showed up we don't know where they came from and they're
[11:18.000 --> 11:25.000]  they're not real ballots but sorry that's just what a watcher caught so they admit it yeah
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  those those those weren't real people but as you can do about it we the bosses we the
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  bosses but again that's a conspiracy theory you know that's the Miami Herald saying that
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  and they're just saying it's accidental but the votes still count yes it adds fire that
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  she's incompetent yes she's incompetent like a fox sure oh Brian Kent pushes Stacey Abrams
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  to concede but she won't give up either in Georgia as announcing there's a recount in
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  a new election even though there isn't that's right but doesn't matter it's not true she's
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  okay Pelosi dismisses Trump's charges of fraud in Florida recount oh yes there's no fraud
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  GOP representative elect Grand Shaw makes appearance on SNL we'll get to that Florida
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  orders recount in Senate governor races and of course you've got Gillum who'd conceded
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.000]  now saying he's not conceding because there's all those magic ballots coming back and there's
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  the article Stacey Abrams largely attempts to run illegal ads in support of a non-existent
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  gubernatorial runoff it's not happening but why not just say it now that's just some of
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  what I've got there and I've got all the footage of Matt Gates saying hey it's past midnight
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  it's a day later you can't be bringing new trucks in where are they from where one of
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  these balusters like shut up police are like it's brown County brother we vote in Florida
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  that matter the whole state votes against my 100% we'll find 25 million votes so just
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  get on out of here that's what this has come down to that's how stupid they think you are
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  I'm gonna play all that coming up later but that's the stack of news that I wanted to get to
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  first not info wars calm not news wars calm not even those are really respected trusted
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  names that's what the enemy attacks them and lies about us all the time says we're fake news
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  that's Miami Herald that's that's all of it right there that's what's going on and videos
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  of just truck after truck after truck after truck just arriving out of nowhere and surprise
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  surprise they do a recount and they're almost all Democrats and so the Democrats are gonna
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  win the governorship that they lost and they're gonna win the Senate seat they lost they're
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  gonna win all the other races they lost that were close because Broward County is a magic
[13:40.000 --> 13:51.000]  genie and Miss Snipes why she has no idea what's going on but everything's okay and that's
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  what Roger Stone we should get Roger on today I didn't want to guess what he's probably calling
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  to get him on he lives in Broward County he said listen they almost always show elections
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  in Broward and any close races they always keep them open I can't believe they've conceded
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  and I said it's because they know we're watching Roger watch I bet a day or two later they
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  are playing something and sure as they do they were being watched as they're Broward County
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  this is like the most corrupt county in the galaxy for election fraud and everything else
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  that matter and now it happened now it happened ladies and gentlemen so that's all coming
[14:24.000 --> 14:35.000]  up next segment now the other news obviously deals with geopolitical issues and it also
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.000]  deals with the open borders it also deals with Trump in France for the World War One
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  Memorial and Macron openly declaring war on nation states this is so key this is so huge
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  I'm gonna cover it at the bottom of the hour because this is world government out in the
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  open remember all those years we'd say they want to get rid of nation states and the EU
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  wants its own army in case countries try to leave Macron has now announced and so has the
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  German dictator she's been and she's been unelected but she's still in there for parliamentary
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  manipulation just like Yonker heads up the unelected EU they're all announcing that we
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  need an EU army to stop America no it's to stop nation states trying to pull out so we're
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  gonna look at nation states versus globalism and the fact that they're openly declaring
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  war on it now please remember that however you're listening to us on AM or FM radio stations
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  are on local television or via info wars.com without you outreaching and telling neighbors

[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  their plan their gambit the censoress will work so far it hasn't worked because you've
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  stayed excited you've stayed focused and you want to take the country in the world back

[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  taking action overrides Google and all the big tech giants because you are unstoppable
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  do you realize that when you spread the links from info wars.com when you spread the videos
[16:04.000 --> 16:11.000]  you are changing the world it's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist it is you
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying that stood against the
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  peer pressure that stood against the threats that have now changed the world and that's

[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  are the info war and now because of their intensifying censorship it's more important

[19:28.000 --> 19:33.000]  taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes

[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  change our bodies with Z shield info wars life dot com
[20:26.000 --> 20:46.000]  All right we are live it is Sunday it is 420 central standard time Roger Stone is going
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  to pop in next hour he lives in Broward County he headed up the recount for George W. Bush

[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  an illustration of incredible fraud going on they admit they've been counting ballots
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  that no one voted on they admit they're all punch for Democrats they admit that they've
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.000]  passed the date to have magic 18 wheeler show up and bring it all in so that's coming up
[21:26.000 --> 21:32.000]  it's just crazy but their answer is conspiracy theory just just say conspiracy theory if
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  you don't like what's going on just say the magic word or the magic words magic term
[21:36.000 --> 21:43.000]  conspiracy theory but let me get to this first because I've got coming up I've got
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  McCron attacking Trump for saying a nation state even exist we always told you the
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  globalist wanted to get rid of nation states what are they going to replace it with what's
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  been set up but remember that wasn't the case it was a conspiracy theory now they
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  admit that's their plan well what is the plan why do they want info wars shut down
[22:04.000 --> 22:12.000]  because we're exposing the globalist plan and we're offering our own plan that's what
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  they're scared of so that's all coming up in the last segment of the shower but I'm
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  going to get to this right now I'm going to go ahead and go to this information right
[22:23.000 --> 22:37.000]  now when I see this footage and I see the exact same talking points the exact same script
[22:37.000 --> 22:49.000]  on every news channel and every late night show and almost every newspaper it scares
[22:49.000 --> 22:58.000]  me not that I'm under attack but that they've gotten corporate media to lie at such a
[22:58.000 --> 23:08.000]  level and to be so disciplined to work in unison to put hoaxes out it makes my head
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  spin and that's what I want to break down here tonight is that corporate mainstream
[23:13.000 --> 23:22.000]  media ended up losing the 2016 election and instead of realizing hey people are sick
[23:22.000 --> 23:32.000]  of us lying they decided to lie that much more intensely and to then work in concert
[23:32.000 --> 23:40.000]  together like a team of horses all hooked up together to then deceive people they think
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  if they're all acting in unison putting out a lie let's say you know the sky's black
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  at high noon instead of it being blue or that ducks don't quack or whatever if they all
[23:52.000 --> 24:00.000]  say two plus two equals a thousand or they all say gravity is suspended does that make
[24:00.000 --> 24:08.000]  it so and that's really where we've gone and what we're up to so I get up Thursday and
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  again this is bigger than just the story it goes to the mind control the brainwashing
[24:12.000 --> 24:23.000]  all of it and they're saying on the news we doctored a video so I go look at it I'm like
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  well that's a cost to push it that interim and grab in the microwave when he would shut
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  up you already asked two questions he was on his third now it will watch and blew it up
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  but it's it's the same video we just zoomed in but they know that they're just doing it
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  to change the subject and then say that the press secretary is lying and she should be
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  fired on every channel that's the talking point you're about to see this it's mind boggling
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  and it notice in all these articles like the one I just showed you from the Dallas Morning News
[24:56.000 --> 25:04.000]  they don't show the so-called doctored video they don't show the doctored video on the Dallas Morning News
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  because it's not a doctored video they just say Jones put out a doctored video across the
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  didn't touch her what he did now others like Colbert and others they show the video but
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  then say it's doctored when it's not I mean they're just seeing what you'll go along with
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  at this point but it does freak me out because thousands of articles hundreds of TV stations
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  everywhere are saying we put out fake video and the president came out and said we didn't
[25:34.000 --> 25:41.000]  because we didn't and anybody can see that he pushes her and grabs the microwave and then
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  I've got document cam shot please motherboard is vice that's HBO they hate me but they said
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  no we looked at it and nothing's been doctored all it was zoom in yeah we just zoomed in on
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  she can see the action red state had forensic people look at it and all these other people
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  but it doesn't matter any idiot can look at this and see that it's just blown up video to show
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  what happened up close let's go to this piece here and we'll come back with Paul Watson's
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  response to this he's the one that got the blame to it zooming in is not doctoring a video
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  but lying and saying a doctored video is doctored is doctoring the truth here it is
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  isn't hiding anymore after giving plenty of time to his repeated question president Trump
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  moved on to the next reporter but CNN's Jim Acosta refused to give up the mic he can
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  clearly be seen physically resisting the White House intern from doing her job and when
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted a video from Info Wars which clarified this the mainstream
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  fake news began repeating their new programmed assignment doctored video
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted she tweeted a doctored video clip that they believe is from
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  Info Wars which is a website for the mentally unbalanced in which they sped up Jim Acosta's
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  hand movement to make it look more violent and the part where he says pardon me ma'am
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  they cut the audio out they altered this video and we'll take a look here and you see like
[27:13.000 --> 27:22.000]  they sped up his hand and the White House press secretary tweeted this video she intentionally
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.000]  disseminated doctored video footage to discredit a reputable journalist she's the White House
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  press secretary she should be fired for that she included this video the intern reaches
[27:33.000 --> 27:45.000]  for the mic and there he goes and that is terrible or it would be if it weren't fake news
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  because Sarah Sanders tweeted a doctored video and where did the White House get that doctored
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  video it appears to have originated with the far-right conspiracy site Info Wars the fact
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  that the White House press secretary is promoting this doctored video is reprehensible and grounds
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  for dismissal but one only needs a few minutes of critical thinking to discern the truth zooming
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.000]  in does not make a doctored video all that was nobody manipulated it give me a break see
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  that's just dishonest reporting all that is is a close up see that's just that is just
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  dishonest reporting I watched that I heard that last night they made it close up they
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  showed it closed up and it was not nice to that young woman I don't hold them for that
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  because it wasn't overly we're gonna come back with the rest of the president's statements
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  on this but you saw how Colbert and others have the exact same words it's a total script
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  because they've got a leftist reporter pushing on a woman they can't have that they just
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  say we doctored it all we did was blow it up to show that he was on the news saying he
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  got it because he was soundly liable see it's a factory of lies

[31:59.720 --> 32:03.320]  M4Store.com is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[32:03.320 --> 32:08.840]  introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate
[32:08.840 --> 32:15.240]  seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort,
[32:15.240 --> 32:21.320]  and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate
[32:21.320 --> 32:26.920]  certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began
[32:26.920 --> 32:31.720]  studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this
[32:31.720 --> 32:37.400]  research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[32:37.400 --> 32:42.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current
[32:42.520 --> 32:47.240]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an
[32:47.240 --> 32:53.160]  enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the
[32:53.160 --> 33:03.160]  air you breathe. Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:23.720 --> 33:28.280]  Two weeks ago, the international media decried President Trump for saying he believed America
[33:28.280 --> 33:34.120]  existed and he was a nationalist. They called that white supremacist and said decry your white
[33:34.120 --> 33:38.440]  nationalist stuff, which means something totally different. They have Islamic nationalists, they
[33:38.440 --> 33:43.400]  have communist nationalists, they have all these different systems like North Korea.
[33:43.400 --> 33:46.760]  Nationalists just means you believe in your country, and all countries are not created equal.
[33:46.760 --> 33:55.000]  That's coming up. But I've got to spend time here today pulling back and just looking at what has
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.400]  been one of the top stories the last four days. It was the biggest story Thursday, one of the top
[33:59.400 --> 34:05.400]  stories Friday and Saturday of the day, every late night show. I can't even keep track of it with
[34:05.400 --> 34:12.120]  the exact same statement. Sir, I can be standard. It must be fired. Jim Acosta of CNN, Fake News,
[34:12.120 --> 34:20.520]  did not touch anybody. Alex Jones faked it. And we're all there watching a live footage. Paul
[34:20.520 --> 34:25.880]  Watson just blows it up so you can see when Acosta said he didn't touch her, Paul goes,
[34:25.880 --> 34:32.280]  look, he clearly touches her here. And so what they do is because they know they're so discredited is
[34:33.480 --> 34:41.160]  they know that they're just disruptors. They know that they are nothing more than disruptors.
[34:41.160 --> 34:44.520]  Just like Trump says, they don't want to fix the country. They want to disrupt it.
[34:44.520 --> 34:47.480]  They don't want to have a press conference. They want to ask three aggressive questions
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.680]  and they're not shut up. That's all they've got. It's the only ball game they have.
[34:53.640 --> 34:59.960]  It's what their whole world orbits. CNN is the leader in fake news. They have to pay to be on
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.560]  at hotels and to pay to be on at airports. And so all they can do is get into a press briefing,
[35:05.560 --> 35:14.840]  press briefing, cause a big scene, make a huge issue out of it. And then when Acosta gets thrown
[35:14.840 --> 35:21.880]  out after two years of this crap, what does CNN say? Document cam shot please. CNN gearing up the
[35:21.880 --> 35:27.320]  sue over Gemma Costa's suspension, White House press pass. We got White House press passes a
[35:27.320 --> 35:32.520]  year and a half ago, had them for a month, didn't even think they were worth it to sit there all
[35:32.520 --> 35:38.280]  day unless you're going to make a fool of yourself. And CNN called them to be revoked and someone in
[35:38.280 --> 35:44.120]  the White House did. So CNN called for info wars to be revoked and for us to be banned off the
[35:44.120 --> 35:50.520]  internet. But now they're going to sue the fascism of Trump. Every man handles this young woman
[35:50.520 --> 35:57.400]  because Gemma Costa, as he said, never touched her. In fact, we have a video I played Friday a
[35:57.400 --> 36:03.320]  bunch that Reese also put together of Acosta saying over and over again, I never touched her.
[36:04.040 --> 36:09.160]  I never touched her. I never touched her. And then it's him touching her. It's him
[36:09.720 --> 36:14.040]  forcefully pushing her arm down, pulling away and she looks to the secret service to help her.
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.160]  That happened. Everyone saw it. We didn't edit the video. We blew it up. We zoomed in. That's not
[36:19.160 --> 36:27.160]  doctoring to make it deceptive. Zooming in, magnifying glass is to make it clear. And I go,
[36:28.040 --> 36:31.960]  look, our audience knows this. I know our audience knows this. I know you know this.
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.160]  I know you know this. But what is CNN doing this for? And what did all the rest of the so-called
[36:39.160 --> 36:45.080]  media get in line, including the Dallas Morning News and the New York Times and not show the video?
[36:45.080 --> 36:52.760]  Think about that. They don't show it and say, Jones put out doctored video info wars.com. They
[36:52.760 --> 36:57.800]  called us Nazis. They've called us terrorists. They've called us all these names. None of its
[36:57.800 --> 37:03.960]  true folks. They're trying to destroy us because we're exposing them. Now here's that piece I talked
[37:03.960 --> 37:09.240]  about with him saying that afternoon he never touched her. So we put the video out. Here it is.
[37:09.240 --> 37:15.800]  Going back and forth there and as you can see in this video, this intern came up to me. They're
[37:15.800 --> 37:20.520]  describing her as an intern. I don't really know who she is and attempted to take the microphone away
[37:20.520 --> 37:24.840]  from me. All I can say at that point is that I was trying to hang on to the microphone so I could
[37:24.840 --> 37:31.000]  continue to ask the president questions. Obviously, you know, I didn't put my hands on her or touch
[37:31.000 --> 37:36.840]  her as they're alleging. If I may ask one other question, are you worried? That's enough. That's
[37:36.840 --> 37:41.560]  enough. I didn't ask one of the other folks. That's enough. Pardon me ma'am. So how does the
[37:41.560 --> 37:45.720]  liar work? Obviously, you know, I didn't. They changed the subject. Put my hands on her or touch
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.160]  her as they're alleging. Let's go to Paul Watts' response because it's Paul that blew the video
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.200]  up and put it out and then the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, put it out. But again,
[37:56.200 --> 37:59.800]  you're like, this is petty. This is dumb. I agree. It's the top story in the country for days.
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.520]  It's all over everywhere and it's Jones puts out a fake video changing the subject from a
[38:06.520 --> 38:10.920]  Costa lying and saying he didn't touch her and lying and saying we put out a fake video. Here's Paul
[38:10.920 --> 38:17.000]  Watts' report. CNN's Jim Acosta put his hands on a woman. The White House staffer was trying to do
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.440]  her job and retrieve the microphone after Acosta had gone on yet another anti-Trump rent. Acosta
[38:22.440 --> 38:27.560]  then used his left arm to push down on the woman and physically restrain her. This resulted in him
[38:27.560 --> 38:34.040]  getting his press access revoked. And who's to blame for all this? Me. Of course it's me. Question
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.520]  for press sec. Where do you obtain the distorted Acosta video you posted? InfoWars personality
[38:38.520 --> 38:43.000]  prison planet posted the same video two hours before you did. Surely you don't trust InfoWars.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.280]  The White House is circulating a doctored InfoWars video. White House uses doctored video to justify
[38:48.280 --> 38:52.760]  stripping CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press credentials. Sarah Huckabee Sanders used doctored
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.240]  InfoWars footage to justify Acosta ban. White House shares doctored video to support punishment
[38:57.240 --> 39:01.640]  of journalist Jim Acosta. White House press secretary shares fake InfoWars video to justify
[39:01.640 --> 39:08.760]  banning CNN reporter. And this is all complete. Oh s***. Look at the comparison between the original
[39:08.760 --> 39:16.120]  video and the one I posted. It isn't doctored. It isn't sped up. It isn't slowed down. All I did
[39:16.120 --> 39:23.240]  was zoom in. Look at it again. Is this an example of someone doctoring a clip to change its meaning?
[39:23.240 --> 39:30.360]  No. It's virtually identical. Is it 100% identical? No. Video compression is going to result in it
[39:30.360 --> 39:35.880]  looking marginally different. But does it show Acosta putting his hands on a woman to restrain her
[39:35.880 --> 39:41.960]  as she tries to grab the microphone? Yes. Inventing a giant conspiracy theory isn't going to change
[39:41.960 --> 39:47.560]  that fact. As you can see from the original editing track in Sony Vegas Pro, none of the individual
[39:47.560 --> 39:53.640]  tracks are sped up. A track that is sped up would show wavy lines in the original track field,
[39:53.640 --> 39:59.400]  which it doesn't. Now I know how James O'Keefe feels every time he exposes the left. They accuse
[39:59.400 --> 40:05.640]  him of doctoring footage. No. Doctoring means deliberate manipulation to change the meaning
[40:05.640 --> 40:11.240]  of the video. Zooming in isn't doctoring. Oh, but some frames might be missing. Wait.
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.480]  This is the same media that demonized Corey Lewandowski for assault
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.720]  based on a video which had just six frames. So I downloaded a GIF, exported it to an M2T
[40:21.720 --> 40:26.760]  file, converted it to an MP4, then re-uploaded it to Twitter. Is the compression going to look
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.080]  exactly the same? No. It's going to look marginally different. Does that mean the video was doctored?
[40:33.080 --> 40:38.440]  No. That's not doctoring. As this video analyst commented, any changes if they did make them
[40:38.440 --> 40:43.240]  would be incredibly minor and possibly due to working across frame rates and compressions.
[40:43.240 --> 40:48.200]  As Tim Poole tweeted, all of the outlets claiming the video was doctored or sped up didn't even
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.480]  bother fact checking. Two different analyses showed it was likely just compression issues as to why
[40:53.480 --> 40:59.400]  it didn't sink. This is why people don't trust the media. They all ran the story due to gossip,
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.000]  not facts. I mean, when even Buzzfeed writers semi-come to my defense, you know the media's
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.040]  reaching. Buzzfeed, there's no evidence that the video was deliberately sped up. Thank you.
[41:10.040 --> 41:14.440]  Now will the hundreds of other media organizations that falsely claimed that
[41:14.440 --> 41:19.560]  issue retractions? Don't hold your breath. The original tweet circulating this fake news that
[41:19.560 --> 41:25.320]  I doctored the video combined have hundreds of thousands of retweets. The clarifications,
[41:25.320 --> 41:30.200]  the ones that debunked the whole thing, the number of retweets they got pales in comparison.
[41:30.200 --> 41:35.160]  The final irony is that while I'm constantly being accused of being a conspiracy theorist,
[41:35.160 --> 41:41.400]  despite loathing most conspiracy theories, the media invented a giant conspiracy theory to distract
[41:41.400 --> 41:47.080]  from a real controversy. They incited a Twitter witch hunt, which resulted in me receiving a
[41:47.080 --> 41:53.560]  bombardment of hate and violent threats. That's how the media rolls these days, and they wonder
[41:53.560 --> 41:58.840]  why people don't like them. Sarah Sanders was right. Jim Acosta put his hands on a woman. He
[41:58.840 --> 42:04.200]  used his strength to overpower her, and that's clearly seen in the video. Does that mean he
[42:04.200 --> 42:10.200]  assaulted her? No, it doesn't. But he clearly used his hand, his wrist, and his arm to push her away.
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.640]  Inventing baseless conspiracy theories about me doctoring the footage is just a convenient way
[42:15.640 --> 42:22.360]  to distract from Acosta's behavior. Don't take my word for it. Go and watch the footage yourself
[42:22.360 --> 42:33.640]  and come to your own.
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.360]  Okay, now that was Paul Watson's video from a few days ago responding. The video we're going to
[42:42.360 --> 42:51.400]  play when we come back over and over again till the show ends is on info wars.com video,
[42:51.400 --> 42:56.840]  one of the biggest media hoaxes ever. This is bigger than this video. It's asking why are they
[42:56.840 --> 43:03.160]  doing this? The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.840]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally
[43:08.840 --> 43:14.440]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[43:14.440 --> 43:20.600]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[43:20.600 --> 43:25.080]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.840]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible. Now,
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.640]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[43:35.640 --> 43:41.080]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research
[43:41.080 --> 43:47.560]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[43:47.560 --> 43:53.320]  it and makes it even more bio available. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[43:53.320 --> 44:21.320]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at M4sLive.com. Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship. And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with M4s. Yes, some of them are like little side accounts, they know we had like M4 stores that just showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back to you.
[44:24.320 --> 44:41.320]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that.
[44:41.320 --> 44:58.320]  I've prayed for that. And I've been told that's going to happen. But you've got to back us and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will. But I give you my commitment if you financially support us at FullWarsTour.com to give you my absolute total commitment.

[46:11.320 --> 46:21.320]  And the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you sort of fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground. And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[46:21.320 --> 46:31.320]  So we've already had incredible success. But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
[46:31.320 --> 46:42.320]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at Infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[46:42.320 --> 46:52.320]  We have huge sales at InfowarsTour.com right now. And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[46:52.320 --> 47:02.320]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the globe will swing when. This is Infowars Darker Tower. We do your support. I'm counting on you.
[47:22.320 --> 47:41.320]  So there's an article with a new video that came out today. We heard Paul's video from like Thursday, which is fine. It was important to pre-curse it with that.
[47:41.320 --> 47:54.320]  We're singing in and all these people are saying he made it up. Jim Acosta never touched her. The White House intern. Then we show the footage. He clearly did exactly what we said. We altered nothing.
[47:54.320 --> 48:04.320]  And you know, people are in the comment sections. I want to show this, maybe we get a shot with the camera in here for TV viewers.
[48:04.320 --> 48:15.320]  I noticed the commenters are in here saying, wow, you're covering this while California burns.
[48:15.320 --> 48:23.320]  People are like, wow, yes, this hoax is almost as big as trying to see video on the Infowars app while the show is live. Never happens. I love that part.
[48:23.320 --> 48:34.320]  I have to watch Alex on my Windows computer. I want to see the video. Well, you got a crappy-ass phone, bro. Simply, and it just goes on, but I was reading one of these like during the break, and I guess it refreshers a bunch of their comments there.
[48:34.320 --> 48:46.320]  And they were just saying like, wow, why are you covering them saying that Jim Acosta didn't manhandle the woman when California's burning?
[48:46.320 --> 48:59.320]  Because here's the deal. They're all over every channel in the country saying that we made up a video and Jim Acosta thinks you're so stupid.
[48:59.320 --> 49:08.320]  He goes on TV and says he didn't touch her. And if they can get away with that, what does it say about corporate media?
[49:08.320 --> 49:18.320]  What does it say about the mindset of these people? What does it say about anything and everything they'll do? What does it say?
[49:18.320 --> 49:31.320]  It tells you a lot that they are a pack of criminal liars that these on HD footage all over the country pushing the woman's arm down, grabbing the microwave from her to ask his third question.
[49:31.320 --> 49:39.320]  He loses his credentials and they say it's fake. He didn't touch her. Does it matter? It was seen by hundreds of millions of people.
[49:39.320 --> 49:50.320]  Does it matter? They just say it, and then the entire, the Austin American statesman, the Dallas Morning News, the San Antonio Express News, where I live, every paper covered.
[49:50.320 --> 50:02.320]  Jones caught faking video. It's not about me. But it'd be like if I went out and said, Jones was not wearing a blue jacket. He was wearing a red jacket. And everyone looks and it's a navy blue jacket.
[50:02.320 --> 50:14.320]  You'd go, man, that guy's a liar, dude. He's wearing a blue jacket. He says it's red. It's blue. And that's the point I've gotten is, what are they doing? Who are these people?
[50:14.320 --> 50:22.320]  I know California's on fire. I meant to start the whole show with that today.
[50:22.320 --> 50:34.320]  But it's two plus two equals four. The ability to be free, as Winston Smith, the character in 1984 says, is to say two plus two equals four.
[50:34.320 --> 50:45.320]  We've now reached the point where we didn't doctor any video. We didn't do anything. It was on dozens of camera angles, across to manhandling her, shoving her arm down, grabbing the microwave.
[50:45.320 --> 50:58.320]  And then they go on the news and they say, he didn't touch her. Jones is a fake. And she and Sanders needs to be fired. The Dallas Morning News says, Jones is a liar.
[50:58.320 --> 51:11.320]  Info wars is fake news. Acosta didn't touch her. And they don't even show the video to prove it. But it gets worse. CNN goes, here's the footage. Nothing happened.
[51:11.320 --> 51:20.320]  And Costa says, see, didn't touch her. And it's the girl kneeling before she goes after the mic. And I'm like, dude, they're on TV lying now.
[51:20.320 --> 51:31.320]  It's like if I said your TV viewer, this handkerchief is black. This handkerchief is white. And everybody's like, yeah, we get it's white. They say it's black.
[51:31.320 --> 51:46.320]  But man, what's going on then? Because we've got mainstream media from ABC to CBS to all the comedy shows saying that he didn't touch her and we made it up, even though it's the same video.
[51:46.320 --> 51:56.320]  So what do we do about a group of criminals like this? What do we do about people that will lie like this? Well, what do we do?
[51:56.320 --> 52:05.320]  I want to play Paul's new video from today. We have it, right? We have it. This is an incredible drum roll. I'm sorry. I told them to get Paul's video on this.
[52:05.320 --> 52:20.320]  They got the one video that's my fault. I am the dread of this broadcast. But we now have it, then I'm done. Next hour, the election fraud in Broward County, the latest on Russian news, Google moving in to the former Stasi headquarters.
[52:20.320 --> 52:30.320]  I'm not kidding. That's the secret police that oppressed the East Germans. That's where Google's now moving for the very same behavior.
[52:30.320 --> 52:39.320]  So it's the same globalist. It's all coming up. Roger Stone's going to be on everything. But I want to play Paul's report because it's bigger than Jim Acosta.
[52:39.320 --> 52:49.320]  It's the fact that they'll lie when all the footage is the same and go, look, their footage is different when our footage is the same and some weird mind control.
[52:49.320 --> 53:02.320]  Because in 1984, he tortures Winston and says two plus two equals whatever I say until Winston sees whatever he wants. And this is like some new level that the whole corporate media behind this saying we're fake and we're liars.
[53:02.320 --> 53:09.320]  And Trump said he hates all Mexicans. There's no video of it. It's just they're horrible people. Here it is.
[53:09.320 --> 53:22.320]  The White House press office also put out a doctored version of the video. Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor.
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.320]  You are fake news.
[53:23.320 --> 53:28.320]  They taped video of Acosta. What are you talking about?
[53:28.320 --> 53:36.320]  All that was, nobody manipulated it. Give me a break. See, that's just dishonest reporting. All that is is a close up.
[53:36.320 --> 53:44.320]  See, that's just, that is just dishonest reporting. I watched that. I heard that last night. They made it close up. They showed it close up.
[53:44.320 --> 53:51.320]  When you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy because it wasn't doctored. They gave a close up view. That's not doctoring.
[53:51.320 --> 54:07.320]  It feels pretty good when the president of the United States has your back. Doctoring, the act of making different in order to deceive, tamper with, falsify or adulterate. Converting and processing a video isn't tampering or falsifying. That's not doctoring.
[54:07.320 --> 54:09.320]  That's not doctoring. This is doctoring.
[54:09.320 --> 54:13.320]  They sped up Jim Acosta's hand movement to make it look more violent.
[54:13.320 --> 54:22.320]  Yeah, here's the screenshot from the edit in Sony Vegas proving it was not sped up. If it was sped up, there'd be wavy lines in the track.
[54:22.320 --> 54:24.320]  They're on because it wasn't sped up.
[54:24.320 --> 54:28.320]  And you see like they sped up his hand.
[54:28.320 --> 54:38.320]  Yeah, I sped up his hand so much that literally two minutes before you said that, you played a clip where his hand moved even quicker, but I sped it up.
[54:38.320 --> 54:46.320]  Okay, New York Times, the video was sped up. Buzzfeed, there's no evidence that the video was deliberately sped up.
[54:46.320 --> 54:47.320]  Give me a break.
[54:47.320 --> 54:59.320]  Is the comparison of the doctored video with the original. It looks virtually identical. Does anything here look like it was done to tamper, falsify or adulterate? No, because it wasn't doctored.
[54:59.320 --> 55:00.320]  That's not doctoring.
[55:00.320 --> 55:13.320]  Elizabeth Loftus says the videos are, quote, totally different. Really? Watch the comparison again. Do these two videos look totally different to you? Or is Elizabeth Loftus a liar?
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.320]  The part where he says, pardon me, ma'am, they cut the audio out.
[55:16.320 --> 55:28.320]  Yeah, there's no audio in the entire clip, Jimmy, because the original was a GIF image. And GIF images don't have audio because it's not a video file. It's an image file.
[55:28.320 --> 55:29.320]  That's not doctoring.
[55:29.320 --> 55:32.320]  Jim Acosta clearly never touched that White House intern. That's just a lie.
[55:32.320 --> 55:38.320]  Yes, he did touch her. It's right there on tape. The tape that you literally just played.
[55:38.320 --> 55:42.320]  You know, I didn't put my hands on her or touch her as they're alleging.
[55:42.320 --> 55:47.320]  Definition of touch. Come into or be in contact with. Did Jim Acosta touch her?
[55:47.320 --> 55:56.320]  I didn't put my hands on her or touch her. I didn't put my hands on her or touch her. I didn't put my hands on her or touch her.
[55:56.320 --> 56:05.320]  All right, folks, if you're a radio listener, anybody can go pull up Acosta and the Trump confrontation that got him suspended from the White House Press Corps.
[56:05.320 --> 56:14.320]  And I agree, it's stupid to have to be doing this. But in Paul's report, we're going to play the rest of it when we come back.
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.320]  He says it over and over again, and we show different HD videos of him doing it.
[56:18.320 --> 56:26.320]  Anyone can go pull it up at ABC, CBS, NBC, and it shows him shoving her arm down and grabbing the mic.
[56:26.320 --> 56:30.320]  The same video we show, we just zoom in a little bit, which is totally normal.
[56:30.320 --> 56:35.320]  And now you're like, okay, we know Alex, shut up. No.
[56:35.320 --> 56:42.320]  They're in every newspaper and every TV show saying it's totally fake. You didn't touch her. These people are dangerous.
[56:42.320 --> 56:52.320]  I mean, what the hell planet have we gotten on when it's clear he did all this, we didn't edit it, and they're on every damn channel, every comedy show saying it isn't.
[56:52.320 --> 57:00.320]  That's dangerous. How do they get all these people to lie like this? I mean, let me tell you something.
[57:00.320 --> 57:08.320]  When I say thousands of publications, I spot checked it, folks. There's tens of thousands with my name or Paul Watson's name and Jim Acosta and Dr. Video.
[57:08.320 --> 57:14.320]  And I went and looked at it. It's like every Texas paper, but they never show the video. They just go, Jones did a totally fake video.
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.320]  He shows the guy hitting her with a karate chop never happened, and they don't show the video.
[57:19.320 --> 57:27.320]  I mean, that means like these newspapers are the enemy of the American people. These TVs, I mean, they literally are criminal strokes.
[57:27.320 --> 57:36.320]  They have all of them on board now. This is like some magic line we passed because we just showed something on national TV and they say we made it up.

[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:13.320]  You know the answer is the devil always inverts. He can't create a show. A cost of man handles a woman. We put a club out.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:20.320]  It's all over the news. They just change the subject and we debate that instead of just going, oh, seeing in their known liars. Here's the rest of Paul's report.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  But people watching Wednesday night's edition of Anderson Cooper wouldn't know whether Acosta touched her or not because they didn't play the part where Acosta touched her. So I'm the one being accused of editing a video to mislead and CNN takes the very same video and edits out the part where he touches her.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:47.320]  The only thing being doctored here is your narrative. Tim Acosta clearly never touched that White House intern. That's just a lie. That's just a lie. That's just a lie.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:52.320]  To discredit a reputable journalist, she's the White House press secretary. She should be fired for that.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.320]  You literally just lied to millions of people about the content of a videotape. That's just a lie.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:10.320]  Now you're saying Sarah Sanders should be fired for lying about the content of a videotape, which she didn't. You should be fired. Remember, these are the same mouthpieces that spent weeks claiming Brett Kavanaugh assaulted a woman.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:18.320]  Yet when there's clear evidence of Jim Acosta, at least accosting a woman, they all suddenly develop temporary blindness.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.320]  Jim Acosta clearly never touched that White House intern.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:34.320]  That is terrible. Or it would be if it weren't fake news. The fact that the White House press secretary is promoting this doctored video is reprehensible.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:41.320]  It's so doctored, Steven. You literally played the same clip two minutes before saying this. Again, it's not doctored.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.320]  It lost a couple of frames after conversion and compression. That's not doctoring.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320]  That's not doctoring.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  It's zoomed in and slowed down. Every single one of your lame stream fucking media firms at some point or another has aired a story where they've done this.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:06.320]  That is not doctoring. It's not misrepresenting the fundamental content of the video. It's simply focusing on the important element of that video and slowing it down so people can get a better idea of what happened.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320]  That's not film doctoring.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.320]  Oh, and what's this? First Vice reports that it's a doctored video.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.320]  Then they talk to two separate forensic experts who say it's not doctored forensic expert.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:32.320]  There is no evidence the White House video of Jim Acosta was doctored. Hanny Fareed, who studies digital forensics, human perception and image analysis at the University of California, Berkeley, told Motherboard, which is Vice, that he does not think the video was doctored.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:43.320]  Though he agreed that the entire video was of course slowed down and zoomed in to focus on the moment of physical contact, he does not see any evidence to suggest that it was selectively edited to exaggerate Acosta's motion.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  Because again, it's not doctored.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:59.320]  I can't speak to the origin of the video except to say, I know where it started. It started writing that room over there when everyone saw it. It doesn't matter who puts it up, who posts it, it doesn't matter the speed at which the video is seen, it doesn't matter the angle.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:07.320]  The question is at the core of this, and this is why Jim Acosta lost his credential. Did he touch her or not? The video is clear he did.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  Donald Trump Jr. So are we just supposed to act like the media didn't completely make up and spread an insane conspiracy theory about the White House doctoring a tape?
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:26.320]  How's that disappear from the news so fast? We've truly entered some kind of delusional dystopia when to distract from Acosta's behavior.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:41.320]  The media launches a giant hoax claiming one, that Acosta never touched her when he clearly did, and two, that a video which loses a couple of frames or has frames added because of compression, they can't even make their minds at which it is, means that it was a doctored video.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:04:00.320]  That's not doctoring. It wasn't a doctored video. They call me a conspiracy theorist while themselves promulgating a monumental conspiracy theory. CNN, Washington Post, TechCrunch, Vox, New York Times, NBC and hundreds of other publications all breathlessly asserted with zero fact checking whatsoever.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:13.320]  And none of them even reached out to me for comment that I, the White House or someone else had doctored a video that wasn't doctored just so they could portray Trump as deceitful and rash for suspending Acosta's press access.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:22.320]  The only deceitful and rash parties in this entire situation were you. You literally claimed Acosta never touched her when it's right there on tape.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:34.320]  Tim Acosta clearly never touched that White House intern. That's just a lie. That's just a lie. That's just a lie. That's just a lie. That's just a lie. I didn't put my hands on her or touch her. I didn't put my hands on her or touch her.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:44.320]  I didn't put my hands on her or touch her. Why do you think your trust is plummeting? Why do you think people don't like you when this is what you're willing to stoop to time and time again?
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  The tape wasn't doctored. The tape wasn't misleading. I didn't manipulate it. The only manipulation here was you lot lying to and manipulating your own audience of people.

[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:35.320]  You know, it came out like six months ago that one of the best-selling authors in the world wanted to do this autobiography on me and I had the name for the book.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:48.320]  The Secret History of the World and the War for the Future. I mean, obviously I could have been writing books through ghost writers every six months having best-selling books out there.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:56.320]  But because of digital video and the way I can reach people with it, I'm not focused on books because those are mainly a monetary thing.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:07.320]  But when you get censored, they become important again. So I was talking to a national writer today who was interviewing me for, I've decided to go ahead and just put out like three books for the next year.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:20.320]  So we're there writing this book today and we're talking about issues. We're like, how do you feel vindicated? Because there's so much of what you've talked about, the NSA spying and the world government and the big global awakening to it and the populist movement.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:33.320]  And the writer done their research. They were like pulling up quotes from like 15 years ago. I envisioned 1776 worldwide, the oppression of the globalists will then boomerang them back on them and there'll be huge populist movements that'll sweep from Latin America to Europe to Asia.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:46.320]  You're like, how did you know this? It's incredible. And I'm like, well now it's almost even worse because I know what's coming next after that.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:08:00.320]  And I've got an electronic straightjacket around me and all I'm trying to do is warn people. I'm going to be honest. And this whole thing with Jim Acosta, he's such a damn demon, man.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:15.320]  If you try to chronicle all the lies of this guy, the fact that the White House even keeps him up there, it hurts me spiritually that every major paper in the country that I've double checked and every major TV channel ran that we put out a lot.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:24.320]  We ran that we put out a hoax video and that Jim Acosta didn't touch that woman when it was on national television and our video is the same video and anybody can look at it.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:34.320]  They'll show on national TV the same video side by side and go, look, it's doctored. It's like, go and look. Just watch it and stainless steel.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:47.320]  And I'm like, well, yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. So Roger Stone is a smart guy, former chief advisor, the president, former head of the campaign, a lot more. And I want to get into really important issues that the elections they're stealing right now.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:53.320]  People say, hey, California's on fire. Malibu's on fire. It's hell on earth. Yeah, I know.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:09:09.320]  And then the president said what I said 10 years ago, what the experts said, cut down all the underbrush, but leftist have this weird rewilding thing for 30 years under UNESCO where they don't allow anybody to take trees and even fall down and cut them into wood because that's bad for the earth.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:24.320]  So they don't cut fire breaks. And the president comes out and says, well, you should have cut fire breaks and they have a few leftist firefighters go, we don't appreciate that. The media firefighters hate Trump. The real firefighting associations have been begging to cut those damn
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:42.320]  fire breaks. But yeah, Jim Acosta, Van Halen, the woman, and then the media lying about it is not as important as Malibu and much of Southern California going up in a satanic, Guder Dama wrong arm again.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.320]  But they made it the top story.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:57.320]  And then I asked myself, what world have we reached Roger Stone? And we'll do the election the next two segments. What world have we reached Roger Stone where because this is actually gotten to me.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:06.320]  Because I've seen a lot of lies in my years. But when something's on national TV and he manhandles her, and it's on all these channels and they just go, Oh, look, info works tweeted it.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  So that makes all the video fake to make them them question what they all saw on thousands of channels and to have been chosen as the thing now that they say is fake.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.320]  To butcher the truth.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.320]  It's a next level sigh up.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.320]  Again, I keep obsessing on this because it is important Roger.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.320]  This is two plus two equals four. We're going to get into the election, get into the fires. And I agree the fires are more important.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:41.320]  But what if I went on air and said the fires aren't real and then 10,000 newspapers and Stephen Colbert said they weren't you'd feel a little crazy.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  You know, Jim Acosta pushed that woman's hand down and grabbed the microwave. I'm not saying even fire him or resting.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  But the point is he did it.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.320]  Just like.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:57.320]  You're wearing a black t shirt, man. I mean, it's at a certain point. What are they trying here, Roger?
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  Look, I think it's very clear that the the staged and I think very juvenile and childish conduct of Acosta in an attempt to draw attention to himself was supposed to be the story of the day.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:33.320]  I was supposed to dominate the news media and unfortunately the or I should say very fortunately and wisely. The president decided to change the leadership of his Justice Department and relieve Attorney General Sessions stealing. I think new hope for Trump supporters, the world over and the reassertion of the president over a control of his own Justice Department.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:45.320]  And that took them by surprise. This video has not been altered. Let's put the word doctored away. It has not been altered or changed in any way other than to say it was slowed down.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:57.320]  So you could actually follow what was happening and it was brought closer in a zoom. That is not under any sense of the word doctoring with the implication that what what really happened.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  A very true video that had been altered and that is false. And listen, I want to come back into the election and then the election stealing, which is really going on. But but right now, why would they try something this bold when clearly it's all over international news?
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.320]  He manhandles her. He says he didn't touch her.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:34.320]  And with all due respect, Alex, there are there are stills missing from the Zaprooter film. They they have to try, I think to pervericate right now because the fact that the House Democrats are soft peddling impeachment.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:44.320]  They need an anti Trump line other than vows of reopening the failed and discredited Russian collusion investigation.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:13:03.320]  This is a side show. It's meant to distract from the larger question of the massive fraud that's going on in these elections in 40 years in American politics, seeing some of the most brazen vote stealing tactics in Texas and Louisiana and
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:22.320]  certain precincts of New Jersey where it is certainly in Miami Dade County where it has been a way of life. I have never seen anything as brazen as outrageous as one sided as the process as it's going on in Broward County.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:30.320]  Roger, you know, I love you. This is real radio. We don't censor stuff. I've only had about four martinis. How many martinis have you had?
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:36.320]  I have had one martini. And it was not Russian vodka.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.320]  I'm joking. I've had no martinis. Hey, seriously, seriously, let's get serious.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:46.320]  I've had one. I'm happy to have jumped on.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  You're a man that can't handle your liquor there, my son.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:14:05.320]  I'm joking. No, I know you can't. I don't drink actually. I'm a big AA supporter. Now, Roger, let's get serious. Let's shift gears out of this because I did get caught in this any pool of like the biggest story in the country for the last three days is the
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:16.320]  I edited video Paul Watson did when it's not true. I agree with you. It's distracting from the new acting attorney general. So let's give you the floor when we come back.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:34.320]  How awesome is Mr. Wettaker? And then we'll shift gears then into admitted documentation. Even the Miami Herald says that they're stealing the election. They have fake ballots. They're running it all through with Roger Stone straight ahead.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:43.320]  Now, don't forget his website, stonecultures.com, but forget I haven't plugged in a hour and 14 minutes on air.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  Please remember that we're under total globalist attack, which shows up a week, the global star. They can't even take us out.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:08.320]  It's not that I'm that powerful as the bigger that week. So we have the 67% blowout sale on things like high quality, global, silver and informer store.com. That is at cost at that price.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:24.320]  57% off, not 67. That's 67% on silver. 57% off on super male and super female vitality. Cold press herbs documented for libido, stamina, energy. It's an amazing product.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:31.320]  But it's so hard to get and it costs so much to make that this is the last round of it. Ladies and gentlemen, I just can't monkey around with it anymore.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:39.320]  But it's amazing. If you want it, it's the last run of super male vitality and super female vitality in four words live.com.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:48.320]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And Roger's got a big old pot of black coffee right now. He's getting in a coffee bath right now.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:56.320]  That's what he's doing right now. He's just sliding into a big old black tub of black coffee. The nurse is coming over with a big old enema bag.

[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:24.320]  Researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:35.320]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:49.320]  The pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.320]  You still won't hear my mind
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:43.320]  Roger Stone is our guest, who I literally called about an hour ago. He's having a barbecue with his family, his grandkids, and I drug him in.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.320]  And he's here with us right now.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.320]  And so let's get serious now.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:58.320]  We got distracted by Jim Acosta, who never touched that young lady. That video's all fake. It's true.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:05.320]  He didn't get kicked out of the White House. He didn't grab her. Of course he did, but let's just move on from that.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:20.320]  What is going on with the new interim Attorney General that has the Stephen Colbert of the world, literally dumping every pound of excrement they've got immediately on the ground?
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:26.320]  Why are they so scared? What's coming next from your intel, Roger Stone?
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:44.320]  Well, I think they have taken a hard look at acting Attorney General Whitaker, and they see a dedicated, true-believing conservative, who also happens to be a very fine lawyer, who was Chief of Staff under Attorney General Ashcroft,
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:22:03.320]  knows how the Justice Department works, served as a prosecuting U.S. Attorney himself, has a record of educational, conservative, nonprofit activity, writing, thinking he's entitled to an opinion.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.320]  He's been critical of the Clintons. He said Hillary...
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.320]  Let's just say he's a died-in-the-wold, Americana guy that's scared of.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:24.320]  Right. Now, he comes out of Iowa. He ran for public office there. He is very close to Donald Trump's issue advisors, a solid guy named Sam Clovis.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:31.320]  Clovis is like you and I, Alex, understands the globalist threat, and he understands what Trump is and what it isn't.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:45.320]  And he is very close to Clovis. He is also very close to a former governor, Kerry Brinstad, who I guarantee you is a blunt talking guy and the perfect person for the president to send to China.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:54.320]  Terry doesn't take any crap. He was an excellent governor of Iowa. He made a phenomenal comeback after being out of office his years ago.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:03.320]  So Trump is now bringing in the patriots and that's scaring the system. Well, I'm going to announce this tomorrow, but I've got some big intel.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:13.320]  I'm told that Whitaker is getting ready to implement the president's plan to go after Big Tech. They're going to be listening tonight, but I'm told the hammer is about to drop.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:42.320]  Well, from your mouth to God's ears, I remind people to go to our important effort, writetrump.com, writetrump.com, for those of you on radio, writetrump.com, where we are going to send letters from you to the president directing him to stop the antitrust and anti-competitive manipulation of the internet that just cost us the last election.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:50.320]  And let's be clear. Let's be clear. You can copy it and send it yourself, which we encourage you to. I have my guarantee. I'm going to pay for the posters like 20 cents or something.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:59.320]  I'm going to mail hard copy letters a million to the White House. I think we're going to go over a million. It's already 100,000 or so signed up in just one or two days.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:12.320]  And then we're going to hit Trump Tower with 100,000 or so and maybe maybe more logo with 100,000. But the point is, and then we'll keep you updated on new developments. But this is what Trump really pays attention to.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:22.320]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, you want to go to writetrump.com, sign your name on the letter to the president that will mail to you. There could be a little personal thing you sent him as well.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:39.320]  The President Trump, President Trump must understand the importance of putting a stop to the mass ownership of conservatives by big tech and institute antitrust actions to end this racketeering collusion by big tech desperate to block America from coming back from the dead.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:44.320]  So that is what this is all about. And we're doing it right now at writetrump.com.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:25:01.320]  Alex, you know, my goal and yours would be to deliver a million letters. Look, the future of the country, the future of Trumpism, the Trump the continuity, first of all, the continuation of Trump himself in office, because they're the Democrats are soft peddling impeachment.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  But don't you believe it? That is precisely their plan. They are allied with special counselor Mueller in that.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:20.320]  The future of the Trump reform agenda hangs in the balance. The future of the Trump legacy hangs in the balance. Trump's reelection hangs in the balance.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:38.320]  The future of the of American exceptionalism and in American sovereignty hangs in the balance. We need a free, fair, robust, vibrant, completely accessible internet to compete in the war of ideas.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:46.320]  Let's get into the recount going on. I mean, I can't even describe these articles I have mainstream news. Miami Herald says they have fake ballots.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:55.320]  They're running and weird 18 wheeler show up and Congress from Matt Gates says, Hey, you're a day late and police like threatened to arrest him. This is this is crazy.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:10.320]  Well, I think we'll start from the beginning. Three months ago, Alex, I urged Governor Rick Scott to to dismiss to fire Brenda Snipes, the head of the board of elections.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:25.320]  In the 2000 Democratic primary between progressive Tim Kanova and Deborah Wasserman Schultz. Kanova was cheated blind by the board. His name did not appear on certain ballots.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:38.320]  Certain ballots were destroyed and hidden. He never got an honest count. He went to court. The court ruled that she had violated state and federal law and demanded a recount only to learn that while the case was on trial,
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:51.320]  she destroyed all the ballots in the recent congressional primary. She refuses to give totals for early voting, absentee voting, election day voting, only giving grand total.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:57.320]  And when she's asked for the rest of the information, she basically says kiss my.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:08.320]  So the governor should have relieved her and she isn't like playing poker with a woman with a long history of problems. And she's been holding back a total.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:21.320]  The fact that she met one on one with Democrat gubernatorial candidate, Andrew Gillum, and Gillum went out to reporters and withdrew his concession statement tells me that the cake is baked.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:36.320]  She refuses, despite a court order, to tell the people and the public what the final totals are for Broward County and whether it is not enough to shift the margin in the three crucial races.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:53.320]  Rick Scott, who was probably in the greatest danger, Ron DeSantis, who has a little larger lead. And of course, right now, the last time I looked, Democrat Nikki Fried, a medical marijuana advocate, was leading Matt Caldwell by 500 votes.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:28:04.320]  Caldwell appeared here on Info Wars, a great Second Amendment advocate in what everybody built as the contest between two future stars.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:08.320]  All right, Roger Stone Cold Truths.com. Thanks for coming in tonight.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:17.320]  During all this and and cover and get back to your family in the barbecue. We really appreciate you tomorrow. We'll have you back on to get more into this situation as it unfolds in Florida.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:23.320]  But I've got all the articles in Miami Herald says they're counting fake ballots. Weird trucks are showing up a day late.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:31.320]  Matt Gaetz shows up when they've got illegal trucks pulling up and says, what's going on the cops threatening arresting? I mean, this is like a monkey.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:39.320]  You know, what to a football? You're absolutely right, Alex. I've never seen anything quite this dirty.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:56.320]  Democrats, if they're beyond taking the gloves off, man, they have gone total crazy town. We'll be back straight ahead. We're live 528 central time broadcasting worldwide.

[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:38.320]  You know it's Veterans Day, November 11th, 2018, but you celebrate it on Sunday. So that's some of the esoteric knowledge on that.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:57.320]  And Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11am central to cover all of this with you with the weekday show. You know, it's almost like the things we've done at info wars that metaphysically I'm supposed to go away.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:11.320]  Like we already relaunched Americana, we already exposed the globalist, we already exposed the eugenics, we already got Trump in there, we already got nationalists being elected everywhere, and it's almost like at that point I'm just supposed to go away.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:28.320]  I mean, I won't leave the whole crew and everybody high and dry, but maybe that is what's supposed to happen. Maybe I'm just supposed to sail off in the sunset. But see, I would have at this point, but Soros and others are suing me and harassing me.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:36.320]  And so I can't go away. So I won't. Plus, I wouldn't have to begin with.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:47.320]  That's that. Here's the thing, you can't do 100 lifetimes work and get what we've done. And I'm not bragging about that. I mean, we've changed the world.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:35:02.320]  We've gone from no one knowing there's a private corporate world government to from Asia to Eastern Europe to Europe to the UK to the US to Brazil to all over.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:11.320]  People get that. And look, I'm not like mainstream media. I don't sit there and tell you something positive is going on. It's not positive.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:28.320]  And it's positive for the general public. For me, you know, it's still kind of positive, but they're bearing down. And then I look at the globalist, they're so pathetic.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:46.320]  Here's an example. Macron was a sex slave in pedophilia for the French elites. I mean, that's actually admitted that age 1314 was passed around by men and women that had sex with.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  Now, that itself is like such an insane story. You're just like, whoa.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:05.320]  And then he's constantly involved running down the president.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:14.320]  I don't have some gleeful Hollywood worship of the president because of the president. I like Trump because he's trying to be a real human being and trying to do some good things.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:29.320]  President Trump goes to France for this World War One Memorial and Macron gets up and gives this big speech against nationalism and its dangers.
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:38.320]  And then the controlled corporate media goes, look, Trump's to blame for World War One. If there weren't nations there wouldn't be wars.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:47.320]  And then, if you know the truth about it, it gets really frustrating at that point.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:37:01.320]  It would take years to break down World War One, World War Two. It would take years to break down the League of Nations and the UN and the Club of Rome and how the robber barons wanted to destroy the nation state.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:13.320]  So these big corporations with finance groups to kill each other and then try to give the nation states to give up their sovereignty and the vote and the investment that people had in the government.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:25.320]  Not those governments were perfect to this shadowy UN or League of Nations or IMF or World Bank or Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:37.320]  I mean, who runs the EU? Macron says two weeks ago, we need an EU army, which they've already set up. I covered it 20 years ago, a decade ago they admitted it.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.320]  They say it's an EU army in their own documents to suppress nation states.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:55.320]  If the UK or Germany or Switzerland who had never joined it or France ever wants to get out, they say they're going to have a military that doesn't let you leave.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  And then when Italy a year ago began to block the Zodiac boats coming out of North Africa into Italy, into Spain every day,
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:11.320]  the Italian military started grabbing them and taking them back to the UN bases in North Africa and saying, you're putting them in boats.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:19.320]  You're sending them here to bankrupt us and then you give them credit cards and political contacts so you're under their control.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.320]  This is a UN political invasion. No, no, no.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:40.320]  And their answer was, we're going to have an EU Navy stop your ships from stopping these people landing on your shore.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:47.320]  So staring into camera two or one or whatever it is right there, think about that.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:58.320]  No one even knows who the EU is. I do. It's in their founding records.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:04.320]  And it's almost sick to even tell people because the public doesn't want to know.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:11.320]  They don't want to know who's going to take your pension funds. You don't want to know who actually runs things. No, no, no. Netflix is on right now.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.320]  Let's not know any of that.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.320]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.320]  At the end of the day, the final equation, people really don't want to be free.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.320]  On average, they really don't want to know what's going on.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:34.320]  They think you're showing off if you know how stuff works. Here's the difference.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.320]  Metaphysically, God is a Republican.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:48.320]  You can get 95% of people wanting to be slaves, but if 5% want to be free, you don't have a right to make them slaves.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:40:08.320]  You know, in a democracy, if 51% want to make the other 49% slaves, if 51% wanted to barbecue the other 49% and put them on spits and eat their flesh in a pure democracy, that would be acceptable.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:29.320]  And so there's this rate toy, Macron, from age 14, being raped by globalists in Paris at these rape parties.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:40.320]  He admits he's proud of it, and women having sex with him, and men, and all this stuff, and he's this perfect MK ultra rape toy, like a dog toy.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.320]  And here he is wearing his little red, white, and blue French thing, and he's up there and he goes,
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:54.840]  up there, and he goes, blebleblebl blahblblblblblblblbl obstelixcon fazuc lightiate
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.080]  150
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:04.900]  and he sits there I am the pedophile right boy these Rothschildes shove me up
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:10.840]  their ass that's basically saying a French and he's sitting there he's
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:19.400]  telling you how dare you want country your country cause war you bad when the
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.120]  EU's unelected globalist and wants total war and is opening Europe up to
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:29.800]  Islamic invasion and it's the nation-state that stood against Hitler
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:33.680]  it's the nation-state that stood against the British Empire the nation-state is
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.280]  a people an ethos an idea they don't want that they want you to go nation-state
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:46.040]  bad say but plug of globalist get rid of it I run over you I Macron it's nice
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:52.040]  huh so that's how obnoxious this is like what is this EU what is this thing
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.520]  like nations are bad like our the French are bad the Germans are bad the
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:03.560]  Dutch are bad the Irish are bad the Prince are bad the Mexicans are bad the
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:10.520]  Japanese are bad well what's the thing we then the problem is the nation you

[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:30.240]  EU military run things you no need nation me Macron we run it for you and
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.000]  that's what this is you're not gonna make jokes all day long but that's what
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.520]  this is this is just ruthless corporations that have gotten control who
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:41.680]  said oh we don't want your nation-state all that's it's busy there now they're
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.560]  like nation-states are illegal I am Macron here come the Muslims here come
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:53.120]  the foreign banks bend over I am Macron bend over I bent over when I was 14
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:58.840]  you'll bend over food get nice you like the globalists know that if they
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:02.080]  suppress the good halogen and pump the environment for the bad halogens
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:07.800]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the

[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.400]  iodine the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.920]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.400]  getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.720]  iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.800]  trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.200]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.320]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:49.080]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available

[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:25.640]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country hold
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:31.040]  on you just said country get that off that's banned it's like mother and father
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.360]  and god yeah they're Merle Haggard a country is racist you're not gonna make
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.640]  jokes about this but CNN ABC News all that says my god Trump just said we're
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:48.600]  a nation but you think about you just give your country up the UN runs slave
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.560]  plants the UN makes their the people like cut the grass with scissors the UN
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.120]  runs giant child kidnapping rings on record and then we sit here and we hear
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:05.720]  like oh it's bad to have a nation McCron says and the Democrats and CNN did you
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:11.480]  heard Trump say America's a country God next will say pigs or pink and go I
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:19.200]  mean that's how crazy this has gotten is that they're assaulting reality we pay
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:24.000]  taxes it's our nation we have a system we're proud of it we project our power
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.320]  globally they go no no no you can't have a country we got to come in and take
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:34.760]  this over right now well who's taking it over the IMF the World Bank the UN the
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:41.240]  UN Human Rights Commission run by Saudi Arabia and China it's like having Hitler
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:47.840]  run your local synagogue it's ridiculous and that's the thing that gets to me is
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:54.440]  it's gotten so ridiculous is that I thought more Americans will be awake
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.280]  yeah you elect a Trump who's not out to get you but through election fraud and
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:04.280]  everything else we're barely hanging on to the Senate there's trying to steal
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:11.240]  all these other races and all Trump wants to do is try to secure the country
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:18.680]  but it shows how a free society allows a lot of weak stupid people to thrive who
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:23.720]  live off other hard-working people to see as a hard-working person as a smart
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.880]  person I look at a dumb person and think oh let me try to scam them I just think
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:33.040]  all that poor person got their IQ they have trouble wiping their butt but it's
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.120]  alright you just go and kind of but see they breed and have kids and they're
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.320]  Democrats and then they look at me both my eyes point the right direction they're
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:47.000]  like kill kill kill like a zombie the globalist go I told you kill him I
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.440]  told you kill him see that's how the thing works the globalist are always
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:59.480]  trying to get good people to join them to wipe the whatever you call it out and
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:04.480]  so we've now really reached this point where I'm just sitting there going man
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:12.480]  I I just don't know what to do I like oh it's it's very frustrating here's an
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:20.480]  example Germany collapses 1945 that's the end of World War two Jim Acosta may say
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:25.480]  that World War two didn't happen but well it he says that actually it didn't
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.920]  happen okay World War two didn't happen World War two didn't happen Jim Acosta
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:37.160]  CNN said it but in a hypothetical world that I live in World War two happened
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:43.920]  and that kind of set the new future of the world from that point on and Germany
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.880]  got divided into East and West Germany and Berlin got divided into that was a
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:53.880]  demarcation line of the DMZ and to the East was run by the Russians and to the
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:58.640]  West was supposedly run by the Allies now that's a fact that happened but Jim
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:04.240]  Acosta will say it didn't happen and so then there's a new article out today from
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.400]  RT and Wired Magazine they all wrote about it Google which is the modern
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:14.040]  Stasi spy on everything you do they have moved or are about to move though
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:19.880]  they're they're in discussions to move it's been offered to move into the former
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:29.120]  Stasi headquarters make police states hip again Google offers Stasi HQ for new
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:38.200]  Berlin office Google and the old Stasi building would say that fits and then it
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:42.080]  goes into how they're doing it here's another article right here
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:49.840]  ecstasy agent who also looks like Ronald McDonald's hired to censor xenophobic
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:57.920]  Facebook posts now you know that Russia didn't come up with correctness New York
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:05.720]  City developed its leftist takeover plan and it attacked Russia in 1917 and they
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:09.760]  stomped every Christians brains out and kicked every Christians guts out they
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:16.560]  could in Russia and then they thought oh this is so cool let's reinvade the US
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:23.200]  with our nomenclature and our culture so when you sit here and you see bozo the
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:29.840]  clown which we reported on four years ago four years ago they were hiring the
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:35.840]  Stasi to help report on people and now they're officially looking to move in to
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:41.320]  the building isn't that cute
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.560]  and my god if you look like bozo the clown you know this woman showed up to
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.920]  arrest you for your speech I'm sure you do it I mean it is the proper thing to
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:53:04.280]  do but that's how pathetic we are that we put up with stuff like this and so we
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:10.240]  get what we deserve some fat ugly stupid demonic cow he's gonna tell you
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.280]  what's go back to her beautiful shoes she's gonna tell you what speech you've
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:23.920]  got and so you're gonna bow down to her all day long because she she is God she
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:30.760]  rules hell her bowel movements are more important to your old family she's a big
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:39.240]  old dumbass control freak and so let's bow to Google let's bow to her let's get
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:45.640]  serious tomorrow I'm gonna come back on here and I'm gonna talk about the new
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.080]  deputy attorney general and the word we've got and what should be done against
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.560]  big tech that are the most horrible America hating God hating people you
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.080]  could ever imagine and so we're gonna talk about what should be done to these
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:06.320]  people and who they are because imagine they scour the earth for the worst secret
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:10.080]  police they can find they find the most evil buildings where people are hung up
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.200]  by the hundreds of thousands by their legs and in tortured rape and that's
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:22.680]  where Google wants to be Google's like a big demonic moth it's like oh my god
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:29.000]  that's a torture base could we move into a torture base because then then put you
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.240]  know then the head of Google Sundar if he could have a real torture base if he
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.920]  could really really like arrest people that don't agree with Google that would
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.000]  be better because Google was always about being pure evil Google says don't be
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.600]  evil but their real credo was be a satanic and evil as you can be and now
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.080]  they've reached this point like oh my god we're gonna hang Christians up by
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.720]  their legs and for their kids and slit their throats and drink their blood
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:02.520]  Jesus Christ he'll be able to fly in on private jet and go to a facility in
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:08.240]  Germany where they're torturing people and he'll land they like 14 floors under
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.200]  that building and they're gonna be down in there with children begging and
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:17.320]  Sundar is gonna waddle in and Sundar is gonna say I'm finally gonna be somebody
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.120]  and he'll just have your kids in that pit they say they're gonna be arresting
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:27.760]  everybody it's gonna be beautiful so don't worry by the way you think that's
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.160]  a joke he's already doing it in China he already has committed to the people's
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:39.560]  army to round up everyone he's so good I kill everyone I'm liberal I'm brown so
