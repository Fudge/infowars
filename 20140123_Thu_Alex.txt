[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:38.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.320 --> 00:43.640]  ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide thank you so much for
[00:43.640 --> 00:51.880]  joining us already Thursday the 23rd day of January 2014 hard to believe that and
[00:51.880 --> 00:56.720]  I am a bit under the weather today my allergies have gotten a lot better over
[00:56.720 --> 01:00.320]  the years drinking more water and taking supplements but all this wind blowing in
[01:00.320 --> 01:07.180]  I'm extremely hammered by it but I will engage in the transmission nonetheless
[01:07.180 --> 01:12.360]  but I'm a little bit dingy as they say but when I remembered that I had Bob
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.600]  Barr on effect I came into the office to go on the Howard Stern network this
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.520]  morning the ISDN line and I was going to do a rebroadcast or have David Knight
[01:21.520 --> 01:26.040]  sit in and then I remembered that we had former Congress from Bob Barr on with a
[01:26.040 --> 01:33.240]  lot of the TSA NSA Obama dictatorship news and information and when I also have
[01:33.240 --> 01:39.400]  a professor on who's breaking down the parallels of the First World War the
[01:39.400 --> 01:45.720]  economic conditions and different power blocks involved and of course it's not
[01:45.720 --> 01:49.400]  just this historian but many other historians say that things are lining
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.840]  up for World War three and global depression and things like that we're
[01:54.840 --> 01:58.240]  not trying to fair monger here I'm trying to get attention to this so that we
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.280]  can overt it because I like stability and I like peace and I don't like
[02:02.280 --> 02:05.880]  depressions and war and you see Homeland Security gearing up for that like a
[02:05.880 --> 02:10.200]  chicken with its head cut off running around in all directions so her report
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.280]  that was in London independent and other newspapers is it 1914 all over again
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.320]  we are in danger of repeating the mistakes that started World War one it
[02:19.320 --> 02:24.920]  says a leading historian and when you realize that British intelligence was
[02:24.920 --> 02:32.120]  involved in the assassination of the Archduke of the Austrian Empire is it
[02:32.120 --> 02:40.120]  the Austrian Hungarian Empire yeah Franz Ferdinand more of a rhetorical
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.360]  question my mother you know as a history major and she always calls me when I
[02:44.360 --> 02:48.560]  butcher names and things whatever the point is is if you look at the black
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.760]  hand of quote anarchist group connections to British intelligence
[02:52.760 --> 02:58.640]  shooting and hand-granating Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria who died
[02:58.640 --> 03:04.840]  June 28th 1914 was the Archduke of Austrian Hungarian Royal Prince of
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.640]  Hungary and Bohemia and from 1889 until his death the air presumed to the
[03:11.640 --> 03:17.400]  Austrian Hungarian the throne his assassination in Sarajevo participated
[03:17.400 --> 03:22.840]  and precipitated the Austrian-Hungarians declaration of war against Serbia this
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.280]  caused the Central Powers including Germany and Austria-Hungary and the
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.920]  allies of World War one countries ally with Serbia and Serbia's allies to
[03:31.920 --> 03:38.760]  declare war on each other starting World War one and the globalist were
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.160]  funding al-Qaeda to attack the Russians trying to start World War three just
[03:44.160 --> 03:49.000]  there it's really really a nice thing they're doing I have to tell you but
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.160]  you guys print me that info just so I have in front of me thank you but that's
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.560]  the kind of happy stuff we're gonna be discussing here today you know what
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.400]  let's talk about Justin Bieber a little bit here he looks like he's wearing a
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.960]  fully loaded diaper with the pants he I've been seeing him wear the last few
[04:05.960 --> 04:12.760]  years and and he's always driving around in a new Ferrari or Lamborghini or
[04:12.760 --> 04:17.840]  whatever and I just I'm obsessed with him actually quite frankly I mean you know
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.400]  a man wandering around disheveled looking like he's been crafting his pants
[04:22.400 --> 04:29.080]  for 10 days is just incredibly exciting to me and so we're gonna talk about why
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.000]  Justin Bieber doesn't change his diapers when we come back after this quick
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.560]  break and then we're gonna examine the contents of his diapers here today and
[04:38.560 --> 04:41.640]  that's basically what the media coverage of it is I'm not knocking media
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.520]  covering I think it's important actually to examine how the media spectacle
[04:45.520 --> 04:51.120]  works on the verge of global collapse in World War three we are focusing in on a
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.880]  spoiled brat moron twit and the police giving him escorts to topless bars this
[04:56.880 --> 05:03.760]  is so vital this is so vital introducing pro one all of your filtration in one
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.480]  system portable on the go no more do you have two or three filters to just
[05:08.480 --> 05:12.840]  reduce sodium fluoride you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and
[05:12.840 --> 05:18.160]  up to 95% of hydrofluorosalic acid advanced manufacturing technology
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.840]  combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced
[05:22.840 --> 05:27.280]  media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.440]  it is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at
[05:31.440 --> 05:37.200]  10% off with promo code water this is the only system that in one unit helps
[05:37.200 --> 05:42.880]  reduce or remove pesticides herbicides chloramines ammonia and chlorine
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.480]  hydrofluorosalic acid the most common form of fluoride not covered by other
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.160]  fluoride filter brands and sodium hexafluorosilicate get your pro pure
[05:52.160 --> 05:59.280]  with a new pro one filters a day at infowarstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139
[05:59.280 --> 06:04.360]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[06:04.360 --> 06:08.200]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[06:08.200 --> 06:13.040]  ability of the American people so why are the social engineers adding it to the
[06:13.040 --> 06:17.920]  water symbol dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy
[06:17.920 --> 06:21.920]  is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply
[06:21.920 --> 06:26.200]  yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies I am extremely excited to

[08:48.560 --> 08:54.920]  and stay an indentured servant forever it's called feudalism and the modern
[08:54.920 --> 09:00.280]  context it's called agenda 21 you know there's so much to cover here up on
[09:00.280 --> 09:06.720]  info wars calm and prison planet calm Al Qaeda the best enemy money can buy by
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.680]  Paul Joseph Watson I had him do that boil down article because I was on the
[09:11.680 --> 09:16.920]  Howard Stern network today talking about the fact that the West is funding
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.640]  Al Qaeda very exciting to be able to get that type of news out to an audience
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.000]  that generally would not be exposed that info and this information is so zeit
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.320]  guys to mainstream now that I was able to get it out and very appreciative to
[09:30.320 --> 09:36.080]  be able to cover that on the Lieberman news hour so very very important
[09:36.080 --> 09:41.960]  information there continuing Al Qaeda the best enemy money can buy I'm gonna go
[09:41.960 --> 09:50.360]  over some of that Davos globalists have basically kicked the Ukrainian prime
[09:50.360 --> 09:59.840]  minister to the curb as violence rages in Kiev so he has been a snubbed now or
[09:59.840 --> 10:06.160]  canceled continuing major league baseball prepares a new DHS screening
[10:06.160 --> 10:09.840]  measures at all ballparks but the Muslim Brotherhood of course is allowed to
[10:09.840 --> 10:13.560]  come into the country and fly all around the nation without screening because
[10:13.560 --> 10:18.440]  they're actually listed as a terror group and funding Al Qaeda but it's okay
[10:18.440 --> 10:21.200]  though and they call for killing US troops all of the Middle East but that
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.200]  that they're not a threat you your your child is has been laden again might be
[10:26.200 --> 10:31.320]  hiding in their trousers or in your wife's brazier Harvard professor warns
[10:31.320 --> 10:37.280]  of devastating China Japan war we're gonna be breaking down that very important
[10:37.280 --> 10:40.360]  article and tying into the professor that's joining us saying that there's
[10:40.360 --> 10:44.320]  serious parallels to the start of other world wars right now and of course
[10:44.320 --> 10:47.800]  that's pretty much all professors of history are saying of a more modern
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.600]  history and 20th century history are saying red level crisis red level but
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.200]  again ladies and gentlemen right now the media is focused in on Justin Bieber's
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.640]  well not as diaper pants which we have a photo of if you're just search the term
[11:02.640 --> 11:10.120]  Justin Bieber diaper pants no no the the news is his DWI and you can go up places
[11:10.120 --> 11:15.520]  like drudgeport.com and see his Disney photo style mugshot and I mean a
[11:15.520 --> 11:19.280]  smoking weed all day charged with resisting arrest what the bleep are
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.200]  you doing because he poorly paid off the police to his escort around Miami had
[11:24.200 --> 11:29.640]  police escort strip club but to the good news is that Gallup poll reports two
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.560]  thirds say federal government too big too powerful and of course they know you
[11:33.560 --> 11:36.840]  know that so they're hearing up with Homeland Security to crush anybody that
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.600]  tries to stop their criminal takeover. Obama wants debt ceiling increased again
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.240]  in February and remember he said increasing the debt does not increase
[11:44.240 --> 11:47.360]  the debt you can keep your doctor and there will be no attempts to restrict
[11:47.360 --> 11:50.920]  any guns not your handgun not your rifle not your shotgun that's a firm
[11:50.920 --> 12:00.880]  pledge that's very funny actually so we're going to be breaking down a lot
[12:00.880 --> 12:05.160]  of other information also IRS the New York Times reports on it is targeting
[12:05.160 --> 12:11.120]  conservative group in Hollywood and this is a very very important article
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.520]  because when you go over it I have been given unique perspectives into
[12:16.520 --> 12:21.640]  Hollywood that that I don't think really most talk show hosts would ever have
[12:21.640 --> 12:28.320]  in fact I don't know of any talk show host on radio who actually for whatever
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.720]  reason have fallen into Hollywood in the entertainment industry the way I have I
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.880]  never tried to go Hollywood I never went Hollywood but I have seen it from a
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.600]  bunch different angles whether it's Gary Busey or Charlie Sheen or Keanu Reeves
[12:42.600 --> 12:47.680]  or Woody Harrelson the list goes on and on who's the Iron Man guy I know him
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.620]  pretty good I remember his name Robert Downey Jr. known a writer and those are
[12:51.620 --> 12:56.000]  people I could say their names yeah I woke up Bruce Willis but he he's not
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.960]  really on record about that but people could ask him if you want some time the
[12:59.960 --> 13:06.360]  point is is that you name it they are listening to this show they're not
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.460]  liberals they're not conservatives they are libertarian conspiracy theorists
[13:11.460 --> 13:20.400]  that question the official lie of the matrix Lawrence Fishburne I mean I
[13:20.400 --> 13:23.600]  just keep going on and on the people that I personally know or know people
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.680]  that know but the people like Sean Penn I mean take my judge he's a listener and
[13:28.680 --> 13:34.200]  am I bragging it's just show the influence of what you can do and you
[13:34.200 --> 13:38.040]  never know how you're influencing people he said some of this on-air but
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.320]  even more off-air because it is an incredible revelation that the King of
[13:43.320 --> 13:49.600]  the Hill characters I'm a large part the composite of part of me is in Dale
[13:49.600 --> 13:57.000]  Gribble and in Hank Hill because he formulated King of the Hill watching
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.720]  access television and watching my show in other shows nobody knows really who
[14:02.720 --> 14:07.920]  he is but he's local libertarian talk show host Jeff Davis Jeff Davis is
[14:07.920 --> 14:15.880]  probably more King of the Hill than me I mean literally no one knows who Jeff
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.440]  Davis is I'm just telling you right now that's that that's that's that's that's
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.800]  where this comes from and again I'm telling you you don't think you have
[14:21.800 --> 14:25.000]  power going and doing an access TV show you don't think you don't have power
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.320]  doing a local radio show you don't think you're not affecting change I was on
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.960]  the air in 95 96 97 and Mike Judge you already had Beavison but had and all
[14:34.960 --> 14:39.160]  these other hit movies and TV shows was watching and literally out of that
[14:39.160 --> 14:45.000]  culture and other composites you got King of the Hill and there's all the
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.400]  inside baseball on that as well every show he's ever had becomes basically a
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.600]  number one hit and obviously I'm not gonna say you read these articles about
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.280]  pressure and Hollywood against libertarians or conservatives or people
[14:59.280 --> 15:05.480]  that are outside the quote socialist communist democratic party line that's
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.800]  what's in this New York Times article is that there's basically a secret 1500
[15:10.800 --> 15:16.360]  member right-wing libertarian group they're really libertarians you look
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.240]  how Tom Sellick's career was basically axe when he was a top TV top movie guy
[15:20.240 --> 15:26.040]  just because he was pro-gun I mean these people sacrifice a lot I know major
[15:26.040 --> 15:29.760]  illustrators and people that got a lot of their business cut just because they
[15:29.760 --> 15:33.480]  started criticizing Obama even though they've been critical of Bush in fact I
[15:33.480 --> 15:37.520]  know a bunch of famous illustrators across the country who've told me you
[15:37.520 --> 15:41.880]  know off air and on air of what they went through just because they wanted to
[15:41.880 --> 15:49.640]  have their free speech this is authoritarianism and if the FBI was
[15:49.640 --> 15:57.800]  demonized for targeting real communist in the 50s and creating a blacklist which
[15:57.800 --> 16:03.080]  is a which is debatable in my view because of what a serious threat these
[16:03.080 --> 16:05.520]  people were and they're romanticized by George Clinton the rest of them
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.480]  meanwhile they are running around literally trying to arrest and
[16:10.480 --> 16:14.360]  persecute and shut down pro-life groups gun groups tea party groups listing us
[16:14.360 --> 16:19.760]  as terrorists James Woods has said because he's gone public that he'll
[16:19.760 --> 16:25.680]  never work again but he doesn't care he's a guy that could have hit TV show
[16:25.680 --> 16:28.520]  after hit TV show you know how much something like James Woods makes an
[16:28.520 --> 16:34.360]  episode on TV half a million to a million dollars for two days of work and
[16:34.360 --> 16:40.120]  he gave it all up folks just to be able to criticize tyranny just to be able to
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.280]  promote the Second Amendment just to have his free speech that's what you
[16:44.280 --> 16:51.000]  need to understand is the reign of terror going on in Hollywood and I mean
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.280]  everybody I talked to is like no there's a mafia with all the big
[16:55.280 --> 17:00.320]  producers and then their little coterie of minions and then if you're not part
[17:00.320 --> 17:09.960]  of that the George Clooney met Damon Sean Penn usual suspects you've got to
[17:09.960 --> 17:16.400]  literally hang out with them kiss their butts and give money to Democrats even
[17:16.400 --> 17:19.600]  if you're really a libertarian or conservative or your shows don't get
[17:19.600 --> 17:23.800]  made you don't get put on air you don't get promoted and then you've got to sit
[17:23.800 --> 17:27.360]  there with a team of writers even if you're the creator of a show or whatever
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.520]  and have them basically twist it and add their propaganda and their agenda into
[17:31.520 --> 17:36.160]  it or or or or you don't get on television I mean that's the big story
[17:36.160 --> 17:40.000]  about Hollywood entertainment that is exported worldwide and is this stinking
[17:40.000 --> 17:48.480]  cesspool cancer Mark Cuban I mean this came out in the New York Times I talked
[17:48.480 --> 17:53.320]  about it on air I couldn't tell the whole story as I was told not to and honor
[17:53.320 --> 17:56.520]  my word until it came out of the New York Times but I mean I've been there in
[17:56.520 --> 18:01.080]  the phone calls when Mark Cuban was going to put out a film I was producing on
[18:01.080 --> 18:06.440]  9-11 being staged inside job on over a thousand screens he was he was going to
[18:06.440 --> 18:09.280]  pay it first to you know get it out there it takes a lot of money to get it
[18:09.280 --> 18:13.520]  distributed and was going to then sell DVDs and blu-ray of it and it wasn't
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.400]  about the money for somebody like him he wanted that message to get out but he
[18:17.400 --> 18:20.200]  also wanted to make money on top of it that's how you keep funding your
[18:20.200 --> 18:25.160]  operation and literally the White House called him this is Republicans doing
[18:25.160 --> 18:28.560]  this along with the rest of Hollywood and saying we're going to put you in
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.640]  jail if you make that and he just said I'm sorry I'm not gonna I can't do this
[18:33.640 --> 18:36.840]  now they're put me in you know they're gonna try to set me up for stock stuff
[18:36.840 --> 18:40.200]  that I haven't even done some $800,000 trade we got worth billions of dollars
[18:40.200 --> 18:46.120]  and I'm not gonna do it and they still tried to put him in prison
[18:46.960 --> 18:51.760]  you understand that ladies and gentlemen you understand how evil this
[18:51.760 --> 18:57.240]  system is sec persecutes mark Cuban for relationship with loose change curtain
[18:57.240 --> 19:03.400]  MO 2008 and then it later again came out in the New York Times that indeed that
[19:03.400 --> 19:08.720]  went on so just to be fair this can happen from the Republicans as well but
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.600]  very rarely that I've seen it well I mean here's a Lionel Chet one threatened me
[19:12.600 --> 19:17.880]  in a bathroom when he was the head of President Bush's media Commission and
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.680]  and they didn't ever try to bring any true patriot messages to TV the
[19:22.680 --> 19:26.520]  Republicans are like a placeholder for the Democrats to people so folks think
[19:26.520 --> 19:30.280]  there's an opposition but but just in them you know just to be fair bring up
[19:30.280 --> 19:33.800]  other subjects you know it shows not just the Democrats over about 90% of it
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.280]  Chet one came up and said we're going to get you we're gonna take you out and
[19:38.280 --> 19:41.680]  luckily one of the assistants walked in to get us when I was going on this TV
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.320]  show with him and and and and heard it because he had his lawyers threaten me
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.840]  and I said let's go to court buddy I got witnesses let's go you know you came in
[19:50.840 --> 19:55.320]  there and and did that but I mean I'm just telling you folks that's how the real
[19:55.320 --> 20:01.120]  world works okay so stop being naive we'll be right back if you're a baby

[24:03.040 --> 24:08.720]  hello this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex
[24:08.720 --> 24:15.760]  and Jones yeah and for worth.com
[24:17.760 --> 24:26.200]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[24:26.200 --> 24:33.640]  CNN lays off more than 40 journalists demo death spiral that's all planned
[24:33.640 --> 24:39.240]  folks they're just destroying the news that they got to sell out from its
[24:39.240 --> 24:45.440]  conception and now mission complete country broken world government going
[24:45.440 --> 24:51.600]  into place now they've just got a mop up what's left of individual liberty and
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.560]  states rights bankrupt you and your families so you're properly under their
[24:55.560 --> 25:00.320]  control by the way I should talk more about Hollywood I should make films
[25:00.320 --> 25:04.400]  about this I should do more reports about it because it is literally a mass
[25:04.400 --> 25:10.240]  mental illness out there where so many people really believe they're not going
[25:10.240 --> 25:16.520]  to live and not be successful until they are embraced by Hollywood as a
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.360]  cinematographer as a writer as an actor or an actress and you sit there and you
[25:21.360 --> 25:25.360]  explain to people listen I've been to the top of the mountain I've seen what's
[25:25.360 --> 25:31.120]  there unbelievable but again 80% of what I've seen I get is off record I can't
[25:31.120 --> 25:35.080]  even tell you but I've been to the big parties I've been I've seen it these
[25:35.080 --> 25:41.200]  people are literally in living hell there's a reason they all move to Austin
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.840]  Texas or they all move to Wyoming there's a reason Robert Plant lives you
[25:45.840 --> 25:52.600]  know down off Congress in Austin Texas I'm not gonna say where I cannot believe
[25:52.600 --> 25:59.040]  where he lives it is unbelievable it's a strangest thing you wouldn't believe it
[25:59.040 --> 26:03.120]  anyways the whole point is I gotta tell you guys off but I shouldn't even tell
[26:03.120 --> 26:07.400]  you anyway I just couldn't believe it anyways the point is is that I'm not
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.280]  sitting here talking about all this to impress people I'm talking about it
[26:12.280 --> 26:18.400]  because we've won folks the mainline conservatives are waking up to the fact
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.480]  that it's all a artificial plastic synthetic BS machine and the Democrats
[26:25.480 --> 26:28.520]  are waking up at the Democratic Party and all that fake liberalism is not
[26:28.520 --> 26:33.440]  liberalism they're discovering Thomas Jefferson they're discovering Magna
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.720]  Carta they're discovering individual liberty I mean the fires are really
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.560]  getting lit here the brush fires in the minds of humans and that's my mission is
[26:44.560 --> 26:48.840]  to ignite human liberty and you can judge a tree by its fruits notice how I'm
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.760]  under a mitigated attack from all angles I love it it means just like when my
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.240]  grandfather was flying on North Africa over Italy they would fly into the
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.840]  flak clouds to bomb the industrial centers because they had to take out that
[27:02.840 --> 27:06.720]  military capacity and they would fly into the flak that means when I'm taking
[27:06.720 --> 27:12.000]  attacks if I'm not being attacked I'm not doing my job if I need to go into the
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.200]  enemy I need to attack the enemy in a frontal assault to break people out of
[27:16.200 --> 27:18.800]  their trance and that's what you need to do and so when I tell you all this
[27:18.800 --> 27:21.920]  Hollywood stuff that I hardly ever even get into I do it because I see an
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.760]  article about a 1500 secret member conservative group which by the way I've
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.560]  had multiple overtures to join this group would you like to join a secret
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.880]  conservative libertarian secret society with reporters and Hollywood people and
[27:36.880 --> 27:42.640]  I'm like no I don't want to be part of any secret group because then I will be
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.960]  tarred with whatever the members of the secret group do by being part of some
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.000]  secret group but the fact is that you've got a like underground Christians or
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.400]  something in Rome it's in the New York Times today that's why I'm getting into
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.360]  all this you have 1500 secret group now with the IRS basically coming after them
[27:59.360 --> 28:03.520]  and not letting them be tax exempt as they try to you know come out of the
[28:03.520 --> 28:10.360]  closet I mean where is the tolerance in this country the conservatives and
[28:10.360 --> 28:12.960]  libertarians in Hollywood cannot come out of the closet I'll tell you why they
[28:12.960 --> 28:15.920]  can't come out of the closet folks because they're the majority I've been
[28:15.920 --> 28:21.800]  there I've seen it unless you're talking about Sean Penn or Josh Brolin and I'm
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.120]  not trying to be mean it's like I've met these people known them talked to him
[28:26.120 --> 28:29.920]  on the phone and then you run into him again and they just preach you like you
[28:29.920 --> 28:34.520]  don't even exist and that's not why I dislike them it's because I know people
[28:34.520 --> 28:36.840]  that know I'm really good and everybody talks about how intellectual and how
[28:36.840 --> 28:42.340]  smart they are and they're not that smart and they they know though this is
[28:42.340 --> 28:46.000]  what you do to be successful in Hollywood yeah it's like Alec Baldwin
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.560]  constantly saying kill this conservative kill this libertarian kill this person
[28:49.560 --> 28:52.960]  kill this person's children and they don't get in trouble if I said kill
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.120]  someone's children go to his house kill their children and he said that
[28:56.120 --> 28:59.760]  repeatedly about members of Congress go to their house kill their wife and
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.480]  children that's a call to action folks if I said on air go to somebody's house
[29:04.480 --> 29:09.760]  kill their children somebody probably would do it that's not free speech that's
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.220]  calling for murder that's calling you know for saying go attack the Capitol
[29:14.220 --> 29:16.920]  hypothetically I'm not saying that they'll probably cut it out of context
[29:16.920 --> 29:21.120]  Rachel Maddow and do that the whole point is Alex said attack the Capitol no I
[29:21.120 --> 29:26.000]  didn't you witch I didn't say giant wasp live under the UN building I didn't say
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.920]  Obama sent that tornado you lion freak that's why you don't have any viewers
[29:31.920 --> 29:38.320]  which you and Janet Reno ought to clone yourselves guess you already did anyways
[29:38.320 --> 29:41.760]  the point is is I'm gonna finish this when we come back and again all the
[29:41.760 --> 29:45.000]  geopolitical is there's so much coming up we got former Congress from Bob Barr on
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.080]  the NSA TSA and breaking into all that's not stay with us we're on the March the

[33:31.600 --> 33:36.400]  if you are listening to this transmission you are receiving this
[33:36.400 --> 33:45.440]  transmission you are the resistance hard to turn that beat down in it
[33:45.440 --> 33:53.760]  crank it up
[33:53.760 --> 33:55.760]  Too much.
[33:55.760 --> 34:15.760]  That's more drugs.
[34:25.760 --> 34:27.760]  We want it.
[34:27.760 --> 34:29.760]  We'll come though with you.
[34:29.760 --> 34:31.760]  Yeah.
[34:31.760 --> 34:33.760]  It's called San Angeles 1969.
[34:33.760 --> 34:36.760]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[34:36.760 --> 34:38.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here live.
[34:38.760 --> 34:40.760]  Thank you for joining us.
[34:40.760 --> 34:43.760]  And then don't forget, we're back.
[34:43.760 --> 34:45.760]  Weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[34:45.760 --> 34:48.760]  With Info Wars Nightly News.
[34:48.760 --> 34:51.760]  Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.760]  And the reason we came in with that song, ladies and gentlemen, is.
[34:56.760 --> 34:58.760]  There is a revolution happening.
[34:58.760 --> 35:01.760]  A revolution of tyranny, a revolution of evil and hate,
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.760]  but also a revolution of good at the same time for every action.
[35:04.760 --> 35:07.760]  There's an opposite and equal reaction.
[35:07.760 --> 35:11.760]  As I love to quote, because it's so true to understand this.
[35:11.760 --> 35:14.760]  Evil is not the only power in the universe.
[35:14.760 --> 35:18.760]  And its great power is convincing good that good has no power.
[35:18.760 --> 35:22.760]  And really, that's the huge thought.
[35:22.760 --> 35:24.760]  Beyond an epiphany, because I already knew it.
[35:24.760 --> 35:28.760]  It's a great discovered truth that has not been.
[35:28.760 --> 35:30.760]  Promoted.
[35:30.760 --> 35:33.760]  That's not been talked about because for most people, Hollywood,
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.760]  entertainment, what sets the cultural mores.
[35:38.760 --> 35:41.760]  What what dominates.
[35:41.760 --> 35:43.760]  The thought process.
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.760]  I mean that that that is the essence of a culture.
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.760]  And it is a weaponized criminally directed mafia.
[35:52.760 --> 35:54.760]  I mean, you think you've seen the Sopranos folks,
[35:54.760 --> 35:57.760]  you want to actually be in these Hollywood meetings with these top lawyers
[35:57.760 --> 35:59.760]  and owners and producers.
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.760]  I mean, these guys are literally beyond the Godfather.
[36:03.760 --> 36:07.760]  All of them big old mean men smoking cigarettes and cigars.
[36:07.760 --> 36:12.760]  And they're like 80 years old going.
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.760]  And then literally, if you don't start like yelling back at them and telling them, you know,
[36:16.760 --> 36:20.760]  I've sat there and like said, hey, the text is saying, you know, be careful,
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.760]  grab safe.
[36:21.760 --> 36:24.760]  The guy went, are you threatening me?
[36:24.760 --> 36:26.760]  He was just totally freaked out.
[36:26.760 --> 36:29.760]  I was like, no, I'm really serious.
[36:29.760 --> 36:31.760]  Well, maybe we'll do that deal.
[36:31.760 --> 36:32.760]  Just don't threaten me.
[36:32.760 --> 36:35.760]  Paranoid out of their minds.
[36:35.760 --> 36:39.760]  Because everyone else is grovels to them and all these women out there,
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.760]  particularly in men who really think if they could ever get to Hollywood,
[36:45.760 --> 36:47.760]  it's like a bug zapper for women.
[36:47.760 --> 36:52.760]  And they just fly in means of turning them into hookers,
[36:52.760 --> 36:55.760]  turning them into prostitutes, turning them into, you know,
[36:55.760 --> 37:04.760]  just just just a system to literally, literally suck this country dry
[37:04.760 --> 37:07.760]  and then export that evil worldwide.
[37:07.760 --> 37:13.760]  And I am in investigating it more and more and realizing how this spiritual
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.760]  sickness is being deployed against humanity.
[37:17.760 --> 37:19.760]  They make a documentary about it.
[37:19.760 --> 37:22.760]  I just, I really am intrigued by the mind control machine,
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.760]  not just the messages that are in it, but how they control the stable of actors,
[37:27.760 --> 37:30.760]  writers, directors, and then how they deploy that.
[37:30.760 --> 37:35.760]  And then how weak it is, once you're aware of it and what a fraud it is,
[37:35.760 --> 37:38.760]  and you see George Clooney for what he is, not a liberal,
[37:38.760 --> 37:44.760]  but a person selling Obamacare and open borders and disarming the American people
[37:44.760 --> 37:49.760]  when he has bodyguards, consciously knowing that they're part of a criminal,
[37:49.760 --> 37:56.760]  authoritarian takeover and are propaganda officers who willingly embrace it.
[37:56.760 --> 37:59.760]  You know, it's one thing for a lot of the Hollywood stars to just keep their mouth shut
[37:59.760 --> 38:01.760]  or quietly try to do things for liberty.
[38:01.760 --> 38:06.760]  Take Billy Corrigan, you know, 40, 50 million records sold,
[38:06.760 --> 38:11.760]  international star, documentaries, films, whole nine yards.
[38:11.760 --> 38:15.760]  Do you know how much courage it takes for him?
[38:15.760 --> 38:16.760]  Like, I need to call him up.
[38:16.760 --> 38:19.760]  We exchange text sometimes, talk to him once a while.
[38:19.760 --> 38:22.760]  For him to have come on my show those times and to speak out against the government
[38:22.760 --> 38:26.760]  and to speak out about Obama being a fraud and not saying Republicans are good.
[38:26.760 --> 38:28.760]  He was saying the whole things of fraud.
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.760]  I mean, do you understand what happens when people do stuff like that?
[38:32.760 --> 38:34.760]  Do you know?
[38:34.760 --> 38:38.760]  That's why I don't admire Billy Corrigan, even though I'm a fan of a lot of his music,
[38:38.760 --> 38:40.760]  because he's just some famous guy.
[38:40.760 --> 38:42.760]  He's a really nice person.
[38:42.760 --> 38:43.760]  He's a really deep person.
[38:43.760 --> 38:45.760]  He's a really smart person.
[38:45.760 --> 38:47.760]  He's a very genteel person.
[38:47.760 --> 38:54.760]  And he sees past my ogre likeness and understands that I love beauty
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.760]  and love goodness and love life and creation.
[38:58.760 --> 39:01.760]  And so we resonate on that level.
[39:01.760 --> 39:10.760]  But I mean, do you know what the type of heat people get just to come on a show
[39:10.760 --> 39:13.760]  that the establishment doesn't want and talk about the weather?
[39:13.760 --> 39:14.760]  They don't like that.
[39:14.760 --> 39:19.760]  That's what the talking points of the White House, the secret of White House,
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.760]  directed into media matters every week with weekly meetings as their front.
[39:24.760 --> 39:28.760]  Sure, the site has no visitors, but it's a talking point memo from the White House
[39:28.760 --> 39:32.760]  to see what they think, to see what they say, to see who they don't like.
[39:32.760 --> 39:38.760]  And when you look at things like media matters and groups like that,
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.760]  they're there telling Republicans what they can and can't think.
[39:42.760 --> 39:45.760]  And oh my gosh, Rand Paul, don't promote him.
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.760]  No Ted Cruz, he's a loser, he's a failure when he's exploding and totally successful
[39:49.760 --> 39:51.760]  by challenging the fraud, by calling it out.
[39:51.760 --> 39:53.760]  So they're trying to set reality.
[39:53.760 --> 40:00.760]  They're trying to dictate reality.
[40:00.760 --> 40:06.760]  They are trying to literally create walls in our minds like we're children
[40:06.760 --> 40:12.760]  and telling us Santa Claus is real, that Obamacare cuts your prices down to a phone bill.
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.760]  You can keep your doctor and just as they shut down our power plants,
[40:16.760 --> 40:20.760]  as they ship our jobs overseas, cold bloodedly parading around.
[40:20.760 --> 40:25.760]  Oh, that's the high and mighty Obama, the man that loves us.
[40:25.760 --> 40:32.760]  That's the high and mighty Obama, the guy that cares about the children.
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.760]  It's all just a joke.
[40:34.760 --> 40:41.760]  Do you understand how evil Michael Moore is and how evil George Clooney is?
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.760]  Do you realize how fraudulent they are as they do this great evil
[40:46.760 --> 40:50.760]  and then tell us they're high and mighty and they have the moral authority
[40:50.760 --> 40:52.760]  and we've got to do what they say?
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.760]  That is the ultimate form of slavery as they race pimp and create division
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.760]  and try to turn women against men as if men are a bad thing
[41:02.760 --> 41:05.760]  and it's the fault of men that women aren't empowered
[41:05.760 --> 41:10.760]  so that women are entitled and at war with men and their children
[41:10.760 --> 41:15.760]  instead of at war against the outside elements that are trying to bring down the family.
[41:15.760 --> 41:19.760]  And then men are these arrested development little boys
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.760]  watching simulated combat all day on television and playing video games all day
[41:24.760 --> 41:26.760]  and so of course the women detest it.
[41:26.760 --> 41:28.760]  They want men.
[41:28.760 --> 41:36.760]  They want red blooded men with guts and big hearts and who are leaders.
[41:36.760 --> 41:39.760]  Of course women don't even know what they want because no one ever told them.
[41:39.760 --> 41:42.760]  No one ever showed them real role models.
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.760]  From day one everything is to screw up children so they have screwed up lives.
[41:46.760 --> 41:48.760]  You think about evil folks.
[41:48.760 --> 41:52.760]  You think about jacking with the hard wiring of a beautiful species.
[41:52.760 --> 41:56.760]  A bunch of filth, a bunch of garbage, a bunch of trash enemies
[41:56.760 --> 41:59.760]  and I see you you little chicken-necked enemies.
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.760]  Your spirits are about a centimeter high.
[42:02.760 --> 42:05.760]  Your shadows taller than your soul.
[42:05.760 --> 42:09.760]  And as you go on down that road you know where you're going.
[42:09.760 --> 42:11.760]  Shadows taller than your soul.
[42:11.760 --> 42:12.760]  You understand that?
[42:12.760 --> 42:14.760]  You know what that means, don't you?
[42:14.760 --> 42:22.760]  Because I see you and you need to know that judgment is coming down on all of you.
[42:22.760 --> 42:25.760]  You think you're going to commit these crimes against humanity
[42:25.760 --> 42:29.760]  and not be brought low and not be cut down?
[42:29.760 --> 42:30.760]  You're already cut down.
[42:30.760 --> 42:32.760]  It's why you're so miserable.
[42:32.760 --> 42:37.760]  It's why you're so weak and it's why you're spiritually shuttered and blind.
[42:37.760 --> 42:40.760]  And the darkness just gets darker and colder by the minute.
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.760]  Because the truth is about hell, it's not hot, it's cold.
[42:43.760 --> 42:46.760]  And you know that coldness now, don't you?
[42:46.760 --> 42:48.760]  You know of what I speak.
[42:48.760 --> 42:52.760]  You know the dark flame you worship.
[42:52.760 --> 42:57.760]  You know you kneel at the altar of death.
[42:57.760 --> 42:59.760]  Because you're afraid of it.
[42:59.760 --> 43:02.760]  You're cowards from the beginning.
[43:02.760 --> 43:08.760]  So you joined with the evil believing that it would give you power and give you knowledge.
[43:08.760 --> 43:12.760]  All it did was give you knowledge of evil.
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.760]  You think you're masters of evil?
[43:17.760 --> 43:20.760]  You are slaves of evil.
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.760]  Now, a lot of news obviously to cover here today.
[43:26.760 --> 43:29.760]  Let me just try to read some of these headlines.
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.760]  It's this, the dam is breaking.
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.760]  And that's why they're going to start wars and implode the economy and do everything else.
[43:35.760 --> 43:37.760]  Because Hollywood is falling.
[43:37.760 --> 43:39.760]  Los Angeles is falling.
[43:39.760 --> 43:42.760]  On record, the mayor declared an emergency.
[43:42.760 --> 43:48.760]  And the mass hypnotism.
[43:48.760 --> 43:50.760]  The mass imprinting.
[43:50.760 --> 43:56.760]  If you're there when baby ducks are born, my dad was.
[43:56.760 --> 43:58.760]  I forget the whole story.
[43:58.760 --> 44:03.760]  I think one of the wild ducks got run over in the road, flew into something.
[44:03.760 --> 44:04.760]  I forget.
[44:04.760 --> 44:06.760]  My dad had these duck eggs.
[44:06.760 --> 44:07.760]  Tells the story.
[44:07.760 --> 44:13.760]  And so when they hatched out, the ducks thought that he was their mama.
[44:13.760 --> 44:15.760]  They imprinted on them.
[44:15.760 --> 44:18.760]  And then generations, I think they were whispering ducks.
[44:18.760 --> 44:20.760]  They said until there were hundreds of them.
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.760]  And then they actually load them up and shipped them off to a big lake nearby.
[44:24.760 --> 44:27.760]  But then the ducks, someone actually came back.
[44:27.760 --> 44:29.760]  The ducks would follow my dad around.
[44:29.760 --> 44:33.760]  And then the parents taught them that he was the leader of the ducks.
[44:33.760 --> 44:36.760]  And then finally there was like a hundred of them or something.
[44:36.760 --> 44:38.760]  It was duck crap everywhere.
[44:38.760 --> 44:40.760]  The ducks, they didn't kill them though.
[44:40.760 --> 44:42.760]  But they shipped them to a nearby lake.
[44:42.760 --> 44:46.760]  But see, that's okay of a duck imprints of a nice person.
[44:46.760 --> 44:51.760]  Women especially are imprinting on television and those messages.
[44:51.760 --> 44:54.760]  They are imprinting on the state as their father.
[44:54.760 --> 44:58.760]  They are imprinting on their father as an enemy.
[44:58.760 --> 45:00.760]  The media is selling them that directive.
[45:00.760 --> 45:08.760]  And so they're literally being led like moths.
[45:08.760 --> 45:14.760]  They're literally being led like moths to the flame.
[45:14.760 --> 45:16.760]  To the bug zapper.
[45:16.760 --> 45:21.760]  And you cannot get these people out of their trances.
[45:21.760 --> 45:23.760]  I mean, I've tried.
[45:23.760 --> 45:27.760]  And it's just like, no, if I could just be an actress, if I could just be a singer,
[45:27.760 --> 45:29.760]  if I could just be a rock star, if I could just be a...
[45:29.760 --> 45:35.760]  And the con games and all the little sub acting schools and music schools and all of this.
[45:35.760 --> 45:37.760]  If you want music for the love of it, that's great.
[45:37.760 --> 45:40.760]  Or if you want to, you know, be an actor because you really are into it,
[45:40.760 --> 45:43.760]  go do it at local theater and enjoy it and have passion.
[45:43.760 --> 45:47.760]  And then you might be successful actually, but everyone just trying to be successful.
[45:47.760 --> 45:48.760]  That's why you're not successful.
[45:48.760 --> 45:52.760]  And there's limited slots in the Hollywood system.
[45:52.760 --> 45:55.760]  And in the news system, there's dwindling spots.
[45:55.760 --> 46:01.760]  Look at CNN just laid off 40 more journalists or propagandists.
[46:01.760 --> 46:03.760]  And so people scrabble looking for fulfillment.
[46:03.760 --> 46:06.760]  You're not going to get it from Madison Avenue spin machines.
[46:06.760 --> 46:09.760]  You're not going to get it from that culture of death.
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.760]  And then I tell these people that are trying to break into the media or trying to break into entertainment.
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.760]  I go, listen, go out and do your own YouTube show.
[46:18.760 --> 46:20.760]  Go out and do your own local podcast.
[46:20.760 --> 46:23.760]  Go out and be passionate, put the information out.
[46:23.760 --> 46:27.760]  And if you really are doing it for the right reason, you will become somewhat successful,
[46:27.760 --> 46:29.760]  maybe incredibly successful.
[46:29.760 --> 46:33.760]  And my gut has always been trying to promote that idea to get more people involved in media.
[46:33.760 --> 46:41.760]  And then so many people, I would say, I don't know, maybe 70% of protogees and people that I've launched and helped,
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.760]  then get into the Cass Sunstein model of cognitive infiltration, not consciously,
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.760]  but then because they're not instantly super successful or aren't as successful as I am,
[46:50.760 --> 46:54.760]  they believe in some primitive thing like the head chimpanzee.
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.760]  They want to bash its brains out so they'll be the head chimpanzee sitting up on the rock with the female chimpanzees
[46:59.760 --> 47:02.760]  picking mites and ticks off of you.
[47:02.760 --> 47:05.760]  That's not how the universe works and not how this world system works.
[47:05.760 --> 47:08.760]  You build systems. The pie is unlimited.
[47:08.760 --> 47:11.760]  You don't tear something down to become successful.
[47:11.760 --> 47:19.760]  But I just see how dumb and adult and uninformed people of,
[47:19.760 --> 47:22.760]  because the world's taught them and their parents have taught them,
[47:22.760 --> 47:24.760]  because we're multi-generations of the television culture,
[47:24.760 --> 47:26.760]  betrayal is how you have power.
[47:26.760 --> 47:30.760]  They've taught them, selling someone out is how you get power.
[47:30.760 --> 47:34.760]  Lying about someone and saying they're immoral and they're not good and they're not upstanding,
[47:34.760 --> 47:37.760]  because then that makes you feel better about yourself.
[47:37.760 --> 47:42.760]  This is all part of this sick artificial culture.
[47:42.760 --> 47:46.760]  But I mean, people, the only way to be successful now is,
[47:46.760 --> 47:53.760]  and people figured this out, is to go out and create your own films and then put them out for free.
[47:53.760 --> 47:55.760]  If you build it, they will come.
[47:55.760 --> 48:01.760]  But see, someone won't really do that who just has a compulsion like an imprinting that they need to be a movie star.
[48:01.760 --> 48:03.760]  They need to be a rock star. They need to be a hip-hop star.
[48:03.760 --> 48:06.760]  They need to, they need to, they need to, they need to, they need to.
[48:06.760 --> 48:09.760]  And then they just sit there and get and work into a system that's designed to cheat them,
[48:09.760 --> 48:12.760]  even if they have talent and designed to destroy them.
[48:12.760 --> 48:14.760]  And it's one in a million they would ever have success.
[48:14.760 --> 48:19.760]  Even having the success, there's no success in it because it's a fraudulent, evil, dark system.
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.760]  In the gathering darkness, even if you want to be a good person,
[48:23.760 --> 48:26.760]  almost anything you do now will get twisted to evil.
[48:26.760 --> 48:30.760]  You will certainly not be able to do good in a massive system like that.
[48:30.760 --> 48:37.760]  You can only do good in a system like that, hijacking it, getting into it to sabotage it.
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.760]  And if you actually fight the system, that's the quickest way to be introduced into it because they want to co-opt you.
[48:42.760 --> 48:45.760]  But again, the fools out there don't even know that.
[48:45.760 --> 48:50.760]  They think selling out to it is the way to be empowered.
[48:50.760 --> 48:54.760]  And so it is mass mental illness.
[48:54.760 --> 49:00.760]  People don't end up being a father or a mother or a great farmer or a great painter because they love painting now.
[49:00.760 --> 49:02.760]  It's because they're going to have value.
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.760]  They're going to be somebody. They're going to be successful. They're going to be fulfilled.
[49:06.760 --> 49:13.760]  They're looking for something when all you've got to do is look into your heart and look up at the stars and look into a river and look into the trees
[49:13.760 --> 49:16.760]  and look at a little bird outside your window.
[49:16.760 --> 49:18.760]  And its fulfillment is right there.
[49:18.760 --> 49:23.760]  And then if you're fulfilled, people will recognize that and then you will gain power.
[49:23.760 --> 49:26.760]  But see, once you're fulfilled, you won't even want the power anymore.
[49:26.760 --> 49:31.760]  But you will then get the power, the power to be a good father, the power to be a good mother.
[49:31.760 --> 49:33.760]  And none of us are perfect and none of us have all the answers.
[49:33.760 --> 49:41.760]  I'm just simply trying to explain to you that the establishment is not going to help you and does not want to help you.
[49:41.760 --> 49:54.760]  The system is evil and wants to sabotage you and hurt you because if you're a free, empowered, healthy person, you won't conform to the system they're creating.
[49:54.760 --> 49:57.760]  Fundamentally, the system will not empower you.
[49:57.760 --> 50:00.760]  Fundamentally, the system will destroy you.
[50:00.760 --> 50:04.760]  Fundamentally, it's designed to.
[50:04.760 --> 50:11.760]  And I don't mean to just get up here and preach today, but I tend to when I'm real tired to, you know, just kind of go off into these tangents.
[50:11.760 --> 50:20.760]  But we got several big guests up coming up, former Congressman Bob Barr on the NSA, TSA, the latest on Obama becoming a unitary executive.
[50:20.760 --> 50:23.760]  That's a fancy term for dictator.
[50:23.760 --> 50:30.760]  And where all of that is going and a board declares NSA data suite illegal?
[50:30.760 --> 50:37.760]  Well, of course, it says it has no basis in law. No, tyranny doesn't have a basis in law. It has a basis in force and fraud.
[50:37.760 --> 50:39.760]  So that's coming up as well.
[50:39.760 --> 50:50.760]  But what the news here is in America, conservatives and libertarians have to be in a secret society in Hollywood or they'll be hunted down and bankrupted.
[50:50.760 --> 50:57.760]  But we're this close to the Hollywood system falling and a true renaissance of American culture.
[50:57.760 --> 51:00.760]  And that we win. It's big.

[53:26.760 --> 53:28.760]  Inside Are You On?
[53:56.760 --> 53:59.760]  PrivacyCase.com
[54:26.760 --> 54:35.760]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[54:35.760 --> 54:37.760]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.760]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[54:42.760 --> 54:47.760]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[54:47.760 --> 54:49.760]  The guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed.
[54:49.760 --> 54:51.760]  We will take all weapons.
[54:51.760 --> 54:53.760]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.760]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[54:57.760 --> 55:00.760]  Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.760]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[55:05.760 --> 55:09.760]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[55:09.760 --> 55:17.760]  And as Chance Lee News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered, that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[55:17.760 --> 55:25.760]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.760]  If you got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.760]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.760]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[55:42.760 --> 55:47.760]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.760]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[56:00.760 --> 56:03.760]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[56:03.760 --> 56:05.760]  I am inside.
[56:05.760 --> 56:07.760]  I have two words for you.
[56:07.760 --> 56:09.760]  Predator drones.
[56:09.760 --> 56:12.760]  You will never see it coming.
[56:14.760 --> 56:17.760]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[56:17.760 --> 56:26.760]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[56:26.760 --> 56:32.760]  They let them in the area. They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[56:32.760 --> 56:40.760]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want a commentation.
[56:40.760 --> 56:46.760]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run.
[56:46.760 --> 57:05.760]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[57:05.760 --> 57:21.760]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you for joining us.
[57:26.760 --> 57:33.760]  I love playing that at least once a week because that really is just a snapshot of the off the chart tyranny we're dealing with in this society.
[57:33.760 --> 57:45.760]  We have a professor coming on to deal with the parallels that are taking place and going on in the world to other World Wars that have started.
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.760]  And there's not an analyst out there that doesn't say we're on the verge of catastrophe.
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.760]  And my goal in bringing that up is to try to not have it repeat history again.
[57:54.760 --> 57:59.760]  But there are parasitic globalists that will use these calamities to bring in total control.
[57:59.760 --> 58:03.760]  And they do this every time they're about to lose control.
[58:03.760 --> 58:07.760]  And the British Empire helped start World War I and World War II.
[58:07.760 --> 58:15.760]  And I'm not saying Hitler was good, obviously. I'm stating history that if you study it, they helped create the climate, even helped fund the Nazis early on.
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.760]  The King of England didn't advocate over a woman he wanted to marry.
[58:19.760 --> 58:22.760]  It was he was a Nazi and how old Hitler, you can look it up.
[58:22.760 --> 58:28.760]  And it was actually in Germany when World War II started, had to flee out of Spain back to England.
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.760]  That's what it's all about. And British intelligence started all of it. All of it.
[58:32.760 --> 59:00.760]  And the same model is about to start World War III. Right now, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[59:02.760 --> 59:03.760]  Adding it to the water.
[59:03.760 --> 59:04.760]  Simple.
[59:04.760 --> 59:08.760]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[59:08.760 --> 59:14.760]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[59:14.760 --> 59:20.760]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive Info Wars Live fluoride shield formulation.
[59:20.760 --> 59:30.760]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[59:30.760 --> 59:35.760]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[59:35.760 --> 59:37.760]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[59:37.760 --> 59:43.760]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at infowarslive.com today.
[59:43.760 --> 01:00:05.760]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time. That's infowarslive.com.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:17.760]  Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:30.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:40.760]  Professor Margaret McMillan is going to be joining us, breaking down the parallels to World War I, the start of World War I, that we're seeing geopolitically.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760]  I see a lot more parallels than that.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.760]  And we've got other professors looking at the geopolitical developments.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.760]  Harvard professor warns of devastating China-Japan war.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.760]  We're going to tie that in.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.760]  Also, Russian study says U.S. could easily defeat Beijing in nuclear conflict.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.760]  But, you know, we'd lose 15 million people.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760]  Not saying we wouldn't get our hair messed up.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:14.760]  Quote, George C. Scott playing one of the generals in Dr. Strangelove.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.760]  Oh, man, the madness of the situation.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:24.760]  The absolute madness of what's going on in society right now is just crazy.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.760]  I got an idea. How about we just not have a nuclear war?
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:45.760]  You know, that makes sense because they have all these underground bases and the United States has spent more money than all other countries combined, not just on so-called defense that's offense for the globalist army, but also in the final equation to protect themselves.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:52.760]  And I guess they don't care about Fukushima and leaking reactors because that's going to be nothing, I guess, from the fallout of a huge nuclear war.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.760]  And I guess they think it's survivable.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:11.760]  And most analysts, and we've covered these articles, had them on, you can just search it, believe that we're in greater danger of a nuclear war right now than we were in 1960, 1961, 1962, during the whole Cuban missile crisis run up during and after.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.760]  When the United States was covertly putting nuclear weapons in Turkey, so the Russians would put them in Cuba.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.760]  And again, it isn't like I'm saying the U.S. was the bad guy there.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.760]  It's all establishments. It's the Russians were definitely the bad guys then.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:41.760]  But the U.S. elite, a large section of it actually put the Bolsheviks into power and used that as a big army to take over the world while then building up another empire that they control with another hand in the name of resisting that other empire.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760]  They both built themselves up.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:50.760]  It's almost like the arch how you take two pillars and lean them together, and then they support each other.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:58.760]  And that's how you can take two tyrannies, or if you create a tyranny, you can then create a system to respond to it for every action.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.760]  It's an equal and opposite reaction. You know that's going to happen.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.760]  And then you can steer and ride that new beast.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:17.760]  And that's what al Qaeda is, is a prime enzyme that is used for these different equations, political, geopolitical equations.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:25.760]  It's more of an art form to be able to guide crises and destabilize areas while at the same time taking domestic liberties.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.760]  And I know I beat that dead horse to death, but the point is that it's starting to come out.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.760]  It's starting to happen.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:44.760]  And, you know, the public is basically mesmerized the point of they don't even know that plants need water to live.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.760]  They think they need brondo because that's got what plants crave electrolytes.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  And of course, I mean, sarcastic there with a Mike Judgian quote from Idiocracy, but that's pretty much what it comes down to.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:10.760]  Like humans are now more than ever that they will change the subject to something else and then never, never move on to the larger issue.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:21.760]  Dealing with people is just frustrating to say the least sometimes, as we all know, to try to communicate ideas to people that do not want to receive the idea.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:30.760]  It's almost like thinking is seen as a labor when it's actually very enjoyable.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.760]  I mean, thinking about balancing your checkbook is not fun.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.760]  Thinking about, you know, fighting out if you have termites in your house isn't fun.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:50.760]  But thinking about how the world works and your position and looking forward into the future and backwards into the past is the essence of being human
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:58.760]  and communicating with future generations and loving them is the secret to unequivocal true immortality.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.760]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:30.760]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.760]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:39.760]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:04.760]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:13.760]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.760]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.760]  We are what we eat.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.760]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.760]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.760]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:06.760]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.760]  a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.760]  Fluoride.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.760]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.760]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:32.760]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.760]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:41.760]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:46.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you go up to infowars.com, we've got the headline Harvard Professor Warns
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:54.760]  of Devastating China-Japan War, Russian study says U.S. could easily defeat Beijing in nuclear conflict
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:01.760]  as the president of China and others in the last month have said prepare for all-out multi-theater
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.760]  conventional war and nuclear war with the United States.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.760]  And of course they said last week in the People's Daily and other state-run media
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.760]  that they are going to invade Philippine islands that they claim really belong to China,
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:24.760]  that Japan took, and that they're also going to take other disputed islands by Japan.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.760]  And if that happens, there will be war.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.760]  Now I understand Justin Bieber's in the news, he got a DWI, and that's very important as well.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.760]  But we're not going to be talking about that.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.760]  I already talked about entertainment industry and the mass mental illness of it and people being distracted,
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.760]  fiddling while Rome burns.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.760]  But we are joined for the next 25 minutes by Professor Margaret McMillan from Oxford.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.760]  I'm going to be out of Oxford in the middle of March doing a keynote speech.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760]  I look forward to doing that.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.760]  I always wanted to go to Oxford, honored to do that.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.760]  And she has margaretmcmillan.com.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:04.760]  She's a prestigious professor and is the fifth warden of St. Anthony's College in 2007.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.760]  She was educated at the University of Toronto College in Oxford University.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.760]  She is a fellow, the Royal Society of Literature and a senior fellow at Massey College, University of Toronto.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.760]  And I'm not going to go over on the boards of Mosaic Institute, Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.760]  and the editorial boards of International History and First World War Studies.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.760]  She's an expert on the World War, First World War.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:33.760]  Professors' publications include Women of the Raja and Well as Peacemakers, the Paris Conference in 1919.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.760]  And it's an attempt to make peace for which she won many awards.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.760]  I'm not going to go over the rest of her letters and all the work she's done.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.760]  Her most recent book is The War That Ended Peace, How Europe's Abandoned Peace from the First World War.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.760]  I guess that goes into her size. I haven't read it.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.760]  She comments frequently in the media and she joins us now, margaretmcmillan.com.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.760]  Thank you so much for coming on, Professor.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.760]  And I want to get into the report I saw at the London Independent.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760]  Is it 1914 all over again?
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.760]  We are in danger of repeating the mistakes that started World War I,
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.760]  which is a leading historian.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.760]  So thanks for coming on and tell us about the parallels and your concern.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.760]  Well, there's some things that concern me.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.760]  I don't think history ever repeats itself.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.760]  I think we get similarities, but the conditions are so different.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.760]  I mean, the 21st century is very different from 100 years ago.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.760]  But I think what is concerning is we seem to have nationalist rivalries between countries.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.760]  You have a rivalry developing, as you were mentioning earlier on, in the South China seas,
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.760]  which has the potential for sparking off further tensions and conflicts.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.760]  You have international ideologies.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.760]  In the years before 1914, there were international ideologies of anarchists, for example.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.760]  Today, you have international ideologies of religious ideologies or ultra-religious ideologies.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.760]  So I think we live in a slightly turbulent time.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  We have globalization.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.760]  Both ages are very globalized, and I think you have people worried about the impact of globalization,
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.760]  perhaps turning to their homes and feeling rather defensive.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760]  So I think that there are similarities.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.760]  I mean, I don't think we're bound to end up in the same way they did in 1914,
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.760]  but you always have to be careful.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:22.760]  I forget the exact quote, but basically history doesn't repeat, but it kind of rhymes.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.760]  Who wasn't said that?
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  Mark Twain.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:31.760]  And humans act the same, even though we have almost god-like weapons and technology now.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.760]  It would be god-like to the ancients, professor.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:42.760]  But if you look at global crises, currency devaluations, armies lining up on borders,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.760]  groups not compromising, really, I see the West driving conflict,
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.760]  and I'm obviously not a fan of what Russia and China do.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.760]  I'm an American, and I'm a Westerner.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:03.760]  But at the same time, I really see the West as filling the shoes of the villain in many respects
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760]  compared to our position in the past.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.760]  What's your take on that?
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.760]  Well, I think human nature doesn't really change that much.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.760]  I mean, I think we like to think we're a lot more sophisticated than the caveman.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.760]  I'm not sure we are.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.760]  I mean, I think we're still driven, at least in part, by emotions and fears.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.760]  And I think what's really dangerous is when people lack, or nations lack,
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.760]  the ability to see things from the other person's point of view.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:29.760]  And so what nations do to defend themselves, and what we do to defend ourselves as individuals,
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.760]  we may think we're just being defensive, we're just looking out for ourselves,
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.760]  but that may really look like aggression from the other side.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.760]  And I think that's when it gets dangerous, when you fail to understand what the other person might be thinking.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.760]  And I think what's also dangerous, and you see it with individuals and you see it with nations again,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.760]  is when their pride gets involved and when their prestige gets involved.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.760]  I mean, I think an analogy is the members of gangs who, to me, rather like knights in the Middle Ages,
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]  they'd rather die than be dishonored.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.760]  And so I think this is a perennial strain in human nature.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.760]  Now, we've got a small, sensible side.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.760]  I think we've got a more reasonable side, and we've got a side where we do reach out,
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.760]  we do try and understand each other.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.760]  So I never like to think that history is going to repeat itself,
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.760]  but I think we should be careful about being too complacent.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.760]  History doesn't repeat.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  It does rhyme.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.760]  And I think that is true as Mark Twain said it.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760]  I mean, here's the issue.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.760]  You look at the moral authority of the United States or England or many European countries.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  Look at France in the disheveled nature that it's going into from what I've been seeing and traveling and witnessing.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.760]  And there is, I see a cyclical, and of course there are cycles within cycles,
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.760]  and I'd like you to speak to that professor as you're an expert on that.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.760]  I do see it going into a very sick bottom of the cycle.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.760]  All the same indicators, the decadence, the debt, the corruption,
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:57.760]  the almost laissez-faire attitude of dictatorial government corporations, the power grabbing,
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.760]  and as the establishment senses that it makes basically everyone become even more feverish,
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:10.760]  including myself, adding to almost the same electrical hysteria that you see in mass movements
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  of almost like rats overpopulated in the sewers killing each other.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.760]  I mean, I'm just kind of throwing a stalt out there.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  What's your take on what I'm saying?
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.760]  Well, it's a pretty gloomy picture you have, and I hope it's not all true.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.760]  But I think there are things we need to look out for in our own societies.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.760]  I mean, I don't worry about government debt so much because government debt,
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.760]  if it's going into building infrastructure, I think it's actually positively a good thing,
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.760]  just like we've borrowed it by houses through mortgages.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.760]  What I think is worrying, and I think it's affecting a lot of Western societies,
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.760]  is the growing gap between the very rich and the very poor and the way the middle class is getting squeezed out.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  And that isn't good for society.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760]  It leads to tensions.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.760]  It leads to a lack of links between the different groups in societies.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:58.760]  And I think you don't want a society in which very few people at the top control a great deal of the resources of that society
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.760]  and are able to live in a way which insulates them from the problems of society
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:09.760]  and that means they're probably going to have less understanding and less empathy for those who are less fortunate than themselves.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.760]  Separately, what other historical trends are you seeing?
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.760]  And then flesh out if you can some of the parallels that they were reporting on that you've seen,
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:26.760]  I guess, would it be geopolitically the parallels with 1914 and 2014?
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  Well, one that a lot of people have talked about, including me, and I don't know if we're right.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.760]  The thing about talking about the present is you're usually much too close to it to get a very good view of it.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.760]  But it seems to me you do have tensions in the world internationally now
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:46.760]  because you have what had been a dominant power no longer as dominant as it was.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.760]  It doesn't mean it's that much weaker, but it's no longer quite as dominant as it was.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.760]  Before 1914, that was the British Empire, which was the world's biggest empire,
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.760]  the biggest empire the world has ever seen.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.760]  It was hugely powerful, had the world's biggest navy, had the world's biggest manufacturing power,
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.760]  but that was now being challenged, and you had a Britain and its empire that was very conscious
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.760]  that it was beginning to slip a bit, that it had competitors like the United States and Germany and Japan.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.760]  And it seems to me today that you have the United States, which for much of the Cold War
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.760]  and certainly after the Cold War was overwhelmingly the most important and powerful country in the world.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.760]  It's no longer perhaps quite as powerful as it was, and that can lead to tension
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:31.760]  and nations that feel themselves to be slipping a little bit may react in ways that aren't always predictable,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.760]  and nations that sort of feel that they haven't yet got their share in the sun can be aggressive and not very tactful.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.760]  I mean, Germany was not tactful before the First World War.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.760]  It was sort of pushing its way into the world order and throwing its weight around.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.760]  And I would say that China's not being particularly tactful today.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.760]  And so it doesn't make for an easy international situation managing these shifts,
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.760]  often very subtle shifts in the international order.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.760]  Exactly. I mean, China's not being tactful when they basically say,
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.760]  you know, prepare the nuclear weapons for war with the United States.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.760]  That is a brazen escalation and quite frankly frightening.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:15.760]  Well, it seems to me very foolish of the Chinese because, you know, I mean, some of the rhetoric is coming.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.760]  I mean, I don't think Chinese foreign policy is necessarily guided by a single sort of central agency
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:26.760]  because you'll get the priority saying one thing, you'll get the military saying another thing.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.760]  You now gather Chinese public opinion, which is beginning to play a role.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  But it does seem to me that the Chinese are very silly, in my view, to talk in a particularly belligerent way
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.760]  because they haven't yet got the capacity to back up those belligerent statements.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.760]  And what they will do as so often happens is they may well create a coalition against them.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.760]  I mean, they're not doing a lot to get on with their neighbors at the moment.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.760]  And, you know, they need those neighbors.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.760]  I mean, they may disapprove of a lot of what the Japanese do.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.760]  But in the end, the Chinese, I think, are better off living in a world in which they get on with their neighbors
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760]  rather than having all those neighbors furious at them.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.760]  Well, sure. And as you know, there's the enmity because of the Japanese invasion of China
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.760]  and a million debt or whatever the number is.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:12.760]  And so I know I've seen the numbers that the Chinese, on average, I think would like a war with Japan
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:16.760]  when it's not even the same people that did this to them 70 years ago.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:21.760]  And so I see that as obviously where the big war could kick off.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.760]  Well, I think it's a danger. But I mean, I think the Chinese leadership, and let's hope they have a sense to see this,
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.760]  would not gain by war with Japan.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.760]  I mean, both countries would suffer horribly because one thing, as you mentioned earlier,
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.760]  that has changed since 100 years ago is that the weapons are an awful lot more powerful
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.760]  and the capacity to do real damage is that much greater.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.760]  So, you know, you would end up with a war if you had one in which really neither side would win.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.760]  And in fact, that's what happened to the First World War.
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:53.760]  I mean, if you look at the end of the First World War, I mean, even the winning side had spent down their resources.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760]  Wow.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.760]  Professor, we've got to go to break. We have one more short segment with you.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:15.760]  I want to ask you what you think is most important to talk about when you come back.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:30.760]  Have you heard this?
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.760]  Do you know about the NSA loophole?
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.760]  Or maybe you think your law-abiding ways are too boring for them to care about you.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:47.760]  Tell that to the Virginia farmer who was audited by the IRS because of her Tea Party activities or the Texas man who woke up to a SWAT team raid because of online comments he had made about his gun collection.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.760]  No, God-fearing Americans like you are in the crosshairs.

[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:16.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:32.760]  It's not just the deindustrialization of globalism. The race at the bottom that Ross Perot talked about in 1993 when he warned of maps and gat. It's that the West is losing its moral authority, especially the United States with the torture and the NSA and getting caught lying and the derivatives.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:50.760]  The problem is all these other countries have the same types of elites in them from my research, and so it just keeps historically, and I don't have a degree in history, but I do love reading history books, and it's just to me as a lay person that likes history.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:25:05.760]  Man, I see so many parallels just everywhere, and most analysts, Pentagon, colonels, generals we have on, retired, current, the think tanks, the British think tanks, the British Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon, they're all saying the same things that I'm basically saying.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:17.760]  I'm not trying to put a bleak view on it. I want us to look at how it could be bleak if we don't do something. Let me ask you that, Professor, in the six minutes we've got left, other topics that you'd like to put forward.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:34.760]  What's front and center in your mind, because you are a very intelligent person who's tracked a lot of trends, but what's your comment on what I just said, and what's the essence of what you think people should know out there, that if we don't know history, then we tend to repeat the same human mistakes?
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:49.760]  You do paint a pretty bleak picture, and I'm not trying to disagree with you completely. I think history is not going to teach us very clear lessons about the future. It's not going to say, do this and all will be okay, but what history can do is give you a greater understanding of what can go wrong.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:58.760]  I think it gives you a greater understanding of other people. If you don't understand the history of other people, you're not going to understand a lot about them, and it also gives you a greater understanding of yourself.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:06.760]  I think we tend to deceive ourselves and think we've always been nice guys or whatever, and I think we need to look at our histories in the round.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:18.760]  What I think history can do, and other things do it as well, like sociology and psychology, they help you to understand human beings better, help us to understand ourselves better, and I think history can offer at least warnings.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:29.760]  It's like seeing a sign on a road that, be careful, this road is slippery in winter. What history can do is say, look, if you invade someone else's country, you're likely to run into trouble if they don't want you there.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:40.760]  This may seem a very simple lesson, or what history can say is, if you don't try and understand the perspective of the other person, you're probably going to behave in ways that frighten them, alienate them, make them want to do stupid things.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:49.760]  So I think history can help us to understand how to act in a complicated world, but I think we have got to rely on ourselves to think intelligently about the world.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  We can't rely on anyone providing us with lessons. We've got to keep thinking. We can't just relax and say, well, our leader's no best.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.760]  I mean, I think we've all got to take responsibility as citizens to try to understand the world we live in.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:11.760]  Looking at the different areas of the world that are in increased conflict and tension, what are the big hotspots for you, Professor?
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  Well, the hotspots, I mean, I think East Asia is a potential hotspot. I think the Middle East remains a hotspot because areas of the world where you have local divisions and rivalries are troublesome for the people who live there in themselves.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:33.760]  But they also, if they are geographically in the wrong places, run the risk of drawing outside powers in.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:45.760]  And so what makes East Asia the South China Sea potentially perilous and what makes the Middle East potentially perilous is not just the local conflict there, but the potential they have to draw in other great powers.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:28:02.760]  Well, I see Russia trying to reorganize itself as a great opportunity if the West would actually try to collaborate with them, but instead they see Russia as weak, obviously, so they're sending in the destabilization forces into Kiev, in the Ukraine.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:08.760]  And obviously, I don't want the Ukraine to join back with Russia again, but they don't want to be part of the collapsing EU.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:15.760]  And so then the CIA's there trying to destabilize it. I mean, they're on record doing that.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.760]  And of course, the Russians are getting angry. It just seems like a real lost opportunity.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.760]  I think generally in the West we've mishandled Russia since the end of the Cold War.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760]  I mean, Russia is an old country, very strong sense of itself.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.760]  Russians are proud people. And when they lost the Cold War, which they clearly did, we treated them with contempt.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.760]  We treated them like, you know, people who didn't know what they were doing.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.760]  And I think you have a great sense of resentment in Russia. And I think you see that in Putin's behavior today.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:49.760]  He's trying to reassert Russia on the world stage and show that Russia can't be pushed around.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  And I think we lost an opportunity there. And I think we're now going to have to deal with a much more aggressive Russia.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.760]  I don't think aggressive militarily, but it's going to be asserting itself a lot more in the world stage.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.760]  It's already asserting itself in the Middle East, in the Caucasus, in Ukraine, in Belarus.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.760]  And I think we're going to see a Russia that's more prepared to sort of really play a part in the world.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:17.760]  It's unbelievable. And it's because the weapons manufacturers want to continue selling weapons until they basically kill us all.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.760]  And it's just a real crisis. Well, I hope sometime you'll come back on with us and talk about Russia.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.760]  And people can find out more about your great books and more at MargaretMcMillan.com.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.760]  Thank you so much, Professor.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.760]  Well, thank you. It was a pleasure talking to you.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.760]  Pleasure talking to you. Really neat lady. I'm going to read some of her books.

[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.760]  Well, I'm going to come back and give the number out, but I'm going to really try to go to your calls.

[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:15.760]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:21.760]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.

[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:17.760]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas Farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.760]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:10.760]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:20.760]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:29.760]  Our mission, wage war on corruption, the crash of the lives, and disinformation.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:37.760]  We see the Earth orbiting through deep space on the edge of the Milky Way galaxy.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:53.760]  In the night sky, we stare into the galaxy, edge on, towards the core, floating through the cosmos with trillions of other galaxies, expanding out forever.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:34:00.760]  In a river of infinity, flowing forward and backwards.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:14.760]  And the average person is obsessed because the media tells us to be with Justin Bieber's diaper pants.
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:18.760]  Justin Bieber's diaper pants.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:25.760]  The secret of the universe is the contents of the diaper pants.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:35.760]  And the question to be or not to be whether it is nobler. Will you guys print me that? Thanks.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.760]  It's Macbeth.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:48.760]  Whether it is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:55.760]  I was thinking about my grandfather again this morning and how interesting he was and how much I wish I could talk to him.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.760]  My mom's dad, my other grandfather was great too.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.760]  And what a dreamer he was.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:18.760]  He was the type of guy that when my mother was like 6 or 7 and her brother was 11 going from memory, took them to an academic talk in a stadium seating classroom, a lecture hall.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.760]  Not a main UT speech, but an actual rocket science meeting with all these scientists.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:45.760]  And he pulled strings to get my mother and she was I think 6 or 7 in a little dress and my uncle to sit there and listen to a two hour dissertation on the future of space exploration by Werner von Braun, the Nazi, the founder of NASA.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:36:00.760]  And I think about kids today. They're watching My Little Pony and their dreams are to someday meet the magic people that are on television because those are the people, those are their friends.
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:08.760]  They don't have real friends. They have friends on friends. They have friends on cheers. They have imaginary friends.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:18.760]  And of course, they don't think they've ever made it or going to be anybody because they can't obtain, unobtain them.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:41.760]  They cannot obtain this magical elixir that is that is flowing out of the open wound, stinking scrawfulous wound of the New World Order.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:56.760]  I mean, that's mind control. And I was just thinking about how people are not taught to like history. They're not taught to like anything except scum.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:05.760]  And I think about how much of that I've not even shaken off. It's just unbelievable.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:17.760]  It really is unbelievable. I don't know what's going to happen to us, folks. I just know that the road we're going down is bad.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:28.760]  I went off the road. We've got to get off this road together. We went out of this. We're going to have to work together.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:35.760]  So that's a very simple statement. But I mean, what do we do? That's the question we've been taught to infight.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.760]  We've been taught to be mentally ill. We've been taught to be screwed up from birth.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:53.760]  And you're now seeing it get worse and the next download of disinfo coming in and the next phase of human destruction.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:58.760]  Hold on to your hat. That's all I can say.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:08.760]  Here's an article yesterday I never got to from infowars.com. In the most popular section, Utah police obtained grenade launchers, riot gear from the feds, giant armored vehicles.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:15.760]  Even small towns with the fewest 10 deputies are getting actual war wagons.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:28.760]  And they are training, ladies and gentlemen, nationwide to take on gun owners in a collapse. And you know what that tells you? Just like Katrina, it'll be guns that cause stabilization in areas.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:38.760]  Every study in common sense shows that. But you better bet your bottom dollar that after they've starved us out, if they go with that plan, that's one of the plans on the table on record.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:45.760]  If they go with a siege program, a fast siege program, not a slow siege that we're already under under 1021 being deindustrialized.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:55.760]  In this globalist deal where they claimed, oh, we'll transfer everything to China and India and the third world to bring them up so that we all have world peace.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:03.760]  But instead they shut us down and then brought the industry there at a level so low that it actually brings those populations down even further.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:09.760]  As a plan, and there's just public about it. Yeah, humans are scum. We want to make you poor. Oh, yay.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:25.760]  I'll go to Whole Foods. They've got all the magazines there about how cool it is to be poor and how cool it is to, you know, the new hobo line of clothing.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:34.760]  And it's a diseased system. It's a diseased brains have come up with this stuff.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:44.760]  Because you look at it and the dark logic of it, it is a permutation of failure.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:40:00.760]  And it's a hate letter to humanity by the social engineers that they would want to swim in an ocean of betrayal and dehumanization.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.760]  That's all I can really say on that front.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:14.760]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231. And all I ask is because when I direct folks on the topic, we get great callers.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:22.760]  When I say it's open-lined, free-for-all, it's a disaster, a train wreck. People that sound like they've been drinking cop syrup all day calling into the broadcast.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:30.760]  And I guess that's the nature of freedom that if it's just wide open and people don't tend to appreciate it, but then if people have to fight for freedom, they then do appreciate it.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:39.760]  You get an age of virtue. Instead of an age of what we're seeing now, the toll-free number to join us.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:51.760]  We'll see if today's different on any topic you wish. Any questions or comments you have is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.760]  And we will get you up and on the air here on this Thursday edition.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:10.760]  And I think I'm going to twist his arm tomorrow. My cousin, Buckley Hammond, my late uncle's son, good friend of mine, he's down here visiting, down here visiting family.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.760]  I think we will see our grandmother today. That's a good idea.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:23.760]  You know, I've not seen my grandmother since my uncle died, her son died, and I have not gone over there because I do not want to see the pain in her eyes.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:28.760]  And it's another form of cowardice, but I'm going to get over there tomorrow.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:36.760]  My friends, I've got so much work to do. There's always more work, always more to do, and you can hear I'm very tired today.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:42.760]  I was not going to do the show today, as I told you, because I was up way too late and had bad allergies today, but I'm here.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:51.760]  But if I kind of just go off reservation here, that's why 800-259-9231.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.760]  Let's just do this. Let me just read you some of the headlines here.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:03.760]  Let me do this while the calls are coming in. Let me read you about the Pied Piper of Hamlin.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.760]  Is that how you pronounce that?
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.760]  And of course, do you know the story of the Pied Piper?
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:15.760]  Because that's what Hollywood is, and that's what Al-Qaeda is.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:23.760]  The rats are Al-Qaeda, and then you call in the Pied Piper because he can get rid of the rats for you.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  But the next time he comes and plays his flute, your children all leave with him, your whole future and everything you got.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:35.760]  And look at our culture. Our children are run by the state and the media, and we are not even human anymore.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.760]  We've lost our individualism. We have been overwritten.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:47.760]  And Al-Qaeda is the rats, and the Pied Piper is the global corporates that run them.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.760]  And again, we come and hire him to get the rats out.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:58.760]  But of course, we give up our children, the most precious thing in the world to us that we'd give our lives for.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:02.760]  But you know, the town doesn't even want to say that's wrong because they were complicit in it.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:10.760]  And so, you know, it's the right thing to do to let him have all our children, isn't it? The TSA and the NSA and the torture and all this bull folks.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.760]  All of it's a lie. And we all know that.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:19.760]  So why do we take part in it? You know, we need to throw the Pied Piper in the river.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.760]  You know, a guy running for the legislature in Florida said that Obama's a traitor and should be hung.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:30.760]  The Secret Service came out to him. And I don't think Obama should be hung because he's not the guy to be hung here.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.760]  He is a front man. But I think the system should be hung.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.760]  We should throw the system in the river collectively.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:46.760]  Florida GOP candidate Bucks Party calls for withdrawal after deplorable Obama comment.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.760]  Well, I mean, it's not deplorable.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:58.760]  From a man who doesn't understand the full thing but has enough honor to have the courage to say, according to common law and common sense, absolutely.
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:06.760]  I mean, if justice was served through due process, you would have thousands of people swinging from the end of ropes in this country.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:12.760]  Everybody knows that. That's why everybody's freaking out about it, like Ted Cruz calling Obama dangerous and frightening.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.760]  That's true. I mean, you've got to call it what it is.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:24.760]  But it's easy now to sit there and go, oh, this guy, he's bad. No, he's not.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:28.760]  From his perspective, what he said is true.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:34.760]  But you can't, you can't get to bring Obama down politically.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.760]  And then these guys have the nuclear weapons. You think if we try to actually arrest all these people, you know what they're going to do?
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.760]  They're going to set off nukes and say the Russians did it or the Patriots did it or working with Al Qaeda.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:48.760]  I mean, let me tell you something. You've got to have an awakening to these criminals to stop them.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:55.760]  You've got to know their system and their game and not participate in the rigged poker game with cards up their sleeves.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.760]  I mean, they don't even hide the cards. They got like eight decks of cards. You're playing.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.760]  Let me, let me get some, let me get the ace of spades to beat you. I got five of them here.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.760]  I mean, it's, it's, I got, I got three royal flushes here. I mean, it's, it's a game.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:14.760]  Don't sit down at the table.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.760]  It's a bad, don't go to the casino, folks, unless you know you're going to blow money and you think that's fine.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:26.760]  You're not going to go get rich there. It's a Pied Piper.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:32.760]  Now continuing the Pied Piper.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.760]  German.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:35.760]  Ratten.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:36.760]  Banger.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:38.760]  Von Hamlin.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.760]  The rat catcher of Hamlin.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:47.760]  Is the subject of a legend concerning the departure or death of a great number of children from the town of Hamlin.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:50.760]  Lower Saxony, Germany in the Middle Ages.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:46:01.760]  The earliest references describe a Piper dressed in a multicolored clothing, leading the children away from the town never to return.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  In the 16th century, the story was expanded into a full narrative in which the Piper is a rat catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe.
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:25.760]  When the citizenry refuses to pay for the service, he retaliates by turning his power that he put into his instrument on the children, leading them away.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:29.760]  Leading them away as he had the rats.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:36.760]  This vision of the story and this version spread as folklore.
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:43.760]  This version has also appeared in the writings of, amongst others, John Wolfgang von Goethe.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.760]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.760]  Goethe and the brothers Grimm and Robert Browning.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.760]  Robert Browning.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:59.760]  Didn't he write, Roland to the dark tower came?
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.760]  See, I've come to my dark tower.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  I realized that I have, in 2013 and now in 2014, I have come to the dark tower.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.760]  I am now in the dark tower.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.760]  Think about that.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.760]  Child Roland to the dark tower came.
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:23.760]  Child Roland to the dark tower came.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.760]  His word was still, thigh, tooth, and thumb.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.760]  I smell the blood of a British man, King Lear.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.760]  Act three, scene three.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.760]  That was the inspiration.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.760]  Hey, print me that poem.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.760]  And what was the other one I wanted earlier?
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.760]  What was the other one?
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:59.760]  And just the Shakespeare Hamlet part about, and when they dig up the skull of his teacher.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:07.760]  To be or not to be is the famous opening phrase of a siliqui in the nunnery scene of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:15.760]  In the speech, a despondent or painting, Prince Hamlet contemplates death and suicide.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.760]  He bemoans the pains and unfairness of life, but acknowledges the alternative might still be worse.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:32.760]  The speech functions within the play to explain Hamlet's hesitation to directly and immediately revenge his father's murder.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:39.760]  He discovered an act one on his uncle's stepfather and new king.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.760]  Claudius and his minister.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.760]  They're eavesdropping his speech.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:51.760]  Dashes hopes that Hamlet was suffering from neglected love.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.760]  And it goes on from there.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.760]  All right, I'll shut up and go to your phone calls.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Evan in Georgia.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.760]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.760]  Hey, Alex.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.760]  Hey, buddy.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.760]  Talking to you from FEMA region four.
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.760]  Oh, isn't that great to be under a FEMA region?
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  They're good people, though. I mean, the government's good. It's good people.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.760]  Well, it's cold here.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:19.760]  Yeah, global warming. It's really killing a lot of people or freezing to death.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.760]  Didn't pay all gore enough money, buddy.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:24.760]  That's right. Well, I told him the check was in the mail.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.760]  Good. Well, he'll fix it then.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.760]  There you go.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:34.760]  A couple of weeks ago, I heard you talking to a lady about she lost her kids to CPA.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:35.760]  CPS.
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.760]  CPS, whatever you want.
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:41.760]  And I was wondering if I could get that phone number because my friend,
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.760]  he lost his kids to the same people.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:49.760]  And he's been in jail for eight months now without a trial because they took his kids.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:53.760]  The judge wouldn't let him even talk to him to say goodbye.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.760]  And he got sort of upset and started yelling at the judge.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.760]  Oh, yeah. That's how it works.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:02.760]  Normal behavior, then they put you in the system.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.760]  Exactly.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.760]  That's why you've got to be completely calm and cunning with this enemy.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:11.760]  Yeah, well, you know, he hadn't seen his kids in a year,
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.760]  and then he went for, you know, another hearing,
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.760]  and then they wouldn't even let him.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.760]  He just wanted to talk to them, you know?
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.760]  Well, that's criminal right there.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.760]  I mean, listen, the Pied Piper got the kids.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.760]  You say you want that number. There's different groups that the homeschool,
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.760]  you know, defense groups, there's a lot of different associations that fight
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  because homeschoolers are somewhat organized.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.760]  But what number are you talking about?
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.760]  You said you told the lady to hold on.
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.760]  I can give you a telephone number of a lawyer that could probably help you
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.760]  because the lawyer that he has is useful.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.760]  You know, I was saying, go dig up the homeschool legal defense groups
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.760]  and try to give her that information.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760]  I don't have that in Toronto.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.760]  I don't have a Rolodex, but you can do research on groups that fight the CPS
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:21.760]  and every authoritarian regime kidnaps children.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.760]  That's I-N-F-I-D-E-L Body Armor dot com.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:57.760]  The CIG e-cigarettes.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:26.760]  Kick some ass.

[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.760]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television,
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.760]  they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.760]  The new, brighter, fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.

[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:23.760]  For a man to march as a child and at the end become a man,
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:33.760]  to enter the dark tower and to then be amongst all the other men that came before,
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  to stand in that knowledge of being a man.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:43.760]  I have only just become a man.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.760]  I realize that.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.760]  And so many men out there never do become men.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.760]  That's a very sad thing.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  That is the main goal of the enemy, is that you never develop.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:07.760]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls, but I did get the Shakespeare text here.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.760]  You guys also print me.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.760]  Is it Mark Anthony's speech in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:30.760]  Just type in Mark Anthony's speech in Julius Caesar's Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.760]  That's a really good speech.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:35.760]  I love the Charlton Heston rendition of that.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:38.760]  Here's the modern version text.
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:40.760]  To be or not to be, that is the question.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.760]  Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows about rageous fortune
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.760]  or to take up arms against the sea of troubles
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:53.760]  and by opposing in them to die to sleep no more
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:58.760]  and by a sleep to say we end the heartache
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:07.760]  and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.760]  Man, that's power.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:14.760]  That's everything right there.
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:18.760]  Of course you want to take up arms against the sea of troubles.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  That is the great contest.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  Let's talk to Carl in Washington.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:22.760]  You're on the air.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.760]  Go ahead.
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:25.760]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760]  Hey, buddy.
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.760]  Am I coming through okay?
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:29.760]  Yes, you are.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.760]  Okay.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  I just wanted to make a couple of comments.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:45.760]  I was watching Adam Kochach yesterday and he spoke with speaking about going to the happy place and inside and all of this.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.760]  And I don't know, it reminded me.
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:48.760]  I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:53.760]  It reminded me of the flower power in the 60s.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.760]  And I just don't agree with that thought.
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:01.760]  I understand self-control.
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:07.760]  But I think there's a time just like this lady you had on today already.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:14.760]  I just think that there's a certain point where that's almost denial of what's going on around you.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  And one of the other comments I wanted to make was he was talking about how to take back the United States and by returning the power to the state.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:38.760]  I'm sitting here wondering why Shirley's watching because I don't know what percentage it is, but there's several states I know that are almost as bad as the federal government is.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:45.760]  But you see, you want to create a multipolar power base to divide the establishment.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:52.760]  So you want the establishment divided so you can't get a centralization, which always turns into a tyranny, you have a separation of powers.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.760]  So that's the function.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:58:04.760]  I think Tennessee is about to pass a bill or is looking to pass a bill that will make it illegal to give aid and comfort to the NSA.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:06.760]  Well, you're supposed to do that.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:11.760]  I mean, that's how you cut it off is you say it's illegal to give power or electricity to these people.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:12.760]  They're committing crimes.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:13.760]  It's on record.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:14.760]  It's criminal.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:16.760]  Violates the law on its face.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.760]  And so you turn their power off.
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.760]  And I'm proud of Tennessee.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.760]  And Texas could be doing that as well.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.760]  But we need to believe me.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.760]  I hear what you're saying, brother.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.760]  And but I mean, what do you think we need to do then?
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.760]  I think we're, I don't like what we need to do.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.760]  But I think we need to.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.760]  Hold on.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760]  I'm going to come back to you in one minute.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:42.760]  Other people.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:50.760]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:57.760]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:01.760]  a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:04.760]  Fluoride.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:06.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:12.760]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.760]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:23.760]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.760]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:32.760]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:37.760]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:42.760]  InfowarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:50.760]  I take it every day that's InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:17.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:22.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:36.760]  They've got all these congressional boards and think tanks coming out in the news saying,
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:43.760]  our findings are it is completely illegal to have random NSA spy grids that violate the Fourth Amendment.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:48.760]  Our findings are you need oxygen to live.
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.760]  I've got those articles.
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:53.760]  Board declares NSA data sweep illegal.
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:56.760]  Fox News says programs should be ended.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:00.760]  The bulk telephone records program lacks a visible legal foundation.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:06.760]  The board's report said adding that it raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:12.760]  Obama is a constitutional lawyer.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:19.760]  Just as a surgeon is an expert at making you stay alive, a surgeon can also be an expert at killing you.
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:25.760]  And then making it all look like it was just a regular happy-go-lucky procedure.
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:35.760]  All bound up in an ass little package.
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:37.760]  We are broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:38.760]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.760]  I'm going to go right back to your phone calls.
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:45.760]  And back to the caller who was, I guess, saying we need to have violence or something.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:47.760]  That's a very big topic.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:53.760]  We should have a whole discussion maybe tomorrow or on the Sunday show about is there ever a time for violence against government.
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.760]  Declaration of Independence says it's not a right.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.760]  It's a duty.
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:06.760]  The thing is just because we have the right to do that at this point, you have to understand they're going to manipulate that into a scenario that's going to cause a civil war.
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:13.760]  And things may get so bad that we have no other choice because the other alternatives are so horrible.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.760]  It's like the French resistance.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:27.760]  We've already been overrun and captured, and if we politically wake up and just withdraw consent and don't collaborate, the enemy will fade like phantoms at dawn, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:32.760]  The tyranny will leave like phantoms at dawn.
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.760]  But these myths will not leave until we bring a lot of liberty back.
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:38.760]  It's real simple.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.760]  And we have to be those lights in the world so people can see what's going on.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.760]  Everybody knows we're going into very serious darkness here.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.760]  And we need to reverse that as quickly as possible.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:03:01.760]  We're just stating the obvious here, like a ghost dance, trying to resurrect basic checks and balances that have been eroded for a long time.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:16.760]  And the establishment knows that if they can convert things over to tyranny and even have a debate about it and just kind of flaunt it in our face that they won.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:24.760]  And it's really that simple where Obama and the government is just parading around doing whatever they want, having debates about it, and then just going on about their business.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:31.760]  So we're going to go to Jay and Greg and James and Felix after Bob Barleys is coming up about 25 minutes.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.760]  If you folks want to hold, I will get to you.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:34.760]  I want to hear from Felix.
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:37.760]  It says FEMA Inspections for Homes and other callers.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:41.760]  It says FEMA Region 3 issues, James and Jay wants to talk about surveillance cameras.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:43.760]  Greg wants to talk about armored vehicles in Utah.
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.760]  He's a KYAH 540 AM listener.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.760]  We're going to get to everybody.
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:55.760]  But the caller, Carl, finishing up with you.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.760]  We have one minute.
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:57.760]  What do you think we should do?
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:12.760]  Because the issue is any type of offensive violence will just be misdirected and will just let the enemy come down on us in their time instead of letting them play out their operation where they're losing credibility and we're winning hearts and minds every day.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:13.760]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.760]  Yeah, I do.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:18.760]  I do understand that and I'm of the same mind.
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  I'm just, you know, I grew up a little bit like I heard you talk about and there's certain people that mindset-wise the only way that they get it is when you knock them on their butt.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:44.760]  And I think some of these cycle paths or social paths, whatever you call them, I don't think that they're willing to leave.
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:45.760]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:56.760]  Listen, listen, the Secretary of State John Kerry and people like him should go to prison or more for openly arming al-Qaeda with service to air missiles and blowing up churches.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:58.760]  I mean, they've aided and abetted it.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.760]  Mass murder.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:05.760]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:13.760]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:15.760]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:17.760]  We are what we eat.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.760]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:25.760]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:28.760]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:34.760]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:44.760]  To learn more, visit infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to big pharma.

[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:09.760]  The facts are in. The studies are legion. Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:13.760]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:18.760]  Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:24.760]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:30.760]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:41.760]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:45.760]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:17.760]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:29.760]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:36.760]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:43.760]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:51.760]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:08:00.760]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:20.760]  Music playing.
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:38.760]  Music playing.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:53.760]  You know I'm excited because former congressman Bob Barb is running for congress again and that's very very exciting bar congress.com. Maybe he can go in there and bar them pun intended from totally overthrowing the republic.
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:09:08.760]  This is a guy who decades ago was a leading voice and has continued to be one warning of growing tyranny and he's got Liberty Guard trying to restrict and bar what the TSA has been up to and all those outrageous.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:15.760]  We see that picking up steam in congress right now to make them not bark orders and grab people's genitals and all the rest of it.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:24.760]  So there is an awakening going on and he's also been writing for town hall dealing with the NSA. Of course he was in the CIA as well.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:35.760]  And so that gives Bob Barb a unique perspective on really the ins and outs of government and how it works. His latest article is transparency through a glass darkly.
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:48.760]  And you know I knew that he was going to be running for for for congress again but I just it just like literally just hit me that he's running and we need to support him and get him in there and people say well he was in the CIA he must be bad.
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:58.760]  Ladies and gentlemen governments all compartmentalized and people in the military and people I know that have been in the CIA are some of the most patriotic informed hardworking people.
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:07.760]  It's that there's compartmentalized groups using national security covers to be able to carry out their own nefarious deeds that's why we need transparency.
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:13.760]  And that's why he's always been a leading light in transparency and only raised that because it's not even really ever a controversy.
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:21.760]  I just hear well he says a lot of good stuff but he's in the CIA he's helped get a lot of good legislation passed and it's helped block a lot of legislation.
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:32.760]  He's not a polling congress anymore. He was in Congress got out of Congress got back in Congress. We need to send Bob Barr back to Congress and I didn't mean to turn this into a campaign promotion here but it just hit me well I've got Bob Barr on him about to
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:40.760]  interrogate him about the NSA and all the stuff that's going on and you know get his take on it and how to turn it around and I'm not even going to mention he's running for Congress.
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:50.760]  So first off sir glad that you're throwing your hat back in the ring. I know it's a lot of work and but we really appreciate that and tell us about the campaign and what your goals are there in Georgia.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:59.760]  Thank you so much Alex that's a great pleasure and honor once again to be with you and your many many listeners across the land.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:07.760]  You know I was at a forum last night just outside of Atlanta where my district is and I was asked a question.
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:13.760]  You know you served in the Congress before you were President Reagan's U.S. Attorney you have background in the CIA.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:20.760]  You know you could just sort of retire and sit back and take it easy. Why are you getting back into the fray? Why are you running again for the Congress?
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:25.760]  And I said it's simple. I love this country too much not to get back into the arena.
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:34.760]  With what I see happening Alex you were there you mentioned a couple of the things just a few minutes ago that I was working on years and years ago when I was in the Congress
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:48.760]  to when we first started to learn about the abuses by NSA and the electronic surveillance the illegal stuff going on and what the FBI was doing through Project Carnivore and Project Echelon.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:59.760]  And it's even worse nowadays. The reason why it's so important for you to be continue to be out there to raise these issues both yourself and your many guests is because
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:09.760]  government is constantly and forever our founding fathers understood this looking for ways to increase its power at the expense of individual liberty.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.760]  And if you let up then it's just going to keep going and going and going.
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:26.760]  It's worse now than it was before and that's why I want to step in there and make sure that I do my part with whatever years the good Lord has left for me on this earth to reign in government power.
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:36.760]  It's almost to the point it's not to the point yet but it's almost to the point where it's going to be irreversible and I ain't going to sleep until I do everything I can to stop it.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:43.760]  Just following it in the news even though the media has been trying to ignore you or attack you both you got a good chance of winning.
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:51.760]  What do we do to help get you into Congress for our listeners because it doesn't matter if people don't live in Georgia they should be supporting you however they can.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:13:04.760]  Because I mean absolutely you came on this show in the late 90s and so many times dozens of times and it was always the NSA spying the FBI carnivore we got to pass a law we got to ban this we got to dismantle this it's dangerous.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:11.760]  Total tyranny they're going to use it to oppress the press they're going to use it to persecute political enemies this this is going to be the end of us.
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:27.760]  And really even more than Ron Paul on the subject of NSA and FBI legal surveillance you were there because obviously you understand it more than most members of Congress who are just lawyers or just doctors you know you've been inside secret operations and things you understand the dangers.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:36.760]  I mean explain to us as you've done before why basic freedom is based in having privacy and without privacy you have no freedom.
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:52.760]  Well very very good point and it's fundamentally important and to take one of your simpler points first the fact that the fact of the matter is we need people up there fighting for individual liberty and fighting against these encroach and encroachments by government
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:14:07.760]  power who have been there who know what government is doing I mean I learned as a an official with the CIA just one one hand how important it is that we have a foreign intelligence agency like the CIA.
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:15.760]  But how equally important it is to make sure that it is kept within bounds because it is so easy to have that power abused.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:32.760]  When it is secret similarly when I served as President Reagan's US Attorney in Atlanta I learned how important it is certainly to have good prosecutors to uphold their laws and protect the public but being on the inside excuse me.
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:47.760]  I also know just how powerful these agencies are and how easily those powers can be abused so I really am in any unique position in many ways to tackle these problems with regard to the privacy issue.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:15:03.760]  Basically what you were doing just a moment ago Alex and discussing how important it is to retain the right to privacy is quoting or paraphrasing iron Rand as you and I have discussed previously as iron Rand said in the fountain head toward the end of that great
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:22.760]  novel on individual freedom and individual power standing up to the government privacy is essential to civilization keeping men free from other men is the is the essence of privacy and the essence of civilization without privacy.
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:33.760]  You can have no freedom you have no civilization you live in a communal world where everything is controlled by the community both ideas money work product and so forth.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:52.760]  So maintaining the right to privacy as codified for example in the fourth amendment constitution that the government cannot invade your privacy by searching your personal records belongings things and homes is essential to freedom.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:16:11.760]  It's essential to liberty. Our founding fathers understood that they understood it long before I am ran wrote about it 150 years later in the in the 1940s and what has been happening since the days when I worked at the CIA back in the 1970s where we had a very clear
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:29.760]  demarcation line very clearly demarcated between domestic and international affairs. That line has been blurred to the point where in the minds of the NSA and these folks up there like Clapper and the Brennan and the others up there.
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:46.760]  It no longer exists. They think that as long as they say we're doing something in the name of national security as long as we're fighting terrorism than we can do whatever we want wherever we want to whoever we want and that is a philosophy that is a recipe for tyranny.
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:59.760]  Well it certainly is and then look at how they've used the NSA on Fox News, the Associated Press, how they've used the IRS to persecute tea party pro life groups. Now they're persecuting secret conservative Hollywood groups.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:13.760]  I mean this is beyond McCarthy times 10 and this is tyranny and we need to recognize it's already here. It was a Senator Ted Cruz that said that Obama is frightening that he's terrifying that he's dangerous.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:34.760]  The media tried to demonizing but that only backfired on him because the public understands the unitary executive that's been degenerating for a while. I'm not saying Obama's going to stay in office but they're turning the executive with the bureaucracy and the interest that run it into a 2.0 modern synthetic oligarchy or dictatorship.
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:54.760]  Those that control the presidency like a control panel, a dictatorial control panel and then the president's kind of a window hanging there. I mean do you agree with that analogy and at what point are we historically because I mean even Jonathan Turley said we're coming to the point other folks have said
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:06.760]  in Congress that the only option would be armed rebellion which obviously we don't want and the system set up for that and it would cause a civil war. So what do you do then and what point have we reached Congressman?
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:26.760]  What we do is first of all at least within my bailaway running for Congress we need to get people into Congress and demand that our folks in the Congress stand up for what Congress is supposed to stand up for. Congress is not a rubber stamp for a president despite what Harry Reid might think or what Nancy Pelosi might believe.
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:47.760]  Congress has to stand up to the president regardless of the political party of the president because they are protecting, they are in the vanguards, one of the protectors of our fundamental liberty and part of what Congress has an absolute responsibility to do and they time and time again in modern years have failed to do this
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:19:03.760]  and that is to stand up to presidents who basically slap Congress around and say I'm not going to do what the law says, I'm going to sign an executive order and do what I want, I'm not going to do what you the Congress have directed by lawfully passed legislation
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:21.760]  and Congress sits back and what do they do Alex they say thank you sir may we have another sir. Every time that happens we move further down the road toward consolidating absolute power in the presidency and weakening the fundamental pillars of our representative to democracy because
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:37.760]  Congress seeds power to the president when they do not stand up to the president sure that's the problem that we see over and over and over again and it happens under Republican presidents the same as Democratic presidents except this one is much worse.
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:56.760]  Now expanding on that Ted Cruz called him frightening and dangerous we just pulled up the Houston Chronicle article on that how would you describe Obama I mean what is the word for it because it doesn't matter if it's energy or guns or borders legalizing the illegals getting
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:10.760]  Obama here passed and saying he'll selectively enforce it and Congress says okay and he'll selectively just how was it with the NSA okay Congress passing the buck and then the state of Texas was about to pass a law unanimously in the house so they killed it in the senate
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:25.760]  two years ago as you know and then Obama said I will have F-16s this was in the news and wasn't even a big deal was just a footnote we will blockade aircraft and no aircraft will be allowed to fly in Texas I mean this is like the stuff that started the Civil War that's why I'm
[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:28.760]  going there I mean this is already getting crazy.
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:45.760]  It is no longer hypothetical when you have statements like that and when you have statements like the president issued the other day basically throwing down the gauntlet to the Congress saying I don't care what you do I have a pen I can order people to do what I want regardless of what
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:59.760]  Congress says regardless of what the laws of this country say and Congress just sits back and does nothing we the people have to rise up and demand that they do something get these guys out of office that are in there who just sit back
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:11.760]  sort of you know and sleepwalk through their terms in the Congress we need people that will fight and I'm not saying I'm the only one there are some other good folks up there and some good candidates around the country
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:25.760]  but whether it's whether you're talking about immigration law whether you're talking about national security in Benghazi whether you're talking about the fundamental right to privacy and allowing NSA to violate the Constitution and the laws of this land
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:39.760]  we need people up there that understand these issues and have the backbone as I've proven I did when I stood up to Bill Clinton and let the impeachment of that scoundrel a generation ago we need these people in the Congress and that's why I'm running
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:55.760]  and we've got Obama saying things like he's good at killing people I mean even the people I know that are army and Navy and you know special forces and Marines I mean the guy's no one even if he killed people with his bare hands you don't make statements like I'm good at killing people
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:22:16.760]  I think it shows a narcissistic really amateurism of Obama and it frightens me to think that these people are so into red carpets so into the jets so into the month long vacations to know that even if we had a corrupt elite if they weren't so reckless it wouldn't be as scary
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:29.760]  I mean I really have never been you know a big fan of the theory that it's a government incompetence theory but more and more you see the foreign policies uncoordinated it's crazy I mean funding al-Qaeda to attack Syria what's your take on that
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:48.760]  Well it's on the one hand one could be charitable as you uncharacteristically were just a moment ago and saying this is just amateurism what they're doing you could sort of chalk it up to well they just don't really understand the Middle East they don't understand the international affairs
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:23:05.760]  I mean after all this guy was nothing but a community organizer and a full constitutional law professor the fact of the matter is I think it goes deeper than that it goes deeper than simply their amateurs it's worse than they simply don't know what they're doing
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:22.760]  They have a world view that is 180 degrees at odds with what the vast majority of our citizens believe and understand and want to see in the world and that is in America that is strong that is the shining city on the hill that carries weight in whatever we do
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:42.760]  That is not does not have to count out to communist China because they have 1.3 trillion dollars of their debt in their pocket that they can hold over our head that's the sort of thing that costs us dearly even in non-economic terms as well because it reduces the flexibility
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:56.760]  And again that the options that are available to these states of America in dealing with these these foreign problems and crises as long as we remain a major debtor nation we will not carry the weight in the world that a Ronald Reagan did
[02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:15.760]  That's right and just to qualify what I was saying so it's clear obviously they're consciously cloud and pivot and domesticate the public centralize the power give favors to insiders pick winners and losers we know the big city mafia democratic party disease that's the worst out there the
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:33.760]  disease of the neocons is bad but I mean there's nothing worse than this this group who they're not even socialists like they claim they're just gangsters I'm saying there there's an amateurism that I see coming through in the recklessness of what they're doing sure they
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:50.760]  are a method of the madness I'm just seeing the playboy nature of it and I'm trying to quantify what I'm saying there's just something very creepy about a bunch of gangsters up there running the American Empire and very frightening
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:25:05.760]  It is frightening because they can not only waste the great legacy that we have in this country but the very continued existence of us as a major nation is at stake I mean it could not Alex be more serious
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:21.760]  and here again that's why it's so important for you to continue to be out there bringing this message why to follow up on a point you made earlier why it's so important for citizens and voters all across this land whatever state they live in whatever congressional
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:37.760]  district they're in to support my candidacy because you know just like there are members of Congress and candidates from other parts of the other parts of the country that I support I need the support of Americans from all over the country to go to
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:56.760]  Barconrist.com to help us out because the votes that I take the positions that I take will help Americans all across this great land similarly Ted Cruz I don't live in Texas my mom does but I support him even though I'm not in in his district in the state of Texas
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:12.760]  Exactly let me expand on how important this is folks Bob Barr said everything Ted Cruz is saying 15 years ago or 20 years ago and it's just that back then the dinosaur media was still dominant and so he could barely get on CNN you'll
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:32.760]  get on Fox sometimes show the message people weren't ready to hear this libertarian constitutional truly conservative common sense message and then Bob Barr was popular but just not iconic I'm telling you you get back in Congress now it'll be like having
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:47.760]  another Rand Paul another Ted Cruz but it's like bringing back you know Babe Ruth you know you know back to life basically don't don't don't get carried away I'm like in too much what you're saying there don't get carried away I mean
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:27:02.760]  no I'm serious you're gonna be and there was some some some outstanding Americans that we need to continue this no no but I mean you know Ron Paul exactly I'm just saying Ron Paul never got his due when he was there until the end and then he and then he
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:15.760]  became a rock star of Liberty that's what we need and I'm saying we need to get you back in Congress to be a major leader and and the zeitgeist is there the climate is right I mean I'm not just putting you know perfume on this thing I'm sure that's why you know to throw your hat in the
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:28.760]  string if you get in there you're gonna really be able to have a bully pulpit and really get in there and do some filler by string you know to expose what's happening and one of the it might be a minor point to some people
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:44.760]  are inside the bell ways so to speak but it's also very important for people to recognize that when I do go back to the Congress in the house I keep the eight years of seniority that I accumulated earlier which is extremely important to do what you just said and that is to
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:47.760]  get things done to move our agenda forward up there.
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:28:03.760]  Oh it's incredible yeah folks if you study Congress Bob Barr back in that is and and then to help formulate more leaders more libertarian patriots to just take this country back I mean we can do it if we get behind people like Bob Barr folks so again go to
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:17.760]  Bob Barr's congressional website we're going to put it back on the screen for folks and I'm going to give you that URL it is absolutely essential that people go there Congressman tell folks how they can go to your website.
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:36.760]  Just a very simple www.barcongress.com can't miss that I tell you and we're out of time you got a promise to come back soon to talk about all the other issues a selfish question whatever happened with the lawsuit because I know you got the intel that Matt Drudge Alex Jones
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:47.760]  info.org.com you know that we were being demonized on these lists and they were trying to declare national security and stuff did we ever find out what the TSA is up to.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:29:07.760]  That that case I mean it's like the old the old case and in Bleak House by Charles Dickens Jorn Dice be Jorn Dice it just drags on for generation after generation we're still engaged after about three years of litigation with the FOI trying to get the the information on the what the
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:13.760]  and what the TSA did three years ago as I think it was right around Thanksgiving time.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  So I know you've got a bottom of it I know you've got to go soon but if you can do just five more minutes with us on the other side Congressman bar I want to talk about the NSA talk about how we stop that talk about how you think we defeat this this security theater that is the TSA and other issues with former
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:49.760]  Congress from Bob Barr we're going to put back in Congress it is so important ladies and gentlemen you can nitpick people all day long but I mean Bob Barr compared to Nancy Pelosi and people like that is the polar opposite of those traders and we cannot use strong enough rhetoric because these people are
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:30:11.760]  we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down societies

[02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:29.760]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones you can run on for a long time folks I get excited about beating the tyrants and you know I've had Bob bar on many times and haven't ever really gushed like I'm gushing now I was just remembering all the stuff he did actual legislation actual police state stuff he stopped
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:49.760]  actual FBI police state stuff he stopped CIA stuff he stopped and listen we barely beat those gun confiscation bills and all the garbage that Obama had in the Senate if it wasn't for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul it would have passed and if it wasn't for a few people like Walter Jones and folks like Ron Paul and a
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:34:09.760]  mosh and all those people in the house we would have lost we are we are inches from losing okay we're inches from winning and so I mean this is a war I mean my whole life okay because my children three children two daughters and a son they don't have a future and my family's been here since 1620 both sides on the Mayflower
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:25.760]  I mean I'm all in for America and it people watch football games and what their team to win they get upset about it this is a hundred times that and that's the attitude we've got to have here I mean I'm in it to win it that's why I'm aggressive we've got to get people out of their days and so I start talking to
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:39.760]  people like Bob Barr and I was getting on about the NSA and stuff I knew was running for Congress and it kind of clicked wow think about what it's going to be like to have him back in there and it's going to be explosive the climate has shifted there is a tide in the
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:54.760]  affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune Shakespeare's Julius Caesar but our fortune isn't money and power our fortune is a future our fortune is saving this country and the world I mean that's the stakes and Bob Barr I mean I
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:35:06.760]  it sounds sensational but if the shoe fits wear it I mean I think that's where we are historically I think people should really understand the stakes what are the stakes right now you were telling me off air you're excited you're in the league you
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:19.760]  to stay in the lead you're probably going to win but people need to get behind you and that you are going to knock heads repeat what you said and then where are we historically well the one thing I've been called a lot of things over over the years
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:35.760]  particularly by the liberal media but one thing I've never been called is a member of the establishment I live to shake up the establishment because the establishment seeks to is our eggs are controlled over individuals and that's the one word that
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  always comes to my mind and talking about Washington it's all about the big C control and I'm excited about about running where we are in the lead but we need to get your listeners and our supporters wherever they are excited and motivated and active because you
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:36:08.760]  can be in the lead one day and not only the next day and I need to stay in the lead in order to get back up there to shake things up in Washington yeah I don't want to say it'll be fun to shake things up in Washington but Alex it will be to get back up there
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:28.760]  I mean I remember 16 years ago today I was on the floor of the Senate Senate arguing to to remove President Clinton from office I mean that's that's the kind of drive that's the kind of commitment that's the kind of backbone that we need up there willing to take on all commerce
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:42.760]  because let's just say it I mean a lot of people died that went up against Clinton a lot of airplanes blew up a lot of people got shot in the head five times and it does take backbone to try to impeach somebody when you're going up against gangsters like this and we've got to get rid of the
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:54.760]  of the Clinton mafia and I think what you're hinting at is if we put you back into Congress you are going to start investigating bringing charges of impeachment up in the house
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:37:13.760]  Alex I was I was with some folks just recently and I pulled out of pulled out of a file in my office the House resolution the House resolution that I introduced on November 5th of 1997 that was the very first official
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:32.760]  inquiry of impeachment filed against Bill Clinton and that was mine and at the time I think I had 18 co-sponsors was all in November of 1997 and what I did is I took that took that document figuratively kind of dusted it off
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:39.760]  added a little bit of language to it and darned if it doesn't sound pretty good with Barack Obama's name in there.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:54.760]  Oh man so I think it's safe to say if you get back in Congress the evidence is already there you're going to start looking into the inquiry to begin getting the co-sponsors for indicting the president in the house and I guess he'll be
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:56.760]  tried in the Senate.
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:12.760]  I think it really has come to that it's not something I like to say when I left the house before after the after we impeached Clinton you know my hope was we would never have to go through that process again but we do we do need to stand up for the
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:26.760]  rule of law we do need to stand up for proper separation of powers and we do need to stand up and tell a president we have an attorney general that won't do it we need people in the Congress who will stand up and say Mr.
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:43.760]  President you are not above the law you cannot ignore the law you cannot simply violate the law violate the Constitution because from a policy standpoint you deem it appropriate to do so we don't operate that way in America and you are not going to be permitted any longer to do that.
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  Well look at Walter Jones from North Carolina who's a frequent guest you know he's got the bill introduced that if he continued to back back al-Qaeda and bomb more countries that impeachment will begin but no one's got the nerve when he's the clearest president to be impeached
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:01.760]  ever it makes Richard Nixon look like an angel and I'm no fan of Richard Nixon.
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:17.760]  And then I look at the Democrats persecuting people and going after Republican governors and people for stuff that's that's that's questionable if it if it's even really illegal you know endorsing vitamin companies and stuff I mean give me a break you know like we're seeing in Virginia and and it's
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:30.760]  really frightening when you see how the Democrats operate trying to indict all their foes trying to send you know a Republican congressman from Texas to jail for totally legal facts.
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:43.760]  Yeah what what they did to Tom DeLay was was was absolutely outrageous and and the prosecutor whose name I forget there the prosecutor you know just kept going and going and going.
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:40:02.760]  Tom DeLay and finally I guess what just retired or what not that was not held accountable and thank goodness Tom DeLay was finally vindicated in the the courts of appeal there but the man lost his job that his reputation was ruined for a period of time there he lost tremendous
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:19.760]  income I'm sure and as Ray Donovan former Labor Secretary said years ago tell me where do I go to get my reputation back it's it's just outrageous that these people can do these things and and get away with them and I'm just tired of letting
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:30.760]  letting Obama get away with what he's doing well that's what's scary I mean there's been Republican leadership that does corrupt stuff and political persecutions but it's so rare compared to the Democrats and I mean they can indict a ham sandwich
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:43.760]  with all these you know I mean they have one county here in Austin where I live that they launch attacks all over the place Bloomberg used New York to launch all these frivolous attacks while they are just wallowing in corruption with
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:41:03.760]  cylindra and Benghazi and fast and furious and then I see this attorney general going around in guiding Republicans for having dirt under their fingernails and really questionable stuff and I mean it's just insane it makes me scared at a fundamental level they could set me up
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:19.760]  I'm totally clean but who knows what they could make up I mean it you really see the dirty tricks that's why I then admire someone like you who I know they see as a threat on the air saying what no one else is willing to say because they're scared and because they know
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:35.760]  wow if they can indict people for getting loans because they were talking about endorsing a supplement company I mean they can do anything and it's not going to get better it's going to get worse well listen we need to get you into Congress
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:50.760]  the website will put it up on screen for folks bar congress dot com we need to get him in there and we need to get other people that have shown their fighters but listen this is the guy that brought the impeachment this is the guy that it's and I was just thinking back now on
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:42:05.760]  I mean no one's going to sit there in the control media and go look what Bob Bar did Bob Bar has courage and I didn't mean to turn this interview into a big endorsement but I just started you know having that epiphany wow this is this is really a good good card to play so a congressman I'm going to say congressman because we're going to pray and hope you get in there and it
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  looks like you can we don't want to count our chickens before they're hatched any other points you'd like to add on other issues in the country and things you like to do when you get into Congress
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:23.760]  oh gee there's so many things that I'd like to do with with Obamacare and the Federal Reserve and so forth but we'll have plenty of time to talk about those
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:43.760]  I do hope people will not only go to the website as you mentioned bar congress but also friend us on Facebook I mean that's an important way to get the message out and to show people that they support what I'm trying to do and what I'm talking about and what you're talking about to friend us on Facebook as well
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  all right well congressman Bob Bar thank you so much for the time and look forward to talking to you throughout the campaign
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.760]  thank you so much for having me once again on your show Alex you take care and God bless you
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:07.760]  thank you God bless you well there goes congressman former congressman soon to be congressman again Bob Bar just just lately launching his new campaign and very exciting and again I'm very tired today I have allergies everybody knows that
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:25.760]  and then I just got energized because it was like clicking I'm like I'm talking to Bob Bar who fought the NSA fought the FBI on carnivore fought the omnibus crime bills fought all the gun bills beat a bunch of them and started the impeachment of Bill Clinton
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:40.760]  David shippers and all the rest of them I just it's just like it's weird to be talking to these historical figures and no one in the mainstream media is going to tell you I mean listen the Clintons murder people okay okay
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:56.760]  and I was talking to him off air and he was talking about impeachment and kind of breathing in when he said it because I mean you make a something you you got to have big way votes to actually be well spoken and threatening to the establishment and have a really good clean background
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:13.760]  Bob Bar and then go up against them because they're scared of people like Bob Bar folks they're scared of Ted Cruz they're scared of Rand Paul these are warriors ladies and gentlemen who are who are in danger and who are being attacked and I hope you realize I don't want your
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:31.760]  thanks because I'm going to fight here with you we're bailing the water together but you need to know too that I am under attack and that all sorts of stuff going on and it's par for the course I expect it and I quite frankly don't like it but that that's what it is
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:49.760]  because I know that comes with the territory and I try on so many fronts to really be a upstanding good person it's it's hard to be a good person it's hard to make the right decisions but my heart's in the right place and I know your hearts in the right place
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:45:04.760]  and man it just clicked when I got Bob because I said last week I get Bob Bar on I want Bob Bar on about the NSA and then it was just clicked oh he's just now announcing for Congress wow this is perfect wow what will he be like when he's in there
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:11.760]  because here's the deal he couldn't really go after him on a lot of stuff he did in the past because he had no support
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:22.760]  people are looking for leadership that's what I'm telling you folks you have to be leaders in your area and listen if there were Democrats out there fighting tyranny
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:26.760]  I would have him on the show and I would endorse them
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:44.760]  who's the congressman from Florida I'm having a brain fart as they call him excuse my French old English insult everything that's excuse my French ridiculous I love the French folks
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:46:00.760]  I'm Alsatian my mom's side of the family is mainly German as a lot of Germans came into the US and Texas obviously but it was old English in there too Greshams and a bunch of other stuff and I've got like double German Alsatian back there too
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:08.760]  most of my German ancestors come from Alsatian that's the real name of a German Shepherd who's an Alsatian
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:20.760]  but anyways I guess if I was anything I am English and Alsatian and a lot of other stuff but no offense the French is what I'm saying
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:28.760]  but it's German French but expanding on all of this
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:39.760]  in the final equation we have to really just gut up and make the decision about what we're going to do I mean I know I keep restating the office I'm going to go to your phone calls
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:53.760]  it's just that I admire people because of their courage and now I understand the world works better as you get older more than knowledge comes with the wisdom and then you understand multi layer what's going on
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:47:05.760]  and you realize people like Bob Barr and others understand there's nothing to sell out to
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:13.760]  there's no Boss Hog in the sky you know in the government that we can just sell out to and they'll still be nice to us in Patus on the head and everything will be okay
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:26.760]  it's not going to be okay it's not going to be okay
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:39.760]  you can't sell out to this there's nothing to sell out to sell out to poverty in a collapsing country run by a bunch of control freaks that want to hurt people and make them poor
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  I mean it's a no brainer they want to divide everybody they want to screw everybody up they want to break up families they want to poison everybody
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:48:01.760]  the New World Order can go straight to Hades this is not that's what's so frustrating there's not even a question here people all their debates are fake all their moral high ground stuff's fake it's all crud and you know it
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:14.760]  you know it's all lies systematic pure lies practiced to break your will and to condition you to accept fraud
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:26.760]  and I'm not accepting it anymore I want to survive I want to thrive I want to have a future it's real simple are you better off now into the New World Order than you were before
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:36.760]  you like where we're going you like the smell of things and you know you don't don't let your eyes and your heart and your nose and your taste and your touch and your senses
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:48.760]  get in the way huh just believe the fraud let's go to Jay in Wisconsin thanks for holding I appreciate it you're on the air go ahead
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:49:03.760]  hey Alex first time caller actually Jay Mitch I'm calling to let you know they've put the surveillance cameras up that you were talking about a few weeks ago they're literally up in my neighborhood like peering into my backyard and there are no
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:16.760]  businesses around and then they're all over the freeways and highways and they're all over the main streets here they're also in street lights all over Austin they run the street lights off of cable
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:29.760]  off of internet and then they've they've got a lot of them have microphones and cameras on them and it's just not even a news item so just looking at your house and they got caught in Seattle everywhere else turning the cameras around looking in people's houses
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  well of course that's what they're doing and they're using our money and super cheap technology to build a total grid of literal imperial probe droids everywhere tracking everything we do
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:52.760]  mean that's what those are those are robots with face scanning and voice analysis and all this ai crap where the conversation gets interesting goes bing bing bing bing bing bing bing there let's see what's going on there
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:50:05.760]  we guys like Oh dig you beat the hell out of work I mean they just know everything you're doing it's so criminal but the answer is Oh we're the Good Guys so it's okay now it's totally illegal go ahead

[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:16.760]  lot of people know about your show, and I'm actually able to make a few t-shirts and things

[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:25.760]  young people here that are in my community that have woken up and are aware of the things
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:26.760]  that are going on.
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:32.760]  And I did want to say that I had a dream a few years back about all of this.
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:39.760]  I actually write music for ASCAP, and I wrote a song about this, so I shot it over to your

[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:35.760]  Alright, I really need to go to your calls. Felix in Michigan, thanks for holding. Tell us what's going on with FEMA, our loving friends.
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:45.760]  Hey, Alex. Just curious to know if you've seen anything in regards to FEMA's looking to hire some housing inspectors.
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:51.760]  Yeah, I know it's Agenda 21 and they do it to get into your house and they do it to acclimate you to the next spy force.
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:01:01.760]  This is a first contact approximation. The people doing it don't even know. It's a Pentagon blueprint from a 1962 takeover model for third world countries.
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  But yes, it's a first contact federal inspector program.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:13.760]  Absolutely. And you understand when you domesticate an animal, you first just are in their presence, then you feed them, then you capture little ones and raise them.
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:17.760]  That's what they're doing with the CPS. So it's a domestication process.
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:21.760]  Exactly. I think the foster care agents do the same thing as well.
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:30.760]  But in this particular javelin says they're looking for these inspectors and such for a presidentially declared disaster.
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:35.760]  And they're looking at looking for them nationwide and they want to get their training done in the next 90 days.
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:40.760]  I was curious to know if you think that might be in connection with what seems to be.
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:49.760]  Listen, listen, they always can have real programs that they all these agencies do real functions. They just piggyback all the evil stuff.
[03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:52.760]  Like Russian dolls inside of it.
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  So there could be legitimate disasters FEMA deals with.
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:05.760]  The problem is, is that then it's used for COG and does have a mission for taking over government and coordinating anything that could reestablish government could overwrite government.
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:10.760]  And that is the right. That's the reason FEMA should be defunded and removed.
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:18.760]  And the federal government should coordinate with the states not to have a FEMA force that comes in and bureaucratically shuts everything down.
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:22.760]  And all the studies show they screw everything up and that responses are much worse now.
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:27.760]  And their unification of police codes and all of it is just a total takeover.
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:36.760]  Absolutely. And you know, the interesting thing is they are deeper and further in talking about enemy territories, if you will.
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:46.760]  One of the things that first woke me up is I was looking into Agenda 21 and it was the wildlife, urban interface, something or other.
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:53.760]  And I was looking at that and it said, I was looking at a symbol and I noticed that I recognized it.
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  And I was in the property management field and I turned around and right on my desk was the manual, the International Property Management Handbook.
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:08.760]  No, absolutely. That's what it is. Send me a copy. It's Agenda 21. Absolutely. Anything else?
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:17.760]  Yeah, I just wanted to get your take. We see that I looked on the NASA website. There's some lunar eclipses coming. They call it a tetrad.
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:24.760]  It looks like we've had some in history, three of them to be exact, a series of lunar and solar eclipses.
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:31.760]  And each time those have happened, there's some sort of biblical significance with Jewish people.
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:39.760]  And we have one beginning to start on April of this year, continuing into next year.
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:47.760]  The Sabbath is really, in the ancient Hebrew, is really the full moon or is it right after the full moon?
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:57.760]  The whole point is that, I know it's Friday night and stuff now, but I'm talking about in the ancient times, it had to do with moon cycles and stuff.
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:01.760]  And that was why you have to keep the Sabbath. Well, back then it was like it was even complex even.
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:05.760]  But the point is, I've done research that year, so I don't want to give out bad info.
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:13.760]  The point is, is that the elites across the board launch wars every time Mars is close to the earth, and then they admit that.
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:22.760]  I mean, these are, you think the Romans were 2,000 years ago or 1,500 years ago, I guess they fell 1,600 years ago.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:33.760]  But the point is, completely fell, the point is, is that, be genetically, and humans go right back to, the customs just go on mommy, daddy down the line.
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:40.760]  So it's like the Romans are 5 minutes ago, and they would launch wars dealing with Mars. That's how this works.
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:46.760]  And so the elites all believe in this stuff. I don't care if they're Jewish or what they are, it's all basically the same stuff.
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:52.760]  It's all Babylon, mystery school, because the whole Zoroastrian, just all those movements.
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:58.760]  And if you go into the Jewish books, the Zohar, modern Talmuds and all this, it's just a bunch of Babylonian stuff.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:03.760]  We'll be back, I'm, I'm keep going.

[03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:17.760]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:22.760]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:07:36.760 --> 03:07:43.760]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:07:43.760 --> 03:07:48.760]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:07.760]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.760 --> 03:08:27.760]  Well, when you're exhausted, like I've been today, with allergies and not enough sleep, what you do is you broadcast longer than you normally do.
[03:08:27.760 --> 03:08:40.760]  Greg in Utah wants to talk about the armored vehicles and rocket launchers and grenade launchers that the police are getting from the feds as they train to take on Hank Williams Jr. basically.
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:50.760]  I mean, that's literally who they train to attack. I'm not kidding. I mean, that's the main Pentagon directive, and that's who they say the main enemy is, is Hank Williams Jr. wearing a John Deer hat.
[03:08:50.760 --> 03:09:00.760]  Because they don't think Hank Williams Jr. is going to let them take their kids to the collectivization farm, and Hank Williams Jr. doesn't want his kids being taught about sex at age five.
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:11.760]  And Hank Williams Jr. likes guns, and Hank Williams Jr. stomps around as a man, and the globalists want to stomp on us. They don't want men stomping around.
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:21.760]  I mean, they put estrogen in the printer ink and in the food and the water and everything because they don't want men. You understand that.
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:29.760]  So that's why they're doing that. Because if you're a bank robber or you come in a house, you're going to rob people. Who do you subdue first? A man.
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:40.760]  You want to get him seduced, conk him on the head, get him tied up so you can rob the house. And then usually criminals go, you know what, let's just rape the wife and kill the kids.
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:50.760]  That's what criminals do. And so that's the mentality of the people running us. And they got the men handcuffed up against the wall with duct tape around their mouths right now.
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:10:00.760]  But still, they know there's men out there with guns they haven't gotten to destroy yet. And so they just want to make sure they get everything geared up first so they can take their time gutting this country.
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:11.760]  Greg, in Utah, go ahead. Alex, you know, yeah, I was just listening, you know, to Bob Barnett got me thinking, too, of another subject besides what I saw the other day.
[03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:21.760]  And that is the fact that right here in this county, just because we're out in the country and most of the business is farming and there's a power plant here.
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:31.760]  The numerous times our blasted sheriff said he was not a constitutional sheriff. He didn't believe he got his power from the Constitution. That's dangerous.
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:38.760]  That means he'll take orders from, you know, and not use the Constitution as his rule of law.
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:53.760]  No, that's it. You know, they've gone from saying the Constitution is bad and old and stuff to saying just get rid of it to being belligerent. Judges, you name it, like declare. It's like how you declare in the New World Order is, you know, you have articles in the Boston Globe about is the Declaration of Independence
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:11:03.760]  Terrorist should we get rid of it. You know, they just declare their outrageousness to get us used to it. And, you know, people haven't the image of Ford or Chevy and the guy urinating on it.
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:12.760]  That's basically what this is. They're letting you know we're going to run over you. We've got the moral authority. We're going to eat you. That's what they do.
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:20.760]  They take your labor. They take your money. They take your house. They take your kids. It's a form of eating us. It's cannibalism. They like the Soylent Green.
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:23.760]  Agenda 21 is the Soylent Green model. Go ahead.
[03:11:23.760 --> 03:11:29.760]  Yeah, just because, you know, he's a member, you know, in the leadership of the local church means absolutely nothing.
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:35.760]  Oh, no, it's always like that. They're always the heads of the church. They're all because they have the moral authority. You understand?
[03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:44.760]  That's why they can do whatever they want because they are at the mega church and they've got the cult at the mega church doing that. Exactly.
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:52.760]  Yeah. And let me tell you something. If this vehicle, I took a picture of Sunday that was had Utah license plates on it showed up here at your door.
[03:11:52.760 --> 03:12:00.760]  They were there to get your guns. Unless you had an army of citizens surrounding you, it's over for you. Either that or you're going to commit suicide.
[03:12:00.760 --> 03:12:02.760]  I mean, it's that ridiculous.
[03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:08.760]  Well, here's the deal. Everybody looks at this from a one-dimensional or two-dimensional warfare model.
[03:12:08.760 --> 03:12:15.760]  Obviously, when gun confiscations start, you have a bug out position that's on public land. It doesn't matter.
[03:12:15.760 --> 03:12:24.760]  Anywhere special forces, total resistance tactics. You can buy a total resistance book from different resistance in Europe.
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:27.760]  There's a lot of them and I've read a lot of them. It's very interesting. Good reading.
[03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:31.760]  I mean, I don't want to get into tactics here with people, but listen, you don't wait for the armored vehicle.
[03:12:31.760 --> 03:12:39.760]  Those guys go to bars. Those guys go to church. Those guys live places and they're not always going to be jacketed in a war wagon.
[03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:53.760]  They go around and start wiping people out and killing folks. Believe me, the military veterans, that's the one enemy the globalists are targeting and tracking, are not going to sit there in their houses.
[03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:59.760]  You understand that and the police better stand down and the military better stand down when this kicks off.
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:05.760]  Now, of course, they're going to stage horrible massacres or provocations to blame on us.
[03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:12.760]  They have moral authority up front. The Patriot group bombed a daycare center where the police keep their children.
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:21.760]  Look at the dead baby. Anyone fighting back against the gun confiscation is part of the such-and-such massacre of the 14 children.
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:25.760]  And look, the other ones who have their eyes blown out. I mean, it's going to be ridiculous.
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:31.760]  So you have to understand that, but it doesn't matter. The resolve is everyone's going to know it's staged anyways.
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:44.760]  The people that count, they're not looking for trouble. But once the Civil War starts, which I'm trying to avert, I mean, they plan to use us to call the police and military that's their secondary enemy.
[03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:54.760]  We're the first enemy. They're the secondary enemy. This is fourth and fifth dimensional warfare. They're going to have us kill each other and then they're going to roll in with the next phase, okay?
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:13:57.760]  And people need to understand how this works.
[03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:06.760]  Yeah, I was just hoping, you know, looking at that vehicle and looking at the tires, which made a Humvee tire look like a Volkswagen tire.
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:13.760]  You know, this thing was meant to go off-road. I was just hoping and praying that maybe that was some prepper had bought that.
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:23.760]  No, no, no. The Homeland Security's deploying the latest anti-mine vehicles, IED vehicles. They're deploying a fifth branch of the military.
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:28.760]  It's called Homeland Treason. This is it, folks.
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:34.760]  And they got the cops all strutting around ready for war and whatever. I'm just going to stay out of it.
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:37.760]  So I'm just, I can't believe it.
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:46.760]  Alright, send us the photo. I want you to send it to Showtips at infowars.com. Just type in local police departments, get armored vehicles, and it's been all over the news. You can see that.
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:51.760]  Thank you, Greg. Let's talk to James in West Virginia. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:53.760]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing today?
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:56.760]  I'm pretty tired, but we have a good broadcast. Talk about long report stuff.
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:02.760]  Thank you for all your effort. I know you don't like all the compliments and stuff. I've got a couple real quick points for you.
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:11.760]  One, your spot on this, the immunization stuff, you know, I mean, it's almost like one of my favorite shows that I used to watch Star Trek Generation, the board.
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:21.760]  I mean, it's one evil central thought process, one evil central agenda, and their thought process is either you assimilate or they kill you.
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:28.760]  And I choose not to be assimilated or I choose not to die out for my family, my friends here, my local community.
[03:15:28.760 --> 03:15:33.760]  That's right. We're being forced into this conflict.
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:35.760]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:45.760]  The second point, and this is why I've made about 1,500 calls in the last week and a half to get on your show, Alex, is back in October, early November.
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:53.760]  You had talked about FEMA Region 3 false slide coming up and it's happening here in West Virginia, sir.
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:57.760]  I mean, please don't forget about us. I mean, that's not complete today.
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:01.760]  It's just this whole contamination with this chemical in our water systems.
[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:09.760]  We are going through the FEMA Region 3 false slide that you spoke of several months ago.
[03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:17.760]  We have one of the tiniest airports available and it's got a little National Guard airport that runs beside it.
[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:24.760]  Sir, I could count daily 60, 80, hundreds and hundreds of Kentrell flights that come out of it.
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:27.760]  I wouldn't think that they could even have that many airplanes up.
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:35.760]  I don't know where they're coming from, but West Virginia is in fact under a total assault for our health and humanity here.
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:41.760]  So, you know, if you've got time and have some of your people look into some of this stuff and follow up on that, you predicted it.
[03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:47.760]  I just want you to forget about us because we are under an attack right now with our water supplies.
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:51.760]  You know, industry has always been in the pocket of government in this state.
[03:16:51.760 --> 03:17:01.760]  We knew they were running around like flies on, you know what, in that area gearing up for stuff the last year and just doing a lot of bizarre psyops.
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:06.760]  And again, they're also testing the military to see how they respond to all the weirdness. God knows what they're doing.
[03:17:06.760 --> 03:17:13.760]  I mean, tens of thousands of people killed in just a couple of different secret government programs that have been declassified.
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:18.760]  And you got the U.S. Code where they say for any law enforcement research purpose, they can kill people.
[03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:22.760]  But you can't put down in a U.S. Code a law that you can kill whoever you want.
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:30.760]  These people are nuts. They're mad scientists. And I mean, I shudder to think of what they're up to that we don't know of.
[03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:36.760]  I mean, that's the thing. As much as we know, we don't, we know very little about what these nuts are doing.
[03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:41.760]  God bless you. And yeah, the big chemical spilting is a big issue. Man, I'm tired.
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:45.760]  Let's talk to Jay in Texas. Go ahead.
[03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:48.760]  God bless you, Alex. Thanks, buddy.
[03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:54.760]  Hey, man. There's this article from before it's news. It says Obama served five, two articles.
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:18:00.760]  Obama serves 14 state governors with warnings of arrest and why it's not front page news.
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:10.760]  It was May 7, 2013 by Ken Larvey. It says Barack Obama has served 14 state governors in the United States with national security letters.
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:19.760]  Warning of the governor's actions in attempting to form state defense forces needed to be halted immediately or they will face arrest for the crime of treason.
[03:18:19.760 --> 03:18:21.760]  The employment of NSL.
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:27.760]  What is the source from that? That's a very disreputable website. I mean, some of the stuff's real on there.
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:33.760]  So it's like Sasha, whatever his name is. Who's that internet guy that always puts up with this info for years?
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:42.760]  I mean, there's just so many of these people and I'm not trying to fight with the side or something. It's just that, I mean, you know, I mean, they just do ridiculous stuff on there.
[03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:52.760]  I know they have been threatening states and stuff not to have their, but I'll look at it. I remember seeing that before. I mean, what's the source from that? Or is it the only source?
[03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:58.760]  There was another guy, Dr. Lyle Rapp.
[03:18:58.760 --> 03:19:05.760]  No, but I mean, but I mean, what's the source? They just say that? I mean, it says before it's news. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:19:05.760 --> 03:19:11.760]  They say they're the source. I mean, I mean, they can do. I mean, they did. It is a source of really good entertainment.
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:18.760]  But it's just, you know, I don't even know about that particular report. I just, it's like, it's like the onion or something. But I appreciate you.
[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:27.760]  I'll look into it. You know, the problem is you got all this real federalization going on and states being threatened like Texas, you know, that will blockade your aircraft.
[03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:32.760]  If you try to like not let the TSA fondle your genitals, that happened and got no attention.
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:37.760]  And then meanwhile, a few weeks ago when that came out, I looked into it and I was like, where's the source?
[03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:46.760]  But I can't poo poo that because I haven't looked at it again. I can just tell you that you get these open source sites where people can write whatever they want.
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:53.760]  And I mean, it's, I mean, I've seen stuff on sites where Alex Jones died today.
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:20:00.760]  People also are calling. I'm like, no, I'm not dead. Remers of my death have been greatly exaggerated. I'm sorry. I'm out of time, folks. I'm out of time. God bless you all.
