[00:00.000 --> 00:08.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.560 --> 00:14.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.840 --> 00:20.400]  It is Sunday, the 9th day of May, 2010.
[00:20.400 --> 00:23.680]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:23.680 --> 00:25.520]  Very important broadcast lined up.
[00:25.520 --> 00:34.800]  I've been a lot of preparation for this radio slash TV, prisonplanet.tv transmission today.
[00:34.800 --> 00:35.800]  I will say this.
[00:35.800 --> 00:41.520]  We are only going to have open phones here on the broadcast for Hispanic Americans or
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.800]  for Hispanics living in Mexico, Latinos living all over the world.
[00:47.800 --> 00:48.800]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.880]  This broadcast will be specifically open phones in the first hour and a half for you to be
[00:54.880 --> 01:02.680]  able to call in and just break down what you're hearing from the Hispanic community about
[01:02.680 --> 01:11.080]  their view of the United States, what the average view is about the, quote, invasion
[01:11.080 --> 01:17.960]  or the la reconquista, OZID line, the takeover of the United States and whether you support
[01:17.960 --> 01:19.360]  that or not.
[01:19.360 --> 01:25.360]  And what the average view is of gringos, white people.
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.680]  The reason I say this is obviously the last week it broke that students were kicked off
[01:30.680 --> 01:35.000]  campus in San Francisco for wearing American flag tees.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.800]  I've now seen interviews with the parents and students, three of the five are Hispanic.
[01:40.800 --> 01:45.200]  And they're sick of hearing about how this is Mexico and the U.S. being run down.
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.200]  And so they wore, well, one of them got kicked out for an old Navy flag shirt.
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.560]  I happen to own one of those.
[01:54.560 --> 01:58.040]  And then the other students were so upset by it, they walked out of class the next day
[01:58.040 --> 02:04.120]  when the school reversed itself and said, okay, you can wear American flags.
[02:04.120 --> 02:05.120]  I mean, think about this.
[02:05.120 --> 02:09.520]  This isn't like immigrants from Germany or immigrants from Italy or immigrants from
[02:09.520 --> 02:15.720]  China where the countries are far away.
[02:15.720 --> 02:20.000]  This is a country that lost several wars with the United States that's on our border that
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.440]  is very corrupt.
[02:22.440 --> 02:26.800]  And there's at least 30 million illegals in this country and tens of millions of other
[02:26.800 --> 02:31.440]  legal immigrants that have come here from Mexico over the last 50 years.
[02:31.440 --> 02:37.160]  And I want to know, is the views that we're hearing from these professors and school teachers
[02:37.160 --> 02:45.920]  and academics that whites are scum and filth and need to die, is that a majority view?
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.600]  I want to know, because I always was brought up to be colorblind and have friends of every
[02:51.600 --> 02:56.120]  color and I don't feel insecure when I go and eat in a Mexican food restaurant owned
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.240]  by Hispanics.
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.920]  I was in one today, but I'm starting to ask myself, am I welcome here?
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.860]  I mean, should I, because I don't have a choice.
[03:06.860 --> 03:10.080]  Should I start separating myself?
[03:10.080 --> 03:12.840]  I mean, is that what you want?
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.960]  Because I mean, all I see is Hispanics and whites getting intermarried and getting along.
[03:17.960 --> 03:19.400]  And I hope that's the vast majority.
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.800]  I think it is, but if it's different, I need to know.
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.800]  Because we know this, the mainstream media, the corporate media, the dominant systems
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.480]  of government are promoting this liberation theology.
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.360]  They are really pushing through Carlos Mancia and all these big comics.
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.600]  Every time I turn them on on television, it's just pure anti-white propaganda and I'm sick
[03:42.600 --> 03:43.760]  of it.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.600]  I'm sick of it.
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.480]  I'm tired of racism, tribalism, and I'm not self-hating.
[03:51.480 --> 03:52.480]  I'm not guilty.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.800]  I've done nothing to anybody.
[03:53.800 --> 04:00.000]  All I have is goodwill towards everyone, but I will stand up for myself.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.920]  And there's nothing wrong with being a European.
[04:01.920 --> 04:02.920]  There's nothing wrong.
[04:02.920 --> 04:05.680]  I mean, every culture has done good things and bad things.
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.960]  I don't sit up here in judgment of anybody, but I've had enough.
[04:10.960 --> 04:16.800]  And I have put out a video that's basically an open letter to Robert Rodriguez, who lives
[04:16.800 --> 04:20.000]  here in Austin, the accomplished director.
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.920]  Because when I saw the trailer for his new movie coming out, Machete, it's basically
[04:28.920 --> 04:35.760]  a call for race war and it mirrors what La Raza and Macha and other groups are putting
[04:35.760 --> 04:37.760]  out.
[04:37.760 --> 04:43.320]  And when you see big-budget movies where whites are the bad guys and have to be killed, it's
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.320]  very serious.
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.840]  Imagine a movie where Hispanics are the bad guys and have to be killed, or blacks are
[04:47.840 --> 04:51.880]  the bad guys and have to be killed, or Jews are the bad guys and have to be killed.
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.600]  This is very, very serious, so we're going to break this down and some of the firebombing
[04:56.600 --> 04:59.600]  attacks and things that have happened in the U.S. in the last few weeks.
[04:59.600 --> 05:06.480]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[05:06.480 --> 05:11.680]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[05:11.680 --> 05:20.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[05:20.280 --> 05:27.320]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[05:27.320 --> 05:33.440]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[05:33.440 --> 05:38.400]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[05:38.400 --> 05:45.200]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.760]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[05:49.760 --> 05:51.920]  ride all day with confidence.
[05:51.920 --> 05:54.880]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[05:54.880 --> 06:04.960]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[06:04.960 --> 06:09.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:09.760 --> 06:10.760]  You want answers?
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.760]  Well, so does he.
[06:12.760 --> 06:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:17.080 --> 06:21.280]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:21.280 --> 06:28.480]  All right, my friends, a very important broadcast today.
[06:28.480 --> 06:35.000]  In the last 30 minutes, economist, Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us to give us his take
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.760]  on what happened Thursday with a thousand-point drop.
[06:38.760 --> 06:43.800]  It has now been confirmed by the major stock exchanges it was not a fat finger.
[06:43.800 --> 06:46.600]  It was not just a single trade.
[06:46.600 --> 06:53.000]  It was now more than 20 stocks that were simultaneously affected, and the evidence is pointing towards
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.560]  massive European sell-offs and a true plunge that began in the markets, and then the plunge
[06:59.560 --> 07:08.840]  protection team set up by Ronald Reagan to stop stock market crashes in 1987 kicked in.
[07:08.840 --> 07:11.800]  The president's working committee on open markets is its technical name.
[07:11.800 --> 07:18.520]  The protection team is the slang or street term for it, kicked in to stop that from happening.
[07:18.520 --> 07:24.200]  Though there's some evidence that may have been JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs black box
[07:24.200 --> 07:30.760]  insider trading, we'll cover that in the last 30 minutes of this radio broadcast coming
[07:30.760 --> 07:31.760]  up today.
[07:31.760 --> 07:33.800]  In fact, here's the Hill newspaper.
[07:33.800 --> 07:39.400]  White House doesn't rule out sabotage in Thursday's wild Wall Street plunge.
[07:39.400 --> 07:41.960]  Now they're saying it could have been a cyber attack, so don't worry.
[07:41.960 --> 07:46.120]  The government and the FCC can start regulating and tracking and shutting down freedom on
[07:46.120 --> 07:47.120]  the web.
[07:47.120 --> 07:48.120]  Here's another one.
[07:48.120 --> 07:50.920]  Plunge in U.S. equities remains a mystery.
[07:50.920 --> 07:55.800]  Financial Times of London, New York Times, Greek debt crisis raises doubts about the European
[07:55.800 --> 08:02.440]  Union, EU preps Euro fund to fight Wolfpack debt crisis.
[08:02.440 --> 08:08.240]  They're worried about the markets opening in just about six hours in Europe and a black
[08:08.240 --> 08:12.080]  Monday globally melting down the stock market.
[08:12.080 --> 08:15.760]  This is a serious week to watch the financial developments.
[08:15.760 --> 08:20.640]  Here's another headline Wall Street Journal crisis deepens chaos grips Greece.
[08:20.640 --> 08:26.840]  So that's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[08:26.840 --> 08:34.040]  But before I get into that issue, sometimes every few months we have a special broadcast
[08:34.040 --> 08:38.040]  where I'll say, I only want to hear from police officers.
[08:38.040 --> 08:43.360]  Military, you know, we have this Army Times article where they're training 400,000 troops
[08:43.360 --> 08:46.880]  for domestic operations and gun confiscation.
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.440]  Please call in and tell us what your training has been like and what you think of it.
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.560]  We've done that from time to time.
[08:52.560 --> 08:59.200]  We're all say during the flu hysteria, open phones only for doctors and nurses and medical
[08:59.200 --> 09:02.040]  people to get your take on what's happening.
[09:02.040 --> 09:08.880]  Well today we're only going to take calls from Hispanics and you can be Latinos, whatever
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.960]  term you like, you can be in Mexico, you can be in Brazil, you can be in the US, you can
[09:12.960 --> 09:18.560]  be in Germany, you can be in Canada, you can be in Russia, whatever the 600 plus million
[09:18.560 --> 09:24.960]  Hispanics in the world are welcome to call into this radio show on the topic I'm about
[09:24.960 --> 09:28.400]  to put out there because I really want to hear from you.
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.840]  I really want to understand your view on what's going on and what's happening.
[09:32.840 --> 09:36.960]  Now you'll have to hold for a couple segments because I have to go over all this information
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.360]  first and then get your view on it, but let me give you the toll free number to join us
[09:41.360 --> 09:53.000]  on this live Sunday, the ninth day of May 2010 edition, 888-201-2244-888-2012244.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.120]  And you can disagree with what I'm going to say, you can agree, you can add points,
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.760]  but really I just want the truth, not just your views, but what you hear in your community
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.680]  because my wife lived many years in Spain, so she speaks Spanish and let me tell you
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.960]  she's got an inside view of what's really being said by a lot of people and my cousin
[10:14.960 --> 10:22.400]  grew up in Guatemala and he speaks fluent Spanish, it's really his first language.
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.800]  I've been on road trips with him before and heard him in the bed next to me, in the hotel
[10:26.800 --> 10:30.520]  room, you know the twin bed across from me, somebody starts speaking to Spanish and I
[10:30.520 --> 10:39.360]  wake up and believe me as a bartender in college, he heard the animosity and the hatred by some
[10:39.360 --> 10:46.400]  Hispanics toward gringos, towards, but not just towards gringos, the slang term for
[10:46.400 --> 10:52.280]  black people in Spanish that translates into English into blackbird and this is something
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.520]  in this politically correct society that is just acceptable.
[10:57.520 --> 11:03.400]  I mean no other group gets away with stuff like this, if when whites come out and spew
[11:03.400 --> 11:08.600]  a bunch of racial hatred, they get slapped down for it and they should, blacks to a lesser
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.520]  extent but they still do.
[11:10.520 --> 11:17.440]  I mean mildly racist stuff from Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton gets exposed, I want to live in
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.760]  peace with everybody and I don't have any guilt either, I don't even want to get up
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.600]  here and say I have lots of Hispanic friends and you know I like Hispanics and I have a
[11:25.600 --> 11:29.960]  lot of Hispanic folks that work in my office with me, I don't even want to say that like
[11:29.960 --> 11:36.360]  I'm having to prove myself, I know who I am, I know what my views are and I discovered
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.360]  this was going on in high school because my white teachers taught me white people were
[11:41.360 --> 11:47.880]  bad and America was bad and that the United States had stolen part of Mexico and then
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.680]  when I was in college I was taught this and then I began to go to Mecha and La Raza rallies
[11:53.680 --> 11:59.800]  and watch videos of their leaders and literally we have hundreds and hundreds of these videos.
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.600]  There are several new ones that have come out from these La Raza which means the race,
[12:04.600 --> 12:08.840]  for those in the race everything, for those outside the race nothing and the Fortune 500
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.560]  funds these groups, the media funds it, Comedy Central chooses to give shows to people that
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.840]  have very racist programs where it's all about stirring up racial division and attacking
[12:19.840 --> 12:23.680]  white people and I for one am sick of it.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.520]  I am sick and tired of it but what's gotten me upset?
[12:27.520 --> 12:33.720]  In the last few weeks we've seen police being attacked in Arizona and illegal alien supporters
[12:33.720 --> 12:39.560]  and illegals saying we'll use our pickaxes on you, we'll kill you and it's nationally
[12:39.560 --> 12:46.520]  blacked out on the news, never made national news, I've seen footage out of Santa Cruz
[12:46.520 --> 12:52.160]  a week and a half ago or I guess nine days ago was on May Day of illegal alien supporters
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.880]  burning restaurants with people in them, they narrowly escaped, torches in the streets and
[12:57.880 --> 13:02.200]  then ABC News locally said well they've got a reason to be angry with this Arizona law
[13:02.200 --> 13:07.920]  and I've seen the Arizona law misrepresented by the media so the corporate media is driving
[13:07.920 --> 13:15.720]  this and pushing this and implying that all Hispanics aren't wanted in America and really
[13:15.720 --> 13:19.160]  adding fuel to all of this tension.
[13:19.160 --> 13:26.480]  Then I saw a video yesterday, it's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, LA teacher calls for
[13:26.480 --> 13:32.920]  Mexican revolt in U.S. and this is at a big rally and he talks about disgusting white
[13:32.920 --> 13:36.800]  people and he talks about how it's a communist takeover and he's honest.
[13:36.800 --> 13:42.040]  He says these old white people don't really dislike us because we're brown, they don't
[13:42.040 --> 13:47.440]  like us because we're communists and that's what I've said.
[13:47.440 --> 13:52.320]  I've said I want to know, I want people to run a flag up because if you're brown and
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.880]  love America and the Second Amendment and private property, well I'll just love you
[13:56.880 --> 14:01.320]  to death and hug all over you and you know I got two white daughters, I'm not going to
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.240]  get upset if they decide to marry a Hispanic American if they're a patriot.
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.520]  You know if my daughters someday bring home a white guy who's a communist I'm going to
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.080]  throw him the hell out of my house and if they bring a brown guy home who's a communist
[14:13.080 --> 14:22.200]  I'm going to tell my daughters that I'm going to ostracize them, shun them, disown them.
[14:22.200 --> 14:28.240]  If they marry, if my daughters brought home a clan member, it'd be the same thing.
[14:28.240 --> 14:31.120]  I am not going to be part of this.
[14:31.120 --> 14:33.920]  I am not going to support this.
[14:33.920 --> 14:39.520]  I'm done, I'm through, I'm finished and I'm coming out against it.
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.520]  You know I'm somebody who has been attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, I'm somebody who's protested
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.800]  them, bunch of federal agents on average and you know that was back 10, 15 years ago, I
[14:49.800 --> 14:52.600]  probably haven't gone out and protested the Klan in about eight years, I don't do a lot
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.720]  of protest period, I don't have time but you know the Klan maybe 100,000 people, this
[14:58.720 --> 15:06.000]  Mecheloraza thing is in the tens of millions and what's happening is there's this intimidation
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.640]  against Hispanic Americans that they are a, well they have a his Spanish term for it and
[15:12.640 --> 15:21.120]  what is it, Mapocho or it's a, it's in Spanish, basically a Uncle Tom and they attack Hispanics
[15:21.120 --> 15:26.120]  and call them sellouts if they fly an American flag at their house or business or if they're
[15:26.120 --> 15:35.360]  not a communist or if they're pro-second amendment and this was illustrated by the school kids,
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.680]  five of them being kicked out of school in San Francisco, three of the five were Hispanic
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.720]  by the way, not allowed to wear American flags.
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.640]  It was offensive to the Mexicans who don't want to be Americans, they're Mexicans and
[15:48.640 --> 15:52.800]  we're going to be discussing all of this today and we're going to go over Robert Rodriguez's
[15:52.800 --> 16:00.560]  new film Machete that is invoking race war, this is so important, stay with us.

[17:59.840 --> 18:03.800]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[18:03.800 --> 18:08.640]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle, did you know that in a real meltdown,
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.440]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold, it's true seeds have
[18:12.440 --> 18:15.920]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.480]  even happen again, so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[18:20.480 --> 18:26.680]  mix of non-hybrid seeds, they call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[18:26.680 --> 18:31.240]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.360]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[18:35.360 --> 18:42.760]  a full acre crisis garden, so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com
[18:42.760 --> 18:54.400]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[18:54.400 --> 18:59.480]  seeds are the ultimate barter item, this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[18:59.480 --> 19:04.960]  They help to create a new world order, we are part of a new world order, a new world order
[19:04.960 --> 19:07.840]  based upon collective action.
[19:07.840 --> 19:11.560]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[19:11.560 --> 19:12.560]  documents.
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.560]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities, it means all
[19:17.560 --> 19:19.480]  the world under their control.
[19:19.480 --> 19:24.320]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[19:24.320 --> 19:25.320]  world.
[19:25.320 --> 19:30.520]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[19:30.520 --> 19:33.040]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.520]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[19:37.520 --> 19:38.520]  financial system.
[19:38.520 --> 19:43.040]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20, so it's going to be an inner ruling
[19:43.040 --> 19:47.920]  elite and then everyone else, and I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[19:47.920 --> 19:53.960]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch
[19:53.960 --> 20:01.640]  you online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[20:01.640 --> 20:04.960]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:04.960 --> 20:18.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network, get it?
[20:18.320 --> 20:23.880]  No more Mr. Nice Guy, ladies and gentlemen, we're getting these issues out in the open.
[20:23.880 --> 20:31.920]  It is a fact that the CIA, the Ford Foundation and others, for 50 years have radicalized
[20:31.920 --> 20:36.960]  Muslims, that was even the Washington Post, sending textbooks into Pakistan and other
[20:36.960 --> 20:42.760]  countries radicalizing the Muslims, making them violent, why?
[20:42.760 --> 20:50.200]  Because that they've created liberation theology, similar to Reverend Wright, Obama, his preacher,
[20:50.200 --> 20:52.120]  and all the race stuff they spew.
[20:52.120 --> 20:54.040]  Why is that?
[20:54.040 --> 20:59.400]  Why is it that Hattari militia, the federal judge has ordered their release, because all
[20:59.400 --> 21:03.160]  the Hattari militia said is if the new world order keeps coming down on us, we may have
[21:03.160 --> 21:09.480]  to physically fight, meanwhile if I tried to play for you, just go to YouTube and type
[21:09.480 --> 21:16.000]  in Laraza or Mecha or Azadlan, and you will see hundreds of videos of professors and the
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.720]  mayor of LA and congressmen, and we've even gotten some of them on air before, saying
[21:21.720 --> 21:27.160]  yes, whites are scum, whites are racist, you don't belong in this continent, all go home,
[21:27.160 --> 21:32.080]  we can't wait for you to all die, I mean this is more heated rhetoric than Ku Klux
[21:32.080 --> 21:37.400]  Klan, and I'm offended by all of it.
[21:37.400 --> 21:41.280]  But this is just a video, it's on Drudge right now, it's also up at infowars.com and
[21:41.280 --> 21:48.480]  prisonplanet.com, this just came out yesterday from rallies on Friday.
[21:48.480 --> 21:53.120]  And then I'm gonna go over the new film coming out that we have the trailer for, and I was
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.160]  then separately, I didn't know what to make of this a few days ago on Cinco de Mayo when
[21:57.160 --> 22:03.680]  I was sent the trailer for the new Robert Rodriguez, who I've been a fan of, film Machete.
[22:03.680 --> 22:07.480]  I mean the whites are racist, they're evil, it's got, you know, Mexicans running around
[22:07.480 --> 22:12.480]  with machetes, killing the gringo, it looked like a call for race war, then I talked to
[22:12.480 --> 22:18.400]  people who called me, by the way, Hispanic, who work in the film, and it's being finished
[22:18.400 --> 22:24.240]  right now, that are saying, we're worried this is going to hurt and cause a backlash
[22:24.240 --> 22:27.600]  on the Hispanic community, and that's what the globalists want, that's why they fund
[22:27.600 --> 22:33.200]  this, so we're all against each other, instead of being for sovereignty, all of us are tribal,
[22:33.200 --> 22:36.280]  all of us are gang mentality, that's human.
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.400]  How about red, white, and blue?
[22:37.400 --> 22:39.200]  How about Bill of Rights Constitution?
[22:39.200 --> 22:40.800]  How about that VR gang?
[22:40.800 --> 22:43.360]  How about we stand up for that?
[22:43.360 --> 22:45.040]  Why do you think everybody wants to come to America?
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.560]  It hadn't been perfect, but it's had freedom of speech, freedom of private property.
[22:49.560 --> 22:52.760]  That's why 4% of the world population had more than half the wealth.
[22:52.760 --> 22:55.600]  Now we've been taken over, now we're corrupt.
[22:55.600 --> 22:59.360]  But the point is, why do these people say that this is Mexico and they're gonna make
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.360]  it Mexico, well if Mexico's so great or Latin America's so great under those corrupt systems,
[23:04.360 --> 23:09.800]  never getting out from under colonial type rule, why then do they want to come here?
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.880]  Why are they offended by, and the media didn't report this until later, I saw the kids on
[23:14.880 --> 23:18.920]  San Francisco TV, three of the five that got kicked out of school for wearing American
[23:18.920 --> 23:22.280]  flag shirts were Hispanic.
[23:22.280 --> 23:28.920]  You just, it's so offensive to a large portion of Hispanic America, the American flag is
[23:28.920 --> 23:30.920]  offensive.
[23:30.920 --> 23:34.440]  So now when I pull into a Mexican food restaurant, I see Mexican flags everywhere, or I see it
[23:34.440 --> 23:39.680]  on car dealerships, or I see the term La Raza or Mecha, La Raza means the race, or they've
[23:39.680 --> 23:45.040]  got a Texas radio station called the Invasion, and again my wife speaks Spanish, she hears
[23:45.040 --> 23:49.280]  it all, it just blows her away.
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.960]  I mean I want to feel comfortable, I don't want to be enemies with everybody, but these
[23:53.960 --> 23:56.040]  groups say, hey we want to be your enemy.
[23:56.040 --> 23:58.800]  So my question for Hispanic college, and your calls are coming up and I need to go over
[23:58.800 --> 24:02.720]  this first, is what are you hearing in your community?
[24:02.720 --> 24:05.040]  What side do you stand on?
[24:05.040 --> 24:09.800]  Because as long as you're an American and believe in our laws and our freedoms, then
[24:09.800 --> 24:11.480]  I'm all for you.
[24:11.480 --> 24:16.800]  But if you're scared by an American flag and hate white people, I mean, I've got to stand
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.480]  up for myself.
[24:18.480 --> 24:23.400]  Now let's just, again, I could fill up 10 hours, no exaggeration with exactly what
[24:23.400 --> 24:24.400]  you're about to hear.
[24:24.400 --> 24:33.000]  First, there's a UT professor, head of Chicano studies, up in UT Dallas, UT DFW, who says
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.320]  we need to use the plan of San Diego, and I didn't know what plan of San Diego was,
[24:37.320 --> 24:43.080]  that's a plan for Hispanics to kill all whites above the age of 16, don't believe me, Google
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.000]  plan of San Diego, you'll be at the UT website.
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.720]  I mean, can you imagine if a white professor was teaching to kill all blacks, remember when
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.600]  that black professor said kill all whites a few years ago, how big a news it was?
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.120]  Why isn't it news when this type of stuff's going on, or when Robert Rodriguez gets ready
[25:01.120 --> 25:06.480]  to put a film out like this, and he says this is a message to Arizona, that's coming up.
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.480]  And then your phone calls.
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.480]  But first, LA teacher calls for Mexican revolt in the United States.
[25:11.480 --> 25:14.200]  This is sedition.
[25:14.200 --> 25:16.480]  This is pure racism.
[25:16.480 --> 25:20.200]  I mean, if the Ku Klux Klan called for this, they'd be arrested in minutes.
[25:20.200 --> 25:21.240]  This is not free speech.
[25:21.240 --> 25:23.600]  This is a call to arms.
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.960]  Meanwhile, I have the ADL and Southern Prairie Law Center listing me, Ron Paul, and others
[25:27.960 --> 25:31.200]  as if we're seditious, and oath keepers.
[25:31.200 --> 25:33.440]  Mother Jones called oath keepers seditious.
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.160]  They're open to every race, color, you name it, to just follow the Bill of Rights.
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.880]  Again, imagine what would happen to Hitari militia if they talked like this.
[25:41.880 --> 25:42.880]  Here it is.
[25:42.880 --> 25:45.800]  This is just two days ago.
[25:45.800 --> 25:48.280]  This is just two days ago.
[25:48.280 --> 25:50.320]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.280]  This, and again, we have this video up on infowars.com.
[25:53.280 --> 25:55.040]  It's got his full name.
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.800]  It's got all the information, Ron Gaches.
[26:00.800 --> 26:06.400]  He's a history teacher at Santa H.S. in Los Angeles.
[26:06.400 --> 26:08.840]  Imagine being a white kid in this guy's class.
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.840]  Here it is.
[26:09.840 --> 26:16.320]  I want to start off by saying that the young man who spoke a little while ago, one of my
[26:16.320 --> 26:17.320]  students.
[26:17.320 --> 26:24.160]  And that made me so proud because I know that our people have strong leaders for years and
[26:24.160 --> 26:33.880]  years to come.
[26:33.880 --> 26:40.560]  As a militante, a revolutionary Mexican organization here, we understand what the camarada is saying.
[26:40.560 --> 26:41.560]  You're right.
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.560]  This is not just about Mexico.
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.560]  This is about a global struggle against imperialism and capitalism.
[26:46.560 --> 26:52.480]  But we know that all of that is happening in the context that where we now stand is
[26:52.480 --> 26:57.560]  stolen, occupied, Mexico.
[26:57.560 --> 27:05.480]  And the message that we bring, if you want to bring a little bit more of a revolutionary
[27:05.480 --> 27:12.280]  context to this, why is it that these people, these frail, racist, white people want to
[27:12.280 --> 27:14.480]  keep us out of this country?
[27:14.480 --> 27:17.080]  It's not because simply the color of our skin.
[27:17.080 --> 27:19.800]  It's not simply because they just want to exploit us.
[27:19.800 --> 27:21.680]  Let me tell you why.
[27:21.680 --> 27:27.680]  Because on this planet right now, of six billion people at the forefront of the revolutionary
[27:27.680 --> 27:34.280]  movement is the Raza, when you ought to make a stride line.
[27:34.280 --> 27:35.280]  The race.
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.280]  The race.
[27:36.280 --> 27:44.880]  When we go, we have the long history and example of our comandante, Fidel Castro-Ruz.
[27:44.880 --> 27:45.880]  And now Castro.
[27:45.880 --> 27:52.280]  We got Uochales, we got Morales, we got Brazil, Ecuador, you name it.
[27:52.280 --> 27:59.080]  We have nine, nine left of center governments in Latin America right now.
[27:59.080 --> 28:05.360]  And they know something that a one young Argentine called Che Guevara said, it was all the domino
[28:05.360 --> 28:06.360]  theory.
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.600]  And they knew that every single country would go revolutionary, one after the other, after
[28:12.600 --> 28:15.000]  the other, after the other.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.120]  And that's their point, get our guns.
[28:18.120 --> 28:20.640]  You're not getting my guns, buddy.
[28:20.640 --> 28:21.640]  Sorry.
[28:21.640 --> 28:23.640]  So what do they fear?
[28:23.640 --> 28:30.040]  They know that every single country, they know that we no longer will fall through these
[28:30.040 --> 28:31.760]  lies called borders.
[28:31.760 --> 28:34.440]  We know that's what we're doing.
[28:34.440 --> 28:36.520]  We're going to go to break when we come back.
[28:36.520 --> 28:37.880]  I'm going to play the rest of this.
[28:37.880 --> 28:40.000]  This is unedited.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.520]  And literally when I was watching this video on YouTube, there were scores of new ones
[28:45.520 --> 28:49.760]  all saying the same thing and calling for killing all whites as well.
[28:49.760 --> 28:51.760]  I mean, this is incredible.
[28:51.760 --> 29:21.680]  We'll be back.

[29:59.760 --> 30:01.760]  In March, Alex Jones announced
[30:01.760 --> 30:03.760]  that eFoods Direct was putting together
[30:03.760 --> 30:05.760]  a high-volume, pre-production order
[30:05.760 --> 30:07.760]  of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[30:07.760 --> 30:09.760]  By waiting for production and shipping
[30:09.760 --> 30:11.760]  of their orders, families were able
[30:11.760 --> 30:13.760]  to receive one free item
[30:13.760 --> 30:15.760]  for every three that they bought.
[30:15.760 --> 30:17.760]  Since the final shutdown of this
[30:17.760 --> 30:19.760]  buy three get one free program,
[30:19.760 --> 30:21.760]  we've had a lot of folks calling
[30:21.760 --> 30:23.760]  disappointed that they missed the order deadline.

[31:01.760 --> 31:03.760]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius,
[31:03.760 --> 31:05.760]  it is clear that we must act
[31:05.760 --> 31:07.760]  quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice
[31:07.760 --> 31:09.760]  where personal health preferences are concerned.
[31:09.760 --> 31:11.760]  As of January 1st, 2010,
[31:11.760 --> 31:13.760]  Codex Alimentarius was
[31:13.760 --> 31:15.760]  implemented within the European Union
[31:15.760 --> 31:17.760]  resulting in the restricted sale
[31:17.760 --> 31:19.760]  of many natural supplements
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.760]  including colloidal silver. We must
[31:21.760 --> 31:23.760]  take immediate steps to assure a continuing
[31:23.760 --> 31:25.760]  supply of colloidal silver for ourselves
[31:25.760 --> 31:27.760]  and our families. Act now

[31:29.760 --> 31:31.760]  beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[31:31.760 --> 31:33.760]  Colloidal silver is a powerful
[31:33.760 --> 31:35.760]  antipathogenic used for more than
[31:35.760 --> 31:37.760]  100 years as a natural alternative
[31:37.760 --> 31:39.760]  to costly drugs and their dangerous
[31:39.760 --> 31:41.760]  unpredictable side effects.

[42:52.760 --> 42:55.760]  And he kills the bad guys.
[42:55.760 --> 43:00.760]  We didn't cross the border! The border crossed us!
[43:00.760 --> 43:07.760]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.760]  If the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[43:12.760 --> 43:20.760]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[43:20.760 --> 43:29.760]  They're so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[43:29.760 --> 43:34.760]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.760]  You diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[43:39.760 --> 43:43.760]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans.

[44:03.760 --> 44:09.760]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[44:09.760 --> 44:11.760]  It really says that the state is God.
[44:11.760 --> 44:17.760]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[44:17.760 --> 44:23.760]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[44:23.760 --> 44:29.760]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.

[47:13.760 --> 47:22.760]  Finish up with this clip and then start taking your phone calls at 888-201-2244. And I want the truth.
[47:22.760 --> 47:30.760]  I want the beefs with America. People really believe that white people all have tails under their shorts.
[47:30.760 --> 47:32.760]  We're all devils.
[47:32.760 --> 47:42.760]  I see the mainstream corporate media, the university funding, since the 60s, trying to radicalize Hispanics so they don't feel like they're part of America.
[47:42.760 --> 47:53.760]  What happens to the globalist and their program if Hispanic Americans are pro-second amendment, pro-family, which they already are, and pro-private property rights?
[47:53.760 --> 47:59.760]  I mean, what do the big banks want? They want to break down this country. That's why they're funding this.
[47:59.760 --> 48:05.760]  And the FBI doesn't go after groups calling for violence, calling for things if they're Hispanic.
[48:05.760 --> 48:09.760]  If they're white or black, they do. Why is this? What's going on?
[48:09.760 --> 48:21.760]  What is Robert Rodriguez doing putting this film out saying this is a message to Arizona and then it shows, you know, the hero, the Hispanic hero about the sniper rifle, the anti-immigration person.
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.760]  And white people are the villain. And, you know, the Border Patrol agent gets explained to her that you can't control the border.
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.760]  Mexico admits they have the most draconian border policies in the world next to North Korea.
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.760]  They don't like Guatemalans in. You can't have a country and have open borders, especially when you have welfare because then it bankrupts the country.
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.760]  I mean, illegal aliens in 800-plus cities, sanctuary cities, are above the law.
[48:43.760 --> 48:52.760]  They don't even get taken to jail for drunk driving. I saw a Knoxville news article last week where $105,000 was an illegal alien's car. They just let them go with it.
[48:52.760 --> 49:00.760]  Why? Why are they above the law? Because the globalists want them here to break down the border and drive down wages.
[49:00.760 --> 49:07.760]  And it'd be one thing if these groups weren't getting indoctrinated into anti-second amendment socialism.
[49:07.760 --> 49:14.760]  But let's just finish the trailer for Machete. And I'm telling you, this film's coming out in September. There's all these tensions going on.
[49:14.760 --> 49:22.760]  The media is fueling it, lying about the Arizona bill. It just says if they have first contact and pull somebody over for drunk driving or stop them for a tail light or whatever,
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.760]  and they don't have ID, they're going to take them to jail. That happens to citizens.
[49:27.760 --> 49:35.760]  Hell, they've got bills introduced that if they say you might be a terrorist, you're stripped of your citizenship as a citizen and go into some dungeon.
[49:35.760 --> 49:43.760]  We're all losing our rights. Since when does the government care about people's rights? And if this does profile or violate people's rights, I'm against it.
[49:43.760 --> 49:51.760]  That's not the issue here. The issue is this is being hyped up. And Rod Regas thinks he's going to make a bunch of money off Hispanics with this.
[49:51.760 --> 49:58.760]  What he's going to do is, and my money's on this is going to cause violence, and he's going to be liable for this because he's made it political and said it's about Arizona.
[49:58.760 --> 50:00.760]  Let's finish the trailer then go to your calls.
[50:00.760 --> 50:05.760]  There's nothing I'd like more than to see that Mexican dance the Balero at the end of the road.
[50:08.760 --> 50:11.760]  And he kills the bad guys.
[50:11.760 --> 50:16.760]  We didn't cross the border! The border crossed us!
[50:20.760 --> 50:23.760]  Steven Seagal, Jessica Halba.
[50:23.760 --> 50:32.760]  Robert De Niro. Well, this cook arrives. He's got AK-47s and he's laying waste and everything. He gets in the f**king pan.
[50:33.760 --> 50:41.760]  But they soon realized. They just f**ked with the wrong Mexican.
[50:43.760 --> 50:46.760]  Machete. Machete.
[50:46.760 --> 50:54.760]  Okay. And it's groups of Mexican illegals running around hacking up Border Patrol with machetes.
[50:54.760 --> 50:57.760]  And you got Border Patrol getting killed all over the place.
[50:57.760 --> 51:05.760]  Now imagine if I made a movie about killing black people like this. I'd be in jail in five seconds. It's called, I mean, this is incredible.
[51:05.760 --> 51:09.760]  But it's part of a program to divide America against ourselves.
[51:09.760 --> 51:18.760]  And I got a lot of other points I want to make, but I'm going to go to Noel, Grace, Rand, Texacan, Raul, Bob, David, George, Joe, Ralph and others.
[51:18.760 --> 51:27.760]  Only Hispanics. I want to get your view on this because, look, I'm a white guy and I know this. I was taught to be guilty that white people are basically bad.
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.760]  White people are running around groveling to everyone. We are not a bunch of racist devils that want to get you.
[51:32.760 --> 51:39.760]  And when that communist school teacher said, these whites scum don't, it's not that we're brown that they dislike us.
[51:39.760 --> 51:48.760]  It's that we're communist. Well, I mean, over 90% of these illegals, when they become citizens, I've seen the polls vote for gun control.
[51:48.760 --> 51:53.760]  I don't care if you got green skin or blue skin. You're not getting my private property or my guns.
[51:53.760 --> 52:02.760]  And you've been conned in Latin America. Why do you want to come here and set up the same system? I mean, what is the deal?
[52:02.760 --> 52:11.760]  All right, I'm going to shut up. Got a lot of other points I want to make. But remember, three of the five kids kicked out of the San Francisco High School were Hispanic.
[52:11.760 --> 52:18.760]  They want, you can't even wear an American flag. That upsets groups of Hispanics so bad all over the country.
[52:18.760 --> 52:25.760]  They pull down American flags, run Mexican flags up at police stations and at auto repair shops and at post offices.
[52:25.760 --> 52:34.760]  And when people try to stop them, they get arrested. I mean, this is sedition. And I guess they're funding the Hispanic groups to do this so they can crush Hispanics.
[52:34.760 --> 52:42.760]  They don't want Hispanics to be part of America. And that's why the Hispanic members of Robert Rodriguez's staff on this film called me and said,
[52:42.760 --> 52:48.760]  I was already worried about it. And I said, I don't know what to say about the trailer. And I didn't really talk about it. And then I got these phone calls.
[52:48.760 --> 52:53.760]  And I said, boy, this is synchronicity. And they know this is going to end up really causing a backlash against Hispanics.
[52:53.760 --> 53:00.760]  Then they're going to get discriminated against. And then they're going to join the radical groups. They want you radical so they can control you.
[53:00.760 --> 53:04.760]  Let's go to Noel in Illinois. Noel, you're on the air. Welcome.
[53:04.760 --> 53:07.760]  And I'll show until you're doing this afternoon, my friend.
[53:07.760 --> 53:10.760]  Good. I'm doing all right. What do you think of this information?
[53:10.760 --> 53:17.760]  It's pretty, it's pretty disgusting. I'm from, I was born in Chicago, and I'm half Puerto Rican, half Venezuelan.
[53:17.760 --> 53:26.760]  Growing up with a huge, you know, Hispanic background. And, you know, I was taught and brought up on, you know, treating everyone as equal,
[53:26.760 --> 53:32.760]  you know, the way, you know, the good Lord above made us all equal and created us beautifully.
[53:32.760 --> 53:40.760]  And to hear the people like Laraza talking about, you know, just basic race.
[53:40.760 --> 53:51.760]  And Alex, it gets my blood boiling in high school on Cinco de Mayo. We had, you know, the Mexican-American kids in our school,
[53:51.760 --> 53:58.760]  you know, tearing down our American flag, pulling up their Mexican flag, walking out on school and trying to create fights.
[53:58.760 --> 54:04.760]  And so you witnessed that. I mean, that's been on the news. Now, listen, in fact, I called Steve Mason,
[54:04.760 --> 54:10.760]  who runs an access show, he has this footage, I couldn't find it, of Gus Garcia when he was mayor of Austin.
[54:10.760 --> 54:16.760]  I'm going to play this saying Hispanics are the master god race descended from aliens.
[54:16.760 --> 54:24.760]  I mean, this Laraza thing was cooked up by the CIA. That's on record telling, telling them they're the god race.
[54:24.760 --> 54:28.760]  Wait till I play that. I'm going to play that later in the week. He's going to bring it by Monday.
[54:28.760 --> 54:34.760]  I mean, that's our city council. I mean, can you imagine? I mean, what do you think's behind this?
[54:34.760 --> 54:41.760]  You know, you hit the nail in the coffin talking about the CIA. The CIA infiltrated the Black Panthers.
[54:41.760 --> 54:48.760]  They're just trying to create racial tension and get us diverted to what's really going on with these globalists.
[54:48.760 --> 54:54.760]  I mean, too, for my Hispanic friends in Illinois around the Chicago land area and those listening in right now,
[54:54.760 --> 55:00.760]  reeducate our Hispanic friends on the Constitution and let them know just how beautiful our country is
[55:00.760 --> 55:02.760]  and how beautiful freedom is.
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.760]  Great points, Noel, but what this is going to do is this is going to encourage white racists.
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.760]  This is going to make other whites who aren't sophisticated get into their Raza and this is going to play,
[55:12.760 --> 55:18.760]  and then Mexicans and others are going to get persecuted, which then just adds to the whole thing.
[55:18.760 --> 55:24.760]  It's disgusting. These globalists know what they're doing. They're smart and sophisticated in what they're doing
[55:24.760 --> 55:30.760]  and we need to one-up them and do everything we can to all these documentaries, translate them in Spanish
[55:30.760 --> 55:34.760]  and teach our friends what's going on in Mexico, what's going on here.
[55:34.760 --> 55:37.760]  Noel, what do you want to say to Robert Rodriguez in 2010?
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.760]  What do you want to say to Robert Rodriguez? I guarantee he's going to say this.
[55:41.760 --> 55:48.760]  Well, Robert Rodriguez needs to understand that it's not about illegal immigration in the country.
[55:48.760 --> 55:54.760]  It's about the globalists trying to set up racial tension to get us diverted to what's really going on
[55:54.760 --> 56:00.760]  in this corrupt system in the world. We need to come together as one peacefully and go after the real criminals,
[56:00.760 --> 56:02.760]  the real racists, and those are the globalists.
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.760]  Goldman Sachs, the eugenicist. Well said, Noel. Let's jam in one quick call.
[56:07.760 --> 56:10.760]  Grace in Texas, go ahead.
[56:10.760 --> 56:13.760]  Yes, this is Grace. Welcome.
[56:13.760 --> 56:22.760]  Okay. My whole thing is that it is, you're absolutely correct, it's a setup.
[56:22.760 --> 56:29.760]  But what Hispanics don't understand is that we are the Hispanics that have been here for generations
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.760]  and we're Americans. We're living the American dream.
[56:34.760 --> 56:41.760]  But what they're trying to set us up is to stay to keep the poverty, the masses,
[56:41.760 --> 56:46.760]  let them call the border to create more. He's absolutely right with what your last caller said.
[56:46.760 --> 56:50.760]  But what are they going to do about the biracial children?
[56:50.760 --> 56:56.760]  Are they going to kill my grandbaby who's half white and half Hispanic but looks white,
[56:56.760 --> 57:00.760]  but the other grandbaby who looks totally Mexican?
[57:00.760 --> 57:04.760]  So what are they going to do about the biracial children?
[57:04.760 --> 57:06.760]  Well, according to the plan of San Diego, they're going to have to die.
[57:06.760 --> 57:10.760]  Ma'am, I'm going to go to break. I want to come back to you, let you finish up, Grace,
[57:10.760 --> 57:14.760]  and I want to hurry through calls because we're getting into banking in the last 30 minutes.
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.760]  Rand, Texican, Paul, Bob, David, George, Joe, Ralph, and others.
[57:19.760 --> 57:22.760]  Look, we got to get the message out because look at the corporate media.
[57:22.760 --> 57:27.760]  It's owned by the globalists. It's pushing this like it's good because they don't want Hispanics
[57:27.760 --> 57:32.760]  to be able to truly become American and be part of the free market bill of rights system.
[57:32.760 --> 57:36.760]  They want to play us off against each other. We'll be right back. Stay there.
[57:36.760 --> 57:42.760]  This is very important information. We're going to hear from Hispanic Americans on this straight ahead,
[57:42.760 --> 58:08.760]  and I hope Robert Rodriguez is listening.
[58:08.760 --> 58:15.760]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[58:15.760 --> 58:20.760]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[58:20.760 --> 58:23.760]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[58:23.760 --> 58:28.760]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[58:28.760 --> 58:31.760]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[58:31.760 --> 58:37.760]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.760]  Atari militia. Nothing about race. They say if the government keeps cracking down on us,
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.760]  we'll have to physically fight back. They get arrested.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.760]  Federal judges ordered them to release. The feds haven't done it.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:40.760]  Meanwhile, literally hundreds of videos of rallies everywhere talking about killing the gringo.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.760]  The gringo's the devil. The average gringo's watching baseball and football like everybody else
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.760]  and doesn't know they're having a hole in the ground. I will assure you.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:53.760]  But what this is going to do is this is going to make gringos start not trusting Hispanics
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.760]  and Hispanics not like gringos. Can't we see what's happening?
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.760]  Grace, Rand, others? Grace, I'm going to try to shut up for a moment.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.760]  Make your point from Texas. Go ahead.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.760]  Yes. We are living the American dream.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.760]  We are the, we become, my husband and I, part of the upper middle class.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.760]  This is what the administration doesn't want.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:21.760]  Now, that's why they're opening the borders and inciting this kind of fever,
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.760]  because the Hispanics that are living the American dream,
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.760]  who are Navy commanders, who are part of administrations in ISD,
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.760]  who are teachers now and we're conservative Republicans,
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:39.760]  we're the ones they don't like because we want to be just called Americans.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.760]  Well, in fact, the radical Areca and Kistas have a word for it.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.760]  It means rotten fruit in Spanish.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.760]  And I mean, do you ever feel pressure to like be part of this whole Raza thing?
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.760]  Because that's what this looks like to me.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.760]  Yes. Down in the valley in Texas, they're all Democrats.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:03.760]  And our own family says, the only reason you're a Republican is because you have money in the bank.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:11.760]  And our own daughter is now joining that left-wing rivals in Oakland and San Francisco,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.760]  and she's joined against us.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:24.760]  And we'll never live in Texas because she says we're just a bunch of gun-toting conservative Republicans.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.760]  Well, since when is it bad to own a gun to protect yourself?
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.760]  That's a basic freedom.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:36.760]  Okay, but if you decide why it's an immune side violence among the Hispanics against the gringos,
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.760]  then the government's going to take away those guns.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.760]  I agree. And no, that's a great point.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.760]  And that's exactly what Hispanics are calling me and warning me about.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.760]  And that's how I even learned about this many years ago.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.760]  Grace, God bless you.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.760]  It is booing my heart to know that, I mean, I've always told myself,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.760]  oh, it's maybe 5% of Hispanics that have this view.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.760]  But now the media is trying to mainstream it to where if you're Hispanic, you've got to have these views.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.760]  And I'm telling you, it's going to make the gringos who don't think like this start getting paranoid
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.760]  and start becoming racist towards you.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.760]  And we do not need that.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.760]  That's why the Hispanic members of Rodriguez's crew called me.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.760]  They're smart.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.760]  They said, man, this is because they saw non-disclosure agreements.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760]  They can't tell me.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.760]  They just said, look, it's worse than even the trailer.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.760]  Let's talk to Rand in Texas.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.760]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760]  Alex, how's it going today?
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  Not good.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.760]  Well, the reason I'm calling is because I'm really mad about what I'm hearing out there.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:41.760]  Growing up, I'm really from South Texas, but growing up, I had to dealt with the word you were using earlier
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.760]  that you couldn't pronounce called Porto.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.760]  That Porto, yeah, that's it.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:53.760]  Basically considered a gringo, they say basically I'm as wide as you, which I got no problem with that.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  But all I'm saying is that I'm coming from four generations of Texans, not Mexicans.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.760]  And we're basically getting stereotyped and combined with the Mexicans, which I don't agree with.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.760]  And there's all this racial tension.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:19.760]  Alex, all I want to do is basically challenge all the Tejanos out there to stand up for their Bill of Rights and the American freedom.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.760]  Well, God bless you.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760]  We're going to go to break in a moment.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.760]  I want you to come back briefly and talk about the type of persecution you went through.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.760]  Because I've been doing deep research on this for many years.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.760]  And, you know, the Porto, you mean rotten fruit, the way Portos get stabbed and killed.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.760]  I want to find out if that's accurate from what you've seen.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.760]  And why would somebody not want to choose America and the Bill of Rights and private property and guns
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.760]  over living like they do in Mexico under a corrupt state?
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.760]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.760]  I mean, I frankly wouldn't care if there were 30 million illegals if they'd be pro-second amendment.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760]  But no, they're not.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:07.760]  So, no, stay there.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:56.760]  We're going to break in a moment.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:14.760]  We're talking to an American who happens to be Hispanic, ran from Texas.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:22.760]  In fact, I wanted to refresh my memory today, so I did about 30 minutes of research.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.760]  Jose Antonio Navarro, known as the father of the first Texas Constitution, Hispanic,
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.760]  more than 30 of the people that died at the Alamo, Hispanic.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:39.760]  What the media is doing is robbing Hispanic Americans of their heritage.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:46.760]  And again, when I was in public school, America's bad, Texas is bad, all these lies, all these distortions.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.760]  And of course, there's racist white people and bad stuff that they've done.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]  I stand against them.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.760]  The point is, Mexico has tripled the resources of the United States, conservatively.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.760]  Oil, gold, timber, the land, the fertile soil.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.760]  They have more billionaires than the U.S. does, but the poorest population.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:11.760]  And what you've got is this Mexican elite teamed up with the globalists that love to use racial division,
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.760]  because they don't want 30-plus million illegals that come here to learn about the second amendment and private property.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.760]  That's why the big universities are teaching them communism.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:28.760]  And I played a clip last hour of a Hispanic teacher in California with his students up there saying,
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.760]  whites are devils.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.760]  We're going to get them.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.760]  We're communists.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.760]  We're taken over.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.760]  But he tells the truth.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.760]  He says, whites don't dislike us because we're brown.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.760]  They dislike us because we're communists.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.760]  Well, why would you want to be a communist?
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.760]  I love the fictional character Tony Montana.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.760]  He doesn't like communism or slavery, but he ran, brought up the term.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.760]  Yeah, it's Portchot or Rotten Fruit or the Hispanic Uncle Tom.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:59.760]  How are you an Uncle Tom if you want to own your own property and not have an L Heffey shaking your family down for money?
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.760]  Or because you own a firearm, which you can't do in Mexico.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.760]  This is so elementary.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:12.760]  Again, the new film Machete coming out, Robert Rodriguez says the border didn't, we didn't cross the border across us.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:18.760]  They cut to all these white actors, Robert De Niro, Don Johnson saying racist things about Mexicans.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.760]  Again, false flagging white people.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:28.760]  And then it shows Mexicans with machetes killing the gringos and killing the border patrol.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:38.760]  I mean, this is revolutionary and this mirrors the real stuff, the fire bombings in Santa Cruz, the murders, the white ranchers being killed in South Texas and Arizona.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.760]  I mean, this is real.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.760]  And so what they're doing is trying to radicalize Hispanic Americans.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.760]  And maybe it is for a long term plan because they don't want to have more Hispanics in America.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.760]  Maybe it's meant to shut it down later.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760]  I don't know. This is very sophisticated.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.760]  But when Robert Rodriguez's people contacted me, people inside his organization say we're really worried about this film.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.760]  It's going to be a backlash against Hispanics.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.760]  Well, I mean, you can tell why because it dovetails with all of this racist garbage that's being spewed out here.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:20.760]  Rand, for stations just joined us, some stations don't care that first five-minute segment, recap what you went through as a Hispanic American who saw himself as an American.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.760]  Because the last lady was saying the same thing for her.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.760]  She sees herself as a pro-property right second amendment Hispanic American.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.760]  And so her own daughter is coming against her saying, you got to join the Raza.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.760]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.760]  Wow, Alex, I just want to say it again.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:45.760]  Growing up in South Texas, actually north-central Texas, I went through that persecution.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:49.760]  Basically, Mexican people asked me, well, what part of Mexico are you from?
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760]  And I said, well, I'm an American.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  They basically took that as an insult and called me a porcho.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.760]  And I said, what is a porcho?
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.760]  They said, well, a porcho is basically a white boy.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.760]  I guess, well, if that's the title you give me, I guess that's what it is just because I am American.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.760]  I don't have any roots in Mexico.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760]  I have nothing against the Mexican people.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.760]  I have been against Mexican people being here legally, paying their taxes just like I do.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:21.760]  What we need to realize out there, folks, is that we need to stand together as espionoles or jahanos
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.760]  and all over the nation as Hispanic Americans stand up together and fight the globalists
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.760]  and what's really going on.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.760]  What did you think of me playing that clip of that?
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.760]  Because I can play countless clips of them saying, we're going to have communism.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.760]  We're going to get the gringos.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.760]  We're going to kick them out.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760]  They're scum.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.760]  I mean, that is going to take white people, believe me, who on average,
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.760]  that's like 95% are not racist towards Hispanics.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.760]  That's going to make them start.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.760]  I mean, that's going to really be a backlash.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.760]  It's already happening out there.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.760]  And people need to realize this and see through the lies and what's going on.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.760]  And Hispanics should come together again, like I say, and educate those Mexicals
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.760]  or people that are out there that don't know.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:11.760]  Listen, I would vote for Hispanic Americans all day long, just like I did Debra Medina.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.760]  If they're pro-Second Amendment and sovereignty, all I've got is my republic.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.760]  All I've got is those rights that are so special that nobody else has got.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.760]  Does that mean America's perfect?
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.760]  No, because we're violating that.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.760]  I mean, to hear them saying communism is good, to hear them saying this,
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.760]  and it's just, it is so evil.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.760]  Rand, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760]  God bless you.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.760]  It buoys my heart to hear you saying this.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.760]  It's what we're only taking calls from Hispanics to get their view.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.760]  I mean, if you agree with what these folks are saying, I'm telling you, though,
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.760]  the illegitimate government is behind this.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.760]  Texican in Texas.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.760]  You're on the year.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760]  Go ahead.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760]  Hey, Alex, good to talk to you.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760]  Good to talk to you.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  Last time I saw you was at End of Fed here in Dallas,
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.760]  and I really wanted to go say hi to you,
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  but there's so many people around you.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.760]  But anyway, my opinion is, you know, I'm from here.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  I was born in South Texas, raised in Corpus Christi,
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.760]  and you know, gringos is all, we all got along with each other.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.760]  I don't see how, I guess it was the illegals,
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.760]  because they're kind of separated.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.760]  They don't live in the same middle-class neighborhood as the rest of us.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760]  Exactly.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.760]  No, they want us all fighting with each other.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  I mean, think of the illegal aliens at that San Francisco school
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.760]  who kicked out Hispanics.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  It was Hispanics wearing American flags.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.760]  Those Hispanics want to be Americans,
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.760]  and the Mexicans are up here intimidating them.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.760]  Absolutely.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.760]  In fact, when I was a kid, I was telling the story about that the other day
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.760]  at the bar while I was talking to some people about this very same subject,
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.760]  and I had a shirt that my mom put an American flag on it.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.760]  And I remember, you know, Mrs. Welsh, you know,
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.760]  explaining to me the colors of the flag and what they represented.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.760]  And you know, my dad was a World War II, Korean War guy,
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.760]  three purple hearts, silver star, and bronze star,
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  clearly decorated.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.760]  You know, my son is an Air Force officer currently serving.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760]  You know, he's against the war.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.760]  He's pro-Ron Paul, you know.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.760]  You know, it's almost behind us.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760]  We love our culture.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760]  We love our music.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760]  We love our food, you know.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.760]  Well, listen, I love your culture, too.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.760]  So sickening about this, I wish Mexico was free.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.760]  I mean, I might retire down there.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.760]  Well, they should have just taken it when they had the chance.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.760]  You know, we paid them for Southwest.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.760]  I mean, Texas, we outright fought them for it.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.760]  I mean, that's how long my family's been here on both sides,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760]  just like the color before me.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.760]  I looked the number up.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.760]  I looked the number up.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.760]  I was having an argument with my dad this morning and he said,
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.760]  no, half of the people in the war for Texas were Hispanic.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.760]  And I said, I thought it was a third.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.760]  I went and looked it up at least a half were Hispanic.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760]  They don't teach that.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.760]  They don't want people to feel like they belong here.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.760]  Jose Antonio Navarro was one of the founders of the Constitution.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]  When I found that out, when I was living in San Antonio,
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760]  and then I found out, you know,
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.760]  well, then we had just a violent was our vice president.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760]  Right?
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.760]  Yes.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.760]  So we got along.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.760]  Okay.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:03.760]  And then you can ask my mother,
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.760]  she's from Orange City, down in the country.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  And she's not with us anymore, but back in the old days,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.760]  she said, hey, all the gringos spoke Spanish.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.760]  Everybody got along.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  Well, everybody was intermarrying too.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]  People were doing that.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.760]  People just like now, just like you go anywhere else.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.760]  You know, maybe the blacks had it harder than us, you know,
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.760]  but I mean, look, everybody's had it.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.760]  Nothing was perfect.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760]  There was discrimination.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.760]  But you go down to Mexico,
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.760]  no matter who you are and try to set something up,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760]  you're going to get discriminated against.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  That's tribalism.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.760]  But I've really studied this history and that's,
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760]  and I agree with you.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.760]  That's what's so sick about this, Texan,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  is that, do you agree with me though that the federal government
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.760]  is injecting this because they're scared of these new Hispanics
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.760]  whose culture fits into our republic,
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.760]  actually becoming what they would call right wing?
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.760]  Well, you know, this government is completely corrupt.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760]  And it's just, like you said,
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.760]  it's not even our government anymore.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.760]  I mean, what do you think my son wants to get out of the Air Force?
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760]  He just doesn't.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760]  Everybody knows.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  Exactly.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.760]  People say, why do you support America?
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.760]  It's got all these wars and it's evil.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  My America died when they killed Kennedy.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.760]  That's really the mark.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.760]  1963 in Dallas, Texas,
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  that's when the republic started dying.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.760]  I want my republic back
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.760]  and I want my neighbors to be whatever color they want.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.760]  I just want them to be pro-freedom.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.760]  I mean, my God, why did our country have half the wealth
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.760]  in the world with 4% of the population
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.760]  because we had more liberty.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760]  Liberty creates wealth.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760]  God bless you, Texan.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.760]  I'm going to go fast to Raul, Bob, David, George, Joe, Ralph and others.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.760]  And again, this is what most Hispanics from my study are for.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.760]  Freedom, liberty, the Second Amendment, private property.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.760]  But the mainstream media is trying to make Mexicans,
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.760]  anybody that has a Mexican heritage,
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.760]  feel like they got to be part of this.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.760]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.760]  was putting together a high-volume pre-production order
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.760]  of the new quick-fix meals.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.760]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders,
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.760]  families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.760]  Since the final shutdown of this Buy 3, Get 1, Free program,
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.760]  we've had a lot of folks calling,
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.760]  disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.760]  Listen carefully.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.760]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com

[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.760]  of the selected products.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.760]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.760]  Thanks for watching.

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.760]  This program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.760]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.760]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.760]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.760]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.760]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.760]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.760]  It's here.

[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.760]  You know, growing up in Dallas playing football and basketball and baseball,
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.760]  I didn't think this is a black kid, this is a Hispanic kid, this is a white kid.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.760]  Things are worse now than they were back then.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.760]  Because the media, if you're against government-run healthcare,
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.760]  written by the insurance companies, they call you a racist.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.760]  They use it as a weapon.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.760]  And now Robert Rodriguez has got a race war film
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.760]  or his own people that work for him who are Hispanic or are concerned.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.760]  Now it's just out in the open and the mainstream media covers it up.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.760]  We have to make a decision.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.760]  What side are we on?
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.760]  Are we for the republic and the bill of rights?
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.760]  It isn't perfect, but it's better than everything else.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.760]  I mean, how could kids in San Francisco at a high school,
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.760]  and the media didn't even say this for three days, it was later on MSNBC,
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.760]  that three of the five kids that were kicked out were Hispanic
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.760]  and that there were their Hispanic parents going,
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.760]  look, they're Americans.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760]  They're allowed to wear American flags.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.760]  They're sick of all this Mexico stuff.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.760]  I mean, even if you believe Mexico previously really had the Southwest
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.760]  and even though the French had it and the Russians had California,
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.760]  nobody could hold it.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.760]  Still, why would you want this to be Mexico?
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760]  Look at it.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.760]  It's our bill of rights that's so precious.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.760]  And let's just go back to your calls.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.760]  Raul in California, what's your view on this, sir?
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.760]  Hello, sir, how are you doing?
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.760]  Doing all right.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.760]  I'm doing all right.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.760]  Thank you so much for what you do.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.760]  First of all, I'm so pissed off.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.760]  I'm so disgusted of what Latinos are doing down in the south.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:58.760]  They make my race, you know, Mexican a disgrace, you know?
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.760]  Well, it's the media doing that.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.760]  It's the media that's setting all this up.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:07.760]  I mean, it's like they're putting two pit bulls in a cage to kill each other
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.760]  and we need to realize that. Go ahead.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.760]  Exactly. One thing that all these Latinos,
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.760]  they're not educated out of Jonesy because even as my parents,
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.760]  what do you think was going on in this world?
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760]  And they start going off.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.760]  What the Gringos are doing is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.760]  And I tell them, look at what you guys are saying.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.760]  You guys stop blaming the Gringos.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.760]  It's not them.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.760]  It's this new world order that's being into place
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:36.760]  and they're raising nonsense policies, put them into place
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.760]  so they could have everybody distracted on these policies
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.760]  instead of what is the real issue on hand.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.760]  We should be dealing with this new world order and later on,
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.760]  there will be immigration, there will be marriages,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.760]  there will be anything else.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.760]  We should be dealing with these people first and bring them to Jonesy.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.760]  Exactly.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760]  Look, it's a North American Union.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.760]  They say in the North American Union documents they'll use,
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.760]  racial strife to just get rid of the border entirely,
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.760]  and then we'll all just be slaves.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.760]  Exactly.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.760]  And if I'm under me myself, I can't, I'm a great American.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.760]  I actually know I was a year old. I got my green card when I was five years old.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.760]  And then two years ago, I became a citizen.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.760]  Our citizenship was something in the military before I had years.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.760]  You know?
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.760]  And it gets on my nerves that we're fighting this ridiculous bogus war
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.760]  when reality is something else, you know?
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.760]  Let me ask you this question, Raul.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.760]  When you talk to your Hispanic friends,
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.760]  what, I mean, are you seeing pressure to force them into this whole
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.760]  raza-communist movement, or what are you seeing?
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.760]  Pretty much the same thing, you know, that they tell me,
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.760]  they tell me, you're a traitor, you're a traitor.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.760]  Why are you saying this?
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.760]  I even tell them, do you really want the same type of government in the United States?
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.760]  Do you want communism in the United States?
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.760]  Do you want organized crime from Mexico in the United States?
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760]  You know, and I don't want it.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760]  Exactly.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:05.760]  That's what you're doing by you saying all this, all this.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.760]  That means you're promoting, you're promoting the Mexican agenda,
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760]  the New York agenda into the United States.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.760]  And that's what we don't want, you know?
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.760]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.760]  Exactly.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.760]  We have the globalists running Washington and then attacking from all sides.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.760]  What would you like to say to Robert Rodriguez, though?
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.760]  Because this is a guy that's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:31.760]  He's filthy rich, and he is, from the Hispanics I've talked to,
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.760]  that's who warned me about this, people that work with him,
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:41.760]  they believe this is going to actually create division and hurt Latinos.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760]  Pretty much I don't want to tell them.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.760]  It's not about being Mexican.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.760]  It's not about being black, being white, being Asian, being black.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760]  It's about humanity.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:56.760]  It's about understanding that once you promote this hatred against racism
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:04.760]  and into society, you're automatically giving the way for the devil to do his...
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.760]  His deeds.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.760]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.760]  Great points.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.760]  I mean, we can play the clips.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.760]  That's what's promoted on the colleges and the universities and the schools
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.760]  is that whites are the devil and must be driven out.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.760]  What do you think whites are going to do?
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.760]  They're going to start going after Hispanics.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.760]  I mean, the globalists are putting us in a cage like pit bulls to kill each other.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.760]  And I want to deal with that.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  I want to give the number out to Troublemaker Studios when we come back from break.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.760]  So you can call Robert Rodriguez and let him know what you think about this new film, Machete.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.760]  This folk icon who kills the gringo.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760]  What is your view of this?
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.760]  Are you concerned about this?
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.760]  Because if there is violence, there's already violence,
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.760]  but if there's violence that comes out of this, it's just going to be horrible.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.760]  God bless you.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.760]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.760]  Bob and Carolina.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.760]  Don't know what Carolina, but from Carolina.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.760]  Bob, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.760]  Hey, Bob.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.760]  First of all, I'd like to say, don't keep up with Angela or the tacos because I know you love them.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:10.760]  Secondly, I'd like to say that we love white people.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.760]  We don't want to fight with the white people.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.760]  All my Hispanic, Mexican, whatever, we don't want to fight.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  Let me just say, the average white person is a thumb-sucking, guilty person who thinks they're evil.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.760]  So believe me, the white people don't want to get you either, but they are starting to get scared.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760]  Yeah, yeah. And that's what it's for.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.760]  I mean, I've seen it in LA.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:33.760]  Look, I grew up in LA with those 14 gangs in my school.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.760]  My father was a principal at LAUSD.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.760]  There's only so many roads that Hispanics can go down.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:53.760]  And from what I've seen growing up, you can either be in a gang or you can be educated in like a La Raza style education that is basically communist.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.760]  It's basically, LA Unified is a basically communist system and they teach basic socialism communism.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  And again, that's the big bankers that have done that.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.760]  They've only given Hispanics the road to be communist with the big banks funding it.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:18.760]  Can't people see that, that the big banks don't want Hispanics to be part of America and begun toting private property owning members of freedom?
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760]  Absolutely.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:27.760]  And for the Hispanic people, I mean, look, there's bad people that are white, that are black, that are Hispanic.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.760]  That's just the way it's going to be.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.760]  And there's good people that are white, that are black, and that are Hispanic.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:41.760]  And the good people need to stand up and they need to speak out and they need to stick together because that's what it's going to come down to.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.760]  Well, I agree.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.760]  But listen, it's more than that.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.760]  There's great political power, as Hitler proved, through racial politics.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.760]  Well, where are the Hispanic leaders that are going to lead the conservative, libertarian, patriot way?
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.760]  I mean, again, they're moral, so they're not out looking for power.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760]  They need to.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  We need powerful Hispanic leaders that are anti-New World Order that I and Ron Paul and others can support.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.760]  I would do it instantly.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.760]  I would promote them for office.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.760]  I would get them campaign donations.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.760]  Look, I wouldn't care if the whole Congress was 500 Hispanics.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.760]  If they give me freedom and cut my taxes, I don't give one, you know what?
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.760]  I want freedom.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.760]  And I can't believe the big banks are turning the Hispanics into an army of New World Order socialism.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.760]  It's dangerous.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.760]  It is dangerous.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:38.760]  And they have like the injectors that also have to not have the leaders like you said.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:44.760]  If you look on TV or the movies or anything like that, we only have a whole lot of leaders to look up to.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.760]  We need them.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.760]  God bless you.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760]  I'm out of time.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:49.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.760]  Tomorrow, I'm going to have again.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  We don't have guests on.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760]  We have a couple big guests tomorrow.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.760]  Nothing but Hispanic callers.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  I want to hear more of this.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760]  This is making me feel a lot better.

[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:11.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.760]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:21.760]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:29.760]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:36.760]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:46.760]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:55.760]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:17.760]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:33.760]  We have a new film out, by the way, made by William Lewis, which is Don't Try It On Me, now available at infowars.com, about states' rights and amendment.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.760]  We need to be part of a tribal gang mentality, but not on race.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:57.760]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, Tarpley Beyond, with us during the weekday show for a full hour this week. I'm going to do this full segment with him. Part of the next, I'm going to jam in David, George, Joe, Ralph, and a few others, commenting about how the media Hollywood is trying to create racial division between Hispanics, whites, and others of the great game of division.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:11.760]  But Robert Rodriguez, the accomplished director, is here in Austin, Texas, and he has made a new film called Machete that basically invokes race war from the trailer, and I've talked to people on his staff about it.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:23.760]  I'm going to reach out to him this week. I don't want you to be hateful, but especially Hispanics that want to let him know what they think about what he's doing and how this may cause a backlash against Hispanics.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:35.760]  The number is 512. It's good to call them today and tomorrow when they're there. 512-334-7777. That's 512-334-7777.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:53.760]  Or fax 512-391-1529. Again, that's fax 512-391-1529. Or if you want to write them a letter, it's 4900 Old Mainer Road, Austin, Texas, 787-23. Because I don't think he's a bad guy.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:05.760]  I talked to a few film directors I know that know him. I talked to a Hispanic film producer that I'm good friends with, and he said, look, Rodriguez just thinks this is a fun exploitation film.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:19.760]  But he's being played here. 4900 Old Mainer Road, Austin, Texas, 787-23. But to also call him tomorrow and just explain to him what's going on here. That's very, very important to do.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:27.760]  Let's go to Webster Griffin Tarpley because White House doesn't rule out sabotage in Thursday's Wild Wall Street plunge.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:37.760]  Tarpley two years ago, during the last plunge predicted that by 2010, we would see the stimulus money run out. He's on record. He's in Obama deception and fall the republic.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:48.760]  One film made over a year ago, one six months ago, saying everything has now happened. And so he's here to break down what he thinks happened in the market Thursday with a thousand point drop.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:58.760]  And what's happening with Greece, what the IMF and World Bank are doing, Goldman Sachs now in the emails, premeditatedly doing this as a financial bomb.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:08.760]  They want to wreck it. It's the false banker economy against the real economy of Main Street. That's the real enemy. And that's why they want us racially divided fighting with each other.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.760]  Webster, good to have you here with us.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.760]  Thank you, Alex. How are you?
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:17.760]  Good. You've got the floor. Break down your intel on the thousand point plunge and what's happening right now globally.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  First of all, on the thousand points in 10 minutes on Thursday afternoon, you got to realize that a panic was already there. You had a preexisting panic, meaning that you had a lot of people dumping assets.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:40.760]  And in particular, it's likely that some of the hedge funds, some of the hyenas in this hedge fund wolf pack that attacks Greece and others.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:50.760]  People, there are some hedge funds who bet wrong and they were very likely dumping assets, panic, distress sales of assets into an already panicked market.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:37:03.760]  Now, it's made worse by the fact that you've got these new things, these relatively new program trading has been around for 10 or 20 years, but now you've got high frequency trading and flash trading.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:12.760]  And these are computer trading programs that go thousands of times a second, even more than that.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:22.760]  So you've got somebody dumping assets and then as this panic is building, you're getting what you already had in 1929. This part is not new.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:31.760]  You've got a lot of people who are put in stop-loss orders and the stop-loss orders say, if the stock goes to X, then sell my shares at X.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:39.760]  So as you start going through those stop-loss orders, you get a cascading snowballing effect as it goes down.
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:47.760]  So you go down to 10,000, to 9,900, to 9,800 and wherever it ended up.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  Then, of course, the plunge protection team comes in. This is the most obvious thing in the world.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:38:04.760]  The PPT, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets and the way they do it usually is through futures in Chicago where they buy the futures to updraft the market.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:12.760]  They keep the price of the future in Chicago above the price of the stock in New York so that the program traders will then sell the future by the stock.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:19.760]  And then with a couple of hundred million in Chicago, you can generate billions and billions of buying in New York.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.760]  So that's what brought it back, if you will. The artificial part of this is the recovery.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:32.760]  And I'm quite sure that within a week or two, we will get down to the same level that we just saw because that's what you see when you've got a panicked market.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.760]  It may go down to a certain level, then bounce up halfway, but then it'll be down there again quite soon.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.760]  So that's a world panic and I think that's what people should see.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:45.760]  This is the second wave of the world economic depression.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.760]  This is not a business cycle. This is not a recession. This is a breakdown crisis.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.760]  By the way, I mean, you've written a book on this many years ago.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.760]  Over two years ago, you predicted that it would start in Greece, go to Portugal, Spain.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.760]  You're not here whistling Dixie.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:06.760]  I mean, I want to just point out Webster Tarpley is one of our chief economic advisors.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.760]  You know exactly what you're talking about with the bona fides.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.760]  What you've said has come true because you understand the technical facts at a deep level.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:20.760]  Thank you very much. It's a world economic depression and a disintegration of the disintegration is this.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:26.760]  We already had the disintegration of some banks, but now you're going to get the disintegration of the euro,
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  a chaotic collapse, something that nobody should want, the chaotic collapse of the European Central Bank.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.760]  And by the way, this is now mainstream news. You were saying this two years ago, they laugh.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  Now they're saying in the New York Times, the euro may disintegrate tomorrow.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.760]  Sure, the euro could be a matter of just a week or months.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.760]  I would also point that the British pound, because of the position of the British pound,
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  They're saying Britain's next to fall, yeah.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:58.760]  They will be sucked into this maelstrom, this whirlpool of bankruptcy and hedge fund speculation.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:03.760]  The other thing though is once you get the British pound going down and the British banks,
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.760]  that also brings down the euro-dollar market.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.760]  There's a huge mass of trillions of US dollars that have been sitting in London.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.760]  Yeah, the carry trade. And London is now bigger than New York financially.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  Right. So the euro-dollar market, of course, the euro-dollar is just the same as any other dollar when it comes to a market.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  So you've got this problem of a whole bunch of dollars that are beyond the reach of the US government,
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.760]  and the British regulatory regime is worth nothing.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.760]  The other thing is interbank lending in Europe has now frozen.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.760]  It has seized up. In other words, when you get a systemic crisis, banks will not lend to each other.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:47.760]  And this, it doesn't just mean Banco Santander or Banco de Bilbao of Spain or the various Italian banks.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.760]  Unicredito is one of the biggest banks in the world.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.760]  And it's probably reaching up to Deutsche Bank in Germany and Barclays Bank in Britain.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.760]  Societé Generale, certainly in big trouble, BNP Paribas.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.760]  These are all bank stocks that have lost 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 percent in the past week.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.760]  But if they're seizing up, that means Wall Street is seizing up too.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.760]  And we have this emergency conference. You can see how scared the European leaders are.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:18.760]  The European finance ministers are meeting in Brussels right now, and they're coming up with what they call the Defense Fund against the Wolfpack.
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  The Wolfpack would be the hedge funds.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.760]  But the Wolfpack is them. They're all chief members or former heads of the Wolfpack.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.760]  More or less. But here's the idea. If you wanted to stop this, there are some things you can do.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.760]  If you're under attack by hedge funds, you ban hedge funds.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.760]  If the hedge funds are using credit default swaps, you ban those.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.760]  Okay, we know what they should do, but what are they saying they're going to do?
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:47.760]  Well, they're going to come up. They came up with $150 billion for Greece, and that's now going through.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:54.760]  And now they're going to have $645 billion. It's 500 billion euros, basically.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:00.760]  So $650 billion U.S. dollars to defend the euro against these hedge funds.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.760]  Hedge fund hyenas and...
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:09.760]  And this is overnight. I mean, as soon as Greece got the $164 billion or whatever, you say $150, now they need $600 billion.
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.760]  And, of course, I've been reading that more than half this money is coming from the American taxpayer.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:22.760]  Well, you can figure that whenever the IMF gets into the act, the IMF board just approved $40 billion U.S. dollars for Greece.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.760]  So the U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for at least one-fifth of that.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  So call it $8 or $9 billion, a little bit less than one-fifth.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  The other thing is, of course, the U.S. has a $100 billion line of credit to the IMF, so they could start drawing that down.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.760]  Stay there, Webster. Webster, I'm going to set you up for a full hour this week if you can do it.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.760]  We can really give you a lot of time to go over this, because you're one of our leading experts.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:52.760]  But in a few minutes we've got left on the other side, versus what you think they should do, the sanity, what they're going to do,
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:56.760]  and what you're predicting is going to happen on the other side of this quick break.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:25.760]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:34.760]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:39.760]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.760]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:46.760]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.760]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:07.760]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high volume, pre-production order of the new quick fix meals.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:15.760]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:22.760]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:23.760]  Listen carefully.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:33.760]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.

[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.760]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:09.760]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:20.760]  As of January 1st, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:26.760]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:31.760]  We must act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:40.760]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.

[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:35.760]  That's got to scare the system. Webster is our big financial expert on these. Everything he said came true.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.760]  Webster, I want to jam in a few calls here at the end. You're back with us.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:45.760]  What, he's back on Tuesday or Thursday with us for an hour? Tuesday for an hour in the last hour of the syndicated weekday show.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.760]  But in the last four minutes I've got with you, you've got the floor and I'm not trying to brag here.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.760]  It's just everything you've said has happened exactly as you said it would happen.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.760]  You always love to warn people with your solutions. We know they're not going to listen to those.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.760]  We'll have you on Tuesday about solutions. Tell us where you see this going.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:07.760]  Well, first of all, the bailouts do not work. Austerity does not work, right?
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.760]  Gouging the lifeblood of the Greek people will make no difference at all in this because that doesn't have anything to do with anything.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.760]  I think you're going to see the chaotic collapse of the euro.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:20.760]  You're going to see panic runs on the euro, flight capital out of the euro.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:29.760]  You're going to see the breakup of the euro as countries like Greece go back to the drachma so they can devalue and somehow try to save themselves.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.760]  And eventually...
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.760]  And for that to happen they'll be an overthrow of the Greek government.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.760]  Yeah, which wouldn't be a bad thing because this guy's a British agent, right?
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.760]  The Papandreou family, a famous British agent in Greek history.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:44.760]  Germany is dependent on exports and China.
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.760]  And I think Germany is going to get itself into quite a fix too.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.760]  Germany is also quite highly indebted.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.760]  That's another question. I want you to get into what's going to happen.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.760]  But Merkel is now calling them evil, wicked.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.760]  She's using all these terms, insidious, deceptive bankers, but she's still voted for it.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:09.760]  Right. The demagogy of the European leaders is that they should be attacking the banks and the hedge funds instead of attacking the people of Greece.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  And they lack the political courage to do it.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.760]  In other words, this is a crisis caused by globalization.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:23.760]  It's caused by sorrows, it's caused by hot money, casino economy, derivatives, all the stuff that we know.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.760]  It has nothing to do really with the fact that Greeks may retire at 50 or 60 or whatever they retire.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.760]  Anyway, the breakdown, the chaotic collapse of the European currency, the euro,
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.760]  the chaotic collapse of the European central bank,
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:41.760]  a lot of these countries going into severe depression and social unrest.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.760]  Then, kicking over, the chaotic panic runs on the British pound,
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:49.760]  plus then the connection is the euro-dollar market.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:54.760]  When those banks go bankrupt in London, they'll start dumping euro-dollar assets.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:56.760]  That may be the thing to sink the dollar.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:00.760]  We always thought it would be China dumping the dollar or somebody else like this.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.760]  I think it's likely to be the British. That would be true to form for them.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.760]  And then, of course, when that happens, then you've got a dollar crisis in the US.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.760]  I would think you've got to think about panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.760]  But then the dollar go up at first as Europe falls, and then about a week later or a month later it plunges.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.760]  Yes, right. I mean, right now we're in the Fool's Paradise phase where they say,
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.760]  oh, we saved the dollar by wrecking the euro.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.760]  Too bad it is one world economy and it's going to bring down the dollar.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.760]  Panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:37.760]  We had panic runs on the Federal Reserve New York branch in March of 1933,
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.760]  so much so that the New York branch had to borrow from the Chicago branch,
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.760]  and the Chicago branch didn't want to do it.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:47.760]  Ultimately, I think you're going to see panic runs on the International Monetary Fund
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.760]  and the Bank for International Settlements.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.760]  In other words, the destruction of all major institutions.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:01.760]  And I think my view of good is that this stuff is not planned, and this is a chaotic breakdown.
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.760]  But is it? Well, here's the problem. I agree with you. They're out of control, which is even more scary.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:10.760]  Is it the default positions start a big war once that happens?
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:14.760]  It's possible, yes. I guess we have to think about that too.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:17.760]  In other words, the Anglo-Americans in particular have this penchant,
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:22.760]  but when they get into a fix like that, one way you can freeze the markets,
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:27.760]  and in other words, you can impose capital controls, exchange controls, and all the rest of it
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.760]  is if you have a war, because then you have political cover for doing it.
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:35.760]  And that might be their way to do it. Much better to do it in advance. Do it now.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:41.760]  Debt moratorium for Greece. Herbert Hoover in 1931 had the sense to freeze debt
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.760]  between the United States and Europe. He tried to stop the Depression.
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:48.760]  The French sabotaged him. This time the Germans are sabotaging.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.760]  So we need debt moratorium, debt freeze for Greece, for Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:57.760]  Just tell them to stop paying their international debts, those governments.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:01.760]  And then the other thing is freeze international payments on derivatives.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:04.760]  We've got 1.5 quadrillion of toxic derivatives.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.760]  You've got to triage that.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:09.760]  Free them. Just freeze them.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:13.760]  Well, Webster, they're not going to do that, clearly. They're going to continue to...
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.760]  No, no, no. Again, if Herbert Hoover, Herbert Hoover of all people, right, the most hidebound,
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:23.760]  if he could say that Germany, Britain, France, and the United States are going to freeze
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:28.760]  all intergovernmental financial debt in 1931, anything is possible.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.760]  Do you think Merkel, going after the banks, at least verbally...
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:36.760]  I don't see Merkel. I see Sarkozy, because this is Sarkozy's demagogic position,
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.760]  is that he's the guy who's tough on the banks.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:42.760]  And I see Berlusconi joining in, because Berlusconi will be bankrupt if he doesn't.
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:47.760]  Italy is not at the top of the list, but getting towards the top now.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.760]  After Spain, Italy, for example.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:55.760]  All right. And time frames, weeks, months, till we see this?
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.760]  Normally, if you... The time table, this depression has been behaving pretty much like the last depression.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:06.760]  So we had a year and a half between the first big crash and now the collapse of Europe.
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:11.760]  In 1931, the collapse of Europe took six months from Austria-Germany to Britain.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:17.760]  When Britain defaulted on gold in September 1931, that was the end of the European banking system.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:21.760]  And then we had the third wave, which was the banking panic in the U.S., right?
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:25.760]  When every bank shut down between the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1932.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.760]  So we're talking about a two-and-a-half, three-year period?
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.760]  I think this time, though, it seems to me that...
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.760]  Well, no, we're already two years in, so another year.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.760]  We're a year and a half more or less in, but I think this time the distance between the second wave,
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.760]  where we are now, we're in the beginning of the second wave,
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:44.760]  the distance between the second wave and the third wave is much less,
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:49.760]  because we have derivatives and we have this euro-dollar market and we have a more integrated economy.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:55.760]  The other thing that's fighting against that, though, is these huge bailouts, which we didn't have in 1931,
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.760]  which do tend to slow things down a little bit.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.760]  So I would say at most, within six months, Europe will be completely collapsed
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:09.760]  and then a panic run on U.S. banks within about, well, a year, year-and-a-half from now.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.760]  That's probably the most. I think less.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.760]  Webster Tarbley, Doctor of Economics.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.760]  Great track recorder predicting this.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.760]  We'll talk to you for a full hour on Tuesday. God bless you.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.760]  See you then. Bye-bye.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760]  Thank you.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.760]  All right. Now, shifting gears again in the last three, four minutes.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.760]  I apologize to callers. We got to most of you, but Stefan, Cliff, Mike, Jeremy, I'll get to you.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.760]  George, Joe, Ralph, I'm going to try now.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:30.760]  I had open phones for Hispanics.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:35.760]  All these videos of the Communist Larica and Keesta as being given media support,
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.760]  film director Robert Rodriguez making basically a race war film, Machete, coming out in September.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.760]  Are they concerned about this? What do they think about it?
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:47.760]  George in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.760]  Hello?
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.760]  Yes, George. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.760]  Yes. Yes. How are you doing today, Mr. Jones?
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:55.760]  I'm doing okay, buddy. What's up?
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:58.760]  All right. Well, here's what I think about the whole thing.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.760]  It's double-edged for me because you guys have a point.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.760]  I mean, I came here from Honduras when I was about three years old and we naturalized.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.760]  That's the way to do it. That's the way you got to do it,
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.760]  especially if you want to be part of this great state.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.760]  I mean, this great country, you know?
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:20.760]  And then coming and pouring in by the thousands, you know, the millions, maybe, I'm not sure.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.760]  It's just, it's sucking up all the resources and we're going into debt.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:28.760]  It's like an agent of chaos.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.760]  It's an agent of chaos?
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.760]  Yeah. That's what it's going to do.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.760]  I'm over here in Washington, right?
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:38.760]  And I'm thinking to myself, okay, maybe it's just like the border states.
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:40.760]  But no, this thing is going everywhere.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:42.760]  It's reaching out all over the country.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:47.760]  Like, if you look up Seattle police beat down innocent Hispanic men,
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760]  you're going to see what's going on.
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:51.760]  Like, this thing is reaching all over the place and it has to stop.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:52.760]  Now, we're going to cover that tomorrow.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.760]  The cops stomping on the Hispanic guy's hand for no reason.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.760]  And then they're making it like it's racial.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:02.760]  If you're wearing a cowboy hat, they call you redneck when they're white cops kicking you.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.760]  If you're black, they call you, you know, and they're calling them something racial.
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  That's because police have been trained to act like this period.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.760]  And that's going to be used racially.
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.760]  I agree with you and it's wrong. It's wrong.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  Let's talk to Joe in Los Angeles.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.760]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:18.760]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  My family came here from Cuba for a free to have freedom and my family had freedom.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.760]  And what I think is this is the whole thing is a setup. Like you said, they're trying to make us fight each other.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  I think you could go as far as F-30 into the world with Mexico,
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:36.760]  which will probably play into the global trends regardless.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:44.760]  But what I want to say to the guy who made that film is if he believes that communism is good
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  and even though it's important to this country,
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:50.760]  that he's going to make a lot of enemies for the Hispanic community who came here for freedom.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:53.760]  You know, I came here for freedom or my family came here for freedom.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:57.760]  And I see this appearing literally by the minute here.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  And we have people like this coming over here trying to destroy America and pissing me off.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:07.760]  No, I hear you all. I want freedom. I can care less what color my neighbors are.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  But when my neighbors start saying I'm evil and communism's good and my guns need to be handed in,
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:16.760]  they're making me their enemy and I'm trying to stop this.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:18.760]  But I feel good though because we opened the phones up.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.760]  We didn't screen the calls. We just said only Hispanics.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.760]  But nobody called in supporting La Raza and Mecha.
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.760]  But the issue is it's a language barrier.
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  People that are Americans and have chosen to join that tribal group,
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.760]  which nullifies race and makes it about ideas, they all agree with freedom.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:42.760]  The problem is we need Hispanic leaders who speak Spanish to reach out and wake up the Hispanic community.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.760]  The problem is the big banks and the government are trying to radicalize them.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:48.760]  Great point. God bless you all. Great job, crew.
