[00:00:01.843 --> 00:00:08.476]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.482]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:18.180]  It is Sunday, the ninth day of May, 2010.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.363]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.545]  Very important broadcast lined up.
[00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:32.969]  I've done a lot of preparation for this radio slash TV, PrisonPlanet.TV transmission today.
[00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:43.476]  I will say this, we are only going to have open phones here on the broadcast for Hispanic Americans, or for Hispanics living in Mexico,
[00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:48.482]  Latinos living all over the world, it doesn't matter.
[00:00:48.482 --> 00:01:07.906]  This broadcast will be specifically open phones in the first hour and a half for you to be able to call in and just break down what you're hearing from the Hispanic community about their view of the United States, what the average view is about
[00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:17.033]  The quote, invasion, or the La Reconquista, Azzedline, the takeover of the United States.
[00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:25.319]  And whether you support that or not, and what the average view is of gringos, white people.
[00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:35.065]  The reason I say this is obviously last week it broke that students were kicked off campus in San Francisco for wearing American flag tees.
[00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:38.608]  I've now seen interviews with the parents and students, three of the five are Hispanic.
[00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:43.774]  And they're sick of hearing about how this is Mexico and the U.S.
[00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:45.135]  being run down.
[00:01:45.135 --> 00:01:50.258]  And so they wore, well, one of them got kicked out for an old Navy flag shirt.
[00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:54.420]  I happen to own one of those.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.725]  And then the other students were so upset by it, they walked out of class the next day when the school reversed itself and said, OK, you can wear American flags.
[00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:04.961]  I mean, think about this.
[00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:15.626]  This isn't like immigrants from Germany, or immigrants from Italy, or immigrants from China, where the countries are far away.
[00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:29.453]  This is a country that lost several wars with the United States, that's on our border, that is very corrupt, and there's at least 30 million illegals in this country, and tens of millions of other legal immigrants that have come here from Mexico over the last 50 years.
[00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:43.905]  And I want to know, is the views that we're hearing from these professors and school teachers and academics that whites are scum and filth and need to die, is that a majority view?
[00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:57.342]  I want to know, because I always was brought up to be colorblind and have friends of every color, and I don't feel insecure when I go and eat in a Mexican food restaurant owned by Hispanics.
[00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:58.703]  I was in one today.
[00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:03.045]  But I'm starting to ask myself, am I welcome here?
[00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:04.065]  I mean, should I?
[00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.707]  Because I don't have a choice.
[00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:10.128]  Should I start separating myself?
[00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:11.309]  I mean, is that what you want?
[00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.882]  Because, I mean, all I see is Hispanics and whites getting intermarried and getting along.
[00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:19.422]  And I hope that's the vast majority.
[00:03:19.422 --> 00:03:23.644]  I think it is, but if it's different, I need to know.
[00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:32.428]  Because we know this, the mainstream media, the corporate media, the dominant systems of government are promoting this liberation theology.
[00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:35.870]  They are really pushing through Carlos Mancilla and all these big
[00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.230]  Comics.
[00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.856]  Every time I turn them on on television, it's just pure anti-white propaganda, and I'm sick of it.
[00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.058]  I'm sick of it.
[00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:51.624]  I'm tired of racism, tribalism, and I'm not self-hating.
[00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:52.445]  I'm not guilty.
[00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:53.786]  I've done nothing to anybody.
[00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:58.531]  All I have is goodwill towards everyone, but I will stand up for myself.
[00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.814]  And there's nothing wrong with being a European.
[00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:03.254]  There's nothing wrong.
[00:04:03.254 --> 00:04:05.735]  I mean, every culture's done good things and bad things.
[00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:09.316]  I don't sit up here in judgment of anybody.
[00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:10.777]  But I've had enough.
[00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:19.800]  And I have put out a video that's basically an open letter to Robert Rodriguez, who lives here in Austin, the accomplished director.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.562]  Because when I saw the trailer for his new movie coming out, Machete,
[00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:35.996]  It's basically a call for race war and it mirrors what La Raza and Mecha and other groups are putting out.
[00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:44.127]  And, you know, when you see big-budget movies where whites are the bad guys and have to be killed, it's very serious.
[00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:51.731]  Imagine a movie where Hispanics are the bad guys and have to be killed, or blacks are the bad guys and have to be killed, or Jews are the bad guys and have to be killed.
[00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:53.352]  This is very, very serious.
[00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:58.575]  So we're going to break this down and some of the firebombing attacks and things that have happened in the U.S.
[00:04:58.575 --> 00:04:59.256]  in the last few weeks.
[00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:06.319]  The last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.461]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:20.184]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:24.265]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:26.546]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:28.687 --> 00:05:33.269]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:37.111]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.331]  Others don't.
[00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:40.492]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.273]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:45.154]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:51.777]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:54.478]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:56.859]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:57.720]  Others don't.
[00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.131]  Big Brother.
[00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.893]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:09.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.798]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.798 --> 00:06:16.982]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:21.047]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.104 --> 00:06:28.449]  All right, my friends, a very important broadcast today.
[00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:38.721]  In the last 30 minutes, economist Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us to give us his take on what happened Thursday with a thousand point drop.
[00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:42.786]  It has now been confirmed by the major stock exchanges it was not a fat finger.
[00:06:43.767 --> 00:07:05.078]  It was not just a single trade, it was now more than 20 stocks that were simultaneously affected and the evidence is pointing towards massive European sell-offs and a true plunge that began in the markets and then the plunge protection team set up by Ronald Reagan to stop stock market crashes in 1987 kicked in
[00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:08.815]  I don't know.
[00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.876]  Coming up today.
[00:07:31.876 --> 00:07:33.737]  In fact, here's the Hill newspaper.
[00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:39.358]  White House doesn't rule out sabotage in Thursday's wild Wall Street plunge.
[00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:41.278]  Now they're saying it could have been a cyber attack.
[00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:47.079]  So don't worry, the government and the FCC can start regulating and tracking and shutting down freedom on the web.
[00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:47.679]  Here's another one.
[00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:48.619]  Plunge in U.S.
[00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:50.520]  equities remains a mystery.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.680]  Financial Times of London, New York Times.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.301]  Greek debt crisis raises doubts about the European Union.
[00:07:58.234 --> 00:08:02.315]  EU preps Euro fund to fight Wolfpack debt crisis.
[00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:11.977]  They're worried about the markets opening in just about six hours in Europe and a Black Monday globally melting down the stock market.
[00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:15.678]  This is a serious week to watch the financial developments.
[00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:20.579]  Here's another headline, Wall Street Journal, crisis deepens, chaos grips Greece.
[00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:24.000]  So that's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:40.109]  But before I get into that issue, sometimes every few months we have a special broadcast where I'll say, I only want to hear from police officers and military.
[00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:46.634]  We have this Army Times article where they're training 400,000 troops for domestic operations and gun confiscation.
[00:08:46.634 --> 00:08:49.817]  Please call in and tell us what your training has been like and what you think of it.
[00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:52.484]  We've done that from time to time.
[00:08:52.484 --> 00:09:01.952]  Or I'll say, during the flu hysteria, open phones only for doctors and nurses and medical people to get your take on what's happening.
[00:09:01.952 --> 00:09:05.695]  Well today, we're only going to take calls from Hispanics.
[00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:16.960]  And you can be Latinos, whatever term you like, you can be in Mexico, you can be in Brazil, you can be in the US, you can be in Germany, you can be in Canada, you can be in Russia, whatever.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:26.987]  The 600 plus million Hispanics in the world are welcome to call into this radio show on the topic I'm about to put out there because I really want to hear from you.
[00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:32.786]  I really want to understand your view on what's going on and what's happening.
[00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:45.652]  Now, you'll have to hold for a couple of segments because I have to go over all this information first and then get your view on it, but let me give you the toll-free number to join us on this live Sunday, the ninth day of May 2010 edition, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, and you can
[00:09:54.414 --> 00:10:00.380]  Disagree with what I'm going to say, you can agree, you can add points, but really I just want the truth.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.763]  Not just your views, but what you hear in your community.
[00:10:03.763 --> 00:10:13.733]  Because my wife lived many years in Spain, so she speaks Spanish, and let me tell you she's got an inside view of what's really being said by a lot of people.
[00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:16.035]  And my cousin grew up in Guatemala.
[00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:20.564]  And he speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:22.426]  It's really his first language.
[00:10:22.426 --> 00:10:29.253]  I've been on road trips with him before and heard him, you know, in the bed next to me, you know, in the hotel room, you know, the twin bed across from me.
[00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:36.440]  Somebody starts speaking in Spanish and I wake up and he, and believe me as a bartender in college, he heard the animosity
[00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:42.127]  And the hatred by some Hispanics toward gringos.
[00:10:42.127 --> 00:10:51.138]  Towards, but not just towards gringos, the slang term for black people in Spanish that translates into English into blackbird.
[00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:55.784]  And this is something in this politically correct society that is just acceptable.
[00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:00.214]  I mean, no other group gets away with stuff like this.
[00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:07.724]  When whites come out and spew a bunch of racial hatred, they get slapped down for it and they should.
[00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:10.587]  Blacks, to a lesser extent, but they still do.
[00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:15.013]  I mean, mildly racist stuff from Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton gets exposed.
[00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:20.130]  I want to live in peace with everybody and I don't have any guilt either.
[00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:28.121]  I don't even want to get up here and say I have lots of Hispanic friends and you know I like Hispanics and I have a lot of Hispanic folks that work in my office with me.
[00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:31.446]  I don't even want to say that like I'm having to prove myself.
[00:11:32.026 --> 00:11:33.527]  I know who I am.
[00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.348]  I know what my views are.
[00:11:35.348 --> 00:11:47.677]  And I discovered this was going on in high school because my white teachers taught me white people were bad and America was bad and that the United States had stolen part of Mexico.
[00:11:47.677 --> 00:11:50.639]  And then when I was in college, I was taught this.
[00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:56.202]  And then I began to go to Mecha and La Raza rallies and watch videos of their leaders.
[00:11:56.202 --> 00:11:59.745]  And literally we have hundreds and hundreds of these videos.
[00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:01.346]  There's several new ones that have come out.
[00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:07.650]  From these La Raza, which means the race, for those in the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:21.018]  And the Fortune 500 funds these groups, the media funds it, Comedy Central chooses to give shows to people that have very racist programs where it's all about stirring up racial division and attacking white people.
[00:12:21.018 --> 00:12:23.880]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.081]  I am sick and tired of it.
[00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:26.482]  But what's gotten me upset?
[00:12:27.506 --> 00:12:38.256]  In the last few weeks we've seen police being attacked in Arizona and illegal alien supporters and illegals saying, we'll use our pickaxes on you, we'll kill you.
[00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:43.181]  And it's nationally blocked out on the news, never made national news.
[00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:47.505]  I've seen footage out of Santa Cruz a week and a half ago.
[00:12:48.427 --> 00:12:54.613]  Or I guess nine days ago was on May Day of illegal alien supporters burning restaurants with people in them.
[00:12:54.613 --> 00:12:57.816]  They narrowly escaped torches in the streets.
[00:12:57.816 --> 00:13:02.280]  And then ABC News locally said, well, they've got a reason to be angry with this Arizona law.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.663]  And I've seen the Arizona law misrepresented by the media.
[00:13:05.663 --> 00:13:08.266]  So the corporate media is driving this.
[00:13:08.886 --> 00:13:18.874]  And pushing this, and implying that all Hispanics aren't wanted in America, and really adding fuel to all of this tension.
[00:13:18.874 --> 00:13:28.462]  Then, I saw a video yesterday, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, LA teacher calls for Mexican revolt in US.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.827]  And this is at a big rally, and he talks about disgusting white people, and he talks about how it's a communist takeover, and he's honest.
[00:13:36.827 --> 00:13:41.772]  He says, these old white people don't really dislike us because we're brown.
[00:13:41.772 --> 00:13:43.574]  They don't like us because we're communist.
[00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:47.591]  And that's what I've said.
[00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:51.173]  I've said, I want to know, I want people to run a flag up.
[00:13:51.173 --> 00:14:05.504]  Because if you're brown and love America and the Second Amendment and private property, well I'll just love you to death and hug all over you, and you know, I got two white daughters, I'm not going to get upset if they decide to marry a Hispanic American if they're a patriot.
[00:14:06.164 --> 00:14:11.147]  You know, if my daughters someday bring home a white guy who's a communist, I'm going to throw him the hell out of my house.
[00:14:11.147 --> 00:14:22.155]  And if they bring a brown guy home who's a communist, I'm going to tell my daughters that I'm going to ostracize them, shun them, disown them.
[00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:26.118]  If they marry, if my daughters brought home a Klan member,
[00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:28.544]  It'd be the same thing.
[00:14:28.544 --> 00:14:31.347]  I am not going to be part of this.
[00:14:31.347 --> 00:14:34.050]  I am not going to support this.
[00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.372]  I'm done.
[00:14:35.372 --> 00:14:36.493]  I'm through.
[00:14:36.493 --> 00:14:37.534]  I'm finished.
[00:14:37.534 --> 00:14:39.437]  And I'm coming out against it.
[00:14:39.437 --> 00:14:42.440]  You know, I'm somebody who has been attacked by the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.704]  I'm somebody who's protested a bunch of federal agents, on average.
[00:14:46.665 --> 00:14:49.367]  And, you know, that was back 10, 15 years ago.
[00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:51.989]  I probably haven't gone out and protested the Klan in about 8 years.
[00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:53.370]  I don't do a lot of protests, period.
[00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.791]  I don't have time.
[00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:58.654]  But, you know, the Klan, maybe 100,000 people.
[00:14:58.654 --> 00:15:02.257]  This Mitchell-Eraza thing is in the tens of millions.
[00:15:02.257 --> 00:15:09.722]  And what's happening is there's this intimidation against Hispanic Americans that they are a, well, they have a
[00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:11.912]  Spanish term for it.
[00:15:32.316 --> 00:15:38.559]  And this was illustrated by the school kids, five of them, being kicked out of school in San Francisco.
[00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:40.500]  Three of the five were Hispanic, by the way.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.681]  Not allowed to wear American flags.
[00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.702]  It was offensive to the Mexicans, who don't want to be Americans.
[00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:48.303]  They're Mexicans.
[00:15:48.303 --> 00:15:50.724]  And we're going to be discussing all of this today.
[00:15:50.724 --> 00:15:56.146]  And we're going to go over Robert Rodriguez's new film, Machete, that is invoking race war.
[00:15:56.146 --> 00:15:57.227]  This is so important.
[00:15:57.227 --> 00:15:57.627]  Stay with us.

[00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:07.977]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[00:17:07.977 --> 00:17:15.324]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[00:17:15.324 --> 00:17:22.310]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.171]  Listen carefully.
[00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:33.235]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[00:17:33.235 --> 00:17:37.477]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[00:17:37.477 --> 00:17:40.478]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[00:17:40.478 --> 00:17:44.680]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.600]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:17:50.162 --> 00:17:53.183]  800-409-5633.
[00:17:53.183 --> 00:17:56.265]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:56.885]  800-409-5633.
[00:17:56.885 --> 00:18:01.067]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:01.067 --> 00:18:06.649]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:06.649 --> 00:18:11.692]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:16.714]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:18:17.254 --> 00:18:22.478]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:24.779]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:18:24.779 --> 00:18:29.582]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:30.703]  And here's the best part.
[00:18:30.703 --> 00:18:33.765]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:37.408]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:40.590]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.811]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:43.732]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:18:47.374 --> 00:18:50.336]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:56.439]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:59.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.861]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:04.063]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:19:04.063 --> 00:19:07.384]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:19:07.384 --> 00:19:12.507]  Invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:16.689]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.450]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.891]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:19:21.891 --> 00:19:25.132]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:32.735]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:38.477]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:41.340]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.024]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:19:45.024 --> 00:19:46.085]  And I got news for you.
[00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:47.426]  You're everyone else.
[00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:48.927]  Invisible Empire.

[00:20:01.181 --> 00:20:04.764]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.764 --> 00:20:08.107]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:18.256]  Hit it!
[00:20:18.256 --> 00:20:20.478]  No more Mr. Nice Guy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:20.478 --> 00:20:25.162]  We're getting these issues out in the open.
[00:20:25.162 --> 00:20:28.605]  It is a fact that the CIA, the Ford Foundation, and others
[00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:40.887]  For 50 years have radicalized Muslims, that was even the Washington Post, sending textbooks into Pakistan and other countries, radicalizing the Muslims, making them violent.
[00:20:40.887 --> 00:20:42.568]  Why?
[00:20:42.568 --> 00:20:52.052]  And that they've created liberation theology, similar to Reverend Wright, Obama, his preacher, and all the race stuff they spew.
[00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:52.672]  Why is that?
[00:20:53.973 --> 00:20:59.035]  Why is it that Hatari Militia, the federal judges, ordered their release?
[00:20:59.035 --> 00:21:04.418]  Because all the Hatari Militia said is if the New World Order keeps coming down on us, we may have to physically fight.
[00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:12.142]  Meanwhile, if I tried to play for you, just go to YouTube and type in La Raza or Mecha or Azadlan.
[00:21:12.882 --> 00:21:18.145]  And you will see hundreds of videos of professors and the mayor of L.A.
[00:21:18.145 --> 00:21:28.990]  and congressmen, and we've even gotten some of them on air before, saying, yes, whites are scum, whites are racist, you don't belong on this continent, all go home, we can't wait for you to all die.
[00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.152]  I mean, this is more heated rhetoric than Ku Klux Klan.
[00:21:33.152 --> 00:21:34.473]  And I'm offended by all of it.
[00:21:37.264 --> 00:21:42.388]  But this is just a video, it's on Drudge right now, it's also up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:48.393]  This just came out yesterday from Rallies on Friday.
[00:21:48.393 --> 00:22:01.705]  And then I'm gonna go over the new film coming out that we have the trailer for, and I was then separately, I didn't know what to make of this a few days ago on Cinco de Mayo when I was sent the trailer for the new Robert Rodriguez, who I've been a fan of, film Machete.
[00:22:03.717 --> 00:22:09.645]  I mean, the whites are racist, they're evil, it's got Mexicans running around with machetes, killing the gringo.
[00:22:09.645 --> 00:22:11.808]  It looked like a call for race war.
[00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:16.174]  Then I talked to people who called me, who by the way are Hispanic, who work...
[00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:25.757]  In the film, and it's being finished right now, that are saying, we're worried this is going to hurt and cause a backlash on the Hispanic community.
[00:22:25.757 --> 00:22:26.878]  And that's what the globalists want.
[00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:32.161]  That's why they fund this, so we're all against each other, instead of being for sovereignty.
[00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:33.181]  All of us are tribal.
[00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:35.362]  All of us are gang mentality.
[00:22:35.362 --> 00:22:36.243]  That's human.
[00:22:36.243 --> 00:22:37.383]  How about red, white, and blue?
[00:22:37.383 --> 00:22:39.184]  How about Bill of Rights, Constitution?
[00:22:39.184 --> 00:22:40.825]  How about that be our gang?
[00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:42.346]  How about we stand up for that?
[00:22:43.326 --> 00:22:45.047]  Why do you think everybody wants to come to America?
[00:22:45.047 --> 00:22:49.468]  It hadn't been perfect, but it's had freedom of speech, freedom of private property.
[00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:52.749]  That's why four percent of the world population and more than half the wealth.
[00:22:52.749 --> 00:22:53.909]  Now we've been taken over.
[00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:55.570]  Now we're corrupt.
[00:22:55.570 --> 00:23:00.631]  But the point is, why do these people say that this is Mexico and they're going to make it Mexico?
[00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:09.754]  Well, if Mexico is so great or Latin America is so great under those corrupt systems, never getting out from under colonial-type rule, why then do they want to come here?
[00:23:09.754 --> 00:23:10.914]  Why are they offended by
[00:23:12.386 --> 00:23:14.288]  The media didn't report this until later.
[00:23:14.288 --> 00:23:16.130]  I saw the kids on San Francisco TV.
[00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:23.277]  Three of the five that got kicked out of school for wearing American flag shirts were Hispanic!
[00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:29.603]  It's so offensive to a large portion of Hispanic America, the American flag is offensive.
[00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:38.055]  So now when I pull into a Mexican food restaurant and I see Mexican flags everywhere, or I see it on car dealerships, or I see the term La Raza or Mecha.
[00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:39.457]  La Raza means the race.
[00:23:39.457 --> 00:23:42.700]  Or they've got a Texas radio station called The Invasion.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.742]  And again, my wife speaks Spanish.
[00:23:44.742 --> 00:23:45.923]  She hears it all.
[00:23:45.923 --> 00:23:46.924]  It just blows her away.
[00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:51.128]  I mean, I want to feel comfortable.
[00:23:51.128 --> 00:23:52.570]  I don't want to be enemies with everybody.
[00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:55.968]  But these groups say, hey, we want to be your enemy.
[00:23:55.968 --> 00:24:02.612]  So my question for Hispanic callers, your calls are coming up, I need to go over this first, is what are you hearing in your community?
[00:24:02.612 --> 00:24:04.754]  What side do you stand on?
[00:24:04.754 --> 00:24:11.358]  Because as long as you're an American and believe in our laws and our freedoms, then I'm all for you.
[00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:17.523]  But if you're scared by an American flag and hate white people, I mean, I've got to stand up for myself.
[00:24:18.447 --> 00:24:23.972]  Now, let's just, again, I could fill up 10 hours, no exaggeration, with exactly what you're about to hear.
[00:24:23.972 --> 00:24:28.897]  In fact, worse, there's a UT professor, head of Chicano Studies, up in UT Dallas.
[00:24:30.129 --> 00:24:34.110]  I mean, can you imagine if a white professor was teaching to kill all blacks?
[00:24:52.466 --> 00:24:56.549]  Remember when that black professor said kill all whites a few years ago about how big a news it was?
[00:24:56.549 --> 00:25:05.215]  Why isn't it news when this type of stuff's going on, or when Robert Rodriguez gets ready to put a film out like this, and he says this is a message to Arizona.
[00:25:05.215 --> 00:25:06.396]  That's coming up.
[00:25:06.396 --> 00:25:07.297]  And then your phone calls.
[00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:11.300]  But first, LA teacher calls for Mexican revolt in the United States.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.382]  This is sedition.
[00:25:14.082 --> 00:25:16.524]  This is pure racism.
[00:25:16.524 --> 00:25:20.106]  I mean, if the Ku Klux Klan called for this, they'd be arrested in minutes.
[00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:21.166]  This is not free speech.
[00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:24.048]  This is a call to arms.
[00:25:24.048 --> 00:25:31.033]  Meanwhile, I have the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center listing me, Ron Paul, and others as if we're seditious and Oath Keepers.
[00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:33.354]  Mother Jones called Oath Keepers seditious.
[00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:36.216]  They're open to every race, color, you name it, to just follow the Bill of Rights.
[00:25:37.634 --> 00:25:41.738]  Again, imagine what would happen to Hatari Militia if they talked like this.
[00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:42.619]  Here it is.
[00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:45.002]  This is just two days ago.
[00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:48.165]  This is just two days ago.
[00:25:48.165 --> 00:25:51.008]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:53.250]  And again, we have this video up on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.992]  It's got his full name.
[00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:56.214]  It's got all the information.
[00:25:56.214 --> 00:25:59.137]  Ron Gotchez.
[00:26:00.694 --> 00:26:05.998]  He's a history teacher at Santa HS in Los Angeles.
[00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:08.741]  Imagine being a white kid in this guy's class.
[00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:10.122]  Here it is.
[00:26:10.122 --> 00:26:17.248]  I want to start out by saying that the young man who spoke a little while ago was one of my students.
[00:26:17.248 --> 00:26:25.034]  And that made me so proud because I know that our people have strong leaders for years and years to come.
[00:26:33.837 --> 00:26:40.501]  As a militante de Unión del Barrio, a revolutionary Mexican organization here, we understand what the camarada is saying.
[00:26:40.501 --> 00:26:42.383]  You're right, this is not just about Mexico.
[00:26:42.383 --> 00:26:46.045]  This is about a global struggle against imperialism and capitalism.
[00:26:46.045 --> 00:26:54.310]  But we know that all of that is happening in the context that where we now stand is stolen, occupied Mexico.
[00:27:01.406 --> 00:27:07.170]  And the message that we bring is we want to bring a little bit more of a revolutionary context to this.
[00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:14.395]  Why is it that these people, these frail, racist, white people want to keep us out of this country?
[00:27:14.395 --> 00:27:17.057]  It's not because simply the color of our skin.
[00:27:17.057 --> 00:27:19.718]  It's not simply because they just want to exploit us.
[00:27:19.718 --> 00:27:21.440]  Let me tell you why.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:29.445]  Because on this planet right now, a six billion people at the forefront of the revolutionary movement is the Raza.
[00:27:34.588 --> 00:27:35.009]  The race!
[00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:36.149]  The race!
[00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:43.154]  When we go, we have the long history and example of our Comandante, Fidel Castro Ruz!
[00:27:43.154 --> 00:27:46.016]  Fidel Castro!
[00:27:46.016 --> 00:27:47.597]  We got Hugo Chavez!
[00:27:47.597 --> 00:27:48.818]  Evo Morales!
[00:27:48.818 --> 00:27:49.839]  We got Brazil!
[00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:50.539]  Ecuador!
[00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:51.720]  You name it!
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.862]  We have nine!
[00:27:53.862 --> 00:27:54.282]  Nine!
[00:27:55.062 --> 00:27:56.684]  Left of center!
[00:27:56.684 --> 00:27:58.965]  Governments in Latin America right now.
[00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:04.490]  And they know something that a one young Argentine called Che Guevara said.
[00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.291]  It was called the domino theory.
[00:28:06.291 --> 00:28:10.815]  And he knew that every single country would go revolutionary.
[00:28:10.815 --> 00:28:16.259]  One after the other, after the other, after the other.
[00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:17.260]  And what's their point?
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.801]  Get our guns.
[00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:19.942]  We're not getting my guns, buddy.
[00:28:21.826 --> 00:28:22.326]  Sorry.
[00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:23.786]  So what do they fear?
[00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:31.728]  They know that every single country, they know that we no longer will fall to these lies called borders.
[00:28:31.728 --> 00:28:32.928]  We know- All right, pause.
[00:28:32.928 --> 00:28:36.529]  We're going to go to break when we come back.
[00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:37.729]  I'm going to play the rest of this.
[00:28:37.729 --> 00:28:39.850]  This is unedited.
[00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:50.012]  And literally, when I was watching this video on YouTube, there were scores of new ones all saying the same thing and calling for killing all whites as well.
[00:28:50.012 --> 00:28:50.872]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:28:52.312 --> 00:29:01.254]  We'll be back.
[00:29:01.254 --> 00:29:03.154]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[00:29:03.154 --> 00:29:04.194]  Lost your remote?
[00:29:04.194 --> 00:29:06.775]  Or is your remote control just not working?
[00:29:06.775 --> 00:29:10.276]  Let ReplacementRemotes.com replace or fix it for you.
[00:29:10.276 --> 00:29:16.237]  We carry a complete line of remote controls for all brands of TV, home audio, or DVD remotes, including

[00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:47.586]  336-377-2220.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:08.803]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[00:30:08.803 --> 00:30:16.147]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:23.130]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:23.970]  Listen carefully.
[00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:34.074]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[00:30:34.074 --> 00:30:38.296]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[00:30:38.296 --> 00:30:41.297]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:45.439]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:46.439]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex
[00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:51.301]  800-409-5633.
[00:30:51.301 --> 00:30:52.923]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:30:52.923 --> 00:30:52.964]  800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.854 --> 00:31:10.338]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:31:10.338 --> 00:31:21.222]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:31:21.222 --> 00:31:26.665]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:32.109]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:41.176]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:31:41.176 --> 00:31:51.304]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:31:51.304 --> 00:31:54.986]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:31:54.986 --> 00:31:55.967]  SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.562]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:07.562 --> 00:32:12.564]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:12.564 --> 00:32:17.606]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:23.368]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:23.368 --> 00:32:30.491]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:31.611]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:31.611 --> 00:32:37.954]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:38.274 --> 00:32:41.477]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:41.477 --> 00:32:43.699]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:43.699 --> 00:32:44.640]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.040]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.283]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:48.283 --> 00:32:50.045]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:33:01.383 --> 00:33:04.994]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.994 --> 00:33:08.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:15.097 --> 00:33:16.198]  We are back live.
[00:33:16.198 --> 00:33:19.119]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:25.222]  Now, the phones are only open for Hispanic Americans, Hispanics in Mexico, globally.
[00:33:25.222 --> 00:33:28.003]  I want to hear your view on this, because I know you're in the middle of it.
[00:33:28.003 --> 00:33:29.043]  You hear this.
[00:33:29.043 --> 00:33:30.104]  I want to hear from you.
[00:33:30.104 --> 00:33:32.205]  Is this your view?
[00:33:32.205 --> 00:33:34.026]  What percentage of Hispanics?
[00:33:34.026 --> 00:33:38.888]  I mean, because I've known that the pro-open borders groups are backed by the federal government.
[00:33:39.528 --> 00:33:50.531]  Because they understand these groups will vote for gun control, will vote for socialism, which the big banks want to consolidate people's wealth because they use poverty as a tool of control.
[00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:53.992]  And I know many of these people have been persecuted in their own countries.
[00:33:53.992 --> 00:33:54.992]  They've been taught the U.S.
[00:33:54.992 --> 00:33:55.792]  did it to them.
[00:33:55.792 --> 00:33:56.412]  No.
[00:33:56.412 --> 00:33:58.613]  Powerful interests that have used the U.S.
[00:33:58.613 --> 00:34:00.613]  to a certain extent have done it.
[00:34:00.613 --> 00:34:04.934]  But why is the mainstream media covering this up?
[00:34:04.934 --> 00:34:06.675]  Why can't Hispanic groups
[00:34:07.839 --> 00:34:13.985]  In Spanish and in English, say things that no other group would get away with.
[00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:14.725]  888-201-2244.
[00:34:14.725 --> 00:34:20.991]  But first I want to finish with these video clips and get to the trailer for Machete.
[00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:30.000]  See, when you just watch the trailer and the white guys are the bad people and the Hispanics rise up with machetes like Rwanda and kill them and, you know, the white guys are racist so they deserve it.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.142]  It's all done with situational ethics.
[00:34:32.142 --> 00:34:33.102]  When you watch this,
[00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:39.146]  You have to understand, this is exactly what's being promoted in the real world.
[00:34:39.146 --> 00:34:42.387]  In Mexican and Chicano studies at universities everywhere.
[00:34:42.387 --> 00:34:46.308]  When I went to Anderson High School, I was taught this by the white teachers.
[00:34:46.308 --> 00:34:47.949]  It's all part of the white guilt.
[00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.369]  Whites are evil, whites are bad.
[00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:51.150]  No, we're not.
[00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.890]  I'm tired of it.
[00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.811]  It's just not true.
[00:34:53.811 --> 00:34:54.591]  Okay?
[00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:58.392]  So, let's go ahead and go back to this
[00:35:00.256 --> 00:35:07.743]  Teacher, teaching high school students in California, up there with his students, at a big rally.
[00:35:07.743 --> 00:35:10.025]  And you can watch other clips of the rally.
[00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:10.925]  It's all the same.
[00:35:10.925 --> 00:35:11.726]  Hours of it.
[00:35:11.726 --> 00:35:13.107]  And this is going on everywhere.
[00:35:13.107 --> 00:35:13.468]  Here it is.
[00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:21.439]  So what do they fear?
[00:35:21.439 --> 00:35:29.383]  They know that every single country, they know that we no longer will fall to these lies called borders.
[00:35:29.383 --> 00:35:35.166]  We know that a Salvadoran and a Guatemalan and a Nicaraguan and a Mexicano, there's no damn difference.
[00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.626]  We are all one people.
[00:35:36.626 --> 00:35:45.411]  So with that in mind, we see ourselves, all of us here, as the northern front of a Latin American revolutionary movement.
[00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.493]  See, the media won't cover this, but this is hot.
[00:35:54.493 --> 00:36:02.419]  There are more than 40 million of our people north of the Rio Grande.
[00:36:02.419 --> 00:36:11.206]  That means to them, there's 40 million potential revolutionaries north of the border, inside the belly of the beast.
[00:36:11.206 --> 00:36:14.769]  So when you think about why do they want to kick us, of all people,
[00:36:15.949 --> 00:36:16.810]  That's why.
[00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.491]  Because they know that we now know the truth.
[00:36:19.491 --> 00:36:21.651]  They know that now we are Raza.
[00:36:21.651 --> 00:36:22.752]  We're professionals.
[00:36:22.752 --> 00:36:23.912]  We're educators.
[00:36:23.912 --> 00:36:25.513]  We are revolutionary students.
[00:36:25.513 --> 00:36:26.893]  What does that mean?
[00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:29.194]  We are not just a regular culture anymore.
[00:36:29.194 --> 00:36:32.355]  We're a culture of revolutionary spirit!
[00:36:32.355 --> 00:36:33.175]  And that's the fear!
[00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:45.675]  In the interest of time, because I want to talk to Noel, Grace, Rand, Texican, and others and get their view on this.
[00:36:45.675 --> 00:36:46.837]  And again, the number is 888-201-2244.
[00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:50.442]  I mean, let me have it.
[00:36:50.442 --> 00:36:51.624]  I mean, if you agree with this, tell me.
[00:36:51.624 --> 00:36:54.648]  If you disagree, I mean, is your community concerned about this?
[00:36:56.459 --> 00:36:59.720]  But you have to ask yourself, why are the big corporations funding this?
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.481]  Because we have the North American Union, SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership documents.
[00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:06.081]  The banks want to break up the U.S.
[00:37:06.081 --> 00:37:07.681]  They want to get rid of sovereignty.
[00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:11.962]  It's the big money that funds socialism.
[00:37:11.962 --> 00:37:21.144]  Now let's go to a clip from just two weeks ago, minutes before the illegal alien protesters attacked police and the police stood down and took it.
[00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:23.557]  With rocks and bottles.
[00:37:23.557 --> 00:37:24.538]  And what does the lady say?
[00:37:24.538 --> 00:37:27.461]  We will use our pickaxes on you.
[00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:30.564]  I mean, this is going on everywhere.
[00:37:30.564 --> 00:37:33.767]  And now Robert Rodriguez, who's put out huge hits.
[00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:35.769]  He's making the new Predator movie.
[00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:39.212]  He put out the Spy Kids films.
[00:37:39.212 --> 00:37:42.035]  He put out so many films here in Austin.
[00:37:43.456 --> 00:38:02.126]  And I was told years ago, because I've been in a few Hollywood films myself, never tried to be, got called up and put on them by Richard Linklater, great guy, that I've been told by people that work in Hollywood, oh yeah, I've given Rodriguez your films, he says he likes them, but he doesn't agree with you on the immigration issue and he's into La Raza.
[00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:06.429]  And then I got contacted by two Hispanics, separately, didn't even know that they were doing it.
[00:38:07.383 --> 00:38:08.264]  They will not stop!
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:38.726]  We will take off our shovels and our pickaxes and we break the land and make it landscaping and clean our toilets and our ponds.
[00:38:38.726 --> 00:38:41.427]  We will use them against you!
[00:38:41.427 --> 00:38:42.848]  Believe that!
[00:38:42.848 --> 00:38:45.850]  Alright.
[00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.830]  Clean the toilets?
[00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:52.394]  I mean, why do you have to come from Mexico up here?
[00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:55.135]  And most of the Hispanics I see are doing better than most people.
[00:38:55.135 --> 00:38:57.937]  Living in big houses, driving new cars, hard working smart people.
[00:38:59.056 --> 00:39:00.377]  But, I mean, why is the U.S.
[00:39:00.377 --> 00:39:00.978]  so much better?
[00:39:00.978 --> 00:39:05.581]  Because it hadn't been a communist or a corrupt narco-state.
[00:39:05.581 --> 00:39:09.044]  Because you had some freedom, some Bill of Rights, some private property.
[00:39:09.044 --> 00:39:16.471]  Now, that said, we haven't edited this trailer except for cutting out the cuss words for radio.
[00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:23.763]  You can watch the unedited trailer up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but all we've bleeped is the cuss words.
[00:39:23.763 --> 00:39:34.866]  Now, this was released on Cinco de Mayo, actually the day before it, and they have the star of the new movie, Machete, and he says this is a message for Arizona.
[00:39:34.866 --> 00:39:37.427]  Then it cuts to the Texas Capitol, and I looked it up.
[00:39:37.427 --> 00:39:38.567]  This was shot in Texas.
[00:39:39.741 --> 00:39:47.786]  Basically the plot is evil white people hire a Hispanic to do a staged hit on the racist white senator who wants to control the borders.
[00:39:47.786 --> 00:39:49.207]  So it's a false flag.
[00:39:49.207 --> 00:39:52.469]  I guess Rodriguez did learn something from me.
[00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:56.812]  And then they have to stand up and kill the evil white racist.
[00:39:56.812 --> 00:39:57.933]  But by invoking
[00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:02.871]  The Arizona situation, it sends the message that this is good to do.
[00:40:02.871 --> 00:40:06.273]  And there have been racial attacks from Miami to Santa Cruz.
[00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:11.016]  A bunch of different white ranchers in Arizona have been killed, you've seen that in the news.
[00:40:11.016 --> 00:40:14.638]  Cops are getting killed, the police are on record about that.
[00:40:14.638 --> 00:40:25.085]  There's been a bunch of machete attacks, and I didn't say it was film-related in the last five days, but it's Hispanic surnames killing people with machetes at public schools, attacking police with machetes.
[00:40:27.046 --> 00:40:29.127]  We know what this is going to do.
[00:40:29.127 --> 00:40:30.648]  We know what this is going to generate.
[00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:35.009]  This is very, very dangerous, what's happening.
[00:40:35.009 --> 00:40:39.951]  And I know Rodriguez just wants the attention and wants to be political and thinks this will create a big controversy.
[00:40:39.951 --> 00:40:44.193]  And by the way, Fox Studios is putting this out.
[00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:49.315]  Fox criticized it on TV Friday and then pulled their articles and video about it.
[00:40:49.315 --> 00:40:50.736]  Because they don't want to create a controversy.
[00:40:50.736 --> 00:40:54.317]  They just want this to be under the radar and sell this racial hatred to make money.
[00:40:56.741 --> 00:41:05.445]  Here is the trailer, and I've talked to people involved in the film, one of them high-level, one of them mid-level, and they contacted me.
[00:41:05.445 --> 00:41:06.585]  They are concerned.
[00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:08.686]  Here it is.
[00:41:08.686 --> 00:41:11.207]  This is Machete.
[00:41:11.207 --> 00:41:14.568]  With a special Cinco de Mayo message.
[00:41:14.568 --> 00:41:18.770]  To Arizona.
[00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.230]  Big image of a machete.
[00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.111]  They called him Machete.
[00:41:22.111 --> 00:41:24.012]  Machete.
[00:41:24.012 --> 00:41:25.332]  Seventy dollars a day for yard work.
[00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:29.994]  100 for roofing.
[00:41:29.994 --> 00:41:30.374]  Get in.
[00:41:30.374 --> 00:41:31.715]  125 for sector.
[00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:35.516]  Have you ever killed anyone before?
[00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:39.078]  As you know, illegal Americans are being forced out of our country at an alarming rate.
[00:41:42.398 --> 00:41:43.879]  I must die.
[00:41:43.879 --> 00:41:46.441]  He was given an offer he couldn't refuse.
[00:41:46.441 --> 00:41:49.082]  Make no mistake, we are at war.
[00:41:49.082 --> 00:41:54.085]  Every time an illegal dances across our border, it is an act of aggression against society.
[00:41:54.085 --> 00:41:57.107]  Machete comes in with a sniper rifle.
[00:41:57.107 --> 00:41:58.068]  Set up.
[00:41:58.068 --> 00:41:59.769]  To kill Robert De Niro.
[00:41:59.769 --> 00:42:01.210]  And left for dead.
[00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:01.970]  Oh, it's star studded.
[00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.232]  Taking your brothers and sisters in.
[00:42:05.232 --> 00:42:07.454]  Deporting them back to their own personal hells.
[00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:29.333]  I'll see what I can do.
[00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:34.975]  Lindsey Lohan.
[00:42:34.975 --> 00:42:38.797]  He's coming after us.
[00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:42.538]  He knows the score.
[00:42:42.538 --> 00:42:43.778]  He gets the women.
[00:42:43.778 --> 00:42:47.160]  Jessica Alba, Robert De Niro, Lindsey Lohan, Chief Moran.
[00:42:48.627 --> 00:42:50.908]  Steven Seagal.
[00:42:50.908 --> 00:42:52.368]  Don Johnson.
[00:42:52.368 --> 00:42:55.729]  And he kills the bad guys.
[00:42:55.729 --> 00:42:56.669]  We didn't cross the border!
[00:42:56.669 --> 00:43:00.890]  The border crossed us!
[00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:07.531]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:43:07.531 --> 00:43:12.672]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[00:44:04.509 --> 00:44:05.770]  Tyranny is here.
[00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.413]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:12.096]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:44:12.096 --> 00:44:17.801]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:24.046]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:44:24.466 --> 00:44:30.409]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:44:30.409 --> 00:44:34.610]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[00:44:50.377 --> 00:44:50.837]  It's here.

[00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:08.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:13.231 --> 00:47:19.897]  Okay, I want to finish up with this clip and then start taking your phone calls at 888-201-2244.
[00:47:19.897 --> 00:47:22.819]  And I want the truth.
[00:47:22.819 --> 00:47:24.581]  I want the beefs with America.
[00:47:24.581 --> 00:47:31.126]  Do people really believe that white people all have tails under their shorts?
[00:47:31.126 --> 00:47:33.508]  We're all devils?
[00:47:33.508 --> 00:47:37.832]  I see the mainstream corporate media, the university funding, since the 60s,
[00:47:39.392 --> 00:47:42.693]  Trying to radicalize Hispanics so they don't feel like they're part of America.
[00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:54.257]  What happens to the globalists and their program if Hispanic Americans are pro-Second Amendment, pro-family, which they already are, and pro-private property rights?
[00:47:54.257 --> 00:47:55.638]  I mean, what do the big banks want?
[00:47:55.638 --> 00:47:57.498]  They want to break down this country.
[00:47:57.498 --> 00:47:58.519]  That's why they're funding this.
[00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:05.850]  And the FBI doesn't go after groups calling for violence, calling for things if they're Hispanic.
[00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.552]  If they're white or black, they do.
[00:48:07.552 --> 00:48:08.414]  Why is this?
[00:48:08.414 --> 00:48:09.315]  What's going on?
[00:48:09.315 --> 00:48:09.976]  And what is...
[00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:21.535]  Robert Rodriguez doing, putting this film out, saying this is a message to Arizona, and then it shows, you know, the hero, the Hispanic hero, about to sniper rifle the anti-immigration person.
[00:48:21.535 --> 00:48:23.376]  And white people are the villain.
[00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:27.578]  And, you know, the Border Patrol agent gets, you know, explained to her that you can't control the border.
[00:48:27.578 --> 00:48:32.381]  Mexico admits they have the most draconian border policies in the world, next to North Korea.
[00:48:32.381 --> 00:48:33.862]  They don't like Guatemalans in.
[00:48:33.862 --> 00:48:36.123]  You can't have a country and have open borders.
[00:48:36.123 --> 00:48:38.645]  Especially when you have welfare, because then it bankrupts the country.
[00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:44.080]  I mean, illegal aliens in 800 plus cities, sanctuary cities, are above the law.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.760]  They don't even get taken to jail for drunk driving.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:51.681]  I saw a Knoxville news article last week where $105,000 was an illegal alien's car.
[00:48:51.681 --> 00:48:54.702]  They just let them go with it.
[00:48:54.702 --> 00:48:55.162]  Why?
[00:48:55.162 --> 00:48:56.322]  Why are they above the law?
[00:48:56.322 --> 00:49:01.043]  Because the globalists want them here to break down the border and drive down wages.
[00:49:01.043 --> 00:49:07.504]  And it'd be one thing if these groups weren't getting indoctrinated into anti-Second Amendment socialism.
[00:49:08.396 --> 00:49:11.558]  But let's just finish the trailer for Machete.
[00:49:11.558 --> 00:49:18.543]  And I'm telling you, this film's coming out in September, there's all these tensions going on, the media is fueling it, lying about the Arizona bill.
[00:49:18.543 --> 00:49:26.769]  It just says if they have first contact and pull somebody over for drunk driving or stop them for a taillight or whatever, and they don't have ID, that they're going to take them to jail.
[00:49:26.769 --> 00:49:27.790]  That happens to citizens!
[00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:35.735]  Hell, they've got bills introduced that if they say you might be a terrorist, you're stripped of your citizenship as a citizen and go into some dungeon.
[00:49:35.735 --> 00:49:37.996]  We're all losing our rights.
[00:49:37.996 --> 00:49:40.598]  Since when does the government care about people's rights?
[00:49:40.598 --> 00:49:44.200]  And if this does profile or violate people's rights, I'm against it.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.741]  That's not the issue here.
[00:49:45.741 --> 00:49:47.583]  The issue is this is being hyped up.
[00:49:48.413 --> 00:49:51.816]  And Rodriguez thinks he's going to make a bunch of money off Hispanics with this.
[00:49:51.816 --> 00:49:55.479]  What he's going to do is, and my money's on this, he's going to cause violence.
[00:49:55.479 --> 00:49:59.382]  And he's going to be liable for this because he's made it political and said it's about Arizona.
[00:49:59.382 --> 00:50:01.304]  Let's finish the trailer, then go to your calls.
[00:50:01.304 --> 00:50:09.331]  There's nothing I'd like more than to see that Mexican dance the bolero at the end of the road.
[00:50:09.331 --> 00:50:12.714]  And he kills the bad guys.
[00:50:12.714 --> 00:50:13.995]  We didn't cross the border!
[00:50:13.995 --> 00:50:15.797]  The border crossed us!
[00:50:21.517 --> 00:50:34.326]  Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba... Robert De Niro... Well, this kookaratch has got AK-47s and he's laying waste to everything he gets in his f***ing pan.
[00:50:34.326 --> 00:50:41.450]  But they soon realized... They just f***ed with the wrong Mexican.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.880]  Okay.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:55.442]  And it's groups of Mexican illegals running around, hacking up Border Patrol with machetes.
[00:50:55.442 --> 00:50:58.063]  And you got Border Patrol getting killed all over the place.
[00:50:58.063 --> 00:51:02.705]  Now, imagine if I made a movie about killing black people like this.
[00:51:02.705 --> 00:51:03.985]  I'd be in jail in five seconds.
[00:51:03.985 --> 00:51:05.926]  It's called... I mean, this is incredible.
[00:51:05.926 --> 00:51:09.167]  But it's part of a program to divide America against ourselves.
[00:51:09.907 --> 00:51:19.471]  I got a lot of other points I want to make, but I'm going to go to Noel, Grace, Rand, Texican, Raul, Bob, David, George, Joe, Ralph, and others.
[00:51:19.471 --> 00:51:20.431]  Only Hispanics.
[00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:24.533]  I want to get your view on this, because, look, I'm a white guy, and I know this.
[00:51:24.533 --> 00:51:30.975]  I was taught to be guilty, that white people are basically bad, white people are running around groveling to everyone.
[00:51:30.975 --> 00:51:33.456]  We are not a bunch of racist devils that want to get you.
[00:51:33.456 --> 00:51:37.338]  And when that communist school teacher said, these white scum don't...
[00:51:37.898 --> 00:51:40.760]  It's not that we're brown, that they dislike us.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.142]  It's that we're communist.
[00:51:42.142 --> 00:51:49.427]  Well, I mean, over 90% of these illegals, when they become citizens, I've seen the polls vote for gun control.
[00:51:49.427 --> 00:51:51.789]  I don't care if you've got green skin or blue skin.
[00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:56.333]  You're not getting my private property or my guns!
[00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:58.915]  And you've been conned in Latin America.
[00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:01.037]  Why do you want to come here and set up the same system?
[00:52:01.037 --> 00:52:02.318]  I mean, what is the deal?
[00:52:02.318 --> 00:52:05.020]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.722]  I've got a lot of other points I want to make, but remember,
[00:52:07.793 --> 00:52:12.775]  Three of the five kids kicked out of the San Francisco High School were Hispanic.
[00:52:12.775 --> 00:52:14.756]  You can't even wear an American flag.
[00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:18.078]  That upsets groups of Hispanics so bad.
[00:52:18.078 --> 00:52:26.402]  All over the country, they pull down American flags, run Mexican flags up at police stations, and at auto repair shops, and at post offices.
[00:52:26.402 --> 00:52:28.463]  And when people try to stop them, they get arrested.
[00:52:28.463 --> 00:52:29.704]  I mean, this is sedition!
[00:52:30.598 --> 00:52:34.863]  And I guess they're funding the Hispanic groups to do this so they can crush Hispanics.
[00:52:34.863 --> 00:52:37.225]  They don't want Hispanics to be part of America.
[00:52:37.225 --> 00:52:48.358]  And that's why the Hispanic members of Robert Rodriguez's staff on this film called me and said... I was already worried about it, and I said, well, I don't know what to say about the trailer, and I didn't really talk about it, and then I got these phone calls.
[00:52:48.618 --> 00:52:50.580]  Alex Jones, how are you doing this afternoon, my friend?
[00:53:11.437 --> 00:53:13.258]  It's pretty disgusting.
[00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:22.663]  I was born in Chicago, and I'm half Puerto Rican, half Venezuelan, growing up with a huge Hispanic background.
[00:53:22.663 --> 00:53:32.608]  I was taught and brought up on treating everyone as equal, the way the good Lord above made us all equal and created us beautifully.
[00:53:32.608 --> 00:53:37.690]  To hear people like La Raza talking about basic race and
[00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:44.837]  Alex, it gets my blood boiling.
[00:53:44.837 --> 00:53:59.525]  In high school, on Cinco de Mayo, we had, you know, the Mexican-American kids in our school, you know, tearing down our American flag post, pulling up their Mexican flag, walking out on school and trying to create fights.
[00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:00.506]  So you witnessed that?
[00:54:00.506 --> 00:54:02.267]  I mean, that's been on the news.
[00:54:02.267 --> 00:54:10.232]  Well, listen, in fact, I called Steve Mason, who runs an access show, he has this footage, I couldn't find it, of Gus Garcia when he was mayor of Austin.
[00:54:11.212 --> 00:54:17.298]  I'm going to play this saying Hispanics are the master god race descended from aliens.
[00:54:17.298 --> 00:54:25.145]  I mean, this La Raza thing was cooked up by the CIA, that's on record, telling them they're the god race.
[00:54:25.145 --> 00:54:26.026]  Wait till I play that.
[00:54:26.026 --> 00:54:28.028]  I'm going to play that later in the week.
[00:54:28.028 --> 00:54:29.149]  He's going to bring it by Monday.
[00:54:29.149 --> 00:54:31.731]  I mean, that's our city council.
[00:54:31.731 --> 00:54:32.772]  I mean, can you imagine?
[00:54:32.772 --> 00:54:34.234]  I mean, what do you think's behind this?
[00:54:35.726 --> 00:54:37.827]  But you know, you hit the nail on the coffin.
[00:54:37.827 --> 00:54:38.708]  Talk about the CIA.
[00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:41.850]  The CIA infiltrated the Black Panthers.
[00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:48.515]  They're just trying to create racial tension and get us diverted to what's really going on with these globalists.
[00:54:48.515 --> 00:55:01.203]  We need to, for my Hispanic friends in Illinois, around the Chicagoland area, and those listening in right now, re-educate our Hispanic friends on the Constitution and let them know just how beautiful our country is and how beautiful
[00:55:02.267 --> 00:55:17.675]  Great points, Noel, but what this is going to do is, this is going to encourage white racists, this is going to make other whites who aren't sophisticated get into their Raza, and this is going to play, and then Mexicans and others are going to get persecuted, which then just adds to the whole thing.
[00:55:19.184 --> 00:55:20.305]  It's disgusting.
[00:55:20.305 --> 00:55:22.806]  These globalists know what they're doing.
[00:55:22.806 --> 00:55:35.054]  They're smart and sophisticated at what they're doing, and we need to one-up them and do everything we can to all these documentaries, translate them in Spanish, and teach our friends what's going on in Mexico, what's going on here.
[00:55:35.054 --> 00:55:37.355]  Noelle, what do you want to say to Robert Rodriguez?
[00:55:37.355 --> 00:55:38.356]  I guarantee you he's going to see this.
[00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:48.472]  Well, Robert Rodriguez needs to understand that it's not about illegal immigration in the country.
[00:55:48.472 --> 00:55:56.515]  It's about the globalists trying to set up racial tension to get us diverted to what's really going on in this corrupt system in the world.
[00:55:56.515 --> 00:56:02.978]  We need to come together as one, peacefully, and go after the real criminals, the real racists, and those are the globalists.
[00:56:02.978 --> 00:56:04.018]  Goldman Sachs!
[00:56:04.018 --> 00:56:04.878]  The eugenicists.
[00:56:04.878 --> 00:56:06.119]  Well said, Noel.
[00:56:06.119 --> 00:56:06.979]  Let's jam in.
[00:56:06.979 --> 00:56:07.759]  One quick call.
[00:56:07.759 --> 00:56:08.640]  Grayson, Texas.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.020]  Go ahead.
[00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:12.814]  Yes, this is Grace.
[00:56:12.814 --> 00:56:13.155]  Welcome.
[00:56:16.733 --> 00:56:32.903]  My whole thing is that it is, you're absolutely correct, it's a setup, but what Hispanics don't understand is that we are the Hispanics that have been here for generations, and we're American.
[00:56:32.903 --> 00:56:41.389]  We're living the American dream, but what they're trying to set us up is to stay, to keep the poverty, the masses,
[00:56:41.949 --> 00:56:47.532]  They're going to cross the border to create more... He's absolutely right what your last caller said.
[00:56:47.532 --> 00:56:50.854]  But what are they going to do about the biracial children?
[00:56:50.854 --> 00:57:01.179]  Are they going to kill my grandbaby who's half white and half Hispanic but looks white, but the other grandbaby who looks totally Mexican?
[00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:03.480]  So what are they going to do about the biracial children?
[00:57:04.787 --> 00:57:07.350]  Well, according to the plan of San Diego, they're going to have to die.
[00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:08.271]  Ma'am, I'm going to go to break.
[00:57:08.271 --> 00:57:11.435]  I want to come back to you, let you finish up, Grace.
[00:57:11.435 --> 00:57:15.339]  Then I want to hurry through calls, because we're getting into banking in the last 30 minutes.
[00:57:15.339 --> 00:57:19.404]  Rand, Texican, Paul, Bob, David, George, Joe, Ralph, and others.
[00:57:20.305 --> 00:57:23.167]  Look, we got to get the message out, because look at the corporate media.
[00:57:23.167 --> 00:57:24.307]  It's owned by the globalists.
[00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:32.832]  It's pushing this like it's good, because they don't want Hispanics to be able to truly become American and be part of the free market, Bill of Rights system.
[00:57:32.832 --> 00:57:35.554]  They want to play us off against each other.
[00:57:35.554 --> 00:57:36.374]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:36.374 --> 00:57:37.475]  Stay there.
[00:57:37.475 --> 00:57:40.717]  This is very important information.
[00:57:40.717 --> 00:57:44.959]  We're going to hear from Hispanic Americans on this straight ahead, and I hope Robert Rodriguez is listening.
[00:57:50.566 --> 00:57:52.968]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:57:52.968 --> 00:57:55.269]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:57:55.269 --> 00:57:58.491]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:57:58.491 --> 00:58:03.595]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:58:03.595 --> 00:58:07.778]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:58:08.098 --> 00:58:10.439]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:58:10.439 --> 00:58:13.320]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.242]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:58:16.242 --> 00:58:23.845]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:58:24.184 --> 00:58:29.569]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:31.891]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:36.114]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:58:36.114 --> 00:58:37.175]  And I got news for you.
[00:58:37.175 --> 00:58:38.536]  You're everyone else.
[00:58:38.536 --> 00:58:40.038]  Invisible Empire.

[00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:51.827]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.827 --> 00:58:57.412]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.412 --> 00:59:02.436]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.436 --> 00:59:07.461]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:08.001 --> 00:59:13.226]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.226 --> 00:59:20.332]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.332 --> 00:59:21.473]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.473 --> 00:59:27.818]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.138 --> 00:59:31.319]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:31.319 --> 00:59:33.540]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.420]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:34.680]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.121]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:39.881]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:51.485 --> 00:59:55.087]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.087 --> 00:59:58.368]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:59:58.368 --> 00:59:59.009]  Big Brother
[01:00:06.613 --> 01:00:08.376]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:10.138]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.138 --> 01:00:11.740]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.642]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:17.488]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:21.534]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.675 --> 01:00:26.078]  Atari militia, nothing about race.
[01:00:26.078 --> 01:00:30.981]  They say if the government keeps cracking down on us, we'll have to physically fight back, they get arrested.
[01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:33.883]  Federal judges ordered them released, the feds haven't done it.
[01:00:33.883 --> 01:00:42.449]  Meanwhile, literally hundreds of videos of rallies everywhere talking about killing the gringo, the gringo's the devil.
[01:00:42.449 --> 01:00:48.294]  The average gringo's watching baseball and football like everybody else and doesn't know they're having a hole in the ground, I will assure you.
[01:00:49.195 --> 01:00:55.879]  But what this is going to do is this is going to make gringos start not trusting Hispanics and Hispanics not like gringos.
[01:00:55.879 --> 01:00:57.860]  Can't we see what's happening?
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.261]  Grace, Rand, others.
[01:00:59.261 --> 01:01:01.542]  Grace, I'm going to try to shut up for a moment.
[01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:03.003]  Make your point from Texas.
[01:01:03.003 --> 01:01:03.343]  Go ahead.
[01:01:04.622 --> 01:01:07.884]  Yes, we're living the American dream.
[01:01:07.884 --> 01:01:12.567]  We've become, my husband and I, part of the upper middle class.
[01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:15.569]  This is what the administration doesn't want.
[01:01:15.569 --> 01:01:20.892]  Now that's why they're opening the borders and inciting this kind of fever.
[01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:36.946]  Because the Hispanics that are living the American dream, who are Navy commanders, who are part of administrations in ISD, who are teachers now, and we're conservative Republicans, we're the ones they don't like.
[01:01:36.946 --> 01:01:39.308]  Because we want to be just called Americans.
[01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:43.468]  Well, in fact, the Radical Reconquistas have a word for it.
[01:01:43.468 --> 01:01:46.449]  It means rotten fruit in Spanish.
[01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:50.851]  And, I mean, do you ever feel pressure to, like, be part of this whole Raza thing?
[01:01:50.851 --> 01:01:53.252]  Because that's what this looks like to me.
[01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:54.552]  Yes.
[01:01:54.552 --> 01:01:58.054]  Down in the valley, in Texas, they're all Democrats.
[01:01:58.054 --> 01:02:03.176]  And our own family says the only reason you're a Republican is because you have money in the bank.
[01:02:04.014 --> 01:02:15.144]  And our own daughter is now joining that left-wing radicals in Oakland and San Francisco, and she's joined against us.
[01:02:15.144 --> 01:02:25.052]  And we'll never live in Texas because she says we're just a bunch of gun-toting conservative Republicans.
[01:02:25.052 --> 01:02:28.175]  Well, since when is it bad to own a gun to protect yourself?
[01:02:28.175 --> 01:02:29.296]  That's a basic freedom!
[01:02:30.632 --> 01:02:39.425]  Okay, but if you incite riots and if you incite violence among the Hispanics against the gringos, then the government's going to take away those guns.
[01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:48.120]  I agree, and no, that's a great point, and that's exactly what Hispanics are calling me and warning me about, and that's how I even learned about this many years ago.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.361]  Grace, God bless you.
[01:02:50.361 --> 01:03:08.431]  It is booing my heart to know that... I mean, I've always told myself, oh, it's maybe 5% of Hispanics that have this view, but now the media is trying to mainstream it to where if you're Hispanic, you've got to have these views, and I'm telling you, it's going to make the gringos who don't think like this start getting paranoid and start becoming racist towards you, and we do not need that.
[01:03:10.137 --> 01:03:10.977]  Alex, how's it going today?
[01:03:10.977 --> 01:03:15.579]  Well, the reason I'm calling is because I'm really mad about what I'm hearing out there.
[01:03:35.467 --> 01:03:44.571]  Growing up, I'm really from South Texas, but growing up I've had to deal with the word you were using earlier that you couldn't pronounce called Porcho.
[01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.392]  That Porcho, yeah, that's it.
[01:03:46.392 --> 01:03:48.954]  It was basically considered a gringo.
[01:03:48.954 --> 01:04:01.720]  They say, basically, I'm as white as you, which I got no problem with that, but all I'm saying is that I'm coming from four generations of Texans, not Mexicans, and we're basically getting stereotyped and
[01:04:03.246 --> 01:04:09.869]  Combined with the Mexicans, which I don't agree with, and there's all this racial tension.
[01:04:09.869 --> 01:04:18.753]  Alex, all I want to do is basically challenge all the Tejanos out there to stand up for their Bill of Rights and the American freedom.
[01:04:19.991 --> 01:04:20.892]  Well, God bless you.
[01:04:20.892 --> 01:04:22.713]  We're going to go to break in a moment.
[01:04:22.713 --> 01:04:30.298]  I want you to come back briefly and talk about the type of persecution you went through because I've been doing deep research on this for many years.
[01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:36.282]  And, you know, the Porcho, I mean, rotten fruit, the way Porchos get stabbed and killed.
[01:04:36.282 --> 01:04:39.744]  I want to find out if that's accurate from what you've seen.
[01:04:39.744 --> 01:04:48.510]  And why would somebody not want to choose America and the Bill of Rights and private property and guns over living like they do in Mexico under a corrupt state?
[01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:51.932]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[01:04:51.932 --> 01:04:59.557]  I mean, I frankly wouldn't care if there were 30 million illegals if they'd be pro-Second Amendment, but no, they're not, so, you know, stay there.

[01:06:00.495 --> 01:06:05.900]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.603]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:09.603 --> 01:06:14.888]  We're talking to an American who happens to be Hispanic, ran from Texas.
[01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:15.229]  In fact,
[01:06:18.689 --> 01:06:22.913]  I wanted to refresh my memory today, so I did about 30 minutes of research.
[01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:29.798]  Jose Antonio Navarro, known as the father of the first Texas Constitution, Hispanic.
[01:06:29.798 --> 01:06:33.181]  More than 30 of the people that died at the Alamo, Hispanic.
[01:06:33.181 --> 01:06:39.667]  What the media is doing is robbing Hispanic Americans of their heritage.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:50.228]  And again, when I was in public school, America's bad, Texas is bad, all these lies, all these distortions, and of course there's racist white people and bad stuff that they've done.
[01:06:50.228 --> 01:06:51.550]  I stand against them.
[01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:56.454]  The point is, Mexico has tripled the resources of the United States, conservatively.
[01:06:56.454 --> 01:07:01.458]  Oil, gold, timber, the land, the fertile soil.
[01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.500]  They have more billionaires than the U.S.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.302]  does, but the poorest population.
[01:07:06.002 --> 01:07:12.654]  And what you've got is this Mexican elite teamed up with the globalists that love to use racial division because they don't want
[01:07:13.851 --> 01:07:18.796]  Thirty-plus million illegals that come here to learn about the Second Amendment and private property.
[01:07:18.796 --> 01:07:21.919]  That's why the big universities are teaching them communism.
[01:07:21.919 --> 01:07:32.470]  And I played a clip last hour of a Hispanic teacher in California with his students up there saying whites are devils, we're going to get them, we're communists, we're taking over.
[01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:33.311]  But he tells the truth.
[01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:35.773]  He says, whites don't dislike us because we're brown.
[01:07:36.474 --> 01:07:38.035]  They dislike us because we're communists.
[01:07:38.035 --> 01:07:40.056]  Well, why would you want to be a communist?
[01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.137]  I love the fictional character Tony Montana.
[01:07:43.137 --> 01:07:45.959]  He doesn't like communism or slavery.
[01:07:45.959 --> 01:07:53.803]  But he, Rand brought up the term, yeah, it's Porcho or Rotten Fruit or the Hispanic Uncle Tom.
[01:07:53.803 --> 01:08:00.186]  How are you an Uncle Tom if you want to own your own property and not have an El Jefe shaking your family down for money?
[01:08:00.962 --> 01:08:01.342]  I don't
[01:08:21.087 --> 01:08:28.673]  False flagging, white people, and then it shows Mexicans with machetes killing the gringos and killing the border patrol.
[01:08:28.673 --> 01:08:32.796]  I mean, this is revolutionary and this mirrors the real stuff.
[01:08:32.796 --> 01:08:39.101]  The fire bombings in Santa Cruz, the murders, the white ranchers being killed in South Texas and Arizona.
[01:08:39.101 --> 01:08:40.122]  I mean, this is real!
[01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:51.866]  And so what they're doing is trying to radicalize Hispanic Americans, and maybe it is for a long-term plan because they don't want to have more Hispanics in America.
[01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:53.727]  Maybe it's meant to shut it down later.
[01:08:53.727 --> 01:08:54.088]  I don't know.
[01:08:54.088 --> 01:08:56.049]  This is very sophisticated.
[01:08:56.049 --> 01:09:02.034]  But when Robert Rodriguez's people contacted me, people inside his organization saying, we're really worried about this film.
[01:09:02.034 --> 01:09:04.215]  It's going to be a backlash against Hispanics.
[01:09:04.215 --> 01:09:08.499]  Well, I mean, you can tell why, because it dovetails with all of this racist garbage
[01:09:09.099 --> 01:09:10.659]  That's being spewed out here.
[01:09:10.659 --> 01:09:25.083]  Rand, for stations that just joined us, some stations don't care that first five-minute segment, recap what you went through as a Hispanic American who saw himself as an American, because the last lady was saying the same thing for her.
[01:09:25.083 --> 01:09:34.925]  She sees herself as a pro-property rights, Second Amendment, Hispanic American, and so her own daughter is coming against her saying, you've got to join the RAZA.
[01:09:34.925 --> 01:09:35.445]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:09:36.601 --> 01:09:46.049]  Wow, Alex, I just want to state again, you know, growing up in South Texas, actually North Central Texas, I went through that persecution.
[01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:50.213]  Basically, Mexican people asked me, well, what part of Mexico are you from?
[01:09:50.213 --> 01:09:52.054]  And I said, well, I'm an American.
[01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:55.377]  They basically took that as an insult and called me a porcho.
[01:09:55.377 --> 01:09:57.219]  And a porcho, I said, what is a porcho?
[01:09:57.219 --> 01:09:59.521]  They said, well, a porcho is basically a white boy.
[01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:05.432]  I guess well if that's the title you give me I guess that's what it is just because I am American.
[01:10:05.432 --> 01:10:07.434]  I don't have any roots in Mexico.
[01:10:07.434 --> 01:10:09.395]  I have nothing against the Mexican people.
[01:10:09.395 --> 01:10:14.418]  I have nothing against Mexican people being here legally paying their taxes just like I do.
[01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:18.901]  What we need to realize out there folks is that we need to stand together
[01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:29.695]  As Hispanos, or Tejanos, and all over the nation, as Hispanic Americans stand up together and fight the globalists and what's really going on.
[01:10:29.695 --> 01:10:39.279]  What did you think of me playing that clip of that, because I could play countless clips of them saying, we're going to have communism, we're going to get the gringos, we're going to kick them out, they're scum.
[01:10:39.279 --> 01:10:48.282]  I mean, that is going to take white people, believe me, who on average, I'd say 95% are not racist towards Hispanics, that's going to make them start
[01:10:48.982 --> 01:10:51.745]  I mean, that's going to really be a backlash.
[01:10:51.745 --> 01:10:53.446]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:10:53.446 --> 01:10:59.431]  It's already happening out there and people need to realize this and see through the lies and what's going on.
[01:10:59.431 --> 01:11:06.017]  And Hispanics should come together again, like I say, and educate those Mexicanos or people that are out there that don't know.
[01:11:06.017 --> 01:11:12.603]  Listen, I would vote for Hispanic Americans all day long, just like I did Debra Medina.
[01:11:12.603 --> 01:11:14.605]  If they're pro-Second Amendment and sovereignty,
[01:11:15.325 --> 01:11:17.187]  All I've got is my republic.
[01:11:17.187 --> 01:11:20.489]  All I've got is those rights that are so special that nobody else has got.
[01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:21.791]  Does that mean America's perfect?
[01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:23.572]  No, because we're violating that.
[01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:31.999]  But I mean, to hear them saying communism is good, to hear them saying this, and it's just, it is so evil.
[01:11:31.999 --> 01:11:33.260]  Rand, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:33.921]  God bless you.
[01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:36.863]  It buoys my heart to hear you saying this.
[01:11:36.863 --> 01:11:39.726]  That's why we're only taking calls from Hispanics to get their view.
[01:11:39.726 --> 01:11:41.967]  I mean, if you agree with what these folks are saying,
[01:11:42.648 --> 01:11:45.409]  I'm telling you though, the illegitimate government is behind this.
[01:11:45.409 --> 01:11:49.130]  Texican in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.651]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:52.112]  Good to talk to you.
[01:11:52.112 --> 01:11:59.054]  Last time I saw you was at End of Fed here in Dallas, and I really wanted to go say hi to you, but there's so many people around you.
[01:11:59.054 --> 01:12:05.897]  But anyway, my opinion is, you know, I'm from here, I was born in South Texas, raised in Corpus Christi.
[01:12:07.754 --> 01:12:11.216]  You know, gringos is all, we all got along with each other.
[01:12:11.216 --> 01:12:15.480]  I don't see how, I guess it was the illegals because they're kind of separated.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.282]  They don't live in the same middle class neighborhoods as the rest of us.
[01:12:18.282 --> 01:12:19.043]  Exactly!
[01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.105]  No, they want us all fighting with each other.
[01:12:21.105 --> 01:12:26.990]  I mean, think of the illegal aliens at that San Francisco school who kicked out Hispanics.
[01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:29.131]  It was Hispanics wearing American flags.
[01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:33.295]  Those Hispanics want to be Americans and the Mexicans are up here intimidating them.
[01:12:34.548 --> 01:12:35.068]  Absolutely.
[01:12:35.068 --> 01:12:41.269]  In fact, when I was a kid, I was telling a story about that the other day at the bar while I was talking to some people about this very same subject.
[01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:44.690]  And I had a shirt that my mom put an American flag on it.
[01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:51.631]  And I remember, you know, Mrs. Welsh, you know, explaining to me the colors of the flag and what they represented.
[01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:55.892]  And, you know, my dad was a World War II Korean War guy.
[01:12:55.892 --> 01:12:59.293]  Three purple hearts, silver star, bronze star, clearly decorated.
[01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:00.693]  You know, my son is an Air Force
[01:13:01.457 --> 01:13:04.179]  Well, listen, I love your culture, too.
[01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:06.280]  That's what's so sickening about this.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.682]  I wish Mexico was free.
[01:13:08.682 --> 01:13:09.642]  I mean, I might retire down there.
[01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:25.812]  You know, we paid them for the Southwest.
[01:13:25.812 --> 01:13:27.713]  I mean, Texas, we outright fought them for it.
[01:13:27.713 --> 01:13:32.737]  I mean, that's how long my family's been here on both sides, just like the color before me.
[01:13:32.737 --> 01:13:33.818]  I looked the number up.
[01:13:33.818 --> 01:13:34.519]  I looked the number up.
[01:13:34.519 --> 01:13:40.404]  I was having an argument with my dad this morning and he said, no, half of the people in the war for Texas were Hispanic.
[01:13:40.404 --> 01:13:41.925]  And I said, I thought it was a third.
[01:13:41.925 --> 01:13:43.046]  I went and looked it up.
[01:13:43.046 --> 01:13:44.827]  At least a half were Hispanic.
[01:13:44.827 --> 01:13:45.848]  They don't teach that.
[01:13:45.848 --> 01:13:48.210]  They don't want people to feel like they belong here.
[01:13:49.144 --> 01:13:52.725]  Jose Antonio Navarro was one of the founders of the Constitution.
[01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:55.366]  I found that out when I was living in San Antonio.
[01:13:55.366 --> 01:13:59.467]  And then I found out, you know, well, then we had this, Zavala was our Vice President.
[01:13:59.467 --> 01:13:59.907]  Right?
[01:13:59.907 --> 01:14:00.107]  Yes.
[01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:01.128]  So we had Houston.
[01:14:01.128 --> 01:14:02.388]  So we got along, okay?
[01:14:02.388 --> 01:14:05.929]  And you can ask my mother, because she's from Orange City, down in the country.
[01:14:05.929 --> 01:14:10.630]  And she's not with us anymore, but back in the old days, she said, hey, all the gringos spoke Spanish.
[01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:13.751]  Everybody got along.
[01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:15.672]  Well, everybody was intermarrying, too.
[01:14:16.963 --> 01:14:21.609]  People were doing that, people just like now, just like you can go anywhere else, you know.
[01:14:22.385 --> 01:14:27.687]  Maybe the blacks had it harder than us, you know, but... I mean, look, everybody's had... Look, nothing was perfect.
[01:14:27.687 --> 01:14:29.287]  There was discrimination.
[01:14:29.287 --> 01:14:34.069]  But you go down to Mexico, no matter who you are, and try to set something up, you're going to get discriminated against.
[01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.529]  That's tribalism.
[01:14:35.529 --> 01:14:48.193]  But I've really studied this history, and I agree with you, that's what's so sick about this Texican, is that... Do you agree with me, though, that the federal government is injecting this because they're scared of these new Hispanics?
[01:14:49.062 --> 01:14:53.745]  Well, you know, this government is completely corrupt and it's just, like you said, it's just...
[01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:04.010]  It's not even our government anymore.
[01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:05.951]  I mean, why do you think my son wants to get out of the Air Force?
[01:15:05.951 --> 01:15:07.451]  He just doesn't.
[01:15:07.451 --> 01:15:08.332]  Everybody knows.
[01:15:08.332 --> 01:15:09.592]  Exactly.
[01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:11.273]  People say, why do you support America?
[01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:12.974]  It's got all these wars and is evil.
[01:15:12.974 --> 01:15:15.715]  My America died when they killed Kennedy.
[01:15:15.715 --> 01:15:16.596]  That's really the mark.
[01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:18.937]  1963 in Dallas, Texas.
[01:15:18.937 --> 01:15:21.478]  That's when the Republic started dying.
[01:15:21.478 --> 01:15:23.479]  I want my Republic back.
[01:15:23.479 --> 01:15:26.420]  And I want my neighbors to be whatever color they want.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.380]  I just want them to be pro-
[01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:29.122]  Freedom!
[01:15:29.122 --> 01:15:35.569]  I mean, my God, why did our country have half the wealth in the world with 4% of the population?
[01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:37.952]  Because we had more liberty.
[01:15:37.952 --> 01:15:39.373]  Liberty creates wealth.
[01:15:39.373 --> 01:15:40.935]  God bless you, Texican.
[01:15:40.935 --> 01:15:45.981]  I'm gonna go fast to Raul, Bob, David, George, Joe, Ralph, and others.
[01:15:45.981 --> 01:15:48.664]  And again, this is what most Hispanics, from my study,
[01:15:49.986 --> 01:15:59.383]  Our four, freedom, liberty, the second amendment, private property, but the mainstream media is trying to make Mexicans, anybody that has a Mexican heritage, feel like they gotta be part of this.
[01:16:00.535 --> 01:16:08.538]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:16:08.538 --> 01:16:15.880]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:22.863]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:16:22.863 --> 01:16:23.703]  Listen carefully.
[01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:33.805]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:16:33.805 --> 01:16:38.026]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:41.026]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[01:16:59.275 --> 01:16:59.576]  800-409-5633.
[01:16:59.576 --> 01:17:01.617]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:07.202]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:17:07.202 --> 01:17:12.226]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:17:12.226 --> 01:17:17.251]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:17:17.771 --> 01:17:22.992]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:17:22.992 --> 01:17:30.114]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:17:30.114 --> 01:17:31.234]  And here's the best part.
[01:17:31.234 --> 01:17:37.576]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:41.099]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:17:41.099 --> 01:17:43.321]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:44.202]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:44.462]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:17:44.462 --> 01:17:47.905]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:17:47.905 --> 01:17:49.647]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:18:01.837 --> 01:18:05.798]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:05.798 --> 01:18:14.660]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.

[01:19:03.927 --> 01:19:05.189]  Tyranny is here.
[01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:08.892]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:19:08.892 --> 01:19:11.354]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:19:11.354 --> 01:19:17.220]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:23.466]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:19:23.886 --> 01:19:29.831]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:34.034]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:19:34.034 --> 01:19:38.318]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:19:38.318 --> 01:19:44.283]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:19:44.283 --> 01:19:47.826]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:49.807]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:19:49.807 --> 01:19:50.248]  It's here.

[01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:03.092]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:03.092 --> 01:20:05.153]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.153 --> 01:20:08.354]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:22.590]  You know, growing up in Dallas playing football and basketball and baseball, I didn't think, this is a black kid, this is a Hispanic kid, this is a white kid.
[01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:25.111]  Things are worse now than they were back then.
[01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:31.473]  Because the media, if you're against government-run healthcare, written by the insurance companies, they call you a racist.
[01:20:31.473 --> 01:20:33.313]  They use it as a weapon.
[01:20:33.313 --> 01:20:39.155]  And now Robert Rodriguez has got a race war film, where his own people that work for him who are Hispanic or are concerned,
[01:20:40.459 --> 01:20:43.901]  Uh, now it's just out in the open and the mainstream media covers it up.
[01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:46.302]  We have to make a decision.
[01:20:46.302 --> 01:20:48.503]  What side are we on?
[01:20:48.503 --> 01:20:50.884]  Are we for the Republic and the Bill of Rights?
[01:20:50.884 --> 01:20:54.265]  It isn't perfect, but it's better than everything else.
[01:20:54.265 --> 01:21:06.931]  I mean, how could kids in San Francisco at a high school, and the media didn't even say this for three days, it was later on MSNBC, that three of the five kids that were kicked out were Hispanic, and that there were their Hispanic parents going, look, they're Americans!
[01:21:07.807 --> 01:21:09.227]  They're allowed to wear American flags!
[01:21:09.227 --> 01:21:11.908]  They're sick of all this Mexico stuff!
[01:21:11.908 --> 01:21:22.590]  I mean, even if you believe Mexico previously really had the Southwest, and even though the French had it and the Russians had California, nobody could hold it.
[01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:24.950]  Still, why would you want this to be Mexico?
[01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:27.930]  Look at it!
[01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:30.711]  It's our Bill of Rights that's so precious.
[01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:34.172]  And... Let's just go back to your calls.
[01:21:34.172 --> 01:21:36.372]  Raul in California, what's your view on this, sir?
[01:21:37.605 --> 01:21:39.107]  Hello sir, how are you doing?
[01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:39.587]  Doing alright.
[01:21:39.587 --> 01:21:42.290]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:46.375]  I want to thank you so much for what you do, Alex Jones.
[01:21:46.375 --> 01:21:48.317]  First of all, I'm so pissed off.
[01:21:48.317 --> 01:21:53.042]  I'm so disgusted of what Latinos are doing down in the south.
[01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:57.647]  They make my race being a Mexican a disgrace, you know?
[01:21:59.551 --> 01:22:00.972]  Well, it's the media doing that.
[01:22:00.972 --> 01:22:03.094]  It's the media that's setting all this up.
[01:22:03.094 --> 01:22:09.118]  I mean, it's like they're putting two pit bulls in a cage to kill each other, and we need to realize that.
[01:22:09.118 --> 01:22:10.879]  Go ahead.
[01:22:10.879 --> 01:22:11.980]  Exactly.
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:19.906]  One thing that all these Latinos, they're not educated Alex Jones, because I even asked my parents, what do you think is going on in this world?
[01:22:19.906 --> 01:22:22.928]  And they start going off what the Gringos are doing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:22.928 --> 01:22:25.089]  And I told them, look at what you guys are saying.
[01:22:25.089 --> 01:22:27.011]  You better stop blaming the Gringos.
[01:22:27.011 --> 01:22:27.491]  It's not them.
[01:22:29.531 --> 01:22:30.351]  We're good to go.
[01:22:49.349 --> 01:22:51.590]  We should be dealing with these people first and bring them to justice.
[01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:52.251]  Exactly.
[01:22:52.251 --> 01:22:54.552]  Look, it's a North American Union.
[01:22:54.552 --> 01:23:04.697]  They say in the North American Union documents they'll use racial strife to just get rid of the border entirely, and then we'll all just be slaves.
[01:23:04.697 --> 01:23:05.398]  Exactly.
[01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:06.038]  And get on my nerves.
[01:23:06.038 --> 01:23:07.979]  Me, myself, I can't.
[01:23:07.979 --> 01:23:08.779]  I'm a great American.
[01:23:08.779 --> 01:23:09.960]  I was a year old.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.221]  I got my drink when I was five years old.
[01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.503]  And then two years ago I become a citizen.
[01:23:14.503 --> 01:23:17.084]  I've earned my citizenship for serving in the military for four and a half years.
[01:23:17.782 --> 01:23:27.205]  You know, and it gets on my nerves that we're fighting this ridiculous, bogus war, when in reality, it's something else, you know?
[01:23:27.205 --> 01:23:29.886]  Let me ask you this question, Raul.
[01:23:29.886 --> 01:23:39.369]  When you talk to your Hispanic friends, what, I mean, are you seeing pressure to force them into this whole RAZA communist movement, or what are you seeing?
[01:23:39.369 --> 01:23:42.230]  Pretty much the same thing, you know, like they tell me.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.902]  They tell me, you're a traitor, you're a traitor, why are you saying this?
[01:23:47.902 --> 01:23:53.245]  I even tell them, do you really want the same type of government in the United States?
[01:23:53.245 --> 01:23:55.146]  Do you want communism in the United States?
[01:23:55.146 --> 01:24:00.109]  Do you want organized crime from Mexico and the United States?
[01:24:00.109 --> 01:24:03.431]  And I tell them, I don't want it exactly, that's what you're doing.
[01:24:03.431 --> 01:24:06.933]  By you saying all this, that means you're promoting
[01:24:08.394 --> 01:24:13.458]  You're promoting the Mexican Agenda, the New World Agenda, into the United States, and that's what we don't want.
[01:24:31.035 --> 01:24:42.221]  From the Hispanics I've talked to, that's who warned me about this, people that work with him, they believe this is going to actually create division and hurt Latinos.
[01:24:42.221 --> 01:24:50.046]  I pretty much all I want to tell them is, it's not about being Mexican, it's not about being black, being white, being Asian, being black, it's about humanity.
[01:24:50.046 --> 01:24:59.811]  It's about understanding that once you promote this hatred against racism into society, you're automatically
[01:25:00.799 --> 01:25:06.240]  Giving the way for the devil to do his deeds.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.501]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:07.501 --> 01:25:08.641]  Great points.
[01:25:08.641 --> 01:25:10.042]  I mean, we can play the clips.
[01:25:10.042 --> 01:25:16.303]  That's what's promoted on the colleges and the universities and the schools is that whites are the devil and must be driven out.
[01:25:16.303 --> 01:25:17.684]  What do you think whites are going to do?
[01:25:17.684 --> 01:25:19.784]  They're going to start going after Hispanics.
[01:25:19.784 --> 01:25:25.546]  I mean, it is the globalists are putting us in a cage like pit bulls to kill each other.
[01:25:25.546 --> 01:25:27.286]  And I want to deal with that.
[01:25:27.286 --> 01:25:29.587]  I want to give the number out to Troublemaker Studios.
[01:25:30.538 --> 01:25:39.362]  When we come back from break, so you can call Robert Rodriguez and let him know what you think about this new film Machete, this folk icon who kills the gringo.
[01:25:39.362 --> 01:25:40.442]  What is your view of this?
[01:25:40.442 --> 01:25:42.603]  Are you concerned about this?
[01:25:42.603 --> 01:25:48.706]  Because if there is violence, there's already violence, but if there's violence that comes out of this, it's just going to be horrible.
[01:25:48.706 --> 01:25:49.226]  God bless you.
[01:25:49.226 --> 01:25:50.387]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:50.387 --> 01:25:51.567]  Bob in Carolina.
[01:25:51.567 --> 01:25:53.568]  Don't know what Carolina, but from Carolina.
[01:25:53.568 --> 01:25:54.329]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:25:54.329 --> 01:25:54.649]  Go ahead.
[01:26:00.205 --> 01:26:07.949]  First of all, I'd like to say don't give up banjos or the tacos because I know you love them.
[01:26:07.949 --> 01:26:11.711]  Secondly, I'd like to say that we love white people.
[01:26:11.711 --> 01:26:13.372]  We don't want to fight with the white people.
[01:26:13.372 --> 01:26:17.755]  I'm a Hispanic, I'm Mexican, you know, whatever.
[01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:18.355]  We don't want to fight.
[01:26:18.355 --> 01:26:23.038]  Let me just say, the average white person is a thumb-sucking guilty person who thinks they're evil.
[01:26:23.038 --> 01:26:25.399]  So believe me, the white people don't want to get you either.
[01:26:25.399 --> 01:26:26.680]  But they are starting to get scared.
[01:26:27.987 --> 01:26:28.888]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:28.888 --> 01:26:30.068]  And that's what it's for.
[01:26:30.068 --> 01:26:31.569]  I mean, I've seen it in L.A.
[01:26:31.569 --> 01:26:33.210]  Look, I grew up in L.A.
[01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:34.411]  with 14 gangs in my school.
[01:26:34.411 --> 01:26:37.412]  My father is a principal at L.A.
[01:26:37.412 --> 01:26:38.493]  USD.
[01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:41.975]  There's only so many roads that Hispanics can go down.
[01:26:41.975 --> 01:26:53.762]  And from what I've seen growing up, you can either be in a gang, or you can be educated in like a Rasside-style education system that is basically communist.
[01:26:54.378 --> 01:27:00.181]  It's a basically, LA Unified is a basically communist system and they teach basic socialism communism.
[01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:03.242]  And again, that's the big bankers that have done that.
[01:27:03.242 --> 01:27:08.024]  They've only given Hispanics the road to be communist with the big banks funding it.
[01:27:08.024 --> 01:27:09.165]  Can't people see that?
[01:27:09.165 --> 01:27:19.470]  That the big banks don't want Hispanics to be part of America and be gun-toting, private property-owning members of freedom?
[01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:20.090]  Absolutely.
[01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:22.471]  And for the Hispanic people, I mean,
[01:27:22.975 --> 01:27:28.222]  Look, there's bad people that are white, that are black, that are Hispanic.
[01:27:28.222 --> 01:27:29.684]  That's just the way it's going to be.
[01:27:29.684 --> 01:27:33.810]  And there's good people that are white, that are black, and that are Hispanic.
[01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:38.276]  And the good people need to stand up and they need to speak out.
[01:27:39.165 --> 01:27:41.866]  And they need to stick together, because that's what it's going to come down to.
[01:27:56.511 --> 01:27:59.453]  Again, they're moral, so they're not out looking for power.
[01:27:59.453 --> 01:28:00.453]  They need to.
[01:28:00.453 --> 01:28:07.778]  We need powerful Hispanic leaders that are anti-New World Order that I and Ron Paul and others can support.
[01:28:07.778 --> 01:28:09.139]  I would do it instantly.
[01:28:09.139 --> 01:28:11.520]  I would promote them for office.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.901]  I would get them campaign donations.
[01:28:13.901 --> 01:28:17.524]  Look, I wouldn't care if the whole Congress was 500 Hispanics!
[01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:21.646]  If they give me freedom and cut my taxes, I don't give one you-know-what!
[01:28:21.646 --> 01:28:23.167]  I want freedom!
[01:28:23.447 --> 01:28:29.191]  And I can't believe the big banks are turning the Hispanics into an army of New World Order socialism!
[01:28:29.191 --> 01:28:31.092]  It's dangerous!
[01:28:31.092 --> 01:28:31.853]  It is dangerous.
[01:28:31.853 --> 01:28:39.257]  And with the other thing I'd like to interject here is that also Hispanics do not have the leaders, like you said.
[01:28:39.257 --> 01:28:42.900]  If you look on TV or the movies or anything like that,
[01:28:43.407 --> 01:28:45.388]  We don't really have a whole lot of leaders to look up to.
[01:28:45.388 --> 01:28:45.889]  We need them!
[01:28:45.889 --> 01:28:46.569]  God bless you.
[01:28:46.569 --> 01:28:47.230]  I'm out of time.
[01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:48.791]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:50.352]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:50.352 --> 01:28:55.676]  Tomorrow, I'm going to have again, when we don't have guests on, we have a couple big guests tomorrow, nothing but Hispanic callers.
[01:28:55.676 --> 01:28:56.457]  I want to hear more of this.
[01:28:56.457 --> 01:28:58.278]  This is making me feel a lot better.
[01:28:58.278 --> 01:28:58.979]  Oh, thank God.
[01:29:01.038 --> 01:29:07.682]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:29:07.682 --> 01:29:12.825]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:29:12.825 --> 01:29:21.550]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:25.633]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:29:25.633 --> 01:29:27.894]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:29:29.926 --> 01:29:34.629]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:38.492]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:29:38.492 --> 01:29:39.712]  Others don't.
[01:29:39.712 --> 01:29:41.854]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:29:41.854 --> 01:29:43.635]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:30:46.698 --> 01:30:47.658]  We're good to go.
[01:31:00.228 --> 01:31:08.211]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:31:08.211 --> 01:31:15.573]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:31:15.573 --> 01:31:22.556]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:31:22.556 --> 01:31:23.396]  Listen carefully.
[01:31:23.776 --> 01:31:33.479]  Starting immediately, efoodsdirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:31:33.479 --> 01:31:37.720]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.721]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[01:31:57.129 --> 01:32:01.312]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.312 --> 01:32:06.896]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:11.919]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.919 --> 01:32:16.963]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:17.483 --> 01:32:22.707]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:22.707 --> 01:32:29.811]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:30.932]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:30.932 --> 01:32:37.637]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.637 --> 01:32:40.819]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:32:40.819 --> 01:32:43.961]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:47.603 --> 01:32:50.565]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:56.668]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:56.668 --> 01:33:01.651]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:01.651 --> 01:33:03.192]  Coast to coast.
[01:33:03.192 --> 01:33:05.213]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:08.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:21.032]  Webster Tarpley has a doctorate of history and economics.
[01:33:21.032 --> 01:33:22.432]  He's a best-selling author.
[01:33:22.432 --> 01:33:25.254]  We sell all four of his books at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:25.254 --> 01:33:34.018]  We have a new film out, by the way, made by William Lewis, which is Don't Tread on Me, now available at InfoWars.com, about states' rights, Tenth Amendment.
[01:33:34.018 --> 01:33:38.500]  We need to be part of a tribal gang mentality, but not on race.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.341]  Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[01:33:40.341 --> 01:33:43.243]  Tarpley will be on with us during the weekday show for a full hour this week.
[01:33:43.823 --> 01:33:58.412]  I'm going to do this full segment with him, part of the next, and I'm going to jam in David, George, Joe, Ralph, and a few others commenting about how the media, Hollywood, is trying to create racial division between Hispanics, whites, and others of the great game of division.
[01:33:58.412 --> 01:34:01.835]  But Robert Rodriguez, the accomplished director,
[01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:12.651]  Is here in Austin, Texas, and he has made a new film called Machete that basically invokes race war from the trailer, and I've talked to people on his staff about it.
[01:34:12.651 --> 01:34:14.473]  I'm going to reach out to him this week.
[01:34:14.473 --> 01:34:24.441]  I don't want you to be hateful, but especially Hispanics that want to let him know what they think about what he's doing and how this may cause a backlash against Hispanics.
[01:34:24.441 --> 01:34:25.162]  The number is 512.
[01:34:25.162 --> 01:34:28.364]  It's good to call him today and tomorrow when they're there.
[01:34:28.364 --> 01:34:28.404]  512-334-7777.
[01:34:31.767 --> 01:34:32.368]  That's 512-334-7777 or fax 512-391-1529.
[01:34:32.368 --> 01:34:33.169]  Again, that's fax 512-391-1529.
[01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:36.993]  Or if you want to write them a letter, it's 4900 Old Manor Road, Austin, Texas 78723.
[01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:55.110]  Because I don't think he's a bad guy.
[01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:58.151]  I talked to a few film directors I know that know him.
[01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:06.693]  I talked to a Hispanic film producer that I'm good friends with, and he said, look, Rodriguez, you know, just thinks this is a fun exploitation film.
[01:35:06.693 --> 01:35:08.053]  But he's being played here.
[01:35:08.053 --> 01:35:11.214]  4900 Old Manor Road, Austin, Texas, 78723.
[01:35:13.735 --> 01:35:18.759]  But to also call him tomorrow and, you know, just explain to him what's going on here.
[01:35:18.759 --> 01:35:20.741]  That's very, very important to do.
[01:35:20.741 --> 01:35:28.427]  Let's go to Webster Griffin Tarpley, because White House doesn't rule out sabotage in Thursday's wild Wall Street plunge.
[01:35:28.427 --> 01:35:35.112]  Tarpley, two years ago, during the last plunge, predicted that by 2010, we would see the stimulus money run out.
[01:35:35.112 --> 01:35:35.733]  He's on record.
[01:35:35.733 --> 01:35:38.415]  He's in Obama deception and fall of the Republic.
[01:35:38.415 --> 01:35:42.218]  One film made over a year ago, one six months ago, saying everything that's now happened.
[01:35:43.939 --> 01:35:52.162]  So he's here to break down what he thinks happened in the market Thursday with a thousand point drop and what's happening with Greece, what the IMF and World Bank are doing.
[01:35:52.162 --> 01:35:58.624]  Goldman Sachs now in the emails premeditatedly doing this as a financial bomb.
[01:35:58.624 --> 01:35:59.584]  They want to wreck.
[01:35:59.584 --> 01:36:04.726]  It's the false banker economy against the real economy of Main Street.
[01:36:04.726 --> 01:36:09.268]  That's the real enemy and that's why they want us racially divided fighting with each other.
[01:36:09.268 --> 01:36:10.488]  Webster, good to have you here with us.
[01:36:10.768 --> 01:36:11.429]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:36:11.429 --> 01:36:12.230]  How are you?
[01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:12.410]  Good.
[01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:13.191]  You've got the floor.
[01:36:13.191 --> 01:36:18.197]  Break down your intel on the thousand point plunge and what's happening right now globally.
[01:36:18.197 --> 01:36:25.745]  First of all, on the thousand points and ten minutes on Thursday afternoon, you've got to realize that a panic was already there.
[01:36:25.745 --> 01:36:30.531]  You had a pre-existing panic, meaning that you had a lot of people dumping assets.
[01:36:31.209 --> 01:36:51.143]  And in particular, it's likely that some of the hedge funds, some of the hyenas in this hedge fund wolf pack that attacks Greece and others, people, there are some hedge funds who bet wrong, and they were very likely dumping assets, panic distressed sales of assets into an already panicked market.
[01:36:51.143 --> 01:36:53.885]  Now, it's made worse by the fact that you've got these new
[01:36:55.005 --> 01:37:18.663]  Things at least relatively new program trading has been around for 10 or 20 years But now you've got high frequency trading and flash trading and these are computer Trading programs that go thousands of times a second even even more than that so you've got somebody dumping assets and then as this panic is building and
[01:37:19.372 --> 01:37:21.733]  You're getting what you already had in 1929.
[01:37:21.733 --> 01:37:22.973]  This part is not new.
[01:37:22.973 --> 01:37:26.034]  You've got a lot of people who are put in stop-loss orders.
[01:37:26.034 --> 01:37:39.959]  And the stop-loss orders say, if the stock goes to X, then sell my shares at X. So, as you start going through those stop-loss orders, you get a cascading, snowballing effect as it goes down.
[01:37:39.959 --> 01:37:42.560]  So you go down to $10,000, to $9,900, to $9,800, and wherever it ended up.
[01:37:48.183 --> 01:37:51.307]  Then, of course, the Plunge Protection Team comes in.
[01:37:51.307 --> 01:37:53.170]  This is the most obvious thing in the world.
[01:37:53.170 --> 01:38:02.743]  The PPT, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, and the way they do it, usually, is through futures in Chicago, where they buy the futures
[01:38:03.163 --> 01:38:04.863]  To updraft the market, right?
[01:38:04.863 --> 01:38:20.127]  They keep the price of the future in Chicago above the price of the stock in New York so that the program traders will then sell the future, buy the stock, and then with, you know, a couple of hundred million in Chicago, you can generate billions and billions of buying in New York.
[01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:22.208]  So that's what brought it back, if you will.
[01:38:22.208 --> 01:38:29.370]  The artificial part of this is the recovery, and I'm quite sure that within a week or two, we will get down to the same level.
[01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:30.991]  By the way, I mean, you've written
[01:38:54.270 --> 01:39:01.455]  A book on this many years ago, over two years ago, you predicted that it would start in Greece, go to Portugal, Spain.
[01:39:01.455 --> 01:39:03.096]  You're not here whistling Dixie.
[01:39:03.096 --> 01:39:07.558]  I mean, I want to just point out Webster Tarpley is one of our chief economic advisors.
[01:39:07.558 --> 01:39:10.760]  You know exactly what you're talking about with the bona fides.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.263]  What you've said has come true because you understand the technical facts at a deep level.
[01:39:15.862 --> 01:39:16.943]  Yeah, thank you very much.
[01:39:16.943 --> 01:39:19.924]  It's a world economic depression and a disintegration.
[01:39:19.924 --> 01:39:21.625]  The disintegration is this.
[01:39:21.625 --> 01:39:27.008]  We already had the disintegration of some banks, but now you're going to get the disintegration of the euro.
[01:39:27.008 --> 01:39:28.549]  A chaotic collapse.
[01:39:28.549 --> 01:39:30.270]  Something that nobody should want.
[01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:33.191]  The chaotic collapse of the European Central Bank.
[01:39:33.191 --> 01:39:35.073]  And by the way, this is now mainstream news.
[01:39:35.073 --> 01:39:37.134]  You were saying this two years ago, they laugh.
[01:39:37.134 --> 01:39:41.216]  Now they're saying in the New York Times the euro may disintegrate tomorrow.
[01:39:41.707 --> 01:39:46.128]  Sure, the euro could be a matter of just a week or a month.
[01:39:46.128 --> 01:39:50.689]  I would also point to the British pound, because of the position of the British pound.
[01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:52.689]  They're saying Britain's next to fall, yeah.
[01:39:52.689 --> 01:39:59.191]  They will be sucked into this maelstrom, this whirlpool of bankruptcy and hedge fund speculation.
[01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:03.852]  The other thing though is, once you get the British pound going down and the British banks
[01:40:04.492 --> 01:40:07.313]  That also brings down the Eurodollar market.
[01:40:07.313 --> 01:40:10.074]  There's a huge mass of trillions of U.S.
[01:40:10.074 --> 01:40:11.895]  dollars that have been sitting in London.
[01:40:11.895 --> 01:40:16.196]  Yeah, the carry trade, and London is now bigger than New York financially.
[01:40:16.196 --> 01:40:21.878]  Right, so the Eurodollar market, and of course the Eurodollar is just the same as any other dollar when it comes to a market.
[01:40:22.799 --> 01:40:30.170]  You've got this problem of a whole bunch of dollars that are beyond the reach of the US government, and the British regulatory regime is worth nothing.
[01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:34.857]  The other thing is, interbank lending in Europe has now frozen.
[01:40:34.857 --> 01:40:35.838]  It has seized up.
[01:40:35.838 --> 01:40:37.601]  In other words, when you get a systemic crisis,
[01:40:38.286 --> 01:40:39.948]  Banks will not lend to each other.
[01:40:39.948 --> 01:40:48.495]  And this, it doesn't just mean Banco Santander or Banco de Bilbao of Spain or the various Italian banks.
[01:40:48.495 --> 01:40:51.938]  Unicredito is one of the biggest banks in the world.
[01:40:51.938 --> 01:40:56.402]  And it's probably reaching up to Deutsche Bank in Germany and Barclays Bank in Britain.
[01:40:56.402 --> 01:40:58.504]  Societe Generale, certainly in big trouble.
[01:40:58.504 --> 01:40:59.905]  BNP Paribas.
[01:40:59.905 --> 01:41:04.489]  These are all bank stocks that have lost 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 percent in the past week.
[01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:08.490]  If they're seizing up, that means Wall Street is seizing up too.
[01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:10.071]  And we have this emergency conference.
[01:41:10.071 --> 01:41:12.872]  You can see how scared the European leaders are.
[01:41:12.872 --> 01:41:16.153]  The European finance ministers are meeting in Brussels right now.
[01:41:16.153 --> 01:41:19.534]  And they're coming up with what they call the defense fund against the Wolfpack.
[01:41:19.534 --> 01:41:21.014]  The Wolfpack would be the hedge funds.
[01:41:21.014 --> 01:41:22.475]  But the Wolfpack is them.
[01:41:22.475 --> 01:41:25.776]  They're all chief members or former heads of the Wolfpack.
[01:41:26.356 --> 01:41:26.937]  More or less.
[01:41:26.937 --> 01:41:28.038]  But here's the idea.
[01:41:28.038 --> 01:41:30.860]  If you wanted to stop this, there are some things you can do.
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:34.023]  If you're under attack by hedge funds, you ban hedge funds.
[01:41:34.023 --> 01:41:37.906]  If the hedge funds are using credit default swaps, you ban those.
[01:41:37.906 --> 01:41:41.128]  Okay, we know what they should do, but what are they saying they're going to do?
[01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:43.590]  Well, they're going to come up with $150 billion for Greece, and that's now going through.
[01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:44.591]  And now they're going to have $645 billion
[01:41:52.972 --> 01:42:02.237]  It's 500 billion euros basically, so 650 billion US dollars to defend the euro against these hedge funds, hedge fund hyenas and zombies.
[01:42:02.237 --> 01:42:03.498]  And this is overnight!
[01:42:03.498 --> 01:42:14.664]  I mean as soon as Greece got the 164 billion or whatever, you say 150, now they need 600 billion and of course I've been reading that more than half this money is coming from the American taxpayer.
[01:42:15.165 --> 01:42:21.729]  Well, you can figure that whenever the IMF gets into the act, the IMF board just approved $40 billion U.S.
[01:42:21.729 --> 01:42:23.530]  dollars for Greece, so the U.S.
[01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:30.335]  taxpayer is on the hook for at least one-fifth of that, so call it $8 or $9 billion, a little bit less than one-fifth.
[01:42:30.335 --> 01:42:31.956]  The other thing is, of course, the U.S.
[01:42:31.956 --> 01:42:37.800]  has a $100 billion line of credit to the IMF, so they could start drawing that down.
[01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:42.624]  Webster, I'm going to set you up for a full hour this week if you can do it.
[01:42:42.624 --> 01:42:56.857]  We can really give you a lot of time to go over this because you're one of our leading experts, but in the few minutes we've got left on the other side, versus what you think they should do, the sanity, what they're going to do, and what you're predicting is going to happen on the other side of this quick break.
[01:42:56.857 --> 01:42:58.318]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:43:00.802 --> 01:43:03.164]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:43:03.164 --> 01:43:05.507]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:43:05.507 --> 01:43:08.710]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:43:08.710 --> 01:43:13.815]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:43:13.815 --> 01:43:18.020]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.662]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:43:20.662 --> 01:43:23.224]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:43:23.224 --> 01:43:26.466]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:34.072]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:43:34.403 --> 01:43:39.805]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:43:39.805 --> 01:43:42.646]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:43:42.646 --> 01:43:46.328]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:43:46.328 --> 01:43:47.408]  And I got news for you.
[01:43:47.408 --> 01:43:48.749]  You're everyone else.

[01:45:00.339 --> 01:45:08.342]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[01:45:08.342 --> 01:45:15.686]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:45:15.686 --> 01:45:22.689]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:45:22.689 --> 01:45:23.529]  Listen carefully.
[01:45:23.889 --> 01:45:33.613]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.

[01:46:01.377 --> 01:46:09.862]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:46:09.862 --> 01:46:20.749]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:46:20.749 --> 01:46:26.193]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:46:26.753 --> 01:46:31.636]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:46:31.636 --> 01:46:40.702]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.

[01:47:03.217 --> 01:47:04.517]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:04.517 --> 01:47:08.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:15.239 --> 01:47:18.742]  Both these films, The Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic.
[01:47:18.742 --> 01:47:20.103]  I had Nightline here a week ago.
[01:47:20.103 --> 01:47:26.329]  They've got a Wednesday night piece about these films on Nightline to give you an idea of the effect they've had.
[01:47:26.329 --> 01:47:29.452]  Over 50 million downloads online.
[01:47:29.452 --> 01:47:30.553]  That's got to scare the system.
[01:47:30.553 --> 01:47:33.215]  Webster is our big financial expert on these.
[01:47:33.215 --> 01:47:35.918]  Everything he said came true.
[01:47:35.918 --> 01:47:38.200]  Webster, I want to jam in a few calls here at the end.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.521]  You're back with us.
[01:47:39.521 --> 01:47:41.423]  What, he's back on Tuesday or Thursday with us for an hour?
[01:47:42.517 --> 01:47:54.350]  Tuesday for an hour in the last hour of the syndicated weekday show, but in the last four minutes I've got with you, you've got the floor, and I'm not trying to brag here, it's just everything you've said has happened exactly as you said it would happen.
[01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:56.772]  You always love to warn people with your solutions.
[01:47:56.772 --> 01:47:58.354]  We know they're not going to listen to those.
[01:47:58.354 --> 01:48:00.536]  We'll have you on Tuesday about solutions.
[01:48:00.536 --> 01:48:01.978]  Tell us where you see this going.
[01:48:04.269 --> 01:48:06.291]  The bailouts do not work.
[01:48:06.291 --> 01:48:08.072]  Austerity does not work, right?
[01:48:08.072 --> 01:48:14.377]  Gouging the lifeblood of the Greek people will make no difference at all in this, because that doesn't have anything to do with anything.
[01:48:14.377 --> 01:48:17.379]  I think you're going to see the chaotic collapse of the euro.
[01:48:17.379 --> 01:48:19.760]  You're going to see panic runs on the euro.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.902]  Flight capital out of the euro.
[01:48:21.902 --> 01:48:30.148]  You're going to see the breakup of the euro as countries like Greece go back to the drachma, so they can devalue and somehow try to save themselves.
[01:48:30.148 --> 01:48:33.250]  And for that to happen, there'll be an overthrow of the Greek government.
[01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:37.492]  Yeah, which wouldn't be a bad thing, because this guy's a British agent, right?
[01:48:37.492 --> 01:48:41.795]  The Papandreou family are famous British agents in Greek history.
[01:48:41.795 --> 01:48:49.600]  Germany is dependent on exports and China, and I think that Germany is going to get itself into quite a fix, too.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.321]  Germany is also quite highly indebted.
[01:48:51.321 --> 01:48:52.221]  That's another question.
[01:48:52.221 --> 01:49:02.948]  I want you to get into what's going to happen, but Merkel is now calling them evil, wicked, she's using all these terms, insidious, deceptive bankers, but she still voted for it.
[01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:03.710]  You're right.
[01:49:03.710 --> 01:49:13.677]  The demagogy of the European leaders is that they should be attacking the banks and the hedge funds instead of attacking the people of Greece, and they lack the political courage to do it.
[01:49:13.677 --> 01:49:21.603]  In other words, this is a crisis caused by globalization, caused by Soros, it's caused by hot money, casino economy, derivatives.
[01:49:22.363 --> 01:49:23.704]  All the stuff that we know.
[01:49:23.704 --> 01:49:29.948]  It has nothing to do, really, with the fact that Greeks may retire at 50 or 60 or whenever they retire.
[01:49:29.948 --> 01:49:41.694]  Anyway, the breakdown, the chaotic collapse of the European currency, the euro, the chaotic collapse of the European Central Bank, a lot of these countries going into severe depression and social unrest.
[01:49:41.694 --> 01:49:46.537]  Then, kicking over, the chaotic panic runs on the British pound.
[01:49:47.245 --> 01:49:50.287]  Plus, then, the connection is the euro-dollar market.
[01:49:50.287 --> 01:49:55.151]  When those banks go bankrupt in London, they'll start dumping euro-dollar assets.
[01:49:55.151 --> 01:49:57.273]  That may be the thing to sink the dollar.
[01:49:57.273 --> 01:50:01.196]  We always thought it would be China dumping the dollar or somebody else like this.
[01:50:01.196 --> 01:50:02.537]  I think it's likely to be the British.
[01:50:02.537 --> 01:50:04.419]  That would be true to form for them.
[01:50:04.419 --> 01:50:09.202]  And then, of course, when that happens, then you've got a dollar crisis in the U.S.
[01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:12.385]  I would think you've got to think about panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[01:50:12.765 --> 01:50:17.810]  But doesn't the dollar go up at first as Europe falls and then about a week later or a month later it plunges?
[01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:18.451]  Yes, right.
[01:50:18.451 --> 01:50:23.996]  I mean, right now we're in the fool's paradise phase where they say, oh, we saved the dollar by wrecking the euro.
[01:50:23.996 --> 01:50:27.940]  Too bad it is one world economy and it's going to bring down the dollar.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.021]  Panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[01:50:30.021 --> 01:50:43.832]  We had panic runs on the Federal Reserve New York branch in March of 1933, so much so that the New York branch had to borrow from the Chicago branch, and the Chicago branch didn't want to do it.
[01:50:43.832 --> 01:50:50.638]  Ultimately, I think you're going to see panic runs on the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.
[01:50:50.638 --> 01:50:53.540]  In other words, the destruction of all major
[01:50:56.604 --> 01:51:03.966]  Well, here's the problem, I agree with you.
[01:51:03.966 --> 01:51:06.627]  They're out of control, which is even more scary.
[01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:08.168]  Is it the default position?
[01:51:08.168 --> 01:51:10.749]  Start a big war once that happens?
[01:51:11.681 --> 01:51:12.562]  It's possible, yes.
[01:51:12.562 --> 01:51:14.703]  I guess we have to think about that too.
[01:51:14.703 --> 01:51:29.192]  In other words, the Anglo-Americans in particular have this penchant for when they get into a fix like that, one way you can freeze the markets and you can impose capital controls, exchange controls, and all the rest of it, is if you have a war.
[01:51:29.192 --> 01:51:31.934]  Because then you have political cover for doing it.
[01:51:31.934 --> 01:51:33.715]  And that might be their way to do it.
[01:51:33.715 --> 01:51:35.416]  Much better to do it in advance.
[01:51:35.416 --> 01:51:36.297]  Do it now.
[01:51:36.297 --> 01:51:37.638]  Debt moratorium for Greece.
[01:51:38.498 --> 01:51:43.459]  Herbert Hoover in 1931 had the sense to freeze debt between the United States and Europe.
[01:51:43.459 --> 01:51:45.400]  He tried to stop the Depression.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.600]  The French sabotaged him.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:48.701]  This time the Germans are sabotaging.
[01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:54.382]  So we need debt moratorium, debt freeze for Greece, for Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy.
[01:51:54.382 --> 01:51:58.503]  Just tell them to stop paying their international debts, those governments.
[01:51:58.503 --> 01:52:01.844]  And then the other thing is freeze international payments on derivatives.
[01:52:01.844 --> 01:52:05.045]  We got 1.5 quadrillion of toxic derivatives.
[01:52:05.045 --> 01:52:06.165]  You gotta triage that!
[01:52:10.032 --> 01:52:13.435]  Well, Webster, they're not going to do that, clearly.
[01:52:13.435 --> 01:52:17.179]  They're going to continue to... Do you think Merkel, going after the banks, at least verbally...
[01:52:32.313 --> 01:52:39.035]  I see Sarkozy because this is Sarkozy's demagogic position is that he's the guy who's tough on the banks.
[01:52:39.035 --> 01:52:43.476]  And I see Berlusconi joining in because Berlusconi will be bankrupt if he doesn't.
[01:52:43.476 --> 01:52:48.557]  Italy is, you know, not at the top of the list, but getting towards the top now.
[01:52:48.557 --> 01:52:50.278]  After Spain, Italy, for example.
[01:52:50.771 --> 01:52:52.152]  All right.
[01:52:52.152 --> 01:52:54.395]  And time frames?
[01:52:54.395 --> 01:52:54.875]  Weeks?
[01:52:54.875 --> 01:52:55.195]  Months?
[01:52:55.195 --> 01:52:55.816]  Until we see this?
[01:52:55.816 --> 01:53:01.582]  Well, normally, if you... The timetable... This depression has been behaving pretty much like the last depression.
[01:53:01.582 --> 01:53:06.927]  So we had a year and a half between the first big crash and now the collapse of Europe.
[01:53:06.927 --> 01:53:09.890]  In 1931, the collapse of Europe took six months.
[01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:11.031]  From Austria, Germany,
[01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.753]  So we're talking about a two-and-a-half, three-year period?
[01:53:30.882 --> 01:53:33.264]  Well, no, we're already two years in, so another year.
[01:53:33.264 --> 01:53:50.118]  We're a year and a half more or less in, but I think this time the distance between the second wave, where we are now, we're in the beginning of the second wave, the distance between the second wave and the third wave is much less, because we have derivatives and we have this euro-dollar market, and we have a more integrated economy.
[01:53:50.118 --> 01:53:58.224]  The other thing that's fighting against that, though, is these huge bailouts, which we didn't have in 1931, which do tend to slow things down a little bit.
[01:53:59.165 --> 01:54:04.907]  I would say at most, within six months, Europe will be completely collapsed, and then a panic run on U.S.
[01:54:04.907 --> 01:54:09.628]  banks within about, well, a year, year and a half from now.
[01:54:09.628 --> 01:54:16.050]  All right, Webster Tarbley, doctor of economics, great track record of predicting this.
[01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:17.670]  We'll talk to you for a full hour on Tuesday.
[01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:18.251]  God bless you.
[01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:18.731]  See you then.
[01:54:18.731 --> 01:54:19.231]  Bye-bye.
[01:54:19.231 --> 01:54:19.531]  Thank you.
[01:54:20.598 --> 01:54:44.589]  Alright, now, shifting gears again the last 3-4 minutes, I apologize to callers, we got to most of you, but Stefan, Cliff, Mike, Jared, I may not get to you, George, Joe, Ralph, I'm going to try now, I had open phones for Hispanics, all this videos of the communist Larry Conquista's being given media support, film director Robert Rodriguez making basically a race war film, Machete, coming out in September, are they concerned about this?
[01:54:44.589 --> 01:54:45.570]  What do they think about it?
[01:54:45.570 --> 01:54:47.971]  George in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:51.161 --> 01:54:57.408]  Yes, how are you doing today Mr. Jones?
[01:54:57.408 --> 01:54:59.591]  Well, here's what I think about the whole thing.
[01:54:59.591 --> 01:55:03.595]  It's double-edged for me because you guys have a point.
[01:55:03.595 --> 01:55:07.960]  I mean, I came here from Honduras when I was about three years old.
[01:55:08.433 --> 01:55:09.593]  It's an agent of chaos!
[01:55:33.942 --> 01:55:35.183]  That's what I'm going to do.
[01:55:35.183 --> 01:55:36.564]  I'm over here in Washington, right?
[01:55:36.564 --> 01:55:39.987]  And I'm thinking to myself, okay, maybe it's just like the border states, but no.
[01:55:39.987 --> 01:55:41.388]  This thing is going everywhere.
[01:55:41.388 --> 01:55:43.230]  It's reaching out all over the country.
[01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:47.894]  Like, if you look up Seattle Police beat down innocent Hispanic man,
[01:55:48.453 --> 01:55:49.413]  You're gonna see what's going on.
[01:55:49.413 --> 01:55:52.135]  Like, this thing is reaching all over the place, and it has to stop.
[01:55:52.135 --> 01:55:53.395]  No, we're gonna cover that tomorrow.
[01:55:53.395 --> 01:55:59.658]  The cops stomping on the Hispanic guy's hand for no reason, and then they're making it like it's racial.
[01:55:59.658 --> 01:56:03.020]  If you're wearing a cowboy hat, they call you redneck when they're white cops kicking you.
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:06.661]  If you're black, they call you, you know, and they're calling something racial.
[01:56:06.661 --> 01:56:09.182]  That's because police have been trained to act like this, period.
[01:56:09.182 --> 01:56:11.583]  And that's gonna be used racially.
[01:56:11.583 --> 01:56:13.104]  I agree with you, and it's wrong.
[01:56:13.104 --> 01:56:14.425]  It's wrong.
[01:56:14.425 --> 01:56:16.546]  Let's talk to Joe in Los Angeles.
[01:56:16.546 --> 01:56:17.126]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:56:18.561 --> 01:56:19.682]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:19.682 --> 01:56:24.645]  My family came here from Cuba for me to have freedom and my family to have freedom.
[01:56:24.645 --> 01:56:27.427]  And what I think is the whole thing is a setup.
[01:56:27.427 --> 01:56:30.108]  Like you said, they're trying to make us fight each other.
[01:56:30.108 --> 01:56:37.453]  I think it could go as far as escalating to a war with Mexico, which will probably play into the Globalist's hands regardless.
[01:56:37.453 --> 01:56:47.039]  But what I wanted to say to the guy who made that film is if he believes that communism is good and even though it's important to this country,
[01:56:47.597 --> 01:56:51.558]  And he didn't make a lot of enemies for the Hispanic community who came here for freedom.
[01:56:51.558 --> 01:57:03.523]  You know, I came here for freedom, or my family came here for freedom, and I see a bit of tearing literally by the minute here, and we have people like this coming over here trying to destroy America, and it pisses me off.
[01:57:04.505 --> 01:57:05.265]  No, I hear you.
[01:57:05.265 --> 01:57:06.266]  All I want is freedom.
[01:57:06.266 --> 01:57:16.589]  I could care less what color my neighbors are, but when my neighbors start saying I'm evil and communism's good and my guns need to be handed in, they're making me their enemy and I'm trying to stop this.
[01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:18.869]  But I feel good, though, because we opened the phones up.
[01:57:18.869 --> 01:57:19.850]  We didn't screen the calls.
[01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:21.030]  We just said only Hispanics.
[01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:25.051]  But nobody called in supporting La Raza and Mecha.
[01:57:25.051 --> 01:57:27.172]  But the issue is it's a language barrier.
[01:57:27.172 --> 01:57:36.455]  People that are Americans and have chosen to join that tribal group, which nullifies race and makes it about ideas, they all agree with freedom.
[01:57:36.455 --> 01:57:42.837]  The problem is we need Hispanic leaders who speak Spanish to reach out and wake up the Hispanic community.
[01:57:42.837 --> 01:57:45.898]  The problem is the big banks and the government are trying to radicalize them.
[01:57:45.898 --> 01:57:46.738]  Great point.
[01:57:46.738 --> 01:57:47.599]  God bless you all.
[01:57:47.599 --> 01:57:48.479]  Great job, crew.
