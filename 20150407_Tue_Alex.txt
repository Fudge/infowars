[03:46.040 --> 03:50.120]  Paul did attend Rand Paul presidential campaign launch he has launched his
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.440]  campaign he didn't do it at Jerry Falwell's old college he did it at a
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.400]  private party that's certainly big news and the attacks are coming in big time

[04:05.240 --> 04:09.920]  without even paying attention I've seen two clubs online so associated him with
[04:09.920 --> 04:16.720]  me and his father is this that's something bad Ron Paul brought Rand Paul to
[04:16.720 --> 04:27.160]  the dance and I've got him a bunch of punch and danced with him so I don't
[04:27.160 --> 04:36.400]  even care if Senator Paul to people don't want him on the show I haven't
[04:36.400 --> 04:42.000]  even really tried he says he'll come on what I don't like is the neocons trying
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.320]  to brainwash him into running away from his libertarian base that many polls
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.960]  show he's the only guy that could beat major democratic candidates there's a
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.840]  reason the systems attacking Rand Paul they're scared of him because he's a

[08:07.200 --> 08:11.880]  they were doing who is they he was in the office at a trilateral commission
[08:11.880 --> 08:19.840]  trilateral commission yeah the trilateral commission all right what is the
[08:19.840 --> 08:27.560]  trilateral commission the trilateral commission is a private organization
[08:27.560 --> 08:32.320]  founded by David Rockefeller in 1973 you see what they're really up to is a
[08:32.320 --> 08:38.600]  scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country to
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.840]  work to erase national boundaries and create an international community and
[08:43.840 --> 08:48.880]  in time bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.760]  the shots come back we don't want your new lawyers you know Rockefeller we know
[08:53.760 --> 08:58.520]  what you're doing we'll never come in we're not your slaves we're not your
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.320]  slaves you started to help start the trilateral commission and you've been to
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.480]  the builder body groups there is such a thing as insidious influence I'm telling
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.440]  you our whole way of life as we know it is in jeopardy I appreciate that I have
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.600]  I have the documented evidence it's all in there so it's most notable members
[09:16.600 --> 09:22.280]  include George Bush it is a big idea a new world order are you happy for the
[09:22.280 --> 09:26.600]  millions of deaths you're part of people know people are waking up to the reality
[09:26.600 --> 09:32.960]  of this Mr. Bush I think that what needed to be done was done I think we were
[09:32.960 --> 09:36.800]  perfectly justified in doing it
[09:36.800 --> 09:43.120]  you gotta figure out Bill Clinton Henry Kissinger Madeline Albright I think this
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.440]  is a very hard choice we think the price is worth it you remember at the
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.760]  at the convention everybody thought it was gonna be Ford for Veep you know
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.320]  what happened David Rockefeller just picked up a phone put in a call hey
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.640]  Ronnie forget Jerry it's George by no matter who won in November they had
[10:02.640 --> 10:06.600]  their man in the White House David Rockefeller founded all the major UN
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.920]  groups their family gave the UN the land I mean this is the global Empire we are
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.320]  grateful the Washington Post the New York Times Time Magazine and other great
[10:14.320 --> 10:17.520]  publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their
[10:17.520 --> 10:21.520]  promise of discretion for almost 40 years it would have been impossible for
[10:21.520 --> 10:24.440]  us to develop our plan for the world if we would have been subject to the
[10:24.440 --> 10:27.720]  bright lights of publicity during those years but the work is now much more
[10:27.720 --> 10:31.520]  sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government defending the
[10:31.520 --> 10:38.280]  Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones broadcasting
[10:38.280 --> 10:45.640]  worldwide if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.880]  what would you call that little two-minute 50-second promo intro piece
[10:51.880 --> 10:59.240]  that Rob do our news director put together Barney Miller destroys David
[10:59.240 --> 11:06.720]  Rockefeller and that's a show from is that the late 70s or like 1981 I guess
[11:06.720 --> 11:15.480]  had to be like 1981 82 because it it was talking about the the 1980 election but
[11:15.480 --> 11:20.520]  of course that was the big debate back in 1980 I remember John Bircher's coming
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.920]  over to the house and ranting around the dinner table with my parents about the
[11:24.920 --> 11:34.200]  exact things you just heard because it's true and you notice 35 years later 36
[11:34.200 --> 11:39.640]  years later the world government the global corporations running things
[11:39.640 --> 11:47.480]  freedom being destroyed world government being set up it's all naked now but I
[11:47.480 --> 11:50.560]  love how we can take some predictive programming like Bernie Miller do you
[11:50.560 --> 11:54.000]  think they were criticizing it or hiding it in plain view or discrediting it
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.280]  maybe trying to get the word out you have to watch the whole episode to decide
[11:59.280 --> 12:09.200]  that but regardless now we can show David Rockefeller and Zabignan
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.240]  Brzezinski and others on C-SPAN admitting the plan for planetary world
[12:13.240 --> 12:19.640]  government and insidious influence and we can play CNBC clips in fact do you
[12:19.640 --> 12:24.000]  did a great job on that video but why don't you add the clip from CNBC where
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.240]  they go aren't we all just slaves to international banks and the central
[12:28.240 --> 12:33.240]  banks and then maybe show the financial times of London saying and now for
[12:33.240 --> 12:37.120]  world government and maybe a Time Magazine article world government's the
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.720]  answer just for the weaker minds out there who will see that and say oh you
[12:43.720 --> 12:47.120]  cooks thought it was happening then and you you think it's happening now there
[12:47.120 --> 12:52.480]  is no world government Obamacare cuts your prices Obamacare national deficit
[12:52.480 --> 13:01.440]  going up lowers the debt 2 plus 2 equals 100 we've got some other promo
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.960]  intros that are new coming up today as well Dr. Jerome Corsi a political
[13:06.960 --> 13:15.920]  scientist and economics professor will be joining us in the third hour today to
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.160]  give us his detailed analysis on what's really happening with the Iran deal
[13:22.160 --> 13:28.400]  so Dr. Corsi joining us today other than that will have open phones let me just
[13:28.400 --> 13:33.520]  go over some of the headlines here and and how they correspond and this is not
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.880]  in the order of top story to the least important there's just my head is spinning
[13:38.880 --> 13:44.920]  looking at these stacks and so I'm just gonna begin in kind of the order as as
[13:44.920 --> 13:51.160]  my eyes fall upon it warmongers hit Rand Paul with slander campaign as he
[13:51.160 --> 13:59.160]  announces presidential run and we have a clip here put out by a John McCain pack
[13:59.160 --> 14:05.440]  John McCain is announced he is running for the Senate again and John McCain who
[14:05.440 --> 14:11.800]  never saw a war he didn't love is behind this new 32nd ad called
[14:11.800 --> 14:16.800]  sanctions attacking Senator Rand Paul who launched this campaign today here
[14:16.800 --> 14:21.880]  the Senate is considering tough new sanctions on Iran
[14:21.880 --> 14:27.040]  President Obama says he'll veto them and Rand Paul is standing with him Rand
[14:27.040 --> 14:31.680]  Paul supports Obama's negotiations with Iran and he doesn't understand the
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.080]  threat you know it's ridiculous to think that they're a threat to our national
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.680]  security Rand Paul is wrong and dangerous tell him to stop
[14:40.680 --> 14:47.880]  siding with Obama because even one Iranian bomb would be a disaster those
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.080]  are the same type of ads that were run against Barry Goldwater in the early
[14:52.080 --> 14:57.360]  1960s that got Lyndon Baines Johnson elected right after they killed Kennedy
[14:57.360 --> 15:04.380]  of course Barry Goldwater was just like Rand Paul spoke out against the
[15:04.380 --> 15:09.680]  council on fine relations the trilateral Commission world government he
[15:09.680 --> 15:12.760]  would have been way better than even somebody like Ronald Reagan who was
[15:12.760 --> 15:21.080]  pretty good on many fronts but they ran ads like that out of context he went on
[15:21.080 --> 15:25.040]  in that interview because I know he said similar things here senator Paul that
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.760]  we have 10,000 nuclear weapons aimed at them and if they use it it'd be suicide
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.520]  and that if Israel wants to attack them that's their national prerogative
[15:33.520 --> 15:37.040]  that's what Ron Paul has said but that we shouldn't be involved and we shouldn't
[15:37.040 --> 15:43.680]  have aid to Israel or Egypt or Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or anybody else he is
[15:43.680 --> 15:48.480]  a libertarian constitutionalist and now Bloomberg has the headline GOP Hawks set
[15:48.480 --> 15:55.920]  to ruin Rand Paul's big day by the way these are the Hawks that pretty much
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.600]  fill the Obama cabinet it's all on the surface that they're really fighting
[16:01.600 --> 16:06.840]  with Obama if Iran gets out of line one bit that will give them the excuse of
[16:06.840 --> 16:11.520]  at the UN to get the authorization for military strikes and they want that to
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.040]  establish the UN as the boss that's what they don't want Israel hitting them now
[16:16.040 --> 16:22.640]  they want to make it look like that they have really given Iran all the all the
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.840]  sale they need all the rope they need to hang themselves and there is a double
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.720]  cross against Saudi Arabia going on right now and they've got their own lobby
[16:31.720 --> 16:34.640]  here in the US it's in the news that they've given tens of millions to
[16:34.640 --> 16:38.240]  Hillary through her foundation that she then uses for her campaigns totally
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.960]  illegal but the Saudi Arabians are bankrolling Hillary Clinton and Obama
[16:42.960 --> 16:46.960]  and so on the surface it looks like Obama's siding with the Iranians in the
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.360]  civil wars but that's not really what's going on it's it's it's it's it's it's
[16:51.360 --> 16:56.200]  double triple cross there's no honor among thieves so we'll be looking at every
[16:56.200 --> 17:00.400]  angle of that today I'm gonna get more into Rand Paul quote I'm running for
[17:00.400 --> 17:08.760]  president then we're going to get into quote this is why the US just lost its
[17:08.760 --> 17:13.480]  superpower status according to Larry Summers who of course heads up Harvard
[17:13.480 --> 17:18.840]  and who was the main architect of the current economic derivatives fraud I mean
[17:18.840 --> 17:21.960]  there are a lot of people involved but if you got a point to one person it's
[17:21.960 --> 17:26.880]  Larry Summers they got all the laws changed heading up the economic council
[17:26.880 --> 17:33.600]  for president Clinton and now they're claiming that China's economic development
[17:33.600 --> 17:37.240]  bank and the way the US handled it signals the end of our hegemon that's
[17:37.240 --> 17:40.840]  not what's happening the globalists are transferring things into a trilateral
[17:40.840 --> 17:48.560]  global plan where three trilateral systems the the US the euro and China the
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.520]  European Union the Americas Union the Asian Union will compete with each other
[17:52.520 --> 17:57.160]  on who can accelerate globalism and global governance faster claiming that
[17:57.160 --> 18:03.080]  if you do that and transfer power to your trilateral head there's three of them
[18:03.080 --> 18:11.840]  try uno dos tres tricycle then you will be dominant the global government and

[35:26.000 --> 35:29.440]  be live Thursday it's just I'm gonna go see the doctor make sure it all went
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.360]  well but thank you all for your prayers but that's why I wasn't here yesterday
[35:32.360 --> 35:35.720]  David night at a great job I listened to about two hours of the broadcast right
[35:35.720 --> 35:38.800]  along with you and I tell you at some levels he does a better job than I do I
[35:38.800 --> 35:45.320]  think it's a good mix I was sitting out by the local community pool with my
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.640]  children and I was listening to the rebroadcast of it about five o'clock and
[35:49.640 --> 35:55.680]  I had it on my iPhone and it wasn't even playing very loud but there were a married
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.560]  couple and their kids sitting about three lawn chairs down from us and they
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.960]  said that man I will let the lady attractive lady she goes that man has a
[36:04.960 --> 36:09.800]  very soothing voice I went oh that's David night yeah he's the host of info
[36:09.800 --> 36:13.960]  wars.com she was oh really how do you listen to that I said well it's on this
[36:13.960 --> 36:18.200]  local station but here's the free app I'm just always promoting liberty and
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.360]  then somebody else goes yeah yeah I've heard of that show isn't that guy named
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.160]  Alex Jones and I'm sitting there going I don't know that's the fun part about
[36:27.160 --> 36:30.480]  radio is that a lot of people don't know what you look like you can kind of go
[36:30.480 --> 36:36.400]  under the radar but it's just good David night is married though ladies and
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.960]  happily has three children but I do notice that women period when they hear
[36:41.960 --> 36:46.000]  his voice they go I really like his voice so I guess David night has a thing
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.120]  with the ladies going with that voice my voice is a little the opposite the
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.280]  opposite of soothing a bit grading sometimes I can actually be soothing
[36:55.280 --> 37:01.080]  the ladies how you doing there baby I need to help you out a little bit there
[37:01.080 --> 37:04.800]  yeah just come on over here and sit on this lap all right I'm joking I'm gonna
[37:04.800 --> 37:10.280]  stop right there I'm out of control today and I apologize it's just good to be
[37:10.280 --> 37:17.040]  amongst the living and on the green side up let's get back into the seriousness
[37:17.040 --> 37:20.960]  before I get into the military news that dovetails with that real game of thrones
[37:20.960 --> 37:27.640]  intro that Rob Jacobson did a great job putting together so I just mentioned
[37:27.640 --> 37:33.240]  norquist book IRS assault on Tea Party saved Obama's presidency and it just
[37:33.240 --> 37:42.360]  continues the the open persecution of tens of thousands of mainline Christian
[37:42.360 --> 37:47.480]  groups Tea Party groups veterans groups libertarian think tanks everybody got
[37:47.480 --> 37:53.160]  audited I mean I don't give the enemy attention I guess I should make a big
[37:53.160 --> 37:57.120]  deal about when they do but we had all sorts of loving little agencies federal
[37:57.120 --> 38:03.280]  popping up over here I was just laugh at them and then usually the the the the
[38:03.280 --> 38:07.400]  feds of the state people that come by just like look mr. Jones I I know who
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.680]  you are my son or daughter likes the show I listen to it I just am here doing
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.360]  my job please answer the questions and I say you are part of a rebel alliance and
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.040]  a traitor no I say look we all know why you're here so just whatever but that's
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.040]  what goes on in this country but a lot of people they actually indict they set
[38:26.040 --> 38:30.840]  up they grab bank accounts and then they admit on MSNBC yeah we're doing this to
[38:30.840 --> 38:34.520]  shut down the Tea Party why it's racist they deserve it of course we're
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.360]  targeting the Tea Party fact I remember playing those clips here from about a
[38:38.360 --> 38:41.480]  year or two ago we ought to find those clips of Maddow and others going of
[38:41.480 --> 38:47.880]  course we're coming after you you're racist horrible groups collecting money
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.360]  that's why they had the Pentagon tell the folks at Fort Hood you cannot be part
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.840]  of the Tea Party or will basically well that basically they said we will
[38:57.840 --> 39:02.720]  discipline you up to court Marshall up to and including court Marshall in
[39:02.720 --> 39:10.120]  America in America you can't be part of the Tea Party because we said so and man
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.800]  I knew five years ago the talking points won't even mainline conservative radio
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.880]  were bashing the Tea Party and the Republican leadership it's been raising
[39:18.880 --> 39:22.080]  money against Tea Party that's all you gotta know and then you've got the fake
[39:22.080 --> 39:28.760]  neocons the the the rhinos the hawks the socialists media matters spends more
[39:28.760 --> 39:34.800]  time attacking Rand Paul then they spend anybody else why because he's viable
[39:34.800 --> 39:41.200]  and he reaches out to libertarian liberals who are anti-war and in so
[39:41.200 --> 39:44.800]  many national polls he's the number one guy to beat Hillary even though she's
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.920]  not kind of a dead duck in many ways but let me tell you that that that that
[39:48.920 --> 39:52.680]  zombie can rise again because when you're already dead you know you can
[39:52.680 --> 39:58.680]  never be killed I guess politically they say but that's why they're coming out
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.160]  after Rand Paul and they've got a whisper campaign the libertarian right wing
[40:03.160 --> 40:08.600]  about he's not really good you know he's not perfect you know he said that if
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.320]  somebody tried to blow Israel off the map we defend them why that is real
[40:12.320 --> 40:19.520]  worshiper all the Israel lobby comes after him he's just trying to be a
[40:19.520 --> 40:25.520]  moderate libertarian and he is a veritable angel compared to a John
[40:25.520 --> 40:32.640]  Boehner or Hillary Clinton but people in the patriot movement love at least some
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.440]  of them to be manipulated by the globalist and to demand someone be
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.200]  absolutely above even their standards that's one reason we're in so much
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.200]  trouble he's helped shoot down the gun bills he's trying to promote true
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.760]  sovereignty he's trying to do just so many good things end the national debt
[40:52.760 --> 40:58.440]  reverse all this garbage stop all these illegal wars and that's why he's got the
[40:58.440 --> 41:03.280]  whole establishment against him meanwhile Colorado reverse discrimination
[41:03.280 --> 41:09.600]  yes to gay marriage know the Bible verses that's in right bart.com upon
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.000]  info wars.com in a bizarre new twist on religious liberty front Colorado
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.200]  officials have determined that bakeries must cater to proponents of gay marriage
[41:18.200 --> 41:23.720]  but not legally obliged to decorate cakes with Bible verses you know what I
[41:23.720 --> 41:27.440]  think you advertise that we're an inclusive restaurant have some symbol
[41:27.440 --> 41:35.480]  maybe an L for libertarian or you say no we are nitpicky and obsess over who
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.200]  we're selling to I mean I didn't know you sat there and really paid attention to
[41:39.200 --> 41:44.320]  what you were doing I mean I'll be honest if I owned a cake shop and
[41:44.320 --> 41:50.240]  somebody had like you know F the the the n words I'm not gonna do that cake
[41:50.240 --> 41:57.920]  because there's a good chance I'm being set up so that's why we have the
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.600]  discrimination power that like discrimination is always a bad thing
[42:00.600 --> 42:03.680]  you go to a restaurant the food's terrible services bad you discriminate
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.520]  that's what discrimination is you look at a woman you discriminate off of her
[42:08.520 --> 42:11.880]  looks and then once you get to know her off how she behaves same thing with a
[42:11.880 --> 42:15.680]  man women discriminate they admit this in every study off how much money you
[42:15.680 --> 42:19.520]  make that women find that number one the most attractive thing is prestige
[42:19.520 --> 42:25.280]  power and money we don't need Tony Montana to tell us that that way you get
[42:25.280 --> 42:29.640]  the money you get the power you get the power you get the woman let's stop
[42:29.640 --> 42:34.440]  lying about what most women are looking for men are looking for looks and
[42:34.440 --> 42:42.320]  positive behavior happiness somebody to get their back and women are looking
[42:42.320 --> 42:48.720]  for cash and power as long as it satisfies women long term is power and
[42:48.720 --> 42:52.840]  prestige most of them shoot for the money and it doesn't satisfy them but
[42:52.840 --> 42:56.280]  that's the number one thing they're looking for in a bizarre new twist on
[42:56.280 --> 43:02.360]  the religious Liberty front Colorado officials have determined that bakeries
[43:02.360 --> 43:07.040]  must cater to proponents of gay marriage but are not legally obliged to decorate
[43:07.040 --> 43:12.920]  cakes with Bible verses hey you want a Bible verse with the Quran on it you

[43:47.680 --> 43:52.280]  labor I forgot Christian activist Bill Jack has announced a decision by the
[43:52.280 --> 43:56.320]  civil rights division of the Department of Regulatory Agencies which found
[43:56.320 --> 44:00.840]  occur bakery and Denver not guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a
[44:00.840 --> 44:08.520]  cake adorn with Bible quotes condemning sodomy I mean don't worry bakery the

[44:13.560 --> 44:17.880]  March Jack went to the bakery and requested two cakes be decorated with
[44:17.880 --> 44:23.680]  biblical messages I requested two cakes each with a shape of an open Bible the
[44:23.680 --> 44:32.200]  first quake requested one page God hates sin Psalms 54 55 7 and on the facing
[44:32.200 --> 44:39.720]  page homosexuality is a detestable sin Leviticus 1822 and don't worry they've
[44:39.720 --> 44:43.600]  already started banning Bible verses in Canada in the UK on the second kid
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.960]  requested one page God loves sinners on the facing page while we were yet
[44:47.960 --> 44:55.760]  sinners Christ died for us and that one was refused as well hey refuse their
[44:55.760 --> 45:01.480]  cake I'm gonna refuse yours I mean I'm gonna tell you right now if somebody
[45:01.480 --> 45:06.160]  showed up here at this office and they said I am a Satanist and I worship the
[45:06.160 --> 45:12.440]  devil and I I want to work in your organization I would say no and I'm
[45:12.440 --> 45:21.200]  sure they'd sue me I mean it's just not compatible and that's what this is
[45:21.200 --> 45:26.480]  coming down to ladies and gentlemen I'm not into people that are into screwing
[45:26.480 --> 45:30.880]  other people over and and taking advantage of people and being predators
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.360]  you want to be predators like that I want to break their necks I'm gonna be
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.840]  real honest with you I don't need to be around it the truth is all you people
[45:39.840 --> 45:42.600]  want to be evil or nothing compared to good people when they stand up to you
[45:42.600 --> 45:50.840]  so I don't be around you it'd be like having a rat run around in the presence
[45:50.840 --> 45:59.960]  of a trained doxin or something the rat isn't gonna do too well but see these
[45:59.960 --> 46:03.120]  cowards one at one way where they can force feed their Satanism to our kids
[46:03.120 --> 46:06.480]  and that's what it is and then we can't even have our children armed with a
[46:06.480 --> 46:15.760]  Bible in their bag let's move on to the next censorship coach loses his job
[46:15.760 --> 46:22.200]  after posting an open letter about Obama on Facebook a main lacrosse coach
[46:22.200 --> 46:26.200]  lost his job when he posted a letter on Facebook criticizing President Obama a
[46:26.200 --> 46:29.560]  main lacrosse coach lost his job when he posted a letter criticizing the
[46:29.560 --> 46:32.760]  president with an unflattering but accurate description of America's
[46:32.760 --> 46:40.520]  America's Muslim heritage Scott Lee told the Conway Daily's son last month he
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.560]  is politically minor conservative I thought it was an interesting letter to
[46:43.560 --> 46:47.320]  Obama and his current administration who are not paying attention to Israel and
[46:47.320 --> 46:52.720]  focusing on Iran he said whether you agree with this guy's view or not he has
[46:52.720 --> 46:57.880]  the First Amendment and he can publish this separate from the school did it
[46:57.880 --> 47:04.160]  violate policy was it him naked was it him in playgirl was it him selling drugs
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.480]  no it was his view about a president who's very unpopular even if he was
[47:08.480 --> 47:18.480]  popular it'd be protected speech but it's political correctness
[47:20.960 --> 47:26.040]  Lee 48 coach the boys lacrosse team at Freyberg Academy and see they can audit
[47:26.040 --> 47:28.960]  you they can fire you they can come after you they can ban you when you're
[47:28.960 --> 47:32.840]  in prison from having speech that's what this administration is doing they can
[47:32.840 --> 47:36.360]  keep you from having Bible verses on a cake but but but then let their
[47:36.360 --> 47:42.600]  protected groups have free speech and have agencies defend them independent
[47:42.600 --> 47:46.840]  secondary school that serves a wide diverse population of local day students
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.160]  and boarding students from across the nation and around the world according
[47:50.160 --> 47:56.000]  to the school's website schools founded 1792 that is reported that Lee said he
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.400]  shared the letter with his personal Facebook page and resigned two days later
[48:00.400 --> 48:06.520]  he said the athletic director Sue first in first in hell oh Buffy
[48:06.520 --> 48:12.200]  oh dear it is no free speech in America he said the athletic director Sue
[48:12.200 --> 48:18.800]  Thurston told him he had a decision to fire him had he already been made before
[48:18.800 --> 48:23.720]  he had chance to meet with school officials Freyberg Academy head of
[48:23.720 --> 48:28.520]  schools Aaron Mayo said we prized each young person we enroll as an individual
[48:28.520 --> 48:33.920]  and we prized the diversity they bring so see he can't criticize Obama that might
[48:33.920 --> 48:37.240]  hurt the feelings of a Democrat
[48:39.040 --> 48:45.000]  see and I've just got stacks more of this oh AP fraternity announcing legal
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.160]  action against Rolling Stone and their fake rape story they basically knew
[48:49.160 --> 48:56.880]  wasn't true but fit the narrative that all sexes rape I mean I went to college
[48:56.880 --> 49:02.560]  folks for a few years and I didn't see any rape going on I saw a bunch of people
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.640]  having a really good time and doing some things that probably weren't too healthy
[49:06.640 --> 49:12.760]  drinking too much and I see a lot of sex that's why I'm not up here on some
[49:12.760 --> 49:17.800]  high horse lecturing everybody but it doesn't need to be pushed on children
[49:17.800 --> 49:23.720]  sex period heterosexual homosexual I don't care but remember the whole across
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.680]  team thing too with the black stripper turned out they hadn't laid a hand on her
[49:27.680 --> 49:31.600]  folks it was all made up but it fit a good narrative a bunch of white men
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.920]  raven a black woman truth is they weren't racist they wanted a black stripper
[49:35.920 --> 49:42.280]  at the basically mainly white fraternity it's just insanity ladies and gentlemen
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.160]  believe me you're not gonna have racist getting a black stripper fraternity
[49:47.160 --> 49:53.720]  announces legal action against Rolling Stone and it's just it's constant folks
[49:53.720 --> 49:58.160]  99% of time I was about to say nine out of ten times but quite frankly there are
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.400]  very few cases out of let's not exaggerate it's got to be over a thousand on the
[50:02.400 --> 50:05.840]  year 20 years I've seen of this I mean I see one every every couple days every
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.160]  week at least with a black church burned down or a swastika or a cross
[50:11.160 --> 50:20.680]  burned or or a postal worker hung or a what do you call them census worker hung
[50:20.680 --> 50:26.520]  and then it's almost always a suicide note but it doesn't matter then it
[50:26.520 --> 50:30.640]  turns out that it's a black student a white student a Jewish student more
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.040]  often not just a white student wanting to get a bunch of liberal attention doing
[50:34.040 --> 50:38.600]  it to their own biracial or whatever multiracial fraternity but of course the
[50:38.600 --> 50:43.000]  media always runs with it like it's true swastika scrawled across northeastern
[50:43.000 --> 50:52.480]  u-campus in Boston oh yes and of course you can bet it's fake I'm betting right
[50:52.480 --> 50:56.760]  now it's fake just the latest we're gonna be right back with some key news

[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:23.800]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones if I had the money I'd hire
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.640]  probably 10 more writers and 10 more reporters to go out and do stories but I
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:37.040]  don't but we can probably get a few more great interns you know and in paying
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:44.360]  interns I don't we get a lot on pay but I don't like not paying somebody just to
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.400]  sit there and write down everything I say and to create an archive we kind of
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:53.840]  do it but I have said not dozens not hundreds but but multi hundreds of
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.120]  times that the plan in California is a gender 21 not because I think it it's
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.800]  admitted and that they would then start cutting off the water artificially
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.600]  shutting it down and bring in smart water meters to track and control
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.040]  everything you do and basically charge you so much for water only multi
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:18.000]  millionaires will be able to take baths just like I told you last week when the
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.520]  German co-pilot reportedly flew the plane in the ground that they would then
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:31.520]  call for no more pilots that's in the New York Times today and AP you name it
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.720]  MIT it's it's all there I'm gonna cover that I mean really this doesn't get
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.760]  hard after a while I mean I know the next move they're gonna make and it's so
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:45.440]  pathological with these criminals that I I tend to think they're gonna zig when
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.080]  they zag they don't they just follow an exact plan and you know why they say
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.440]  they do cuz it works I mean they've gotten away with putting dozens of deadly
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  poisons in the water and making us pay for it I say dozens I mean conservative
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.160]  some water that we some of the additives we buy the so-called fluoride from China
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.720]  has been tested over 300 deadly chemicals on average it's a couple hundred and a
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.720]  city like Austin pays 1.2 million year last contract I saw to put it in the
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:22.120]  water mercury lead arsenic I've got articles here today where the FDA under
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.920]  public pressure is finally banning arsenic feed to turkeys and chickens
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.400]  because it makes them put on water wake as they're poisoned instead of Walmart
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.920]  having to inject the turkey breast or chicken breast with water at the
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:43.880]  facility they just feed they feed them arsenic so they get real fat and bloated
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.680]  oh I'm crying I have tears of eyes this is so sick I don't even want to do this
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:03:02.440]  anymore I mean I remember hearing about when I worked for a large animal vet and
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.640]  I was talking to guys that hauled turkey manure to fertilizer plants out of the
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.600]  turkey and chicken plants and one time driving home from work this guy to give
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.520]  me a ride as my truck was broken down this is when I missed a whole year of
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.440]  high school they took me out fighting while they moved to Austin I was in
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:24.760]  high school five years and I just took off a year when I was 16 and worked about
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.760]  14 hours a day and he goes listen I got to pick up one more load over at this
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.520]  turkey place we go in there we put on respirators we go in there and it's like
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.640]  hell on earth and mites all over everything huge piles of stinking
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:45.480]  crap and he goes you see that feed over there that's arsenic make some fat it
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.920]  was like entering another world this giant facility had a couple hundred
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.120]  thousand turkeys in it next to it was a million chickens there was like a
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.120]  lake a crap outside a literal lake and I'm in there on a respirator with like
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.280]  bugs getting on me and the stench in there was the most horrible thing I
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.760]  ever smelled you can just feel the torture so yeah I'm against stuff that's
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:17.200]  factory farmed but I digress the US government and that's the problem when
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.120]  I read that headline this morning and I can't find it the stack now you guys
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.320]  print that again arsenic based feed is the or arsenic based drug they call it a
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:33.320]  drug to make them fat yeah one symptom of arsenic poison as you take on water as
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.800]  yourselves try to keep the arsenic out of them anyways I digress in Austin they
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.320]  had arsenic to the water and if you go down to the city council they'll laugh
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.160]  at you if you don't like it FDA would draw approval for arsenic based drug
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:53.400]  using poultry oh boy and I guess they were gonna I guess they were gonna try

[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:31.040]  Dr. Jerome Corsi of world net daily bestselling author two times number one
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.200]  New York Times bestseller political scientist degree in economics from
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.400]  Harvard he'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour to give us his expert
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.640]  inside perspective on the situation with Iran and the so-called accord and all
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.200]  the bizarre statements coming out of the White House on it because regardless
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.440]  what you think about the accord it's got giant Swiss cheese holes in it they're
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:58.280]  saying it's permanent speeches when it's not permanent it's just really bizarre
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:04.200]  so we'll get his take on that coming up I want to get more into Rand Paul's
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.680]  announcement for president court moles revealing secret government plan to cut
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.640]  cell phone service a lot of really important health news including
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:19.120]  mainstream media reporting radiation levels increasing on the West Coast from
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:25.200]  Fukushima huge news on that front speaking of West Coast I want to hit
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:32.320]  this first we talk a lot about agenda 21 of UNESCO now that's a treaty the UN
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:39.760]  cooked up in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro George Herbert Walker Bush was there and
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.960]  he said that we were gonna ratify it even if Congress basically wouldn't now
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.360]  under this they have to create artificial scarcity and you hear where Obama
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.800]  goes to Africa and again tells the Africans that people don't I got an
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.680]  email saying I made this up this weekend I saw one when you guys I don't always
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.760]  respond to challenges but I'm getting tired of it okay in fact this weekend I
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:09.160]  heard that weeks ago he said that Obama said we're gonna lay off half the
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.480]  cattle guards in the West and that that will fix part of the budget and I thought
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.200]  it was a joke and it turned out Joe Biden had said it anyways I'm digressing
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.360]  I you just cannot make the folks cattle guards of the spaces in the gates on the
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.640]  ground so the cows won't walk for them so break their ankles they're not like
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.880]  school guard crossing people yeah I guess if you grew up in an industrial area
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.600]  and don't know that but speed up that's like George Herbert Walker Bush not
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:45.800]  knowing what a what a store scanner was a decade after they'd come out there's
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.240]  the headline Obama planet will boil over if young Africans are allowed cars
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.200]  air conditioning big houses so we'll cue that up and actually play that in a
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:11:02.440]  minute but this issue is so big because California in the last 40 years has not
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:08.320]  allowed the construction I have the article right here of one reservoir now
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.000]  in the last 30 plus years they've gone from roughly 15 million people to 36
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  million people last time I checked I'm going from memory teleprompter free guys
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.600]  you search engine California population but I know it's gone from 15 million or
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:31.080]  less to 35 plus 30 I think it's 37 million is it 38 million now boom 38.8
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.400]  million so it's almost 39 million people that's more than doubled their
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:45.600]  population since yep there you go the 1970s so it's doubled since the 1970s or
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:53.960]  more and they haven't built one stinking reservoir you know here in Texas when
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.960]  they build a big city or they're about to expand one they get on the news and
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.400]  say we project that Austin will need five reservoirs of such-and-such size by
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.360]  2040 or we're gonna have water shortages and guess what they're doing they're
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.960]  building reservoirs I'm not defending a lower Colorado River Authority there's
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.640]  certainly corrupt organizations from my experience but compared to the
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:19.680]  California groups here's an example of and I'm gonna walk through how this is
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.040]  unit 21 on a state level
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.800]  they want artificial scarcity to gouge you remember what happened in 2000 Enron
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:36.920]  got caught some days making a billion dollars a day gouging with the smart
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.880]  meter hubs at the local level not not the individual level but they had quote
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.840]  smart hubs at the switcher level inside the cities so they could game the price
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.800]  of the energy claiming it was bought an open trading system but they were
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.800]  really engaged in fraud and what have members of Congress said in the
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.760]  legislature in to show them the energy trading going on but it was all fake it
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.720]  was pre-programmed at the local level to gouge you the prices of felony every
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.560]  time they did it and the Enron documents came out you know the big secret
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.200]  about the California drought here it is if everybody in California wants to
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.400]  stop it I'll tell you right now
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.720]  they were having meetings in 98 99 and 2000 with different state officials to
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.920]  go along with it secretly and this all came out Schwarzenegger was in on one of
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:31.160]  the meetings before he was even governor on how to game the electricity and they
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.800]  said we found in studies in third-world countries if we have some rolling
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.080]  blackouts that we control and we'll admit we're doing it'll create the
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.200]  perception of artificial scarcity and then we can double or triple prices and
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.800]  that's exactly what Enron did some days making a billion dollars a day scamming
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.160]  the daylights out of the Californians and there's two types of Californians
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.840]  super wealthy and aware of what's going on and the general public that does not
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.360]  know which end is up and obsesses over race all day that's it for my
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:16.960]  experience CBS News California water authorities to use new tool that's the
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.200]  headline in fight against water wasters and they said oh they could only go off
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:29.080]  tattletales before and say that you can only go you know a couple times a week
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.440]  45 minutes but that was before the smart meter done done done you hear that word
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:39.040]  that means little robot tracking everything you do and gouging you it
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.080]  collects data every five minutes then after midnight the cell phones that's
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:49.200]  built in there comes on makes one call and calls into the database that we and
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.560]  the customer through a password security system have online access to their
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.760]  consumption the accuracy is just incredible oh see it matters that it's
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.280]  accurate and see it's fair because we're only going to charge the biggest
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.040]  wasters and that's how it always starts and then it's everybody the accuracy is
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:12.000]  just incredible because we get the data the next day way to your knew the exact
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.240]  amount and precise moment to send his employees to videotape the infractions
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.160]  to use as evidence we are using it specifically for an enforcement tool
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:28.080]  pre-surveillance of all the water you use to send not meter maids not the
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.440]  normal meter made in Austin within two minutes within two minutes they'll give
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.760]  you a ticket downtown if your meter runs out well imagine hordes of these
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.040]  people surveilling your smart meter that dials into all your appliances you name
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:45.480]  it not just the water to come in and tax you now you know what the smart meters
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.960]  are for CBS news you're like we'll run out of water no you're not since the
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.800]  70s and I've got the news articles right here we're gonna go over them they've
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:59.440]  not built one stinking reservoir and then they had one up in Klamath on the
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.120]  Oregon border and that the supply all of northern California and the farmers
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.040]  that's why they turned it off a member a decade ago that big fight went on for
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.040]  about five years starting ten years ago to about five years ago and Sean
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.760]  handy would go out there we went out there and covered it and it was like
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.000]  why for a sucker fish that isn't even indigenous are they shutting off the
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.960]  giant mountain reservoir because it was enough water to supply the farmers you
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.640]  let the water run out for a while you run those farmers off their land you put
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.840]  in all the smart meters and then you in the drought and let the water flow you
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.720]  just charge everybody more for it and that's how the scan works and you look
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.320]  into who owns the different water districts in California a handful of
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:50.920]  foreign companies French German Dutch Chinese based look it up everybody
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:57.640]  loves it that's fake environmentalism for you here's the headline MWD plans to
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.720]  ration water to Southland districts and cities Southern California water hole
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:07.040]  sailor is planning to wield its powerful hammer oh see it's the water hole sailor
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:13.520]  they're gonna teach you to save see how they're morally go oh nesty and others
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.360]  that have a monopoly have to even pay you know Nestle doesn't pay for the water
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.240]  we're ready to send Joe Biggs out there I may even go out there myself it will
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.520]  take your curry with us those guys like to work together I like to work with them

[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.000]  well same thing with the other big wholesalers they're gonna go oh we're
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.940]  gonna stop delivery of water to you and raise prices to show you how moral we
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:46.520]  are you're like oh you're gonna gouge me she thanks for teaching me to use less
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:54.240]  oh don't worry we're real moral I can run we will that's all the scam is and the
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.200]  big corporations admit it I've gone to the smart growth conferences in 1998 and
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:07.360]  2001 and 2007 and 2014 I mean we go there where they got all these rich people
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.680]  going once we shut off all the coal plants we'll triple charge them for our
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:19.620]  natural gas I mean these are villains folks it's not like they don't know
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:25.160]  they're running the scam on our resources southern California's water
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:30.400]  wholesaler let me let me say the trendy voice only care southern California's
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:37.000]  water is planning to wield its powerful hammer to force more urban
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.200]  conservation this year by cutting water deliveries and of course increasing
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.640]  prices faced with dwindling regional reserves and a fourth year of drought the
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.360]  metropolitan water district of southern California is expected to vote next week
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.800]  and of course that's private suppliers to ration imported water that is supplied
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.080]  to 28 Southland water districts and cities something the agency has done
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.240]  only twice before the cuts which would take effect July 1st we're on the works
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:07.280]  before Governor Jerry Brown imposed 25% mandatory restriction on urban water
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.200]  use last week and then of course there's all the bizarre geoengineering they
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.560]  admit it's going on but they won't release the tails with jet spraying any
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.880]  any moist water groups we've had meteorologists on I mean the planes go
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:26.400]  out spray dissipates the water falls in the ocean you know what weather weapons
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:33.640]  are for now my pretties here's another article this is how the Washington Times
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.600]  Carly Fiorin blames liberal environmentalists for California water
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:47.240]  crisis and then goes through not letting them build a single facility not
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.680]  letting them build anything new putting new regulations on the water on and on
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.240]  and on not building any desalination plants nothing the answer is you don't
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.080]  get bads anymore and you pay rich criminals tons of money

[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.800]  government and Israeli sources on what's really happening with the Iran deal
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:47.800]  in the next segment. Then we're going to look at Ron Paul and Rand Paul how
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.240]  they're trying to demonize Rand via his father will we accept the brainwashing

[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.840]  love it throw me in the briar patch but Rand Paul has not been doing that
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.600]  entirely and that's his real mistake and I'll tell him point blank so that's
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.400]  coming up we'll also look at planes without pilots now this ties into
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.400]  driverless cars it's all being announced but first I drug Anthony Guciardi in
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:21.480]  here because this has been in the works for about a year or so and then
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:26.680]  basically we just ended up going to the biggest one of the biggest organic
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.360]  supplement manufacturers in the country we're actually gonna have the CEO in
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:38.520]  studio when he's in town what is it in a month Anthony in a few weeks and we
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.840]  basically just went and private labeled but then added a couple things the
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:50.920]  nationwide best-selling supplement known to calm children and give them
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.040]  better focus and you've heard all the doctors we've had on medical doctors you
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.960]  name it about the double-blind studies of st. John's wort versus Prozac I mean
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.360]  the list goes on and on this is a concoction with just a whole bunch of
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.400]  organic concentrated known things that absolutely calm your children out we
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.520]  had the advanced bottles of this three months ago and I've been giving it to
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.920]  my children almost every day boy is it good when I remember to do it and it
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.560]  just really smooths them out their grades have gone up it's been amazing and I
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.520]  chalk a lot of it up to child ease supports calm focused attention the
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:29.440]  newest product from infowarslife.com four ounces this is the number one health
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.520]  product line suggested by yours truly joining me as Anthony Guciardi to go
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:39.360]  over how we developed child ease with one of the leading manufacturers in the
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.920]  country Anthony Guciardi. Now it was more than a year ago when we sat down and we
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:48.280]  both realized just how depressingly sad it was going through a list of the top
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.760]  12 selling psychiatric drugs in the United States of America just over the
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:55.880]  last year. We'll go to a document cam of some of those articles and now we have
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.200]  this printed out from Mental Health Daily the top-selling psychiatric drugs
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.560]  this is from 2013 to 2014 just Abilify which is a booster of sorts for
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.240]  psychiatric drugs made seven point two billion dollars in this course of one
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.600]  year and those are all just super low ball numbers that obviously they only
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.560]  report their profits which they claim you know after they pay off all their
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.280]  friends and everything are super low. Billions and billions of dollars are
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.480]  spent every single year on drugs like Abilify, Symbalta, you name it Prozac all
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.360]  of that and it's so so sad to know that in 2004 a Harvard professor came out and
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.880]  said that the people were being treated like guinea pigs on these drugs because
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.160]  it was of course causing suicides causing more and that's all in the
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.560]  in-search. Now we are not saying that this replaces any drug we're not saying
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.160]  that we're saying we're upset at that and we were sought out to make a super
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:51.480]  high-quality formula and what we also were upset about is the reality. In fact
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.440]  speaking of Dr. Jerome of course here's a piece of his from 2012 one of my
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:01.080]  favorite pieces he's ever written. Psych meds linked to 90% of school shootings
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.440]  and of course we all know that pretty much every major school shooting. Every
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.880]  one. The pilot. The pilot right. It takes your impulse control away. And it's just
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.440]  one more proof that how brainwashed the society is. We look at a story like this.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.200]  Sergeant Bales that went and killed the 18 people was on two psychotropics. Yeah
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.800]  and what happens is the kids get hit with the TV, they get hit with the fast
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.120]  food, they get hit with the sugars, they get hit with the aspartame which blows
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:30.880]  their brain up and they're absolutely feeling crazy. I mean legitimately nuts.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.000]  They have super high energy, false phony artificial energy which isn't good
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.400]  powerful determined energy. Because they're poisoned. It's crazy. They have speed-freak energy.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.040]  They have speed-freak poisoned energy and their parents spend 7.2 billion
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.720]  dollars a year on just one of these drugs to try and shut them up. And it's
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.880]  messed up and then we have we have people say okay I get that the psych drugs
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.920]  don't work. What do I do? And for years. You get them on organic food filled with
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.080]  their water, get them off the drugs. You got to do it slowly though. They're deadly.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.880]  Talk to a medical doctor first. That's just what I'd personally do. And you put
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.120]  them on things like child-ease. Absolutely. You know I think the key thing is
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.600]  we've been recommending the herbs that have been in this for so long that we
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.800]  finally finally put it in a formula. Tell folks about some of what's in there
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.720]  Anthony. So we have chamomile which everyone knows as super high quality
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:19.480]  sources it can actually give some of the most most calm focused effects on
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.560]  the drug. That's only one of like 20 ingredients. There's lemon derivatives.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.400]  There's essential oils and we all know the power of essential oils. There's over
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.480]  14 different ingredients in there and that's not counting the different list
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.760]  of proprietary essential oils that are in it. Cubube seed, Hawthorne berry. Hawthorne
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.560]  berry is another good one. Catnip. Catnip. So that's interesting. This is
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.040]  made, this was formulated over 20 years ago by one of the top
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.160]  herbologists. Long pepper fruit. And think about it as wine. So we're taking... Hold on

[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:16.040]  quality which is hard to do and then sell it for a lower price until we get
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:19.240]  in trouble so we actually have to sell it for the regular price I didn't know
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.520]  this was coming in this week it just came in yesterday so I said let's just
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.400]  launch it early that's why we're kind of wargaming here on air right now and I
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.760]  saw the price and I went isn't that lower than supposed to be so it's gonna go up
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.840]  in fact just go give them one hour we'll go up like five bucks as we have to in
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:40.560]  the agreement but child ease infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and Anthony

[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:39.880]  alright shifting gears to dr. Jerome Corsi he has been a very very busy man
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.000]  not just with his best-selling books and worldnet daily.com but his own website
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.280]  as well patriot news he of course has doctorates from Harvard he's an
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.920]  economist and a political scientist and is consulted to the highest levels of
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.400]  our government other governments a lot of it classified there's a PhD from Harvard
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:03.160]  University and political science 1972 number two he he's he's written to number
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.960]  one New York Times best-sellers or maybe it's three and he joins us
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:12.560]  JeromeCorsi.com to give us his expert analysis on what's really going on with
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.280]  Iran I've tried to read the agreement now that part of it's out and it just
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.040]  sounds like Obamacare it sounds like it's a blank check for Iran and the
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:24.400]  Obama administration to do whatever they want to do everybody knows I don't just
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:29.080]  blindly side with Israel I look at the facts and this does not look like a very
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:34.120]  good deal what's going on dr. Corsi is this a real political realignment with
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:39.280]  the Shiites in a civil war against the Sunnis or is it a triple cross dr. Corsi
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.720]  can you make sense of this with all your high-level sources well well first of
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.400]  all the we don't even know what the agreement really is I mean Iran agreed
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:53.560]  to agree Iran said that they're going to it by the end of June I have a frame the
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:58.960]  framework agreement will be implemented now framework agreement in in terms of
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:03.840]  diplomacy means an agreement that structures what the deal is ultimately
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.680]  going to look like the deal on a framework on a framework so it's like
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.960]  saying something we're going to drop the plan for a boat we haven't drawn the
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.920]  plan up yet and this is what the boats going to look like when we draw up the
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.880]  plan unless of course we decide to change the plan between now and the final
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.080]  agreement that's the problem is that all the things Iran said they were going to
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:29.160]  do limiting centrifuges reducing their program having it open to inspections
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.880]  are not going to happen today they're going to happen at the end of June when
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.320]  the agreement is so I mean bottom line is this a screwed job and then break it
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:43.640]  down absolutely because at the same time we agreed to start stepwise removing
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.440]  sanctions and this is what the big disagreement is that we're saying we're
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.000]  going to start removing the sanctions right now so Iran still can be
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.840]  enriching uranium it could still be running a secret program can ultimately
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.560]  not agree to any of these terms at the end of June and we will be lifting
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:07.000]  sanctions in the meantime so it's a it's a complete win for Iran as a complete
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.400]  really fooling the American people with the idea that there is an agreement
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.240]  because in reality the two sides failed to come to an agreement and had to
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:22.320]  extend the length of time they're talking this framework agreement is you know
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.480]  there's been a framework agreement on two-state solution in Israel since the
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:33.200]  Carter administration so is this Obama just trying to get some type of legacy
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.320]  yes it's an attempt to it's a public relations effort it's John Kerry and
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:43.320]  Obama saying look at this great lifetime once another lifetime opportunity we
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:48.040]  have with Iran to end their nuclear program but in reality Iran has not
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.680]  agreed to limit their nuclear program they've agreed to keep talking about it
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.280]  and said when we do agree to limit our nuclear program here's what we think we
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:02.840]  would do so in effect there is no agreement and in effect the tale the
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:08.640]  talks failed because Iran the last hour refused to agree to many of the critical
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.920]  terms and the Obama administration kept making concession after concession and
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.400]  still could not get around to agree to even all the concessions that the
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.760]  Obama administration was willing to make so we have no deal there really is no
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:27.560]  deal here on the table at all there's a deal to have a deal there's an agreement
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:33.440]  to have an agreement that's all we've done looking at the larger picture there
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.240]  in the Middle East North Africa with ISIS running around and then the
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:40.800]  invasions going on in Yemen and other areas seems like all hell's breaking
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:47.720]  loose geopolitically from your research what is the real US policy versus the
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.960]  rhetoric and what's going on in the Middle East right now well first of all
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:55.920]  the I think the abandonment of Israel is really the the key story and when I was
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.400]  in Israel in 2009 I warned the key people in the government that the United
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:05.520]  States and Obama would abandon Israel that we would relinquish the historical
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:11.120]  commitment we had to the Jewish state and now I think Obama is in open conflict
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.280]  with Netanyahu I mean even punishing I believe Senator Menendez who welcomed
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.040]  Netanyahu when he spoke to the joint session of Congress so you think that
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:27.040]  that splits real oh absolutely I think that Obama has no interest in
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.920]  maintaining a Jewish state Obama wants a two-state solution he wants the
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:39.400]  gradual erosion of Israel there's nothing being maintained in terms of even
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:43.640]  from the very beginning the settlements that Israel had that were agreed upon by
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.560]  the Bush administration have been objected to by Obama and continue to be
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:54.520]  objected to by Obama and Netanyahu virtually said when he came to the
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.640]  United States in the joint session of Congress that this was a low point in
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:03.240]  U.S. relations with Israel since 1948 let's pull back on that too and I want
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:07.520]  to expand on that but let's just say for the the whole cause celeb thing and the
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.800]  left and Hollywood and the rest of it only one thing they love more than
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.360]  trying to take our guns is bashing Israel now I have real criticisms of
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.760]  Israel Israel has different governments that come and go but separate from that
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.440]  if Israel disappeared the Arabs are still just going to be killing each other
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.500]  the Palestinians like they did before will start fighting over who gets that
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:32.560]  land I mean I just don't see what happens if Israel disappears it's kind of
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.920]  like Nixon said you won't have me to kick around anymore what would the world do
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:41.240]  without Israel to blame for everything well we would reverse and do what we're
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.160]  having now is chaos I mean we first of all the Obama administration is starting
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:53.760]  in Libya back the al Qaeda affiliated militia to depose Qaddafi we armed is
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.560]  what Christopher Stevens was doing when he was in Qaddafi he was arming the al
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.880]  Qaeda support and militia and many of those weapons end up in Syria fighting a
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:08.280]  sod with the groups that ultimately becomes ISIS so Obama has fostered the
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:13.400]  but Muslim Brotherhood he supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under Morsi
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:19.080]  there's a dozens of Muslim Brotherhood now into the Obama administration at
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:24.120]  high policy levels the Obama administration has tilted decidedly in
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:30.480]  terms of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood but then we turn around and we are
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:37.080]  working with you know a fighting Iran Iran is helping us to fight ISIS in
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:44.920]  Iraq we now have the Iranian Revolutionary Guard an open force in Iraq and
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.960]  take Crete trying to take to Crete back United States is doing some bombing but
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:56.240]  the major force of the ground is Iraqi militia which again are now Shiite back
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:03.120]  by the Shiite Revolutionary Guard from Iran in Iraq and we're supporting in
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:10.320]  that conflict Iran Saudi Arabia know opening the door and kicking off the
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.520]  Shiites Sunni civil war would give Iran the green light to release this more
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.560]  highly trained military teams across the region well it's the I've said since 2009
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.640]  that if Israel attacks Iran the only ally Israel is going to have is going to
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.880]  be Saudi Arabia and since 2009 Israel and Saudi Arabia have been running
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:36.080]  military maneuvers Iran has been real Israel's been rehearsing a strike on
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:42.440]  Iran training pilots preparing logistics Saudi Arabia would be the force that
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:48.640]  would help Israel attack Iran and Saudi Arabia has come closer now to Israel
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:54.560]  because the Saudis as Sunnis are desperately afraid that if Iran is the
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:59.640]  Shiites exert regional power which they're doing and this agreement with
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:04.960]  Obama under nuclear weapons just gives Iran more prestige more power more
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:09.000]  money with the lifting of sanctions okay well let's pull back I mean we know
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.480]  there's a major Israel lobby there's a defense lobby there's a major global
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:17.920]  banking lobby that I think is the most dominant that really does tend to be
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:22.200]  financing an anti-Israel movement worldwide to kind of legitimize global
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:26.920]  government worldwide and the UN through some type of sacrifice of Israel so
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.800]  separating you know let's say I'm an atheist politically on Israel just
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.920]  looking at it coldly like a political scientist which you are why does the
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.960]  elite want to start getting rid of Israel and how do they think they're
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.200]  going to get away with that because Israel's got nuclear weapons a major
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.720]  military and isn't going to go quietly I mean I've heard people say oh no Israel
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.680]  just give up and roll over I don't see that happening I mean is this a larger
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:56.600]  destabilization program that they think will then force Israel into a
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.480]  confrontation and then Israel will destabilize the region more I mean this
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.400]  just seems like an order out of chaos playbook here that doesn't have an end
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.520]  game it seems insane what you've got first of all I think the globalists have
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.960]  tired of supporting Israel and are willing to abandon Israel I don't see
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.720]  any really global you know the the one-world order crowd the new world
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.760]  order crowd and the groups who are pushing one-world currency and all the
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.080]  other integrations of economies they're done using Israel now just like they're
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.800]  done with the US they have no real use in Israel they don't want to support it
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:34.680]  any longer what you've got developing in the Middle East is really a fundamental
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.160]  conflict between Sunnis and Shiites and the United States seems to be playing
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  you know the only both sides we're not supporting any of the moderate forces in
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.240]  the Middle East we're certainly not supporting Israel and when Israel gets
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.160]  pushed into a corner and I've said this since I wrote atomic Iran in 2005 Israel
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.880]  will reach a point where they decide that if Iran's going to be imminently
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:02.360]  having nuclear weapons Israel will attack regardless the cost and
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.760]  regardless of whether Israel has to use nuclear weapons or not we were we're
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:13.600]  seeing a regional the Middle East has devolved into violent Islamic chaos that
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.160]  is going to be very difficult for most Americans even to companies now being
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.080]  exported at record rates with the political left worshipping it and the
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.360]  ultimate sin is criticizing radical Islam what is the insane equation there
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:31.960]  for places like France are xenophobic against other European cultures and in
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.440]  language but are importing radical Islam as fast as they can well even the United
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.240]  States I mean the the surprising thing is that the princess on the left the
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:46.080]  feminist movement does not oppose radical Islam even though it's no violently
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:52.400]  discriminates against women abuses women and it does so on a theological on a
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.520]  theological basis yet the American left embraces Islam and ignores all of these
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:04.400]  atrocities that Israel Islam creates so you've got a love affair with the left
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.480]  worldwide and you see it in France you see it in the European countries we're
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.320]  also importing a large number of Muslims into the United States with the
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.680]  Obama administration that's again not being actively reported we're reporting
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:24.240]  it at WND you're reporting it at Info Wars but in general the influx of
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.000]  Muslims under the Obama administration and in high policy positions Muslim
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.440]  brotherhood in high policy positions in the State Department and the
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.520]  administration throughout has not been adequately covered well sure and
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.160]  everybody knows that I was against these previous wars and I'm not a quote
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.640]  Islamophobe but I mean I went to high school in college with really nice
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.440]  Muslim folks that weren't radical some of these earlier waves were really you
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:54.080]  know scientist engineers really doctors neat people the folks coming in now and
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.960]  I live in Austin Texas are our Wahhabist I mean I talk to him I see him I
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:02.720]  hear him I see him like shoving their wife down the street wearing a hood over
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:07.120]  her head bugging their eyes out at me I mean it's it's getting pretty creepy and
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.760]  I mean I don't want to live in Saudi Arabia I'm sorry well the responsible
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.280]  position should be to support moderate forces within Islam to have a
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:20.320]  reformation and they can be found I mean LCC in Egypt for instance is one of
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.560]  the moderate forces in Islam that could help to get a reevaluation of the
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.520]  violent nature of radical Islamic terrorism I mean what you know I think
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:36.080]  any responsible person is opposed to radical Islamic terrorism rather than
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:39.400]  Islam itself we're not going to go to war with a billion people in the world
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.480]  who believe in Islam most of whom don't want any of this violence at all
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.040]  absolutely and you know Bill March says they all want violence or most of no
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.760]  that's not true but the groups taking overdue and I want to talk about that
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.440]  radicalization we come back with Dr. Jerome Corsi of WND.com

[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:14.040]  live how sick the so-called left really are how they would try to end fatherhood
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:18.240]  and manhood and try to ban dodgeball or even running in the playgrounds as it's
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.000]  seen as aggressive this one in slavis and how they say all sex is rape and then
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.880]  they'll never criticize sexual mutilation radical Islam and they put
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.920]  movies out with David Cross where they go Alex Jones is a racist Islamophobe
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:37.520]  just randomly in the movie when I was criticized for being against the Iraq
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:40.720]  war and all the rest of it doesn't mean I want to be colonized by radical Islam
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:45.160]  which if yet and looked around is taken over even the UN says Christians are
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:50.800]  being persecuted at record levels why are Christians so low in the government's
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:56.800]  eye why can't Christians get bakeries to put Christian verses on cakes but the
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:01.640]  quote gays and lesbians can't because Christianity seen as the dominant
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.160]  culture and we're being conquered right now that's my view dr. Corsi as a
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:10.640]  sociologist anthropologist political scientist well-traveled man why is there
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:14.320]  a major war on Christianity or do you disagree that there's not one I mean look
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:18.800]  at lowest learner not getting in trouble well I think you see it you've
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:24.520]  identified it correctly there is a war on Christianity going on the left agenda
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:30.080]  the agenda the left sees an opportunity right now to get as it were a final
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:36.960]  victory in terms of the culture war pressing on the LGBT agenda they have
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.520]  you know various forms of sexual preference be declared a constitutional
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.640]  right so that you know what happens the First Amendment well if you object to
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:51.400]  this you are a biggest churches we're going to see lawsuits increasingly to
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:57.640]  tax churches that do not support the LGBT agenda around the world and the Pope
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:01.880]  has mentioned this as well the you're seeing Christians under attack on and
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.160]  throughout the Middle East throughout Africa slaughters of Christians which
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:13.040]  are being largely unreported and largely not even taken seriously the UN which has
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.720]  largely been you know again very supportive a radical Islamic agenda I
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:24.080]  had from the beginning of the Palestinian debate going back you know 30 or 40
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.400]  years the UN has not speaking up for Christians the way it would be expected
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:34.720]  to speak up for Islam and that's because Christians are politically incorrect
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:40.640]  Christians need to just roll over and die or become Marxist conduits or or we
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.800]  will be destroyed the choice are you know first what's acceptable politically is
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.280]  it can be an atheist or you can be you know certainly Islam is not being
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:56.360]  criticized by the left but any true Christianity is viewed as being portrayed
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:02.480]  as bigoted being you know portrayed as out of touch with reality Christianity is
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:06.520]  what caused basically the modern Renaissance and inclusiveness and the
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.200]  Reformation as you were getting at and and it's just I mean they've taken the
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:16.080]  fruits of that and are now bringing in a totalitarianism in closing what do you
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.080]  make separately we've been through this before with the ancient Roman Empire I
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.960]  mean ancient Roman Empire had you know Christianity was the solution to the
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:30.400]  violence the paganism and the you know the anything goes kind of attitude value
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:36.360]  relativism that it produced the chaos of the ancient world Christianity large
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:41.320]  league brought the ancient world into a reformation the enlightenment and the
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.560]  modern world now we're going the opposite direction we're going back to
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.960]  moral relativism we're saying that any attitudes people have regardless of
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:56.560]  what they want to believe or not believe or have sexually or not have
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:00.920]  sexually is within their preference and they're all constitutionally protected
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:05.960]  except if you want to believe in Jesus Christ and profess Christianity I was
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.640]  about to say there's that paradox where anything goes except if we say it
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.880]  doesn't and then it's a totalitarianism they will see the left is not going to be
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:18.200]  tolerant it's not going to be classically liberal it doesn't believe in a
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.040]  First Amendment it believes that if you don't adhere to the last principles you
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.600]  need to go to thought reform because you are not only incorrect you're evil you
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.600]  have got to be crushed you've got to be abused that's what they do to you Alex
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.000]  what they do to me on the left because these people are sick dr. Corsi I know
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.120]  you've got to go but we're back in 60 seconds even do like three more minutes
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:43.040]  to put bookends on this and finish up on where you think Obama's going this

[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:16.400]  want answers so do we well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:22.560]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones doctor course he doesn't have but
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:26.000]  one other article to do today very hard-working guys he's gonna save us for
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.720]  20 after and I appreciate that because he's a busy guy I want to get his take
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:35.440]  on election 2016 I want to get his take on stuff like New York City Council
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.920]  considers allowing non-citizens to vote Illinois doing that as well court
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:44.560]  malls receiving and revealing secret government plan to cut cell phone service
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:50.000]  I wanted to put bookends on the Iran geopolitical situation then I wanted to
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.880]  come back in the next longer 12-minute segment and get into the the other
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:57.200]  issues cover the waterfront but not of course he you know baner was just in
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:00.680]  Israel and he said the world's on fire it was interesting to see him tell the
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:06.120]  truth for a change as he helps Obama keep Obamacare in and the rest of it but
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:12.520]  but am I wrong or is the political elite getting more more reckless or
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.240]  feckless I mean what's going on because I really try to track their activities
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:20.880]  and more and more it seems like they don't know what they're doing well I
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.040]  think you've got the last two years here the Obama administration and there's
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.440]  kind of a rush to the finish line to see how many agendas can on the radical
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:35.080]  left can be put into place by fiat by executive order or certainly with a
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:40.120]  dysfunctional Congress unable to oppose the bait baner and McConnell the senator
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:45.720]  not able very effectively to oppose Obama so the left field has got a free run
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:51.200]  to the finish here to open the borders which they're doing very aggressively to
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.080]  weaken the support for Israel I mean I think the Middle East will continue to
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:03.200]  descend into chaos and Iran will now advance to nuclear weapons with more
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.720]  money to support his terrorist activities once the sanctions are lifted
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:12.200]  the international situation is desperate I think Christian should not even
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:17.080]  contemplate going to the Middle East for hardly any reason I mean still safe to
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:22.800]  visit Israel but again I wouldn't go much beyond Israel in the Middle East it's a
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:29.400]  desperate situation of chaos and the world is on fire you've got Russia in
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:34.680]  the same time exerting its influence opposing NATO I mean I think we're much
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:40.040]  closer to a nuclear war than we've ever been since maybe on the Cuban
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:45.680]  missile crisis in 1962 and the and the nature of the nuclear war I think is
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:50.240]  going it is coming will be more of a local or regional nuclear war where
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:56.040]  Russia may use a nuclear weapon against what the Baltic states or you may end up
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:01.080]  with a Israel strike on Iran which turns into a nuclear exchange these things are
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:06.480]  possible now and if Iran gets nuclear weapons or appears to be eminently
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:10.200]  getting nuclear weapons all the other countries like Saudi Arabia will begin
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.720]  working immediately with Pakistan to get nuclear weapons and the entire regional
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.640]  conflict in the Middle East will go from chaos and conventional weapons very
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:26.200]  quickly to chaos of nuclear weapons those are really strong words but a lot
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:29.400]  of analysts are saying the same thing we've never been in more danger that
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.280]  this is worse than the Cuban missile crisis you've got the Russians and the
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:36.480]  United States and Israel trying to legitimize the use of tactical nuclear
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:41.120]  weapons which it seems is really hard to keep control of it's just a crazy time
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.800]  and then I'm no fan of Putin but then you got I'm really no fan of Soros
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.920]  helping stir up Ukraine it just seems like America really has lost moral
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:53.360]  high ground and we're now just down there with the rest of them it just seems
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.320]  like a degeneration well the the chaos and again you know the whole moral
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:02.720]  relativism of the left the chaos that comes from the kind of breakdown
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:06.000]  structures moral structures and structures that have traditionally
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.880]  defined the post-war world we're entering into a very kind of fluid
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.320]  period of time I mean I can see I don't think the EU is going to stay together I

[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:20.760]  having flies and all over him it's just happening constantly even in the

[02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:00.560]  scientists doubt salt as bad for you as government says I have a stack of news
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.360]  I'm going to be getting into some of the news also up on info wars.com and
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:14.480]  prisonplanet.com Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest since you are an economist I
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.080]  wanted to get into this investment bank that first the US wasn't going to be
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:22.920]  part of now it is that's led by the Communist Chinese Larry Summers come is
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:29.200]  come out in an op-ed P0 hedge has it and said basically we haven't joined global
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.600]  government enough we haven't been enthusiastic enough even though we've
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:38.000]  helped lead it so we're going to be left behind by the Asian Union meanwhile US
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.320]  defense chief says influence influence at risk without Asia trade pact that's
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.720]  Reuters that's what the globalists said in the 70s will create the Asian Union
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:50.560]  European Union American Union have those unions compete run by the same people
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.000]  getting people to give up more and more of their power to a central group
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.920]  claiming that'll make us prosperous as we actually become enslaved and signed
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:03.480]  on to the global derivatives overhang and that's been the plan since 1976 the
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.280]  trilateral Commission and then here's Larry Summers in this amazing piece time
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.880]  US leadership woke up to the new economic era when he's the author of so
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:16.440]  much of the derivatives what an amazing time to be alive and to have this Asia
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:22.520]  pan-Pacific trade pact that's secret that we can't even see the Trans-Pacific
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.400]  Partnership I mean this is everything you wrote about and went on Lou Dobbs
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:31.920]  about you know 15 years ago 10 years ago dr. Corsi and got scoffed at it's all
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:38.080]  coming true I mean this is amazing dr. Corsi what's really going on geopolitically
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:43.560]  right now and what's happening with this new investment bank well a lot of what
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:47.240]  I did write about a like great USA which was you know 10 years ago is
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:52.400]  happening now the what you're reading about the Asian Bank is just the prelude
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.720]  to the attempting to create fear Larry Summers out there saying oh we're
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:00.720]  losing due China they're having their own investment bank you're right all these
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:05.280]  international banks are run by the same group of globalists but the the long-term
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:11.080]  plan is here Obama is going to come in now next and ask for fast-track authority
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:15.560]  to get this Trans-Pacific Partnership approved another deal we don't know
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:20.120]  anything about it's been negotiated in secret and the solution will be oh well
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:26.200]  we have to have a supra Pacific not just NAFTA we'll subsume NAFTA into a
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:33.400]  Pacific Rim NAFTA and then we'll involve China and this will be the solution to
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:38.640]  the fact that we're getting excluded from China's Asia Bank so all Larry
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:43.840]  Summers is doing is trying to create fear so that the globalist can jam the
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:47.960]  next global solution down everybody's throat which is the Trans-Pacific
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:52.360]  Partnership and I suspect we'll be seeing now this is the prelude very
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.160]  quickly you know the next crisis the next manufactured news that the Obama
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:02.080]  administration will use to push the last crisis off the front page which is no
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:05.640]  Valerie Jaris been very good at manufacturing news so that nothing
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:12.080]  sticks will be this we're losing the Asia we're losing our global position so
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:15.560]  we need a Trans-Pacific Partnership which just gives more power to the
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.960]  globalist and less freedom and autonomy to the United States and less jobs and
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:25.760]  more of a planned managed economy over and over again which you wrote about I
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.400]  made films about we've been talking about this for 20 years or longer not
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:33.320]  because we're rocket scientists but because it's an admitted plan I mean
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:36.800]  look at Europe having their leaders installed you're predicting the EU
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:41.240]  breaks up what do you how do you see all this ending because what I've read from
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:45.000]  the Toronto Commission plans that are public or what Senator Goldwater talked
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.960]  about and some of the secretive Senate meetings that he was in was openly
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:54.000]  discussed they create three global unions right use those to suck dry the three
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.320]  unions collapse those into one global super state run by private corporations
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.640]  that are anti-free market is that an accurate analysis yeah I think so I think
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:07.160]  also Russia wants to play and Russia is going to the breakup of the EU will not
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:11.880]  be a reduction of globalism it won't be the individual countries going back to
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:17.400]  individual autonomy and self-governance it'll be Russia coming in to bail out
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.680]  Greece as such Russia will want to include Greece in its its alignment and
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:29.680]  you'll have a Russian Union that stands outside the global Union the China seems
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:35.280]  to be willing to agree to quote to grow I mean China and Russia they may both be
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.640]  communist states they're not on the same side of the table Russia's always been
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:46.360]  closer to Japan and aligned with Japan even since World War two you know when
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.800]  we ran merchant marine ships to one lease to Russia and Japan let them go
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:57.600]  Russia and Japan have been closely aligned Russia and China are at odds you're
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:04.440]  going to see an EU structure that that weakens and gets pushed into the trans
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:10.000]  Atlantic Alliance while the Trans Pacific Alliance is going to be advanced and
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.720]  before you know it will be in global governance again and none of these
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:18.600]  global governance is what anything to do with freedom or the Bill of Rights or
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.640]  the Second Amendment or the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.840]  because that in the cultural war attack that you're seeing from the left is
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:31.760]  also being eradicated and undermined by saying well if you don't agree with the
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:36.920]  LGBT agenda you're a bigot you know you believe in Christianity you're not
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:40.200]  only if you want any type of borders and don't want to pay for everybody's free
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:44.480]  health care you're a racist if you don't want illegals voting you're a racist just
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:48.800]  given to our globalist agenda or you're a bad person because the fundamental order
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:51.760]  that has to be broken down that the left is now working aggressively to
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:57.240]  break down is the United States of America as supporting freedom First
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.600]  Amendment the Bill of Rights our limited government and being since the end of
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.880]  World War two a power that could impose that kind of a moral business structure
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.520]  a capitalist structure upon the world that view is evil is being broken down
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.880]  and what will replace it is globalism and under globalism everybody start
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:20.240]  but it's not reading George Orwell and and Aldous Huxley bravely. That's right,
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:25.160]  piratical combines that are the opposite of free market while scapegoating free
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.800]  market as what we're seeing under globalism. And producing a hundred
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:32.880]  million people in the United States who are out of work out of the labor force
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:37.720]  and not needed and then the in history of the world when you know the average
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:41.160]  person when the middle class has been defined is not needed look out you set
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:47.160]  up the perfect conditions for genocide for mass disease for nuclear war because
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:50.920]  they'll you'll find the globalist talking about there's just too many people in
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:56.240]  the world and they're useless I mean the hundred million people one third of the
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:00.960]  U.S. population you know the working population more than a third not able to
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:05.600]  find a job and just basically economically and they're setting up death
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:09.680]  panels and telling the yuppies how cool it is to kill your mom and dad and then
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:14.440]  meanwhile our video is up on drudgereport.com UN climate change official says
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:19.160]  we should quote make every effort to depopulate the planet close quote the
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:23.720]  there is pressure in the system to go towards that we should do everything
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:28.440]  possible to carry that out I mean these people are totalitarians and when you
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:33.480]  look at Obama I mean I was a big critic of Bush but my goodness light speed
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:37.640]  opening the borders outside of law light speed going after guns outside of law
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:41.800]  light speed shutting down the power plants outside of law light speed putting
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:47.640]  us under the UN illegal treaties and then like you said totalitarian treaties
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:55.120]  that take Congress's authority this is classical usurping happening but as
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.800]  long as they dress it up as trendy it seems to be okay with a politically
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.400]  ignorant public but there's still a larger minority becoming more and more
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:08.720]  aware and as history shown Dr. C of a large minority won't go along no amount
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:12.480]  of tyranny can force it what do you see in your crystal ball for the future of
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:18.200]  the confrontation by free humanity true liberals true Renaissance people versus
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:21.720]  the totalitarian leftist well don't give up the Second Amendment that's
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:27.080]  number one and number two is that you know the middle class is being destroyed
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:31.600]  totalitarian government push everything to the top there's going to be a wealthy
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:36.440]  class that ruling class at the top and everybody else who are serfs slaves and
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:41.160]  that's where the left that's where all of this globalism ends up the George
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:45.200]  Soros is they're not going to suffer you'll have you know not one billion
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:49.120]  next we'll be having trillionaires instead of billionaires concentration of
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:53.280]  wealth under Obama is growing but also don't get confused to think that the
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:57.400]  Democrats and Republicans are two separate parties you know you've got an
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:01.120]  extension of the same kinds of principles that George W. Bush was
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:07.000]  pursuing open borders etc. just at a much rapid pace under Obama and Obama was
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.880]  you know outright trained as a communist Obama was raised as a Muslim Obama is
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:16.160]  solidly in with the globalist agenda and also don't get confused that he's for
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.640]  the people he's done nothing for African Americans he's done a lot for Wall
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:23.760]  Street concentration of well wait a minute he did double their unemployment I
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:27.480]  mean that was and put them in prison so that's a nice thing to do that yes
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:32.600]  that's right but nothing positive the all the rhetoric the communist rhetoric
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:37.040]  is just a rhetoric of control as a rhetoric of serfdom it's now been
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.960]  introduced again under the Saul Linsky and Cloward Piven of Obama because it's
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:47.440]  the people were conditioned to be able propaganda wise you know to utilize the
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:52.160]  racist theme Hillary Clinton wins it'll be the sexist theme we're gonna have
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:57.760]  another centrist Republican candidate on Jeb Bush being advanced you know and
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:02.720]  again these leftist and rightist politicians are basically the two sides
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:06.960]  of the same sure who do you like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul more I like them both
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.440]  and either one of them would be worth supporting and I hope that the two of
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:14.240]  them continue to advance and hope the two of them continue to you know they're
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:17.320]  gonna have to fight the media they're gonna have to fight for campaign
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:20.400]  contributions I have to fight and I think they should own the fact that they're
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:24.040]  libertarian constitutionalist and not be ashamed of it they should outright own
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.360]  it and they should proclaim it and argue for it and they're gonna have to have
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:32.280]  grassroots support though because they will be shut out from the car by the
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:39.240]  Carl Robes from the Republican money which will go to the Jeb Bush you gotta
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.360]  support them the establishment's attacking them it's a no-brainer Dr.

[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:37.480]  this headline dovetails with the next court moles revealing secret government
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:45.720]  plan to cut cell phone service feds SOP standard operating procedure 303 mobile
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:52.440]  phone kill switch policy would endanger public if disclosed that's right where
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:56.240]  the government takes over all your cell phones all your TVs all radio and
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:03.960]  broadcast brainwashing the internet kill switch which I think was nightline
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.680]  attack me about five years ago and said I was insane for talking about a federal
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.000]  appeals court is asking the Obama administration so they think you're dumb
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.840]  when they talk down to you like that there's no Asia Pacific partnership
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:25.780]  doesn't exist there's no NSA Florida it's good for you not take it take the
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:29.680]  shots we love you sorry a federal appeals court is asking Obama
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:33.000]  administration to explain why the government should be allowed to keep
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.760]  secret it's planned to shutter mobile phone service during critical
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:40.280]  emergencies close quote the Department of Homeland Security that means
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:43.240]  globalist foreign takeover every agency that's what it really is the
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:47.320]  occupational government takeover VC French collaborator system I'm sorry the
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:50.080]  Department of Homeland I mean literally that's what it is the Department of
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:55.360]  Homeland Security up with the plan came up with the plan known as standing
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:00.480]  operation procedure 303 after cellular phones were used to detonate explosives
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:06.040]  targeting a London public transportation system that's why the kill switch was
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:13.800]  put in of course to stop the MI6 terrorist SOP 303 is a powerful tool
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:17.520]  of digital age and it spells out a unified voluntary process for the
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.480]  overly shut down and restoration of wireless service during critical
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:25.560]  emergencies such as a threat of radio activated improvised explosive devices
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:29.040]  that's why all the new phones whether they're droid or apple come out with
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:34.200]  kill switches the police can hit during demonstrations no it's about managing
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:39.760]  everything with Trojan horses in everything the US Court of Appeals and
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:43.560]  by the way the danger of hackers taking this over as an outside threat is much
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.640]  bigger than quote terrorist the US Court of Appeals for the federal circuit in
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:51.920]  February sided with the government and rule the policy did not need to be
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:57.160]  disclosed under four year from the electronic privacy information center
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:00.600]  but now another courts looking at it now that dovetails with this little jewel
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:07.200]  out of the Washington Post scattered power outages reported across DC DC
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:11.280]  utilities and Homeland Security officials not servants are investigating a
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:15.120]  power surge the temporarily knocked out power for the White House and parts of
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:18.840]  downtown Washington and other nearby areas boy I wish it was powered stuff
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:24.320]  longer the DC Homeland Security officials instead they're turning off our
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:29.000]  power are jacking up our prices set an explosion at the southern Maryland
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.680]  electrical facilities believed to have caused the power surge the temporarily
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:39.960]  knocked out power the White House the explosion of the facility run by SEM
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.280]  Co a customer owned electric system that serves parts of the district of
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:52.640]  criminals and it just goes on from there look at this though man's serving 17
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:58.360]  days in jail for overgrown lawn and then we have another clip we played
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:01.920]  yesterday where the police chief or the head of the fraternal order police says
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.040]  you know what if you criticize somebody on Facebook we're gonna arrest you there's
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:10.280]  no such thing as petty crimes free species of crime but the problem is
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.880]  overgrown government not overgrown lawns Kit Daniels has that report so throw
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.480]  the book at people for bureaucratic stuff but don't bring any legal alien in
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:23.600]  for drunk driving as they admit they do or don't let foreign bankers get in
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:29.080]  trouble when they steal trillions of dollars that's just how the cookie
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:33.440]  crumbles on that front and don't ask that the Asian Pacific partnership be made
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:36.880]  public so the American people can know what's being voted on just have
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:42.280]  Congress sign away fast track to the president so he can decide sounds like
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:47.200]  a free society doesn't it army says diversity training this is USA today
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:54.160]  army says diversity training sent wrong signal army officials are investigating
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:59.920]  a diversity training briefing at Fort Gordon in Georgia which a slide about
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:03.520]  white privilege was inappropriately shown to soldiers yeah that's just for the
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:06.880]  school kids they don't want the soldiers in fighting with each other so they
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:10.320]  know they don't want that because you might have to actually be unified in war
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:13.720]  but if you want to screw the country up obsessive a race all day and just bring
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:18.400]  up random you know race stuff like Starbucks does the equal opportunity
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.680]  briefing took place Thursday for about 400 soldiers the 67th signal battalion
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:28.080]  and then it just goes into how this would cause in fighting and destabilize
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:32.360]  things so the army doesn't want it well I guess you don't want arsenic in the
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:36.880]  poultry either what are you a racist FDA to withdraw approval for arsenic based

[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:42.280]  Rand Paul you want to see how far the info war has come ladies and gentlemen
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:47.200]  and how much we influence people that you influence people I was the first
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:51.920]  person I know of about 16 17 years ago to start saying put tape over your web
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:57.760]  cams and we we popularized it now you can go in businesses everywhere and see
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:02.360]  it was in a hotel in California and looked over they had the cameras covered
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:07.480]  up with tape people know and something simple like that but I've said a symbol
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:12.760]  of liberty could be covering up the webcam they're now shelling for people
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:23.120]  that donate on the Rand Paul website don't drone me bro because he they're
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:26.320]  going to go really popular with actually libertarians that aren't pro war I
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:29.840]  mean he could really win folks bridge the gap that's what they're gonna hit him
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:34.080]  with the racism charges because it's the opposite and they've got a little blocker
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:37.960]  little NSA blocker where it's a little plastic piece that slides over and then
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:42.840]  slides back like a camera lens for when you want to use the camera yeah these
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:46.680]  always be lenses on things these to always be something to cover it up and
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:50.040]  it says Rand we ought to rip this off because they're ripping us off which is
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:55.160]  a loving thing to do I mean the greatest form of flattery is imitation we
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:58.560]  should find out who's making this forum and come up with our own it was always
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:04.680]  just a bandaid for us we progenitor we were the progenitors of this gave birth
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:08.400]  to this the granddaddies of this so now I can come back home and maybe we can get
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:13.080]  these so inexpensive maybe throw them in free with orders or something but that's
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:19.680]  really smart of them what they're doing and they're going the trendy route
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:28.360]  trendies love socks they've got Rand blue trendy socks and they've got Rand Paul
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:39.560]  headphones and Rand Paul car mats oh this is really cute Rand Paul flip flops
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:48.920]  okay I'm liking it Rand on a stick shut of 12 and again folks they're demonizing
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:54.400]  him because he's pro-gun pro sovereignty and you know he's was reasonable about
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:58.960]  legalizing legal legals who do the proper steps and not for total amnesty so
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:01.680]  they misrepresented that to make it sound again he has the right wing and left
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:05.920]  wing attacking him for a reason because I know Rand Paul and the White House makes
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:10.640]  a big deal out of this and even running TV ads now about his association with us
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.000]  and if Rand Paul smart he'll just say I do support the radical libertarians you
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.080]  know the radical folks that helped found this country not the radical socialists
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:24.880]  and warmongers and I'm not ashamed of you know I'm doing your show on Fox News
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:29.520]  we can make a big deal out of that a lot of bull on here but if he goes with the
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:34.840]  Republican wonks that he's got in his inner circle they just want the next
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:38.600]  political job the next one the next one that's all coming to an end of this
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:45.400]  country's gonna collapse all the house of cards bull about how it's cute to get
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:49.320]  things done and kill the old people or blah blah blah this isn't gonna fly
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:56.600]  anymore people are sick of it all right I said I'd cover a plethora of articles
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:03.680]  that's one just went up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com look at
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:07.880]  this one world-renowned pianist censored in Toronto for questioning Ukrainian
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:12.800]  government man I tell you the Canada basically told me and George Noreen
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:17.240]  wants me to go up there and speak I think I'll do it as a test at the end of
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:23.040]  the summer but they told me basically don't you ever come back here and the
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:26.600]  only reason I was able to get in and with hell for 15 16 hours was because the
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:33.080]  media heard about it he made a big deal out of it but top pianist has been
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:36.720]  replaced by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and accused of engaging in
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:40.960]  public incitement of hatred ever she posted political opinions critical of
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:45.720]  the Ukrainian government conduct in the country Civil War
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.640]  I mean if you point out that most of leadership are a bunch of Nazis you get
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:39:00.320]  you can't Canada is now a great tyranny truly sickening and again I'm not on
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:04.600]  the Russian side or on the George Soros side but George Soros started it
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:12.640]  NATO started it and it is a mess ladies and gentlemen it is a mess we do have a
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.680]  bunch of clips of Obama I said I get to these of your radio listener info wars

[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:13.600]  say a man this new feminist teaching that all men are just rapist period has
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:17.920]  women massive increases in fake rape reports because it's just the thing to
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:21.120]  do I mean all men are rapists they deserve to you know be called a rapist
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:27.800]  immediately and that's just what needs to be done we have one more Obama clip
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:31.480]  this is him at the prayer breakfast this clips up on info wars calm Obama
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:36.360]  criticizes Christians at Easter breakfast prayer president randomly calls
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:40.080]  out less than loving expressions by Christians yeah he didn't have time to
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.440]  talk about the hundreds of thousands of Christians killed last year a radical as
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:46.800]  long as sister how he was funding him it was just you know there's some mean
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:50.600]  Christians that want to bake some cakes that quote the Bible and we've all got
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:53.280]  to just shake and fear and give it a bunch of attention and act like we're
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:56.880]  all being abused and maybe have some liberals burn some more fake crosses and
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:00.800]  swastikas you know to get everybody fighting with each other let's go ahead
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:09.600]  and go to that clip on Easter I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian I
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:20.960]  am supposed to love and I have to say that sometimes when I've listened to less
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:27.080]  than loving expressions by Christians I get concerned that's right let's
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:29.920]  criticize Christianity on Easter you piece of crap that's topic for another
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:36.480]  day that's slime ball man I tell you what a piece of garbage funding the
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:41.000]  Muslim Brotherhood to kill over 20,000 Christians on record in Egypt in the
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.640]  last three years crucify and I'm upside down that's what you like to do here in
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.920]  your family I'm serious this guy is a you sharper who hates you and your family
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:54.880]  period I mean I cannot express to you that's not rhetoric this is a monstrous
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:43:02.280]  expression of evil oh and you know what you don't pay your fake income taxes are
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:05.080]  going to take your house and everything you got oh but if you're
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:09.160]  illegals again who they're just using illegal immigrant children surge across
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:13.480]  border at highest rates this last summer speak there's a video on info wars of the
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:19.960]  feds loading them on planes in Latin America to pay to fly them here and
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:24.440]  again it's all just to break the country up border patrol unsuspected truck
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:33.080]  drivers fighting immigrants on board action 24 news poll yes more aggressive
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:38.320]  deportations no to welfare citizenship for kids of illegals no who cares with
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:42.560]  the polls one TSA is being criticized because they actually stopped some
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.440]  illegals from flying without IDs and they've apologized and promised to let
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:49.240]  them fly without IDs which we've gotten on video so again you're above the law
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:54.320]  when you're an illegal that's from the intercept Ryan Williams running around
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:58.160]  now with new lies about brain tumors or whatever they're saying he may never
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:01.400]  come back just other examples I mean this guy's nothing compared to the other
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:09.440]  liars Brian Williams is an angel compared to them I'm not defending Brian
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:12.480]  Williams okay let's get to the really important stacks of news now I'm just
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:18.480]  moving across the board here New York Times we told you this was coming wasn't
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:21.840]  hard to tell you that just pointing out we told you last week that they'd call
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:26.760]  for autonomous aircraft and no more pilots the pilot would be ceremonial
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:32.240]  like a butler it would basically shake your hands and hang out with you so
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:35.520]  imagine a world without humans would be in a world without crime a world without
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.200]  humans making decisions imagine what idea what precept they're putting out
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:44.520]  here it's it's the globalist takeover I told you 15 years ago or more they
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:48.120]  would then say that you have to pay higher insurance to drive your own car and
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:51.960]  then after that they'll just ban the mount ride and that's in the news today
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:58.200]  I'm about to get to that Toyota and BMW are leading and sure it sounds good hey
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:04.280]  you don't see a car slamming on its brakes the car will do it for you again
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:08.200]  building a world without humans and then next they tax you by the mile and
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:11.400]  next they take control and next they can kill you whenever they want to say the
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:17.440]  robot malfunction mounting evidence that the co-pilot crashed a German wings
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:20.900]  plane into French mountains it you know it's not hey don't let people take
[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:25.800]  Prozac or one of those drugs and fly planes are doing else no no no no just
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:31.480]  humans can't fly now and by the way the planes already fly themselves that's
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:34.840]  why a lot of pilots say there's so many accidents is because when the malfunctions
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:40.520]  happen you're screwed mounting evidence that the co-pilot crashed a German
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:43.640]  wings plane to the French mountain has prompted a global debate about how to
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:47.480]  better screen crew members for mental illness and how to ensure that no one is
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:51.840]  left alone in the cockpit yes you can't trust anybody but among many aviation
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:55.120]  experts the discussion has taken a different turn how many human pilots
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:46:00.720]  some wonder are really necessary aboard commercial planes one or none and it goes
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:03.560]  into advances and artificial intelligence they already have the
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:07.560]  autonomous plane well what if somebody hacks it then there's an emergency
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:10.640]  overdrive and a human there who doesn't know how to fly anymore because that
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:14.320]  skills been taken what happens when the GPS goes out what happens to lose
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:19.520]  connection that's why you'll have the toilet attendant there that's what they'll
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:23.720]  do they'll they'll hand you you know how I got a fancy hotel bathroom they're

[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:33.800]  let's move on to the next article BMW is new sensors do the breaking for you
[02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:39.680]  Bloomberg business in the new episode of spark the government car manufacturer
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:43.560]  wants to cut down on accidents caused by human error that's right we'll save you
