[02:55.600 --> 03:02.360]  years ago they put al Qaeda in charge and then I get lectured by these neocon
[03:02.360 --> 03:07.200]  radio host I routinely turn into radio I just scan to the dial and then once a
[03:07.200 --> 03:11.200]  week or so here's some talk show host talking total trash about me I'm sent
[03:11.200 --> 03:14.280]  clips more often than once a week by listeners but I even hear it myself
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.280]  where Alex Jones wants the Islamists to get us really last time I checked I
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.440]  didn't get the underwear bomber on Christmas Day on the airplane like the
[03:22.440 --> 03:26.440]  State Department under CIA orders last time I checked I didn't get the shoe
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.920]  bomber on the plane under MI6 orders last time I checked I wasn't MI6 running

[03:53.440 --> 03:59.560]  checked I didn't land them in Tripoli last time I checked I'm not with al Qaeda
[03:59.560 --> 04:04.600]  let's get that straight the criminal banks that run this government and then
[04:04.600 --> 04:11.160]  are running our country into the ground they run al Qaeda the very people using

[06:03.200 --> 06:07.520]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.520 --> 06:11.680]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.720]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.720 --> 06:19.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.600 --> 06:23.640]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.640 --> 06:28.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:28.040 --> 06:32.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.360 --> 06:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:36.080 --> 06:40.280]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:40.280 --> 06:43.680]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[08:27.760 --> 08:34.200]  all right my friends I hope that you are strapped in today because we've got a
[08:34.200 --> 08:40.960]  special report coming up in the third hour we're going to be joined by a
[08:40.960 --> 08:52.800]  mother in Pennsylvania who is a listener who is a health and sports director at a
[08:52.800 --> 08:58.200]  major organization but we're gonna leave that name out of it here and I've
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.840]  called made calls confirmed all of it she took her two and a half year old in
[09:02.840 --> 09:11.520]  to the pediatrician and she was basically harassed by the doctor for an
[09:11.520 --> 09:20.840]  hour pressuring her to take inoculations and then when she got home over
[09:20.840 --> 09:31.320]  the weekend two separate times the state police came to her home and so Rachel
[09:31.320 --> 09:38.240]  Gorman is going to be joining us she's heard the show before but it's her father
[09:38.240 --> 09:44.280]  that is a daily listener and told her told her to email us and we have
[09:44.280 --> 09:51.240]  contacted her we have a copy of the letters the state police gave her and
[09:51.240 --> 09:55.400]  she will break it all down coming up in the third hour but the reason I say this
[09:55.400 --> 10:05.160]  is a special report is because all over the United States from California to
[10:05.160 --> 10:11.000]  Alabama and those are the two news clips we've got actually coming up when
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.400]  she's on with us it's from California in Alabama the police come to your door
[10:17.400 --> 10:23.400]  with bureaucrats and they say we're coming in we're going to give you
[10:23.400 --> 10:30.360]  inoculations and in some cases they're so hyped up in their criminality they
[10:30.360 --> 10:36.520]  actually will force their way in take your children and have a judge say that
[10:36.520 --> 10:40.560]  you're a bad parent and take them even though there is no law but you have to
[10:40.560 --> 10:47.680]  take the inoculation it is total tyranny on steroids and in every state from
[10:47.680 --> 10:53.640]  Michigan to Texas from Kansas to Utah this is now happening and we have the
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.800]  confirmed mainstream dinosaur media reports they're not even hiding it that
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.480]  the feds are now visiting people's homes health and human services centers for
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.840]  disease control families are across the nation you've seen this in the news
[11:07.840 --> 11:14.200]  getting letters from the feds and then if you're uninformed enough to even fill
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.160]  out the report that they order you to fill out which violates your rights as
[11:18.160 --> 11:25.240]  well they then use that to send feds or deputized feds and in some cases it's
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.600]  not even constables or police and we have newscast of this it is health
[11:29.600 --> 11:33.480]  department people and you open the door and they say I'm coming in we got the
[11:33.480 --> 11:40.080]  shot I mean can you imagine the ultra mega tyranny of this I mean this is
[11:40.080 --> 11:46.760]  twilight zone cuckoo for cocoa puffs absurdist craziness because they don't
[11:46.760 --> 11:54.640]  even have laws it is just frothing criminality in a Psyop the criminal
[11:54.640 --> 12:01.120]  bureaucracy can't pass a law they've tried hundreds of times every year they
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.520]  try in every state in the union and so they do the other thing they run a hoax
[12:05.520 --> 12:08.960]  and you've all heard it you've all read it heard it on radio and seen on the
[12:08.960 --> 12:15.000]  nightly news in the month of august every day it's the law to take 50 plus
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.520]  vaccines we're having a mass inoculation at zilker park in austin
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.320]  texas we're having a mass inoculation at this gymnasium we're having a mass
[12:24.320 --> 12:31.080]  inoculation to keep your children safe at this facility or its central
[12:31.080 --> 12:40.920]  park it is the same giant criminal lying wicked hoax and now in alabama and
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.640]  california that's the two places they're going wild and by the way they're
[12:45.640 --> 12:48.880]  done going and taking the poor people's kids they think can't defend themselves
[12:48.880 --> 12:53.400]  and are ignorant they're now going to the uppity places and again that's when
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.880]  you know you are hitting rock bottom when they went in new orleans and went in
[12:57.880 --> 13:01.600]  the high and dry areas and giant 15 million dollar mansions some of the
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.720]  most expensive houses in the country are in new orleans they look like the
[13:05.720 --> 13:09.040]  white house there's a whole bunch of it's famous in architecture that's what's
[13:09.040 --> 13:12.760]  on the news you've seen it just type in gun confiscation new orleans and it
[13:12.760 --> 13:17.640]  shows them blowing the doors off safes taking families guns granddaddy's shot
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.960]  gun everything throwing them in trucks and stealing them and putting the
[13:21.960 --> 13:26.680]  citizens in handcuffs and going ahead and breaking their nose or tackling
[13:26.680 --> 13:32.880]  grandma I mean they want everybody and they sit there with the cops and the
[13:32.880 --> 13:39.600]  rest of them engaging in these hardcore crimes outside of law but remember they
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.120]  did this starting in about 1910 in New York New Jersey than it's spread
[13:44.120 --> 13:51.520]  nationwide by the 30s 34 states had total eugenics laws another 10 or so
[13:51.520 --> 13:57.080]  we've got maps of it in game had quasi laws that just said you have no rights
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.200]  so they're in constitutional laws can't legalize tyranny we are going to come
[14:01.200 --> 14:06.240]  because you made under a b-plus we actually have the newsreels in in game
[14:06.240 --> 14:13.400]  showing the credit of the the the report card and if the report card said you
[14:13.400 --> 14:18.880]  made under a b-plus they would pull up in a truck and they would take you to
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.800]  generally a medical facility an insane asylum and they would have medical
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.920]  students chop your uterus out or literally chop your testicles off and
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.280]  people say well come on I get dumb emails when I'm showing the newsreels of
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.160]  this and I'm sorry to get graphic this is medical stuff we're talking about
[14:37.160 --> 14:44.200]  this is what happened this is history 500,000 people plus on record just up to
[14:44.200 --> 14:48.280]  the 40s did it they estimate another 500,000 or more but the numbers were
[14:48.280 --> 14:54.280]  kept more secret up until 1987 when Oregon was the last state to stop doing
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.440]  it and I've had the guest on about this you say but they could there's other
[14:58.440 --> 15:02.000]  ways to sterilize a woman you know just tie their tubes or whatever or do the
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.920]  same with a man they wanted it bloody they wanted it to be brutal it was all
[15:06.920 --> 15:11.600]  about a bunch of medical students having fun and learning that you're an animal
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.920]  it's about twisting medicine medicine is always used as the tip of the spear
[15:17.920 --> 15:22.000]  in tyranny and if you don't know about the Soviet Union or the chai comms or
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.400]  the Nazis and medical tyranny or medical tyranny in England or medical
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.760]  tyranny in France with a panoptagon if you don't know what that is you better
[15:30.760 --> 15:39.600]  learn because this is the philosophy and this is what we're under and I have
[15:39.600 --> 15:43.360]  had family who doesn't vaccinate and they've been threatened okay well you're
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.080]  you know the doctor says you're I may call child protective services on you
[15:47.080 --> 15:52.880]  this is a neglect there's no law but they've got eugenics courts set up in
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.760]  1910 in New York by the Rockefeller family on record Margaret Sanger all of
[15:57.760 --> 16:03.040]  them came out of New York and they set the precedent with the mentally
[16:03.040 --> 16:06.720]  handicapped and folks that it looked like it was reasonable to some they
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.280]  always start with you know with with the most vulnerable and then they beta test
[16:11.280 --> 16:17.240]  and then they move on and they set this up all across the United States and the
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.360]  family courts people ask how is it a judge I thought you get a jury oh it's
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.200]  to protect the children no they were health department eugenics write this

[18:25.520 --> 18:29.880]  because it's now even come out in dinosaur press that many of the children
[18:29.880 --> 18:33.320]  they wonder why the babies die it's always after the vaccines and they try
[18:33.320 --> 18:36.920]  to blame the parent and they do a cat scan there's blood on the brain they say
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.520]  you must have beat your child and it turns out the hospitals know full well
[18:41.520 --> 18:46.760]  they've killed your child but they're gonna blame you for it they're gonna
[18:46.760 --> 18:51.400]  blame you when your baby has an autoimmune response and convulsions as
[18:51.400 --> 18:57.040]  top brain scientist and neurologist like dr. Blalock a broken down here sudden

[19:02.080 --> 19:05.160]  convulsion and the blood starts running out their nose right there on the spot
[19:05.160 --> 19:10.320]  but usually it happens that night you put the 18 month old down or you put the
[19:10.320 --> 19:14.840]  newborn baby down who just got their shots you put them down and they either
[19:14.840 --> 19:23.000]  wake up dead or the 18 month old's talking drawing laughing learning their ABC's
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.840]  we're gonna go to break and when the next morning junior wakes up junior ain't

[24:19.080 --> 24:25.000]  knew it so he started begging with a bucket instead of a cup he's in the
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.400]  jail house now he's in the jail house now he's in the jail house now well Camel
[24:31.400 --> 24:37.360]  plugged his tub when he wore a tuxedo to the country club he's in the jail house
[24:37.360 --> 24:48.160]  now yeah that's Johnny Cash with in the jail house now we're playing a local
[24:48.160 --> 24:55.760]  house the night earlier what's that fellow's name you said Doug some you
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.040]  boys got to turn that microphone up I mean I've got to be psychic almost to
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.880]  be able to hear you when you talk about that thing it's always so low well no
[25:02.880 --> 25:06.160]  it's an electro voice if you guys got like nine feet away from me I can't
[25:06.160 --> 25:09.880]  even hear you it's no big deal it's just like an ongoing nightmare never been
[25:09.880 --> 25:19.280]  able to hear what you say okay we are back live we do have Ray McGovern
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.040]  former top CI analyst to break down the latest on Iran for about 30 minutes with
[25:23.040 --> 25:31.000]  us at the start of the next hour then we've got another guest lady who they're
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.200]  sending the CPS after with the state police because she said no I'm not gonna
[25:36.200 --> 25:44.600]  take the vaccines for my daughter sorry so that is coming up but after I cover
[25:44.600 --> 25:53.240]  the news and after I have Ray McGovern on with us I am going to open the phones
[25:53.240 --> 26:02.520]  up and go to some of your phone calls but I do have trouble controlling my
[26:02.520 --> 26:10.880]  shelf when I see the state of California inoculating children without
[26:10.880 --> 26:17.000]  parental consent so I guess I've got to correct my shelf when I said in the last
[26:17.000 --> 26:25.000]  segment that in no state is it the law your children be vaccinated I forgot that
[26:25.000 --> 26:35.480]  governor Brown what four months ago did sign a bill saying they will give your
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.880]  children shots without your consent they're claiming children as young as
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.000]  11 now have parental control so so your 11 year old's got to get permission from
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.280]  you to go to the zoo or go to the planetarium they go on a field trip but
[26:52.280 --> 26:58.480]  they don't need that for an abortion or for the state to convince your child to
[26:58.480 --> 27:05.280]  take the shot of course under common law can a 20 year old man convince a 12
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.880]  year old girl to have sex with them no because even if the 12 year old says
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.840]  they consent they're a minor this is just common sense but see the criminal
[27:16.840 --> 27:25.220]  state the lawless anti-american criminal state of California says we're gonna
[27:25.220 --> 27:28.800]  give your children shots and we're gonna give them abortions and there's
[27:28.800 --> 27:34.920]  nothing you're gonna do about it now previous to that we have newscast where
[27:34.920 --> 27:40.760]  they come to your house and order your child vaccinated and you know cops sit
[27:40.760 --> 27:47.640]  there they got their nightsticks in their tasers and of course the cops do
[27:47.640 --> 27:49.920]  think it's the law they're like the general public they don't know their
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.520]  heads from the hole in the ground they can probably barely count to 10 like the
[27:53.520 --> 27:57.840]  fluoride head general population I don't hate cops I just hate stupid ignorant
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.720]  people that'll carry out any order they're given and it'll ruin your own
[28:01.720 --> 28:09.920]  future all right I'm sorry you know this is a short segment I'm gonna go to
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.520]  break it I'm gonna try to compose myself but what happens is I stay up late at
[28:14.520 --> 28:17.480]  night researching I research in the morning I get in here there's stacks of
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.040]  news they've printed some of it I've seen other news I haven't and it just
[28:21.040 --> 28:27.880]  makes my head completely spin I mean I knew this was coming they announced two
[28:27.880 --> 28:33.720]  years ago they said Austin will adopt the Copenhagen Treaty and and and how
[28:33.720 --> 28:36.800]  will adopt it even though the Congress didn't didn't sign on to it as the
[28:36.800 --> 28:41.080]  president tried to but we can't without Congress we're gonna adopt the Copenhagen
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.080]  Treaty and we're gonna double the average Austin power person customer
[28:47.080 --> 28:51.640]  within the next three years and here we are two years later and they're
[28:51.640 --> 28:56.080]  implementing it it already went up some last year about a 40% increase that's
[28:56.080 --> 28:59.160]  all in the Austin American statesmen in your news now you're in front of me
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.920]  local news news outlets and I was listening to the city council meeting
[29:03.920 --> 29:07.560]  this morning on the radio they're having a special session and they're debating
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.320]  whether it should be an 80% increase this this year alone on the average
[29:12.320 --> 29:18.480]  user over the 40% last year or whether it should just be 40% again and the good
[29:18.480 --> 29:22.120]  guys are just for the 40 and the bad guys are for the 80 of course they're all
[29:22.120 --> 29:27.240]  bad but they give you a false choice that's psychological warfare and they
[29:27.240 --> 29:30.240]  admit it's gonna bankrupt a lot of people but that's just the way it is and
[29:30.240 --> 29:37.920]  they said it's for the earth that's right that's right give formula one 50
[29:37.920 --> 29:42.280]  million dollars in tax breaks and then just get the money from little old
[29:42.280 --> 29:48.680]  ladies in fact they say this year alone these rate increases in the next 11
[29:48.680 --> 29:56.000]  months we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[34:27.160 --> 34:32.000]  having a debate about this they're saying that it is for the earth actually in
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.600]  the city council of Austin this is a beta test for the rest of the country on
[34:35.600 --> 34:39.320]  the world for that matter in fact Bloomberg even reports that Austin is
[34:39.320 --> 34:45.920]  the test case to just charge people more for electricity and they say to teach
[34:45.920 --> 34:53.640]  you to use less so that they can pay to build formula one race tracks and give
[34:53.640 --> 34:59.040]  their buddies all sorts of tax breaks and incentives and they plan on raising
[34:59.040 --> 35:06.800]  160 million dollars extra just this year alone by the 80% tax rate increase for
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.000]  power now of course of government buildings and government affiliate
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.880]  contractors they're exempt from this the churches though are going to have their

[35:19.800 --> 35:27.400]  earth no it's a criminal enterprise and and then I was reading some of the
[35:27.400 --> 35:30.840]  statesman articles and following the debate in the city council this
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.960]  morning on the radio when the local stations was airing pieces of it and
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.720]  they were saying well people use too much power and we've got too many power
[35:40.720 --> 35:46.200]  plants in America and so overall electric rates have dropped in some
[35:46.200 --> 35:51.120]  areas of the country we need to do this to teach people that coal and natural
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.360]  gas aren't good options that we need to use less I mean I'm hearing post
[35:56.360 --> 36:01.160]  industrial world America having power is bad Mexico can have all the power
[36:01.160 --> 36:06.280]  plants at once China can build a couple new ones a week we can't have any but
[36:06.280 --> 36:10.800]  general electric who is exempt from all this they can keep their plants
[36:10.800 --> 36:15.600]  operating because they basically run the White House and they have the patent on
[36:15.600 --> 36:21.360]  the curly queue mercury filled toxic headache inducing light bulb the
[36:21.360 --> 36:29.040]  horrible fluorescence that they're by law by executive fiat making us adopt
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.640]  Congress has now started to repeal that but the bureaucracy still just rolls
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.960]  forward what type of toilet you can have what type of light bulb but under
[36:38.960 --> 36:43.440]  bio shield hundreds of facilities 36 government hundreds and hundreds of
[36:43.440 --> 36:50.000]  other subsidiary universities and private firms weaponizing every zoological
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.720]  and human transmitted disease you can imagine to airborne with 90 plus percent
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.720]  kill rates nobody's worried about that environmentally nobody's worried about
[36:59.720 --> 37:03.240]  hundreds of species being spliced with each other or the honeybees dying or
[37:03.240 --> 37:09.200]  every study showing GMO corn potatoes maize soybeans within three generations
[37:09.200 --> 37:16.120]  just totally mutating sterilizing and killing every monkey species rat species
[37:16.120 --> 37:22.240]  you give it to of course monkeys you can get them going on a five-year cycle so
[37:22.240 --> 37:25.720]  in 15 years you know three-generation study they got them with rats you can
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.320]  have that in one year three-generation study or humans is a 20-year cycle on
[37:29.320 --> 37:32.640]  average and we're just now seeing the numbers sperm rate almost completely
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.920]  went down to nothing total collapse cancer exploding everywhere absolute
[37:36.920 --> 37:42.200]  bedlam just all sorts of diseases neurological disorders diabetes off the
[37:42.200 --> 37:47.200]  chart and we're just a generation and a half or so into this can you imagine in
[37:47.200 --> 37:55.840]  10 years can you imagine in 20 and of course the corporate dinosaur media will
[37:55.840 --> 37:59.720]  never tell you why this is happening they'll just tell you here's drug
[37:59.720 --> 38:03.680]  companies that'll treat the disease the globalist have given you
[38:03.680 --> 38:09.640]  isn't that just special and cutesy cake yeah you bet I'm angry and in fact I am
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.600]  so angry right now that I'm not gonna blow up because I've learned that when
[38:14.600 --> 38:18.080]  I don't control myself and I have complete blow-ups that I don't have
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.760]  energy to work until eight o'clock at night like I have to this evening because
[38:22.760 --> 38:26.320]  I got the TV show tonight I got meetings I've got interviews I got to do I got
[38:26.320 --> 38:32.800]  all this to do and I cannot explode but as a primitive human faced with all this
[38:32.800 --> 38:40.360]  at a certain point you start getting hopping mad because you know in 5000
[38:40.360 --> 38:46.680]  BC or whatever most problems could get be solved by stomping somebody and so my
[38:46.680 --> 38:51.480]  brain just keeps saying just give me somebody to stomp just show me the
[38:51.480 --> 38:56.120]  enemy but we're not gonna defeat this that way at this phase we have got to
[38:56.120 --> 39:00.880]  just get people to realize just how evil the government and special interests
[39:00.880 --> 39:13.520]  are and stop being naive but I mean the city council is a group of outrageous
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.280]  scum just like California total globalist anti-human they're not liberals
[39:19.280 --> 39:24.880]  they're they're they're they're thieves that sell you it's for the earth so that
[39:24.880 --> 39:32.960]  the contractors and the and the power sellers that sell to Austin energy and
[39:32.960 --> 39:35.480]  we're told it's government getting this money no it's not it's the special
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.560]  interest that sell the power to Austin the same special interest that helps
[39:40.560 --> 39:43.840]  shut down the city-controlled utilities so that we couldn't produce our own
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.960]  power they're shutting power plants down all over the country and I have to sit
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.800]  here and oh 40% last year 80% this year and another 80% increase next year I
[39:56.800 --> 40:07.120]  mean just highway naked flaming stealing with both hands and they're so
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.280]  manipulative that we can just teach people these tricks they're on the news
[40:10.280 --> 40:16.400]  going well the mayor you know says we should only increase it by 40% not 80
[40:16.400 --> 40:21.080]  like the rest of the council wants and then it's like oh the mayor he's the good
[40:21.080 --> 40:28.960]  guy he only wants to raise it on old ladies by 40% how nice of him I mean is
[40:28.960 --> 40:36.520]  there that trick is so elementary that it makes me want to throw up I mean only
[40:36.520 --> 40:39.080]  see people think when they're self-centered and don't care about
[40:39.080 --> 40:42.760]  politics and just say oh you can't affect change why should I get involved
[40:42.760 --> 40:47.120]  that that's somehow some kind of moral shield and then if you just don't care
[40:47.120 --> 40:53.440]  that that you're immune no when you don't care the wolves eat your sheep like
[40:53.440 --> 41:02.080]  romp for dinner and I hear the people complain I don't know why my power is
[41:02.080 --> 41:05.760]  going up I hear all the time we got to do something well you're not going to do
[41:05.760 --> 41:08.400]  anything till you kick out the electronic voting machines where I live
[41:08.400 --> 41:14.040]  and sustain many other cities I mean you think these crooks are here to just
[41:14.040 --> 41:17.360]  take over the power supply and the water supply and jack up your prices
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.120]  they're here to take control they're criminals of course there's no voting in
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.960]  Austin so you say what do you do you sue them you protest them you point out it's
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.520]  a fraud you go back to original paper ballots counted precinct by precinct and
[41:31.520 --> 41:38.720]  then tallied up publicly but if you don't face up the fact that many cities are
[41:38.720 --> 41:45.840]  100% mafia run Austin Texas Chicago Illinois New York New York Los Angeles
[41:45.840 --> 41:52.720]  California you mean Detroit Detroit these are criminal 100% devilish
[41:52.720 --> 41:59.200]  enterprises with a bunch of cattle out there okay I'm gonna stop right there
[41:59.200 --> 42:04.120]  let me just let me just let me just do what I said I was gonna do at the very
[42:04.120 --> 42:09.080]  start let's see if I can do it journalist Susan Obama over indefinite
[42:09.080 --> 42:13.160]  detention law in the AA provision could be one-way ticket to Gitmo for
[42:13.160 --> 42:17.240]  protesters claims class action lawsuit well yeah they're trying to take people's
[42:17.240 --> 42:24.000]  kids outside of law for not taking shots here's another one Romney rattled by
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.640]  Republican rivals Mitt Romney unnerved in South Carolina debate after being
[42:29.640 --> 42:34.560]  challenged over tax returns and negative campaigning yeah Ron Paul is number two
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.320]  right behind him and Mitt Romney is as globalist as Newt Yenrich or Rick Perry
[42:39.320 --> 42:45.560]  even worse than Rick Perry that's hard to say it's true I mean he's a ringer folks
[42:45.560 --> 42:49.520]  it's either Ron Paul or nobody and all you Republicans going well I'll go for
[42:49.520 --> 42:59.600]  Mitt Romney he's going to take a dive like Bob Dole did in 1996 just watch
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.240]  continuing here oh I've gotten through two articles a business group claims
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.920]  Obama creating constitutional crisis over all the different things he's doing
[43:11.920 --> 43:15.680]  launching wars without congressional approval making recess appointments we
[43:15.680 --> 43:21.760]  never even brought him before Congress of course he is Ron Paul tied with Romney
[43:21.760 --> 43:24.380]  as most electable Republican establishment meant that Paul is
[43:24.380 --> 43:28.960]  unelectable debunked yet again and I hear these local media prostitutes on
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.240]  here repeating that well he just can't win they're not even consciously paid
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.680]  to lie like that the average cattle brain out there the average sheep head
[43:38.680 --> 43:45.960]  thinks that it's cool and trendy to parrot what talking heads say they watch
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.280]  political shows and then they think that's real slick and highbrow and then
[43:50.280 --> 43:54.640]  they go and they they parrot what has is said and then feel like they're real
[43:54.640 --> 44:02.840]  smart you know what I could you go get a parrot and train it to talk to and
[44:02.840 --> 44:08.360]  repeat what I say here's another one this is just some of the financial news
[44:08.360 --> 44:15.920]  here senator pushes for GMO labeling in Washington state that is super good
[44:15.920 --> 44:20.960]  news you have a right to know what's in there that's just some of the news in
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.380]  that stack I mean I'm just randomly picking up one of the stacks here look
[44:25.380 --> 44:34.000]  at this headline US and Iran inch closer to military conflict the hill here's
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.040]  another one somebody's jamming Iranian national TV signals the Iranian
[44:38.040 --> 44:42.720]  government's announced via press TV Saudis are saying don't worry about
[44:42.720 --> 44:46.280]  Iran they close the trade or moose at the end of the month when sanctions are
[44:46.280 --> 44:50.360]  put on them and their their gas is cut off they ship out oil ship back in
[44:50.360 --> 44:54.120]  refined gas because the West has blocked them getting oil filled equipment or
[44:54.120 --> 44:59.960]  refinery equipment to be able to refine it so they're saying they can supply that
[44:59.960 --> 45:07.480]  many animals say that's not true look at this article healthy seven-year-old
[45:07.480 --> 45:12.440]  girl dies in mother's arms after flu shot and then it links to the articles
[45:12.440 --> 45:16.880]  that break it all down the incredible death rates worldwide it says on the
[45:16.880 --> 45:21.240]  insider can tell you but so what here's another one eugenics in action three-
[45:21.240 --> 45:25.880]  year-old girl denied kidney transplant because she is quote mentally retarded
[45:25.880 --> 45:30.760]  she's told yeah an in-game in Texas at the state legislature they asked the
[45:30.760 --> 45:34.560]  head of the state psychiatry board they say why are over two-thirds the foster
[45:34.560 --> 45:41.320]  kids on a whole bunch of type of tropics because they have bad genes they come
[45:41.320 --> 45:47.360]  from bad gene pools so eugenics is the real religion and as long as you're not
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.120]  aware of the game that's being played with you you're gonna lose EPA drops
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.080]  jackboot on necks of couple daring to build their on their own land and as a
[45:56.080 --> 46:00.480]  report going to the Supreme Court Ron Paul talked about it yesterday and
[46:00.480 --> 46:04.920]  there you've bought your property you own it they just come along and say if
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.600]  water ever stands on your property anywhere during a rainstorm it's a
[46:09.600 --> 46:15.360]  wetland and they can take control of your land and then charge you for taking
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.360]  your land though that's actually in the Supreme Court case you know you don't
[46:19.360 --> 46:23.040]  just have your land taken they charge you for the assessment to have it taken
[46:23.040 --> 46:25.960]  and that ties them with other article coming up here in a moment out of
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.720]  Canada medicine of the future arrives in high street as pharmacy offers pills

[56:01.720 --> 56:09.640]  fly over your house and they say we see unusual heat resonance or they spy on
[56:09.640 --> 56:13.280]  your power bill and the police are in the article and it says you're using too
[56:13.280 --> 56:17.240]  much power for say three people living here so they come without a warrant
[56:17.240 --> 56:22.680]  demand to come in and then never leave when marijuana is not found they find
[56:22.680 --> 56:33.160]  you for mold or for water damage see they use zoning rules to harass you out
[56:33.160 --> 56:39.000]  of existence and slap some of these fines are over $20,000 listen to this and
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.920]  this is coming to the US this is now being rolled in this is the feudalism
[56:42.920 --> 56:49.120]  terrorism system where they just bureaucrats his feet on us a number of
[56:49.120 --> 56:53.000]  citizens led by Stacy going lock we're gonna get on the show so their homes
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.760]  were legally searched for marijuana grow ops that's how they sold the law
[56:57.760 --> 57:01.560]  resulting in them being slapped with fees and repair orders sometimes
[57:01.560 --> 57:09.400]  exceeding $10,000 all on flimsy evidence grado 67 said he has never grown pot he
[57:09.400 --> 57:12.240]  said it was laughable but see it doesn't matter that pot wasn't found it's just
[57:12.240 --> 57:15.360]  it's pot so you're bad
[57:17.440 --> 57:22.160]  grado 67 said he's never grown pot he said that laughable evidence against him
[57:22.160 --> 57:27.600]  consists of pitchers of some dirt on the basement wall and a furnace pipe going
[57:27.600 --> 57:31.920]  up the chimney where it should be well that's just evidence it's upsetting they
[57:31.920 --> 57:36.000]  can do this said grado we were growing cucumbers in the basement because they
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.400]  wouldn't take outside grown lock said he was searched in 09 and hit with
[57:42.400 --> 57:45.200]  thousands and fees and repair orders despite never growing marijuana in his
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.200]  home a lawyer will probably be filing his civil suit the next few days he said
[57:49.200 --> 57:55.160]  I'm going to the first step forward he said and then it goes on to describe it
[57:55.160 --> 58:00.320]  right here in the article what's worse inspectors don't even have to find a
[58:00.320 --> 58:04.920]  marijuana if they find what they deem residual evidence such as high mold
[58:04.920 --> 58:11.360]  readings they charge homeowners search fees that's where you pay to be abused
[58:11.360 --> 58:19.000]  and order other expensive repairs if a homeowner doesn't comply their homes are
[58:19.000 --> 58:26.120]  tagged under the bylaw and effectively condemned as unsafe and unusable and I
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.600]  mean oh my god we are in so much trouble and then I've got it out of England

[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:53.800]  rate increase on average last year the city says 80% and they say it's for the
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:59.040]  earth so private companies make a bigger profit by shutting down their
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:05.760]  competition and the city regulates it so you pay more artificially and then says
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:10.920]  it's for the earth that general electric power plants supplying Austin make
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:21.200]  more money I mean it is so outlandishly and nakedly criminal so the toll free
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:30.960]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 what do you think about in

[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:45.880]  more power than you should surveilling you without warrants they come and swap
[1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:50.800]  team your house and when no marijuana is found they bring in house inspectors to
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:55.840]  find leaks or windows that don't have the right caulking and give you fines it's

[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:10.160]  more money because the city's all invested in derivatives and are basically
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:13.360]  bankrupted by design so now they've got to get even more money to give it to the
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:17.400]  bankers that you know control their little criminal criminal city manager
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:21.600]  so they can do that and no amount of squeezing will ever get you enough money

[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:10.280]  says they attract your your power consumption and it says that when once
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:14.640]  they see that your power that you're using too much power that's that's when
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:22.240]  they come to your house and demand inspected here it is grow up bylaw
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:26.280]  programs sound like a bad dream based on provincial legislation they allow
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:31.560]  municipal inspectors to enter homes which what they deem so that they're God now
[1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:36.200]  see no judge no jury no and this is and this is in the US England and Canada
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:39.800]  they're all under common law in Canada as well quote abnormally high
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:45.480]  electricity usage about 93 kilowatts or more a day and look for evidence see
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:50.200]  they look in your house without a warrant for the evidence of illegal
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:55.400]  marijuana grow ops for public safety and what's worse when no marijuana is found
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:04:01.960]  you are always charged for the inspection I'm not loving and of course now
[1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:07.360]  people that have snakes lizards or guinea pigs here's the BBC Bradford

[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:29.720]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones every day we spend at least
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:36.600]  half an hour covering Iran because if there's a war with Iran the different
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:41.880]  possibilities run from bad to worse that's why the last two chairman of the
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:45.760]  Joint Chiefs of Staff have told Israel do not attack Iran that's why the former
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:50.440]  head of Mossad basically got fired a year ago by BB Netanyahu for saying
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:54.600]  don't do it that's why most of his general staff have said don't do it now
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:58.640]  it's now being reported that Netanyahu was the guy two days ago that canceled
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:05.080]  the naval drill and ground drills with the US basically steaming towards a
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:10.000]  confrontation in the trade of Hormuz for the Iranians the Iranians because of
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.920]  their military bases being blown up and their scientists being assassinated have
[1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:17.640]  said okay we'll stop denying that you're engaged in guerrilla warfare and
[1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:20.960]  sabotage against us because our public now knows you're doing it and yeah we
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:24.560]  look weak so we'll just attack your ships if you come back through the
[1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:28.440]  trade of Hormuz which is a wild escalation and the head of their
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:32.680]  parliamentary intelligence arm said we'll attack Tel Aviv in New York and
[1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:37.040]  asymmetrical warfare a huge escalation I didn't just believe the Jerusalem post
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.840]  when I saw that two weeks ago I went to the Iranian news agencies pressed to be
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:45.720]  in others and they did say that so joining us is Ray McGovern to break
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:51.520]  down the huge escalations now here is the Hill newspaper today the US and Iran
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:56.240]  it's closer to military conflict the sanctions are going on which are
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:59.920]  crippling at the end of the month against the gasoline that they import
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:04.080]  they export raw oil they import gas because the West for decades won't let
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:09.280]  them ship in refinery equipment Halliburton gave themselves a waiver in
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:12.160]  the White House where they could sell them some it's what they have is Halliburton
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:16.640]  incredible corruption here by the folks lecturing us on how evil Iran is Ray
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:22.560]  McGovern of course is an army veteran and Vietnam era and also of course a top
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:26.760]  CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior and he's also a political
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:33.240]  activist and writes for a great organization consortium news.com and
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:37.080]  that's the short bio but he's an analyst analyst and he's given a
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:42.920]  stunningly accurate information in the last decade. Ray looking at this we're
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:47.080]  seeing evidence of them not having the naval confrontation but then separately
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:51.360]  we're hearing that on Capitol Hill it's moving closer to confrontation you've
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:56.280]  got the sources both former and current intelligence what is your intel sir on
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:11:02.600]  where we are right now on that doomsday clock. Well Alex I think the big news is
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:07.720]  the cancellation of the very large joint exercises that had been planned for
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:13.200]  the spring with Israel, Israel, the United States. This is a biggie there were
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:19.520]  several thousand US troops already deployed to Israel already there still
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:25.960]  there ready to do this exercise so the the reason why it's been canceled I
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.760]  think Obama has finally been persuaded that he has to put the brakes on
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:37.360]  Israel and its attempts to start something with Iran something that he
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:43.360]  would drag the United States into. Things are very dicey there as you
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:48.520]  probably know the chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey is doing Israel I
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:54.200]  believe tomorrow or Thursday to talk to his opposite numbers. Now what's the
[1:11:54.200 --> 1:12:00.400]  bottom line for me well the bottom line for me still is how seriously a
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:06.200]  Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Ahu Barak how seriously they
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:14.120]  take our president. Do they believe that he would have the courage not to support
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:20.200]  Israeli military were they to provoke or to start some military action against
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:25.240]  Iran or do they think he's a wuss? Pardon the expression that's in the Bronx
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:29.360]  that's what we call a person who would not even stand up for his for his
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:35.720]  sister the worst possible crime. Do they think that they can put their right
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:40.160]  thumb on their nose and wiggle the rest of their figure at the rest of their
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:45.200]  fingers when he tells them please don't build any more settlements or please
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:51.200]  don't attack the US boat to Gaza or well you know they are used to thumbing
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:54.800]  their nose at the president and receiving great applause from our
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:00.680]  standing Congress people every time he comes to address the joint meeting of
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:08.440]  Congress so the the the most important thing is how seriously the Israelis
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:14.560]  take our president when he apparently told Netanyahu on the phone last
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:21.280]  Thursday please please don't start a war against Iran. Do they have to take
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:26.680]  that seriously or in more Israeli fashion could they start something and
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:33.080]  rather than ask for permission or even tell us about it ask for sort of quasi
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:38.760]  forgiveness after the dais cast I don't know but it's getting very very dicey
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:44.960]  there and the president's record in facing into what the Israelis want to
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.760]  do on this or that issue has not been good and so I continue to worry even
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:56.840]  though this sign of the canceled exercise is a very positive sign let me
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:03.320]  just add a footnote here Alex if I'm the president I'm not the
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:08.840]  president but if I were I wouldn't be sending all my officials to Tel Aviv
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:15.000]  you know he sent Panetta last month and now he's sending the head of the armed
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:23.440]  forces the chairman joint chiefs Dempsey I would say look send your head of the
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:29.000]  IDF send your equivalent to the chairman it does look like the United States is
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.920]  being summoned it looks like the tail is wagging the dog yeah it looks like we're
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:41.160]  in in the the role of the person making the entreaty please please don't don't
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:46.680]  do don't do this and I would expect that at least there would be a reciprocal
[1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:50.800]  arrangement if if our Secretary of Defense Panetta is going to go to
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:55.320]  Tel Aviv at least they could ask the head of their armed forces that their
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:00.280]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff equivalent to come here and and you know
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:05.120]  it it really matters what the locale is and if you want to read somebody the
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:11.480]  riot act as to his great credit Admiral Mullen did two years ago when it looked
[1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:16.040]  like the Israelis were about to do what they may be about to do now he went over
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:22.040]  there and he he made a speech as soon as he arrived in Jerusalem and he said you
[1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:29.280]  know what was Iran would be a very very very bad idea and he raised the USS
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:34.960]  Liberty which was unprecedented that's exactly right so you know if if you
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:39.480]  want to underscore how serious the situation is you picked an AV Admiral
[1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:46.000]  who knows about the USS Liberty who knows how easy it is to get into a fighting
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:52.040]  match either deliberately or by accident in a close place like the Persian
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:59.080]  Gulf now Dempsey he doesn't you know the jury is out at Dempsey but the way he
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:04.280]  bubbled up to the top so to speak suggests to me that he's a he's more a
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:11.560]  creature of the the Pentagon system where generals promote other generals
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:17.040]  depending on how often they've been able to avoid being come being involved in
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:22.120]  any controversy let's expand on this ray what changed in the last four or five
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:26.480]  days and I guess it must be face-saving then if reportedly Obama said don't do
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:30.840]  this and then and then now Netanyahu says he cancelled it now as US and
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:34.520]  Israeli papers are reporting what changed I mean I mean from what I've seen
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:39.760]  the Russian foreign minister and the deputy prime minister as you know came
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:44.560]  out and said this is an attack on our national interest which is a signal for
[1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:49.520]  will get involved the Chinese have said we'll get involved is 20% of their oil
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:54.880]  comes out of Iran did that enter into this the fact that Russia and China made
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:59.320]  noises that they're not going to sit on the sidelines well Alex first off I
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:06.000]  would say that the the the word that Netanyahu cancel the exercises is very
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:11.440]  suspect I would I would say that that's a cover story nobody wants to embarrass
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:17.320]  the Israelis even though we do embarrass them by canceling these exercises but
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:22.800]  I'm 99% sure that it was the White House canceled them and they're allowing
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.480]  the Israeli should say oh no no Netanyahu cancel is that because they got
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:29.300]  intel that the Iranians were gonna open up on the ships because that the
[1:17:29.300 --> 1:17:33.560]  Iranians said you've got one warning don't come back through here yeah well
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:39.000]  you know the straight is not all that wide the port that's navigable the
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:44.960]  Iranians can in fact do that I don't think the Iranian government would do
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:51.200]  that deliberately but as I say it's so dicey so iffy and so so susceptible of
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:57.000]  provocation or accident there that any sober mind the general or president
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:02.520]  would try to do something now what I think is was key here was the the
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:08.120]  assassination of that young scientist apparently he was a chemical
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:13.520]  scientist deputy head of that but in Richmond program right yeah now that
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:20.080]  was clearly a Mossad operation everyone pretty much concedes that now and you
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:24.120]  know not only was that pretty heinous I mean have you seen the pictures of the
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:29.600]  of the scientists family and yes you know I mean and the head of the
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:34.680]  spokesman of the Israeli Defense Forces says well I'm not going to shed a tear
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:41.240]  over you know and the bluster and the kind of arrogance that was displayed
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:48.640]  there suggests to me that that was very very really a unilateral Israeli
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:53.560]  operation they have all that capability they don't need that the CIA to help them
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:58.280]  on those kinds of things and so they not only did it but they bragged about it
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:04.600]  it was the fifth one and that they didn't so much as tell Hillary Clinton or
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:08.920]  anybody else they were going to do it right at this very dicey time okay it
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:13.320]  looked very much to everyone who and so that angered the power structure that
[1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:17.720]  they weren't consulted on the escalation yeah I think so I mean when things are
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:22.720]  so so labial as the Germans would say they're so dicey in in the streets in
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:26.600]  the British Persian Gulf you don't want people to do this on their own hook okay
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:32.960]  and have the US automatically blamed for it together with the Israelis so it was
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.040]  then that something very curious happened Alex and this is kind of
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:39.920]  interesting stay there right we're gonna come right back tell us about this on
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:43.560]  the other side okay and you know where all of this is going and again folks
[1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:47.200]  we're not endorsing the Mullahs and the Iranians we are not endorsing what could
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:52.040]  cause World War three and seven dollar or more a gallon gas we're trying to have
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:56.240]  cooler heads prevail here and that's why most the Israeli power structure
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:04.160]  doesn't want to war as well the question is why do others want it folks have you
[1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:07.880]  lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on if
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:11.040]  so this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear
[1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:14.480]  because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power
[1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:19.440]  outages ahead here's why solar power generators are now available from our
[1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:23.640]  friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their emergency

[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:32.120]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:36.040]  produces electricity from the Sun it's like having an electric power plant
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:40.520]  running quietly in your own own whether it's ice storms brownouts or blackouts

[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:13.000]  analyst joins us writes of course for consortium news we also posted info
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:17.160]  wars.com finish your point about the Israelis not checking with the United
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:21.000]  States and you think that's what changed this and then I want to go back to I am
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.400]  seeing more hawkish rhetoric suddenly from the Iranians and I didn't normally
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:30.600]  see that in the past I wanted to ask you why we're seeing some of those
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:36.000]  statements in your view Ray. Okay yeah I was starting to say was a new
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:41.360]  development that has been around for a long time but just had not been released
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:48.920]  or surfaced has to do with the Israelis going around recruiting people in Iran
[1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:56.120]  and other places like that posing as CIA officers it's kind of a false flag
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:25:02.000]  recruitment it's done all the time but it's usually done either with the
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:07.480]  permission of or at least the tacit admission that this happens when you
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:13.880]  use an allies name what the Israelis were doing was trying to recruit
[1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:19.880]  terrorists acknowledged to be terrorists this is Shondor is one group
[1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:25.920]  there in Iran and they were they were posing as CIA case officers now that
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:32.000]  that's been known for for years within the CIA and all of a sudden this week it
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:38.360]  surfaces alright and it surfaces in such a way as to say the CIA professionals are
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:44.160]  really really ticked off at this there is a certain honor among thieves if I
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.640]  can put it that way there is a certain regime that you don't do this to a close
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:54.480]  allies intelligence service and the Israelis are doing it doing it all the
[1:25:54.480 --> 1:26:00.000]  time and especially with respect to Iran to assassinate folks and stuff like
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.240]  that now what I want to pick up on is your earlier question just before we
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:10.600]  went to break Alex where you said well why would anybody want a war okay now
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:17.040]  let me let me be clear here everybody's thinking that the nuclear weapon issue is
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:24.880]  the biggie it's not let me say let me be clear as the president would say all
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:32.520]  right the Israelis in the United States are not primarily motivated by fear of
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:39.200]  a nuclear weapon in Iran's hands okay the Secretary of Defense Sunday before
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:45.360]  last asked himself rhetorically are the Iranians working on a nuclear weapon
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:52.760]  no that's a direct quote okay they aren't so why all this fall to rock well
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:59.120]  it's an election year the top Israeli leaders think they can mousetrap the
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:03.240]  US into doing something that they almost succeeded in getting Bush and Cheney
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:10.320]  to do there's very little risk for them to do that they think okay and they can
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:18.440]  do what the primary objective is regime change okay it reminds me you know it
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:25.560]  reminds me of how Paul Wolfowitz and those neocons used WMD in Iraq anybody
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:29.400]  remember that okay Wolfowitz finally admitted you know when they were
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:34.600]  riding high after they got into Baghdad he finally admitted well WMD oh it's
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:39.160]  just something that we could all agree on bureaucratically and so we use that
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:46.080]  as the reason okay wasn't the real reason so the neonology is apt a nuclear
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:51.000]  weapon development on the part of Iran is not the real reason the real reason is
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:56.840]  regime change and and our leaders are joined at the hip with the Likud
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:01.200]  government in Tel Aviv that's what they want they see an opportunity to do it
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:05.200]  and so they're trying to do it now the best way for them to do it of course is
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:11.320]  to provoke things now let me just pick up on you know piece of McGovern you say
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:14.880]  that they're not they're not worried about a nuclear weapon I say
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:20.080]  definitively no they're not now what's my proof well Pakistan has over a hundred
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:27.480]  yeah but the proof is that when in 2003 the Iranians came to us and they said
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:31.400]  look we're prepared to negotiate everything even on nuclear development
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:37.080]  program we know that we're entitled to develop nuclear energy for energy but
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:40.840]  we'll negotiate the whole thing John Belton who is at the State Department
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:46.440]  at that point turn them down sit and go you know go somewhere okay then what
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:54.000]  happens well in a couple years later the Iranians are running low on the 20%
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:59.480]  enriched fuel that they need to power their their medical nuclear reactor okay
[1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:04.800]  and so there's a there's a sort of a juncture there where they need to refine
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:09.800]  this to 20% all they can do now is just to the for the energy for the
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:15.240]  electrical energy I think it's less than 5% so what do they do well a proposal
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:19.920]  is made by the United States government and by the Europeans and you know by
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:24.240]  anybody who wants to put the Iranians in a bad light and they say all right look
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:30.600]  give us two-thirds of your low-enriched uranium and we'll have it processed out
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:35.360]  in Russia or France or Turkey and we'll get one right we got to go to break this
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:38.400]  was a short somewhere to come back with about five more minutes with you finish
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:42.720]  that point recap it then I want to ask you why are so many experts saying don't
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:47.160]  have a war I want you to break down what could happen in this war straight ahead
[1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:55.080]  with Ray McGovern we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:38.920]  republic back from the big six megabank special interest that have
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:43.800]  overthrown our republic and are trying to now institute their police state but
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:48.200]  it's one thing to pass laws saying they can secretly arrest citizens and that
[1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:51.840]  was disappeared a black hole and use the military against us it's another thing
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:55.840]  to actually implement it and before Ray leaves us here in a few minutes I did
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:33:59.560]  want to raise that point to him something something I haven't talked to him
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:05.120]  about in the last few months that we've interviewed him but Ray getting back to
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:09.720]  your point about the Iranians before Ahmadinejid came along they were ready
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:14.200]  to deal they had inspectors everywhere they they're like here will give you our
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:19.720]  uranium you know that's you can make sure it's non weapons grade we're having
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:24.520]  to import most of our gasoline we need power we're ready to do whatever we want
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:29.760]  to come in out of the dark like like Libya did and you see how Libya got
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:34.360]  treated you see what happened to Mubarak I mean the point is is that we all know
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:38.400]  what happened but for those that don't know finish up what happened there right
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:44.080]  well not maybe not many people know this Alex that's why I would like to just
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:48.720]  mention what happened you know when people say well McGovern how do you know
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:53.440]  that the Israelis were really aren't interested in that really not afraid of
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:59.320]  this nuclear program and why is the US you know in luck step with them well the
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:04.280]  proof is in the pudding you know a low-enriched uranium which is all that
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:10.920]  Iran has right now needs to be refined to a much higher degree 90% to make it
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:16.960]  suitable for a nuclear weapon now still that's the material that's what they use
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:24.720]  okay now on October 1st 2009 the Iranians shocked everyone you know what
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:30.560]  they said they said that they would agree to send as much as 75% of its low
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:35.880]  enriched uranium abroad to be turned into fuel for this medical reactor that I
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:40.800]  talked about before now the New York Times which is always have a very
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:46.360]  Zionist bent even the Times acknowledged it said quote if this happens this would
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:51.000]  represent a major accomplishment for the West reducing Iran's ability to make a
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  nuclear weapon quickly so they worked it out in in Geneva here and they're going
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:04.800]  back to to Vienna to do the detail work okay now what happens a day before
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:12.000]  they're going back to Vienna well Vienna was to happen on October 19th 2009
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:19.800]  on October 18th this terrorist organization for whom the Israelis recruited
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:25.640]  folks with the pretext that they were US case officers they detonated a car
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:30.000]  bomb at a beating of top Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders and
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:36.760]  kill five of them five Brigadier Generals okay now what do you suppose the
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:41.040]  the military and the Revolutionary Guards did they went to their the
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:44.600]  Supreme Leader who was their patron and said you're gonna negotiate with these
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:49.520]  guys you're gonna you're gonna trust them to send out three-quarters of your
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:53.760]  low-enriched you come and give me a break and so that was the next day they
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:58.560]  didn't send their top negotiator they sent a lower-level guy they still wanted
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:04.360]  to do a deal but the strength of the opposition in in Iran to dealing with
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:10.160]  folks like this spike the deal and the US wasn't interested in it either now
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:15.280]  fast forward at the year and you have the Brazilians and the Turks the Prime
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:19.800]  Minister of Turkey and the president of Brazil working out an agreement this time
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:23.440]  not for three-quarters of their low-enriched uranium but for half of
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:27.480]  it to be shipped out of the country out of their control and refined for their
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:32.840]  medical reactor it's what happens when they agree on this within hours Hilary
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:36.560]  Clinton gets up at the White House and she says this is our answer this is her
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:41.000]  words this is our answer to that we're gonna go to more and more sanctions
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.520]  we're gonna cripple the economy of Iran so Iran is on record everything you
[1:37:45.520 --> 1:37:49.240]  said is on record but it never talked about on the news it's a footnote they
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:53.760]  have done nothing but try to actually follow the orders of the quarter
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.520]  national community but the system wants war with Iran so that leads us to we
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:03.800]  only had a few minutes left here with Iran you've got to go we know that the
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:07.440]  politicians want war as a political distraction at least some of them with
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:11.040]  all the domestic things that are happening but why are so many top generals
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.080]  in the former head of the Mossad and others saying don't do it well because
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:20.840]  it would be suicide now you know the results the effects of all this not
[1:38:20.840 --> 1:38:28.440]  only on the world economy but on various places like like Gaza and Lebanon
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:34.480]  where where people could be put into action to shoot rockets at Israel that
[1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:39.840]  kind of stuff the effects would be be terrible but the worst effect and the
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:45.040]  reason that the head of Mossad the previously just retired head of Mossad
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:51.440]  the Israeli CIA reason he said what he said was because he also said that this
[1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:57.800]  war would result in the destruction of Israel wow yeah he said that I know that
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:01.040]  because I said that at an interview and then I said to myself my government did
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:05.320]  you really say that and I looked up then sure enough they're there too later I
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:11.280]  realized that Dagan the former Mossad director had said that it's it's beyond
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:14.600]  the point where Israel can do this kind of thing he also called it a
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:17.920]  catastrophe he said it would be a regional catastrophe yeah and he also
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:21.240]  said it would be the stupidest thing in the world which he's absolutely right
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:26.040]  about now the neocons the people running our policy with even with Obama
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.800]  they're hanging around they have great difficulty distinguishing between the
[1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.760]  strategic interests of Israel on the one hand and the strategic interests of
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.120]  the United States and the other but in this case they should be coincident
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:43.560]  they should be identical I want to preserve the state of Israel I don't
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:47.760]  like its behavior but I don't want it I don't want it destroyed that's what
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:53.000]  would end up here and that's perhaps why the Dagan felt forced to speak out
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  because nobody else was saying that in the Israeli body body well it's going to
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.720]  unify that entire region against Israel and in Israel's already lost its world
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:07.640]  view as the little guy being picked on and it would definitely be billed as
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:14.360]  the villain and world sympathy would completely evaporate and I saw a
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:17.960]  Washington Times interview with folks that are in contact with Netanyahu and
[1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:22.400]  they say that he believes it'll be such a big war that the West will be forced to
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:27.840]  defeat Iran and then out of that he'll be seen as Churchill or something and I
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:32.840]  just don't think that he's right about that it's a big role of the dice Alex
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:37.640]  it's a very big role of the dice and we should do everything we can to prevent
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:42.080]  that dice from being rolled because how do Russia and China tie into that that's
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:45.880]  a very good question now Russia is becoming much and much more vocal and
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:51.120]  saying look your eyes right on our southern frontier pretty much and we
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:55.360]  don't like this kind of thing even the possibility that nuclear weapons might
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:01.520]  be employed besides you should leave Iran alone now Russia has a big stake in
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:07.960]  Iran there's an economic stake there and China has an even bigger stake so I
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:12.880]  fully expect that the Russians and the Chinese are very very strong in their
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:18.440]  protestations about all this stuff and I think that may be as much as as this
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.680]  freelance terrorism that is being conducted by Israel within Iran without
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.520]  so much as a buyer leave to us I think both of those factors may have been
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:32.880]  enough to persuade the president that he's got it you got to say pretty please
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:36.920]  don't do it anymore and again I come back to the bottom line is Netanyahu
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:41.760]  gonna this gonna settle for pretty please or does he think that he has the
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:46.080]  high cards he has Congress he has our press here in this country those are
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:50.360]  pretty high cards I think he's tempted to do it anyway so it may happen anyway
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.120]  and we'll continue to watch that in closing I want to ask you about NDAA
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:57.960]  but what about what about Ron Paul I mean I hear it all over neocon radio I
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:01.680]  see it all over the news he's crazy he doesn't want to attack Iran and I guess
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:05.880]  the system's counting on the public's ignorance because most of the joint chiefs
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:11.720]  the last two chairman top Israelis the former Mossad head I mean most I'd say
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:16.280]  9 out of 10 analysts that I've talked to out there say it's crazy to do this don't do it
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:22.640]  so so I mean Ron Paul is really in the sane camp when it comes to foreign
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:28.200]  policy but because people that want war are in such control of the media they're
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:32.440]  able to create that illusion with some of the general public that it's crazy to
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:38.680]  not want a new war that's exactly right Ron Paul has it exactly right and I
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:43.400]  admire him greatly for speaking out the way he has been despite the derision on
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:48.360]  part of the press the press is no longer a free press in this country and
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:53.200]  having been having been in Washington 50 years I've seen a lot of change but the
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:57.880]  biggest change is that we no longer have in any real sense of free press it's
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:01.920]  it's dominated by people who do the bidding of the corporations there's lots
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:06.120]  of money to be made but from war in the Middle East and there's lots of money to
[1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:10.560]  be made by being being a strong supporter of Israel whatever the
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:14.920]  consequences so when Ron Paul gets up and tells it like it is that this is
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:20.480]  crazy what do you want you want to know the war yeah what is this war lust he's
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:25.000]  exactly right it makes no sense and I hope he begins to make a dent on the
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:28.240]  public opinion of this car we've only got about a minute and a half left here
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:33.040]  isn't even an appointment in DAA all these preparations for civil unrest
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:37.080]  secret arrest of citizens I think this is really starting to wake people up
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:41.640]  what's your view on NDA and why Obama said he wouldn't sign it but then signed
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:49.320]  it I think it's the corporate interests and the leadership of our our Congress
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:54.840]  and the White House you know what Alex they're afraid they're afraid of us
[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:59.560]  they're afraid of occupy Washington and occupy these other cities they don't
[1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:03.600]  know what to do and what they're really afraid is that if they call the Capitol
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:08.040]  Police or the Secret Service or the district police they might realize
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:13.080]  they're part of the 99% and so what do they do well they want to be able to call
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:18.360]  on the army the army can be to can be expected to follow waters and it's sort
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:24.000]  of like an insurance policy and you and I are now liable for things that since
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.520]  the Constitution was written we never would have been liable before and it's
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:33.720]  just an incredibly atrocious situation I'm glad that Chris Hedges is suing the
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:41.280]  president over this because he is a traitor he is a traitor in in just
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:47.120]  presending from his oath of office where he swore as I did as an army officer to
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:52.000]  to support and protect the Constitution the United States from all
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:57.120]  enemies foreign and domestic well you served five presidents or was it for
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:02.240]  you I've never heard you call a president a a a a traitor and undoubtedly is and
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:06.600]  by the way I'd like to get Chris Hedges on I believe you know him if you've got
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:09.840]  any contact info we've been trying to email them in I have the right one I
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:13.200]  want to get Chris Hedges on we have an article about it today journalist who's
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:18.600]  Obama over an indefinite detention law Ray McGovern thank you so much for
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:22.280]  spending time with us and we're glad you're out there a voice for sanity your
[1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:28.840]  most welcome Alex thank you so much sir all right there there he goes look you
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:33.440]  hurting I mean I'm not an enemy of Israel I don't want to see you know bad
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:39.160]  things happen to any country but when the majority of Israelis and Poles don't
[1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:43.840]  want this war and most of the military brass says don't do it I mean that's
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:52.260]  when you know it's bad I mean it is it is bad news and as the world goes
[1:45:52.260 --> 1:45:55.920]  into this economic implosion you're going to see more and more pressure for
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:45:59.920]  wars because these mega corporations make money off of it while all of our
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:03.920]  nations basically lose and they get to take more of our rights and freedoms
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:07.760]  they get to stage terror attacks and then say Iran did it or Iran might
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:12.040]  actually respond you know that that was so creepy about Santorum saying kill
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:16.560]  Iranians bomb them blow them up assassinate people what is Santorum
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:20.080]  going to do the Iranians do come over here and start killing people oh how
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:24.640]  dare them blow something up or kill military people or kill scientists
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:31.560]  that's terrorism well it's terrorism when that's being done to Iran I mean you
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:37.680]  you can't say the bad guys torture but then we torture where the good guys or
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:42.560]  you can't say in foreign countries they secretly arrest people well here we put
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:51.000]  it on paper again reality doesn't line up to what the special interest are
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:54.440]  saying and doing I got a bunch of other news we've got an amazing interview
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.680]  coming up in the next hour with a woman who had the state police come after if
[1:46:58.680 --> 1:47:00.920]  we're not vaccinating her two and a half year old daughter she's a very

[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:09.800]  bunch of clips here we're gonna expose the hoax that's the law you gotta take
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:15.760]  at least vaccines I'm gonna go to Alice Tim Gus J Michael and others Alice in
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:21.260]  Texas thanks for holding her on the year hi Alex I'm a big fan I've been a
[1:47:21.260 --> 1:47:26.640]  subscriber for seven years at least and I've been sitting here every day
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:31.920]  lately looking at the the present planet TV screen looking at that link to
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:38.000]  your flow kill Holocaust story and I wanted to make a point that I don't
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:42.880]  think has emerged in recent days as you've been talking about the importance
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:48.920]  of Americans supplementing their diet with proper nutrients because the food
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:55.480]  no longer has it in it and you can't possibly be healthy and of normal way
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.240]  unless you do oh listen I was always wondering why I was hungry hungry hungry
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:04.160]  and it's because the vitamins I was taking weren't liquid weren't powder so
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:06.760]  I wasn't absorbing enough I never really took them regularly because they didn't
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:10.360]  have much of an effect now that I actually take you know minerals and
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:15.640]  vitamins every day that I can absorb I'm not as I mean my hunger is cutting
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:20.360]  like half so of course the weights just pouring off me sorry go ahead that's
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:26.120]  that's about half of it I did an enormous amount of research several years
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:33.160]  ago when it suddenly dawned on me I'm 66 years old when I was a kid nobody was
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:38.000]  fat nobody was fat I mean there just weren't fat people and people ate big
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.840]  old chicken fried steaks and everything else we when I was a teenager we ate
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:49.120]  hamburgers and fries and milkshakes and all the same general food groups that
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:54.800]  people eat today but then it began to dawn on me and I came up with a
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:49:00.960]  hypothesis I said they've done something to the food and I spent two years
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:07.320]  researching this and I came to the conclusion that if you eat at the trough
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:15.600]  of big food because of ingredients they have put into the food supply that were
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:21.440]  not there when I was growing up you are gonna be fat and then you're gonna get
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:26.840]  sick and then you're gonna end up in the clutches of big farmer ma'am let me
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:30.720]  stop you you're absolutely it's on record 50 plus years ago they started
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:33.680]  putting the bistri in all A and all the plastic linings and products and
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:39.000]  newspaper print on record to sterilize and reduce fertility it causes obesity
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.400]  it increases cancer and then it's all the other additives and things and you're
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:47.240]  absolutely right I've looked at studies on it I mean when my dad was a kid I
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:53.400]  mean the meals were giant four or five fried eggs hash browns sausage everything
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:57.800]  at dinner you know chicken fried steak four or five vegetables grease
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.560]  everywhere and none of them were fat it's because it was real food even though
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:08.040]  it was quote unhealthy it's the additives all of it on record totally screws you
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:11.200]  up and makes you obese and unhealthy and that's what you're saying you found
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:18.080]  from your research I lost 80 pounds by making a food rule that if I couldn't
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:24.520]  have eaten it in 1960 I won't eat it today that means no high fructose corn
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:29.960]  syrup which by the way is a seriously bad thing for your body it fries your
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:37.720]  pancreas it manipulates liver function that's on record absolutely no aspartame
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:44.800]  or other artificial sweeteners and no monosodium glutamate and the other names
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:51.760]  it appears under because MSG has the same function in food that those clever
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:56.920]  I tell you what Alice you're on fire I want to come back to you and I'll get
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:02.120]  to everybody else too but I don't hear more from Alice did you ever think you'd

[1:54:12.040 --> 1:54:14.960]  ingredients list and all these petrochemicals and things that they're
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:22.360]  adding not eating it that's what we do at my house and now I'm getting the
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:26.600]  vitamins and minerals and nutrients I need and I've lost over 30 pounds in six
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:31.040]  weeks and just feel awesome my wife had already been healthy you know for the
[1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:35.320]  children herself I over the years have gotten very unhealthy just not caring
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:40.560]  about myself but I've started to turn that around with God's help but this is
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:46.000]  done by design I mean they're legally allowed because they got a law passed to
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:51.160]  add silicone to the foaming agent in most of the fried products that you get
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:54.120]  at the stores everyone I first heard that about five six years ago go that
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:59.440]  can't be true I searched it there was CNN even reporting it I mean no wonder
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:08.320]  organs are failing no wonder the Japanese government in World War I they
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:13.080]  were involved on the US side then this is all part of the record you know look
[1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:17.320]  up the history of MSG they were feeding basically rotten food to the troops and
[1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:21.160]  they found that they put MSG on it they still eat it it'll make a rotten rat
[1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:26.880]  tastes like pumpkin pie and it's an excitotoxin very addictive and it's in
[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:30.000]  hundreds and hundreds well thousands really of things but I'm gonna go to
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:34.560]  other callers but Alice anything else you wanted to add for people I just I
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:39.480]  just wanted to make the comment that that that Americans were appalled when
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:44.320]  they learned that the scientists had figured out how to make cigarettes even
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:50.640]  more addictive by adding chemicals to them yet we have sat by and allowed them
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:57.640]  to add chemicals to our food yeah set up the very same addiction cycle in the
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:02.960]  brain why do people continue to buy this quid and by the way that's not your
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:06.520]  opinion we've got Dr. Blalock top neuroscientist brain surgeon tomorrow

[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:15.280]  mainline science and have been adopted and now they know that all these things
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:19.520]  are addictive these companies they knew aspartame was addictive many most
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:25.400]  poisons are actually addictive I appreciate your call it's so incredible
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:30.440]  once you learn the truth it's so unbelievable that the system wants to

[1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:57.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:58:57.640 --> 1:59:01.680]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:59:01.680 --> 1:59:05.560]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.560]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:13.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[1:59:13.960 --> 1:59:18.120]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:21.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:25.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:29.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:59:29.920 --> 1:59:33.080]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:59:33.080 --> 1:59:36.760]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:42.280]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:59:42.280 --> 1:59:47.080]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:52.040]  1-877-327-0365
[1:59:52.040 --> 2:00:06.480]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:13.840]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's

[2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:51.760]  Gus J. Michael we'll get to everybody today Tim you're on the air
[2:00:51.760 --> 2:01:02.160]  hello Alex yes sir yeah I live in Reno Nevada I do poker it's amazing how many
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:06.480]  people I deal with that are just complete fluoride heads having no idea what's
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:09.960]  going on no they are chemical warfare victims I mean we're not joking about
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:13.520]  that people say how do we go from being land-free home of the brave to being so
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:18.760]  domesticated because they jacked the food and water well I go to work yesterday
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:23.600]  they owe me a few bucks and I worked for a black man who's my boss and oh Tim
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:26.320]  watch this in the game you know let's get this game going so I sit down and
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:30.400]  play poker and they love seeing and they love it there at my job so they're
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:33.720]  watching and my boss looks up at the TV and it goes 40% of the people in
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:38.560]  prison are black and he he says it's not loud and that's just one of my depth
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:42.520]  he was about that and I just I just go off I just say you know you know they fly
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:47.720]  the drugs to the country the CIA does and you know that is to get a poor people
[2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:51.680]  addicted to the drugs so they can lock them up in privately owned prisons so
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:56.280]  they can get through I don't know I thought it was $300 a day for each
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:01.440]  prisoner in prison and have you do slave labor for 25 cents an hour that they
[2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:05.360]  don't pay somebody $15 on the outside to do and he looked at me like I was
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:09.480]  mainly in like you never heard this before oh I know but people love to get
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:14.280]  obsessed over like petty race stuff how somebody looks at them or a name when
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:19.320]  meanwhile the system it's been proven if you're black and caught with drugs on
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:26.040]  generally you serve 10 times more of sentence than if you're white and and
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:30.920]  Ron Paul brings that up and but again black leaders won't talk about that or
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:36.720]  because again the people peddling all this race stuff and acting like they're
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:41.440]  liberal they're distracting quote minorities with the real issues the
[2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:46.280]  real discrimination is mega banks robbing us all with most of our tax
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:51.400]  money going out of banker bailouts I mean isn't that discriminatory or no bid
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:54.440]  contracts you know going to these mega corporations and not going to small
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:58.720]  businesses isn't that discrimination but it's like people can't notice the real
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:03.440]  discrimination going on it's all got to be about race do you see what I'm saying
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:08.800]  exactly you know I wear my 9-11 sure you know I could play poker maybe once a
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:12.960]  week around town I wear my 9-11 shirt around town and nobody ever wants to
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:16.480]  engage you intellectually on a debate they just want to mock you and make
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:21.040]  front of you and that's why I mean you guys are so great at waking people up
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:25.840]  I personally have given up on those kind of people I just can't talk to them well
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:30.200]  look about half the population is in a zombie mode and you're not going to get
[2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:35.640]  to them but you will run into people out there that I'd imagine if you're wearing
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:39.640]  a 9-11 inside job shirt I'd imagine on the street and at supermarkets and
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:45.200]  stuff you run into people that agree with you haven't you also you know I
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:48.800]  work you know there's a few people that I've actually you know hope waking up
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:52.520]  they come to me and they're excited you know say 10 to hear about this or hear
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:57.000]  about that and that's and that's great and I and I love that but it's the
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.960]  people who you know our other heads buried in their cell phone playing
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:04.560]  Angry Birds and all they want to do is mock you because you're trying to tell
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:08.040]  them that but you understand they're in a trance because I've run into those
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:12.840]  people and when they're men they're always very unmale very very soft and
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:18.480]  they smile at you the twinkle like it's cute that they don't care and it's cute
[2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:22.440]  that they're into being slaves and it's cute that they're hubris filled and
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:27.880]  arrogant and and now there's this move to be slovenly and wear pajamas to the
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:33.000]  store and and just have no respect for yourself and look it's a society on the
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:39.360]  verge of collapse it always happens decadence slimy behavior crime it's
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:43.880]  always an indicator of a society about to collapse and we're here just trying to
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:49.160]  get dug in and ready for it because in the collapse you think people are waking
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:53.880]  up now when it gets a lot worse huh I mean people are going to be listening to
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:58.400]  us more than ever so we've got to get out as much info as we can today well

[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:10.520]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:05:10.520 --> 2:05:14.480]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:18.320]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:23.280]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:28.560]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:05:28.560 --> 2:05:33.200]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:37.400]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:42.320]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[2:05:42.320 --> 2:05:47.040]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:10.800]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:14.760]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[2:06:14.760 --> 2:06:19.200]  turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really
[2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:24.000]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:28.360]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:33.640]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:06:33.640 --> 2:06:37.960]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[2:06:37.960 --> 2:06:41.440]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:46.680]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[2:07:03.680 --> 2:07:07.800]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:10.920]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:14.560]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:18.400]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:21.960]  our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:27.440]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:31.480]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:35.480]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:39.560]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:44.720]  survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at
[2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:55.480]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[2:07:55.480 --> 2:08:01.640]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:07.400]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[2:08:07.400 --> 2:08:14.120]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:21.280]  all right for the next 35 minutes or so we are joined by a mother a
[2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:27.400]  professional woman in Pennsylvania who has been at the pediatrician many times
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:31.680]  but took her daughter two and a half years old to the pediatrician and the
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:37.560]  pediatrician for an hour pressured her to get give her all these vaccines and
[2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:40.200]  there's new ones all the time that they're coming out with and trying to
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:46.200]  mandate mandate means we push it on you not that it's the law but now for the
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:50.560]  first time ever we can pull articles up on this later California did pass the
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:58.200]  law last year that they give your child vaccines without your consent now they
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:09:02.100]  claim the child can give consent now well if children could do that there
[2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:05.280]  wouldn't be statutory rape they're saying they'll give 11 year old shots in
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:10.600]  California and this is the new model oh you're 11 you want an abortion sure
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:14.000]  mommy doesn't need to know you want a shot now if you want to go to the zoo on
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.400]  a field trip you got to get this letter signed but if you want us to do a
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:22.920]  medical procedure well then don't don't tell mommy this is the state trying to
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:27.320]  destroy parents control now I want to go to a few video clips before we go
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:33.200]  to Rachel Garmin our guest who joins us via video Skype for radio listeners you
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:39.240]  can go watch the video if you'd like archived at prisonplanet.tv but we're
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:42.960]  gonna go to her here in a few minutes but I thought I would just show you a
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:48.240]  newscast from about six months ago this is about two months before they finally
[2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:53.960]  signed the law saying we will shoot your kid up with whatever the vaccine
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:57.560]  company lobbies government to try to force on you without you knowing and
[2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:02.400]  and we also have the news reports for now the Centers for Disease Control and
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:06.800]  Department of Health federally Health and Human Services is going door to
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:10.360]  door all over the country but first mailing letters saying tell us about
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:14.520]  your child's vaccines then you report on yourself which is a violation of your
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:20.040]  Fifth Amendment and then they show up but Rachel's case is important because
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:24.240]  she had been gone out of town this weekend she was there last Friday and
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:28.640]  twice the state police came to her house and left a note on the door we have
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:32.200]  that note but we're busy right now blacking out the state troopers names
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:36.920]  and things she wants to be nice to them and we have the doctor's name we have
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:40.160]  the doctor's voicemail back to her because when she called him and said
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:43.520]  why are the police coming to my house the doctor called back and said I don't
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:46.960]  know what you're talking about honey and every time they do something like this
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:51.040]  they always want to act like they haven't done anything to you so they're
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:55.040]  now running a hoax coast to coast and here's what I'm exposing that it's the
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:10:58.120]  law you got to take vaccines we're gonna show you some of these news clips in a
[2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:04.360]  moment but every year here in Austin and when I'm in traveling in August and
[2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:09.120]  other cities I see the exact same newscast it's the law you'll go to jail
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:13.560]  if you aren't vaccinated and I had the Maryland state attorney on like five
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:18.680]  six years ago was on CNN showed darking police dogs and checkpoints and the
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:23.400]  families thousands of children brought to the park by the courthouse to be
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:27.520]  forcibly inoculated and people crying I don't want it the parents believed it was
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:32.240]  the law and I got the state attorney on and I said it's the law that you're
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:35.480]  saying it's a regulation a mandates you'll kick him out of school if they
[2:11:35.480 --> 2:11:39.200]  haven't had it but you really can't order him to take the vaccine because
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:42.840]  that's not the law you're just misapplying truancy laws and kicking
[2:11:42.840 --> 2:11:47.040]  him out and then triggering criminal penalties fraudulently and he said boy
[2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:50.200]  you ought to be a lawyer absolutely right my kids don't take it and started
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:56.160]  laughing like it's cute to manipulate the public like it's cute to falsely
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:00.280]  threaten to charge people they do take children for not being vaccinated no
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:04.480]  there's no law they do arrest parents who don't vaccinate the parents don't
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:08.680]  know they can't kick your child out for something that isn't the law when they
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:12.240]  know there's a regulation there's a waiver to it and then they kick your
[2:12:12.240 --> 2:12:18.080]  child out and then sick the police on you it's official imprisonment false
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:24.920]  arrest it's forcing medical procedures on people through fraud it's racketeering
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:32.040]  it's a serious crime and the media runs this hoax every year every year that
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:39.240]  it's the law that you must take vaccines and that you will be jailed if you don't
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:43.800]  the Austin American statesman runs articles local radio TV where I live
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:48.440]  and you know in your area you see it and they have the mass injections at City
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:53.400]  Coliseums at Zilker Park here in Austin and the parents are on the news going I
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:12:57.080]  don't like these shots and don't trust them but I don't want to go to jail and
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:02.800]  the media just plays along with it well now in Alabama and other areas remember
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:06.640]  the H1N1 we had newscast they were accidentally shooting up the whole class
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:12.760]  without parental consent this is incredible so here's California going to
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:18.440]  your door with a bureaucrat and saying I'm coming in to give him a shot no judge
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:24.160]  no jury no warrant no law just I'm coming in to give him the shot I'm coming
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:30.040]  in let's go ahead and go to this clips you understand the magnitude of this the
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:35.000]  police are coming to your door folks here it is up in the news drastic measures
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:38.840]  to make sure every student is vaccinated into Thomas school officials went
[2:13:38.840 --> 2:13:44.000]  door-to-door with a nurse offering the TDAP vaccine to meet a new state mandate
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.040]  hello how are you ma'am my name is Heyman Matlock with the Thomas Unified
[2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:51.800]  School District it's not easy going door-to-door making sure students are
[2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:57.040]  vaccinated your daughter is on independent study yeah Kayla has she
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:02.760]  been verified with her TDAP no okay we were coming today to give her a TDAP if
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:14.760]  she hasn't had it done yet you've got a mass hoax in front of everyone where
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:18.560]  they're acting like they're the good guys coming saying we're gonna give you
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:21.400]  shots outside of law and we're going to our guests here in a moment but I want
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:27.000]  to preface all this for new listeners to understand the magnitude of this fraud
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.360]  they'll tell you in public school because they're getting federal kickbacks it's
[2:14:30.360 --> 2:14:33.360]  the law you got to take it until you say I know you got a waiver right there and
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:36.920]  it's not even a waiver to a law it's just a waiver for your regulations give it
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:40.400]  to me but the courts of rule you don't have to fill that out because you then
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:44.640]  sign the form and basically say you're a bad parent which they then try to use
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:49.640]  with CPS to take your kids and that's what this doctor did to our guests we'll
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:53.360]  go to another clip of that in a moment where they're talking about injecting
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:57.840]  kids without parental consent on CNN and Fox those clips are coming up to let
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:02.560]  you know how serious this medical tyranny is but Rachel Garmin joins us
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:09.520]  from Pennsylvania and I appreciate this sports and wellness director of a major
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:15.040]  institution I'll just leave it at that joining us nice lady to tell us what
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.280]  happened to her because these reports are now pouring in under a federal mandate
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:25.560]  federalizing your doctors your local police Rachel thank you for coming on
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:30.560]  with us today thanks for having me I start from the beginning tell folks you
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:33.280]  know basically what happened to you in the doctor's office what they tried to
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:40.480]  make you sign and then the state police okay on January the 6th I took my son
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:47.080]  to a pediatrician here in town your son excuse me not daughter yeah he was two
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:51.640]  and a half years old and he hasn't had any vaccinations and I took him in for a
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:57.840]  well-checkup and everything was going fine I came into the office I told them
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:03.040]  my son was a new patient I provided them with his insurance card as well as his
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:07.720]  social security card they gave you some paperwork I filled out all the paperwork
[2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:13.400]  including release of medical forms for any previous doctors that he's ever been
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  to went in had the appointment with the doctor everything was going great she
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:25.840]  said you know he seemed like a really healthy well-developed child and then
[2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:29.760]  she asked me for his immunization record and I looked her in her eyes and told
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:33.920]  her that he has not received any immunizations and that was a choice
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:40.720]  that my husband and I had made and from there things went kind of downhill you
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:45.360]  know of course she tried to talk me into the vaccinations she told me about how
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:51.240]  you know these different outbreaks have occurred and went on and on and on and
[2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:55.500]  you know and I again just like took my stand and just said you know this is
[2:16:55.500 --> 2:16:59.600]  just the decision that we've made and I said you know I've done a lot of
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:04.560]  research on this you know if there's any kind of new findings or new research
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:08.080]  out there that I should look into you know I'm willing to take a look into new
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:13.040]  research I research all the time so you know I felt like I was being pretty
[2:17:13.040 --> 2:17:18.800]  open you know we finished up the appointment I mean we were seemed like
[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:22.800]  we were having pretty good conversation you know she told me about how she had
[2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:26.920]  gone to Africa and medical missions trips and I'd been to Africa before too so
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:33.760]  you know I thought things were okay and I left the office and I had refused to
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:39.880]  sign the the APA it's like a disclosure statement or something of that nature
[2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:45.320]  saying that you know I understand that not giving my child vaccinations could
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:49.640]  put them at harm for fatal disease or something that's basically saying you
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:52.960]  agree you're a witch it should be burned at the stake I mean they're getting you
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:57.120]  to say I'm a bad parent I'm endangering my child when the statistics are out
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:00.640]  there the vaccines overall are more dangerous than all these supposed
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:04.440]  diseases out there and they know that you know they won't tell people what's on
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:08.200]  those inserts it's kind of like TSA telling their own employees oh there's
[2:18:08.200 --> 2:18:12.160]  no radiation from these scanners and then they get caught lying I mean it's all
[2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:16.880]  part of this American Medical Association propaganda so when you sign
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:22.320]  that they then use that to try to sick the CPS on you by you agreeing that
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:28.120]  you're a bad parent yeah so I had done my research about that and I you know I
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:32.560]  knew that I didn't want to sign that so I told her that I wasn't going to sign
[2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:38.880]  it again I left the office thought everything was okay went back to work
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:44.280]  went to my sister's house for the weekend and when I got home on Sunday
[2:18:44.280 --> 2:18:50.600]  evening I had two notes on my door from a state trooper asking that I call her
[2:18:50.600 --> 2:18:56.600]  immediately so I tried to call of course she wasn't on duty at you know 9 30 at
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:03.120]  night so I had to wait till the following day I got her on the telephone and you
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:08.040]  know the state trooper she was she was decent about the whole situation she
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:12.840]  said you know this is really minor but whenever I get a call like this I do
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:18.600]  have to look into it so you know you were at the pediatrician on Friday correct
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:23.160]  and I said yes and she said well we received a phone call that you refused
[2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:29.760]  to show your ID and that you were acting strangely and I proceeded to tell the
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:36.400]  state trooper that I had never been asked for my ID and I wasn't acting
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:41.760]  strangely I said what happened was I refused to give my child vaccinations
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:49.280]  and I refused to sign the APA's form and I'm assuming that's why the pediatrician
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:53.240]  called the police let's stop right there in America you go in thought all the
[2:19:53.240 --> 2:19:56.600]  forms they know your name where you're at and ever asked for an ID when you go
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:01.280]  into the doctor and then they call the police on you and we're showing a letter
[2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:06.320]  on screen right now one of the two notes will show the second one that where the
[2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:10.440]  trooper comes to your house because you're acting strangely like the secret
[2:20:10.440 --> 2:20:16.080]  police the thought police to want to know why you were acting strangely I mean
[2:20:16.080 --> 2:20:20.560]  just amazing so it's all this color of law intimidation just like the
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:24.080]  California newscast where they're saying we're gonna come on in and give you
[2:20:24.080 --> 2:20:30.120]  that shot now outside of law just trying to bluff their way in I mean I mean did
[2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:33.040]  you I mean I understand you're a nice lady and you were friendly to the state
[2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:38.120]  trooper but you were like you know well okay I didn't I mean why why are you
[2:20:38.120 --> 2:20:42.960]  coming to my house I was very offended and I told the state trooper that I was
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:50.960]  highly offended I I mean I was all I was really shocked I guess I shouldn't be you
[2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:56.240]  know in the day and age that we live but I felt that my rights as a parent were
[2:20:56.240 --> 2:21:03.560]  violated I felt like my privacy was violated I just I felt very violated by
[2:21:03.560 --> 2:21:10.800]  the whole situation well look this doctor and of course you told me I don't
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:14.920]  know why I got it my head it was a daughter of a son you know had been to
[2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:18.760]  pediatricians before I guess you're going to a new pediatrician and there
[2:21:18.760 --> 2:21:22.280]  never been an issue I mean I've been at the hospital and had three children and
[2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:25.600]  I sit there and have discussions with the nurses going we don't vaccinate
[2:21:25.600 --> 2:21:33.240]  either you know a nurse in Ward R got paralyzed one of my crew members his
[2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:39.120]  wife is a RN and and she she talked about one lady they work with is
[2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:43.560]  completely paralyzed in a wheelchair a young beautiful woman paralyzed other
[2:21:43.560 --> 2:21:49.920]  people just in one hospital the nurses having Gion berets convulsions I mean
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:55.200]  it's on the insert the H1N1 you pull up countless articles caused a tenfold
[2:21:55.200 --> 2:22:00.320]  increase in England in neurological disorders didn't protect you from H1N1
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:04.560]  doubled your chances of getting the regular seasonal flu I mean these are
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:10.080]  the numbers these are the facts CBS News now the polio vaccine just last year
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:14.840]  caused polio all over the world it was live polio I mean over and over again
[2:22:14.840 --> 2:22:19.240]  these companies have liability protection they're a bunch of you let me
[2:22:19.240 --> 2:22:25.120]  ask you this question why do you not vaccinate your son well I believe that
[2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:32.080]  vaccines are dangerous there's dangerous side effects they have mercury in them so
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:37.880]  they're poisonous I don't want mercury in my child I don't want it in his brain
[2:22:37.880 --> 2:22:44.680]  and I really feel that there is not conclusive evidence that disproves that
[2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:53.320]  vaccines can cause autism or ADD I just I don't believe them I don't believe the
[2:22:53.320 --> 2:22:59.880]  so-called evidence of that so I just I don't see any reason for it I did have
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:05.160]  vaccines as a child but my mother pulled my shot records out and by the time I
[2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:09.680]  was six years old I had had 12 shots and if I were to follow the guidelines that
[2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:14.280]  they wanted for my son by the time he was six years old he would have 36 shots
[2:23:14.280 --> 2:23:19.040]  and some of those are more than 36 some of those have triple compounds in them
[2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:23.600]  so it's more like 50 plus but expanding on that vaccine makers have said their
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:28.760]  goal by 2020 is the average child by the age of two will be given over 100
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:32.640]  different inoculations pumping their body full of this garbage and there's
[2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:37.200]  major scientific studies how people can just type in scientific studies link
[2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:42.240]  vaccines to cancer that it's making your immune system shut down to be
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:46.080]  pumped full of all of this I mean look at what's and then they always lie and
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:49.400]  I've had Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and others on exposing this she has the graph
[2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:54.960]  showing it in the Western world by the 20s open serves were shut down hygiene
[2:23:54.960 --> 2:24:00.880]  was upped soap sanitation so diseases go way down by the 50s when vaccines get
[2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:05.360]  popular again the diseases actually go back up a little bit not to what they
[2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:10.160]  were before but they go up a little bit I mean our we're living less now in the
[2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:15.120]  US and in Europe we have the highest cancer rates and vaccines are a big big
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:20.760]  part of it could vaccine science actually help sometimes yes is inoculation
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:25.080]  real science yes but when you're giving them hundreds of these things and the
[2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:29.600]  companies I mean take the H1N1 it just came out what we already knew that it
[2:24:29.600 --> 2:24:34.000]  had piggyback viruses in it same thing with the Gardasil shot now now we just
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:37.600]  showed a headline for prison planet dot TV viewers radio listeners can just
[2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:43.760]  Google Pennsylvania vaccine waiver form law and it says it's not a law but then
[2:24:43.760 --> 2:24:49.240]  we have articles where the news are are are reporting and telling parents take
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:53.640]  your vaccines or go to jail let's put that Pennsylvania code back up there
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:58.480]  did she ever try to this doctor try to tell you it was the law or or did she
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:03.360]  just try to pressure you into doing it no she never said that it was the law but
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:10.640]  I did feel some pressure from her I mean I was in her office for an hour while
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:14.560]  she was going on and on she gave me a lot of literature and I told her I would
[2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:19.600]  take a look at it but I mean I've looked at it all before and you know I'm just
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:25.480]  not I'm not sold on the vaccines and at this point I have chosen not to give my
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:31.920]  child any vaccinations I did tell her that I had looked into an alternative
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:37.480]  schedule and I was still doing some research about that so I felt like I was
[2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:43.720]  being pretty open as far as like you know I wasn't just shutting her down I
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:47.840]  don't deserve to have the police called on you now let's be clear we haven't
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:51.000]  made this clear here but correct me if I'm wrong from talking to you at some
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:57.120]  length last night not only did the state police come to your house two
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:00.280]  different times over the weekend and thank God you were at your sister's
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:05.520]  visiting and gone and left notes the CPS was with them so you see when this
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:08.680]  doctor called you back and said honey I don't know what you're talking about
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:14.240]  obviously she just wants to launch the CPS on you and then act like she didn't
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:17.800]  call in some type of neglect call but that's clearly what happened let's
[2:26:17.800 --> 2:26:21.520]  explain you didn't just have the state police visit who were guaranteed to try
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:26.960]  to force their way in but the CPS was with them right so we haven't explained
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:32.520]  this is an open case an open issue please continue yes when when I got home
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:38.440]  my neighbor came over and he said hey we were really concerned because the state
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:43.000]  police were here twice this weekend and they also had in Pennsylvania it's
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:47.280]  called children and new services they had a children new services worker with
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:52.560]  them as well and when you know you weren't home they came to our door and
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:58.480]  they were asking questions about you and about your son wow what kind of
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:04.120]  questions did they did they ask you or ask your neighbor they asked you know do

[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:30.520]  neighbor or they would use your neighbors affidavit in their kangaroo eugenics

[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:46.800]  trying to scare you but for parents out there the incredible creepiness we
[2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:51.480]  should have started the interview with this not just police but CPS and asking
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:56.280]  your neighbors questions and CPS will lie and even make stuff up what else did
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:01.960]  your neighbors say they said well he he really didn't speak to him he he told
[2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:06.280]  him look I'm not involved with this I don't want to talk to you and he pretty
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:11.640]  much shut the door on him unbelievable now now this is obviously an open case

[2:33:25.960 --> 2:33:32.280]  a fraud you see a hoax you see the media lying and saying it's the law you see
[2:33:32.280 --> 2:33:35.840]  California injecting children now without parental consent I'm gonna play a
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:41.320]  news clip of that in a moment you see her saying you wouldn't show an ID and
[2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:47.600]  filing a fake police report on you sending CPS who have a quota to grab
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:53.400]  children I mean these are child kidnappers and this this person thinks
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:57.000]  because they're part of the system that that's okay like you're not a human
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:01.480]  being like you're not gonna fight back we've got to start recognizing cuz
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:05.760]  you're so polite you're so nice and you're saying all the state police lady
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:09.920]  was real nice on the phone let's black her name out to be nice to her and I
[2:34:09.920 --> 2:34:15.600]  don't understand why this doctors like this I was real nice to her again you're
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:18.840]  a nice lady who knows enough to stand up for yourself you're smart you care
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:24.480]  about your son your husband cares your dad you says a listener but still you've
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:28.920]  got this attitude like why are they being mean to me I haven't done anything
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:34.720]  wrong they don't care their control freaks they're sickening and and none of
[2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:38.640]  us are safe because they're gearing up with the Centers for Disease Control and
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:43.840]  the National Department of Health all of it going door-to-door everywhere
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:47.520]  harassing people and they're really gearing up for forced inoculation they
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:52.200]  have the emergency centers act they have the model emergency centers act
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:56.320]  they're trying to train police for forced inoculation they're really gearing
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:35:00.240]  up for this and that's why I'm telling folks the war is on because if you look
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:04.800]  pull up the statistics record numbers are not taking their vaccines people are
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:10.720]  waking up to the horrors of the Gardasil deaths and Rick Perry and all of it any
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:14.120]  other points you'd like to add about all of this before I go to some more
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:22.720]  clips I just I mean I I understand I mean I just I guess I felt so violated
[2:35:22.720 --> 2:35:28.880]  and I felt that if this was a lot of intimidation and you know her way of
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:35.440]  trying to force me to vaccinate my son you know obviously sending the state
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:41.120]  police to my house is not you know gonna make me trust her I mean you know as
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:45.840]  Americans we think we should be able to trust our doctors but obviously we can't
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:51.400]  well now they are agents of government and they're being told to spy on parents
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:55.680]  pediatricians are told to spy and treat you as if you're guilty the last three
[2:35:55.680 --> 2:36:00.680]  times and my doctor's a listener and my wife's daughter's a listener you know
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:04.840]  great lady but still at the nice hospital new hospital we went to for the
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:08.960]  first child and and the two subsequent I figured it out by the first time the
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:12.480]  nurse would say Alex do you mind bringing this down to the first floor this
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:16.800]  file for me and I got the file and left me and my wife hadn't been arguing
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:21.680]  nothing I was all you know massaging her oh sweetie cake all this and I come
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:26.960]  back and my wife goes she was just asking me if we have money if you
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:31.400]  abuse me she was typing into that computer on the side of the wall the
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:36.280]  lady comes back in and I said hey you know this isn't guilty until proven
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:40.120]  innocent I don't have a criminal record I understand that's so that goes to the
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:44.280]  health department you're filling out a report on me and and you know she was
[2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:48.360]  like the head nurse and she like narrowed her eyebrows like ooh like it's weird
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:52.760]  to even be able to think and know what I'm doing to you ooh and I said hey
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.800]  listen let me explain how this is gonna work I'm a syndicated radio host to turn
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:00.520]  out some of the other nurses were listeners and I said you better you
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:04.760]  better dot your eyes and cross your T's now the next two times when they do it
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:09.040]  years later different nurses I'd say oh no you can take that down there you go
[2:37:09.040 --> 2:37:13.340]  and ask her the questions you know whether I beat her or not right here in
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:17.480]  front of me and then they're like well I usually ask this with you out of the
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:21.880]  room I go look see it's all this it's this whole world about fooling us and
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:28.160]  manipulating us and look for 40 years now this year 2012 for 40 years worldwide
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:32.120]  in every industrialized country they take blood from babies at birth and put
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.440]  it in a global database I knew this 16 years ago when a nurse gave it to me
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:40.760]  from one of the Department of Defense bases in San Antonio declassified three
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:45.120]  years ago the medical system is a tyranny that thinks we're animals and
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:48.440]  they do whatever they want were you aware of the blood grabbing they do a
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:54.000]  baby's at birth is that where they want you to do the stem they want to take a
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:57.440]  stem and they tell you that if your child ever gets certain diseases they'll
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:00.880]  be able to cure them no no yeah yeah yeah no that's a big money-making deal
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:04.560]  where it turns out now they don't usually finish the procedures quick enough for
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:12.880]  women so they can you know get that stem cell fluid out of the placenta and
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:18.640]  umbilical cord no no no this is blood of all children you know they take ampules
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:22.080]  of blood and they go we're sitting in this to the health department sign this
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:26.800]  form to check for blood diseases it's they don't check for blood diseases it
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:31.720]  goes to the Department of Defense I didn't know that oh yeah and then they
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:35.680]  sell the data to companies who then when your child 30 years later needs a
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:41.140]  surgery or a DNA treatment they tell them oh this company bought your blood it
[2:38:41.140 --> 2:38:46.040]  owns your DNA now so it's going to be $200,000 for the procedure instead of
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:50.960]  five thousand that's terrible I know that sounds crazy in science fiction it's
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:55.800]  because we are in science fiction now now let me just stop right there what
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:39:02.320]  else I mean did you bring up why are the CPS here are you coming back or did
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:05.600]  they say they're coming back do they say we want to meet with you have you
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:09.920]  learned the name of the child grabbing ghoul they sent with the police no I
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:15.480]  haven't heard anything back from them actually the state trooper I had even
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:19.920]  offered I said my son's in school right now would you like to talk to one of his
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:27.840]  teachers she said no that's not necessary you know she basically I took
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:33.040]  it as though that was the end of it so but I did try to call the doctor
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:38.600]  immediately and she didn't return my phone call for two days because I did
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:45.240]  want to confront her as to why she called the state police and you know
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:50.080]  children use services I like I said I didn't hear back from her for two days
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:55.800]  until I received a voicemail because I was at work where on the voicemail she
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:04.280]  just says Rachel I got your message not really sure why you're calling we'd
[2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:10.800]  really just like to have his growth charts I know you said there's not any
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:16.080]  immunization records always act like it's no big deal when they're trying to
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:19.920]  wreck your life because they care about you in fact you do have that audio on
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:26.680]  your phone don't you yes I do now now do you want to say the town you're in do
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:29.480]  you want to get out your email for locals that may want to support you or
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:34.320]  local media that may want to march into that doctor's office actually I've
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:38.640]  already been I just checked my phone I've already been receiving some emails
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:44.280]  from local media so apparently they're listening and they know where I am I
[2:40:44.280 --> 2:40:49.560]  mean people do know my name around here because you know I'm pretty active in
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:54.040]  the community and also in you know helping people to become more healthy so
[2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:58.000]  that's right you're a well-known person in the community we're not going to get
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:01.320]  into your profession or exactly where you work because it's going to separate
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:06.000]  but you're very well known in the community yeah I feel like that I mean
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:12.200]  I've I grew up here I did move away from some for some time and recently moved
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:17.400]  back here but I mean it's a pretty small close-knit community everybody pretty
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:20.560]  much knows everybody so yeah I think they picked on the wrong person do you
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:25.360]  want to say the name of your town I'm here in center County very close to
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:32.720]  State College if anybody's familiar with Penn State University so Wow so they
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.440]  they're in the Happy Valley or I guess yes still going after people's
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:43.600]  children and one way or another right what do you plan to do if the CPS shows
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:50.320]  back up well I won't I won't let them in of course you know I mean I'll answer
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:54.120]  the door I'll talk to them I mean as a matter of fact I have a lot of friends
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:42:01.080]  that are CPS workers here I have a lot of friends that are social workers for
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:06.120]  the county government so well to be clear social workers are one thing they're
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:09.640]  helping old people or whatever but more and more statistically they have
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:14.240]  bounties on kids and let me tell you CPS is not to be trifled with you may know
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:18.640]  some of these people but I tell you they are as dangerous as a barrel of snakes
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:22.680]  yeah I mean I don't trust them they're not gonna come into my house it's not
[2:42:22.680 --> 2:42:26.480]  that I have anything to hide but there's no reason for them to come into my
[2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:29.920]  yeah yeah exactly they just it's a fishing expedition they've already are
[2:42:29.920 --> 2:42:36.120]  spying on you let's expand on this though I want to play a clip for you this
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:40.160]  is a clip from national news and I forget the source I'll give you this horse
[2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:44.040]  once we play it here's a clip where they're on and the governor did sign
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:48.800]  this bill debating injecting children without parental consent in California
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:52.360]  and they're now doing the state now in California says they own your children
[2:42:52.360 --> 2:42:55.600]  and they've even said that in federal and state court trying to ban homeschooling
[2:42:55.600 --> 2:43:00.880]  so here is that clip parents are legally accountable for any adverse events
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:05.320]  adverse reactions that occur from the vaccine federal the federal bureaucrats
[2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:08.680]  government bureaucrats should not be making decisions for parents Lisa we
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:13.440]  do know that there are vaccine injuries that happen from vaccines should
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:17.840]  parents know when their 12 year olds are getting a medical treatment that
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:22.320]  could be risky well already in California and other states across the
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:27.040]  country children are already receiving medical benefits that their parents are
[2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:32.680]  aware of birth control abortions events where there could be a severe adverse
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:39.560]  reaction even leading to death like in cases of abortion so no about that
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:47.960]  Lisa yes I shouldn't parent you're making the case that there are risky
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:51.000]  things that 12 year olds and 13 year olds are experiencing shouldn't their
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:55.440]  parents know about those well I think parental consent starts in the home
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:59.040]  every day our teenagers are doing things to risk their health they're having
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:02.360]  sex they're they're taking experimenting with drugs they're acting
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:06.720]  cavalier if we have an open line of communication with our children then
[2:44:06.720 --> 2:44:10.760]  this bill should not threaten parents all right let's stop right there that's
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:16.600]  CNN this is the incredible spin that we now face where well they're using drugs
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:20.600]  they're having abortions let us inject 11 12 year olds without their parents
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:25.400]  knowing and they spin it like parents shouldn't be threatened by this I mean
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:30.440]  it's so creepy that we put up with so much that now the CPS and state police
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:33.480]  come to your house because you don't want to shoot up your two and a half year
[2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:38.600]  old son with whatever the drug companies lobbied them to give you or or now in
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:41.600]  California they just shoot them up at the school and don't even care used to
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:45.240]  it was always an accident oh we didn't know you hadn't agreed to give them this
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:49.200]  new shot just amazing what do you think of that clip with that woman just
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:55.160]  straight-faced saying of course parents don't need to know that's crazy I think
[2:44:55.160 --> 2:44:59.880]  that's ridiculous I mean you know you're not old enough to vote until you're
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:05.400]  18 you're not old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes I mean so why is it that
[2:45:05.400 --> 2:45:12.720]  you're old enough to decide that you want the vaccine or an abortion or any
[2:45:12.720 --> 2:45:17.160]  other of these crazy things that they're they're giving to kids I just I don't
[2:45:17.160 --> 2:45:23.880]  understand that well look if we don't start standing up to these people and
[2:45:23.880 --> 2:45:28.840]  realize how we've been wronged more and more doctors are going to be used like
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:32.880]  they were in Nazi Germany to oppress people and well the doctor said I mean
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:37.440]  if you look at sterilizations did you know social workers were set up for the
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:42.000]  family courts to carry out for sterilizations outside of a regular
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:46.120]  court for US citizens are you aware of the eugenics laws that 35 plus states
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:53.000]  had in the US I mean in regards to Planned Parenthood and abortion and
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  trying to wipe out African-American exactly that's where it all came from but
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:01.560]  it was done to poor whites and others as well but that's where the family courts
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:09.000]  came from I mean these aren't even real courts I mean you that's why the CPS
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:13.400]  person just shows up it starts trying to find some dirt it's all just made up so
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:19.560]  they can get their clutches on your son not my son what does your husband think
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:26.680]  of this oh he's he he definitely actually when I was pregnant my husband is
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:31.440]  the one that brought this information to my attention because you know I was
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:35.440]  raised here in central Pennsylvania I mean you just you grow up you get
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:39.880]  vaccines you do this you do that whatever but my husband brought this to my
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:44.440]  attention while I was pregnant and I spent a lot of time researching it and
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:49.040]  we both made this decision that we would not vaccinate our child and we've
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:54.400]  stood by that decision and he stands by that decision today you know he's been
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:59.440]  with me before when we've been questioned by doctors and things of that
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:06.840]  nature you know when we were living in Ohio we were also questioned or really
[2:47:06.840 --> 2:47:13.120]  harassed by a doctor there and what you do is you Google non-vaccinating doctors
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:16.440]  and you'll find doctors in every major town you have to drive 50 miles you know
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:19.800]  who live in a real world but when they do get in your face I would just pull out
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:24.760]  all the major reports and mainline info I got reports today about kids dying from
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:29.080]  H1N1 and others and say hey don't give me vaccine company propaganda here's
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:33.920]  the facts or will you sign a form saying of my child's hurt you're liable don't
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:39.200]  tell me to sign a form that I'm bad put the shoe back on your foot punk you know
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:44.760]  what I like that idea and you're right I should go when I go to the double
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:50.480]  actually now from this situation I've come to find out that I really should
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:54.760]  just be taking my son to like a general practitioner family doctor rather than a
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:48:01.680]  pediatrician because their main purpose is to enforce the CDC's regulations so
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:04.920]  well exactly it's it's indentured servitude and doctors are just letting
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:08.480]  this happen now where the federal government through the state tells you
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:13.640]  what to do and how to operate and what what what processes what treatments you
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:17.280]  can offer I mean it's the end of regular medicine and they're just being
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:24.120]  turned into little government bureaucrats right I I have a healthy child you know I
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:29.520]  just I just wanted to be a good mom take my son to as well check up and you know
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:34.600]  I wasn't expecting all this to happen but I do plan on trying to find another
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:38.640]  doctor here in the area that you know that we'll be able to work with that I
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:42.920]  can take my son to get you know regular well checkups get him weighed get his
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:46.640]  height taken that kind of what about suing this doctor and then and then you
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:50.600]  can have the staff there and all of them in deposition saying we didn't ask for an
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:53.840]  ID and then there's the false report right there I mean this is a false
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:57.920]  report on you I mean she sent people there who are looking to take your child
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:04.880]  I mean this is an attack I I totally agree and I will contact my lawyer yeah
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:07.760]  you need to go after them I'm telling you and there are other lawyers that
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:12.200]  specialize in this and because if we don't get on the offense with them
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:16.000]  they're just gonna sit there and think it's normal I mean I hear national talk
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:19.600]  show hosting take everybody's kids that don't vaccinate I've got three children
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:22.800]  they've never been vaccinated they're not sickly like all the other kids I know
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:26.160]  that have been and because you cannot trust these companies we've got one
[2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:30.880]  minute left I really appreciate you spending time with us Rachel anything
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:36.400]  else that you'd like to add I would just like to add that my child is very
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:42.840]  healthy he's only ever had one ear infection in his life as far as cold
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:49.040]  coughs he really doesn't get them he's he's really the healthiest two-and-a-half
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:56.120]  year old that I know more energetic lively he's just he's just he's he's
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:01.160]  fabulous he's wonderful and even the doctor agreed that he was very healthy
[2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:06.240]  and developing well so and he's doing all that without vaccinations so without
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:11.520]  mercury being injected into them I mean I would ask the doctor okay well they
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:15.960]  want 50 shots now how about 200 how about 300 how about I mean it it's
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:19.920]  destroying their immune systems that's why we're so sickly now I mean now with
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:23.920]  antibiotics they've got totally drug resistant TB in India I mean there's no
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:30.120]  end to what these doctors are doing yes I agree and that's why I'm not going to
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:36.600]  let it happen to my son my mother actually died last year of cancer oh yeah
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:41.800]  I'm convinced that the main reason why my mother developed cancer was because she
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:46.600]  was put on antibiotics her entire life she spent her entire life that's
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:50.200]  definitely linked to it well Rachel Garmin we need more mothers and fathers

[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:48.880]  that was added in the debate this is around the point where Ron Paul was
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:55.800]  talking about a golden rule of foreign policy and there was just bloodlust in
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:57:00.320]  people in some of the people who were clapping or booing at that but clapping
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:04.240]  at the other comments of the other candidates talking about just take us

[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:26.880]  and they were saying that's the way it is these morons don't know the oil
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:30.560]  companies have shut off most of the oil in the West and Alaska more than all the
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:35.000]  Middle East combined and that we pay for wars so that they can sell the oil to
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:39.600]  Asia and Europe I mean these idiots out there you think big bankers that run our

[2:58:52.440 --> 2:58:56.200]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[2:58:56.200 --> 2:58:59.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:04.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:59:04.440 --> 2:59:08.680]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[2:59:08.680 --> 2:59:13.320]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[2:59:13.320 --> 2:59:17.280]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:21.640]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[2:59:21.640 --> 2:59:25.400]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:59:25.400 --> 2:59:29.560]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:16.640]  Michael in California, Michael, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Michael, come on down.
[3:01:18.640 --> 3:01:24.000]  Hey, listen, 53 year old white male, I'm proud to say I'm a white Caucasian American and it's
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:28.080]  politically incorrect for me to say I'm proud of my heritage. Well, that's pretty evil. Nobody
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:31.520]  should be proud of their heritage. You should have a plastic corporate heritage of the New
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:39.440]  World Order, a vaccine system. Well, Alex, you know, you're totally serious in what you say,
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:45.280]  but you still make me laugh because there's always going to be humor in seriousness. And I want to
[3:01:45.280 --> 3:01:53.440]  say I have been awake now for about a year. I was semi-conscious for about 10 years of my 53 years,
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:58.400]  but you I have to thank for doing your part in waking me up to what the hell is really going
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:02.560]  on in this world. And the great part about waking up is it doesn't mean you've discovered everything.
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:07.040]  It just means you're awake and and looking to discover and know there's always something else
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:13.360]  going on. And you're and you're receptive to more truth. Exactly. And you start learning how the
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:18.320]  con artists manipulate you. Exactly. And you know something, Alex, I want the reason I called
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:23.760]  mainly and I appreciate all these words you're saying they're all true. I live in the crypto
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:29.280]  fascist state of Northern California. And I there's a train system is called a BART. You've heard
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:34.560]  the BART system Bay Area Repetranza. Yeah, yeah. It's a huge train system service nine counties
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:44.000]  in Northern California. Anyway, about three months ago, the TSA was beta testing a new poster.
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:50.640]  This poster has pictures of nine faces on it. Eight of the faces. Okay, one of the faces. No,
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:55.200]  no, no, I mean, sir, we broke all that a year against the white al-Qaeda. They're rebranding
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:59.280]  where all the terrorists are white, and they have all these videos out showing it too. So,
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:03.360]  see, first they sell us that all the brown people are terrorist and then hope that white folks go
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:06.800]  along with that. Then they sell all the brown folks that all the white people are terrorist.
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:11.360]  And again, they're just using race to manipulate people. Yes, I'm aware of those. We're just out
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:16.720]  of time. Thank you so much, sir. And again, they admit they're now rebranding al-Qaeda to the guy
[3:03:16.720 --> 3:03:21.600]  in the John Deerehead, the domestic terrorist. Steve in Florida, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:27.760]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex. I had a couple suggestions. You were looking for alternative
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:32.800]  names for the so-called mainstream media. And then, so hopefully, if you have time,
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:37.680]  we'll get into the main reason I called. The discredited, no audience, so-called mainstream
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:43.920]  peacock, know-it-all, preening, sycophantic, trader, prostitute, globalist minion, zombie
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:51.440]  controller, den of vipers of their father, the liar. I thought about covers it. I was thinking
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:59.200]  of TTN, which stands for a tyranny transponder network. Hey, tyranny transponder network,
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:06.560]  that's a good idea for them. Or how about just pack a liar media or globalist, you know,
[3:04:06.560 --> 3:04:12.320]  trader media? Anything else, sir? Yeah, and then the other one, and this would tie in with what
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:16.880]  they've done with the foods, the glass, etc. You know, you talk about BPA, this, you know,
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:22.720]  hey, well, we can call them media BPA, which would stand for Beast Propaganda Agency.
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:30.160]  Oh, Beast Propaganda Agency, you're right. Or Neural Order Occupation Media.
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:36.960]  Absolutely powerful. Thank you so much for the call. All right, I'm sorry, everybody else.
[3:04:36.960 --> 3:04:43.360]  We'll get back to you tomorrow. Lord willing, pray for us. We sure need it. We don't just
[3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:48.400]  believe in prayers. We depend on them. We don't believe in miracles. We depend on them. My aunt's
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:54.480]  got that as a little sign in the bathroom. And we're going to be back tonight at seven o'clock.
[3:04:54.480 --> 3:04:58.960]  I'll be hosting the nightly news this evening. And boys, it's a big transmission. We have a new video
[3:04:58.960 --> 3:05:08.960]  at infowars.com secrets of the Italian cruise ship disaster.
