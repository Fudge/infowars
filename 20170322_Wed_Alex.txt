[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017.
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.960]  I'm David Knight, your host. Roger Stone is going to be joining us in the next segment with some breaking news and we have a lot of breaking news is happening.
[00:36.960 --> 00:45.960]  We have a terror attack in London. Details of this are just emerging. We've had at least 12 pedestrians mowed down on a bridge by a car.
[00:45.960 --> 00:52.960]  Man jumped out, has been wielding a knife. There were shots fired at Westminster. Parliament is on lockdowns.
[00:52.960 --> 01:00.960]  They're waiting to see what happens with this. No identity yet on this. They say more than 10 people are said to have been hit by a car on Westminster Bridge.
[01:00.960 --> 01:09.960]  The source of this is the Daily Mail. They say after a vehicle described as a 4x4, reportedly drove into pedestrians and cyclists.
[01:09.960 --> 01:15.960]  Three bodies were visible on the floor outside of Parliament and the palace was on an immediate lockdown.
[01:15.960 --> 01:25.960]  So it's not clear if those three bodies are in addition to the 10 people that were knocked down on Westminster Bridge. That's all in one area.
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.960]  Nevertheless, a very serious attack in London. I guess we're waiting to get the last name.
[01:31.960 --> 01:37.960]  The first name is probably Mohammed. Although there are reports that it's an Asian individual, still could be a Muslim.
[01:37.960 --> 01:45.960]  It certainly looks like an Islamic attack with the car, with the knife, etc., as well as not just the gun issue.
[01:45.960 --> 02:00.960]  Another example as well of the failure of gun control folks. This guy had no trouble getting a gun, but of course they can do a lot of damage with a truck that they've hijacked as well.
[02:00.960 --> 02:10.960]  We also see that there's an article up on the Drudge Report from Info Wars. Did the U.S. military infiltrate North Korean defense networks and take out their latest missile test?
[02:10.960 --> 02:22.960]  This is an interesting story. This missile, of course, blew up on the launching pad and as one of the articles from the Sun said, Kim Jong-un suffered stage fright.
[02:22.960 --> 02:27.960]  I guess maybe that's first stage flight. That's when it blew up, was in the first stage.
[02:27.960 --> 02:36.960]  Maybe we ought to start calling this an unlaunch. Maybe that could be the new metaphor for rockets that blow up on the launch pad or immediately after.
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.960]  Maybe that could be his legacy. Maybe this guy could have something positive to contribute to society and the world after all.
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.960]  He could give us a new verb, unlaunch, a rocket. We have a lot of news that's happening today.
[02:48.960 --> 02:58.960]  We have the Neil Gorsuch hearing that is going to be continuing today and we have a lot of information from that yesterday as well as new moves towards impeachment.
[02:58.960 --> 03:10.960]  They're accusing Paul Manafort of working for Putin's government and he pushed back and said, I worked for Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments.
[03:10.960 --> 03:23.960]  My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests. Meanwhile, we see also the Podesta who they conveniently ignore has even closer ties.
[03:23.960 --> 03:31.960]  And a call from the Daily Caller article, they point out the Podesta who was campaign manager for Hillary Clinton the entire time she was running for office.
[03:31.960 --> 03:40.960]  Not just for a short period of time, but the entire time she was also Bill Clinton's White House Chief of Staff. He first made contact with the Russian firm in 2011.
[03:40.960 --> 03:51.960]  So it's more recent than Paul Manafort's, which was more than a decade ago. The amount that he has involved here is $35 million that is involved, not the $10 million that they're talking about with Paul Manafort.
[03:51.960 --> 04:01.960]  And he has problems in terms of disclosure. He did not disclose when he started working for Barack Obama's White House staff in 2014 as a senior counselor.
[04:01.960 --> 04:09.960]  He did not disclose these investments, these stock holdings that he had in Russia at the time. We've talked about this all along.
[04:09.960 --> 04:21.960]  We've talked about Representative Louis Gohmert, who is pulling this out and saying, why aren't you talking about John Podesta's involvement? Which is orders of magnitude more than the allegations against Paul Manafort.
[04:21.960 --> 04:31.960]  But of course, they're not going to do that. It's the same thing we see from FBI Director Comey. He's not going to come after Hillary Clinton, remember?
[04:31.960 --> 04:38.960]  Going all the way back to the national security violations. Yes, we have multiple felonies committed, but we're not going to go there.
[04:38.960 --> 04:49.960]  We're not going to investigate that. But don't you try this at home because we don't have law enforcement that enforces laws without being selective about two potential individuals or two classes of individuals.
[04:49.960 --> 05:09.960]  We're also going to be talking about the Rockville Rape and what that tells us about the special protections afforded to foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing. We'll be right back.
[05:19.960 --> 05:31.960]  Carlsbad is expanding its use of automatic license plate readers into a system that aims to collect the registration information of every vehicle that enters the city.
[05:31.960 --> 05:52.960]  The $1 million police department project, which will add stationary cameras at 14 key Carlsbad intersections, creating a virtual gateway at the city's borders was approved by the city council last week, sparking outrage over privacy rights and government control from several residents and one council member.
[05:52.960 --> 05:59.960]  Stay tuned for more special reports at infowars.com.
[05:59.960 --> 06:07.960]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[06:07.960 --> 06:20.960]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[06:20.960 --> 06:29.960]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:29.960 --> 06:42.960]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:42.960 --> 06:53.960]  This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[06:53.960 --> 07:20.960]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself infowarslife.com today.

[08:20.960 --> 08:38.960]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:38.960 --> 08:45.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017. I am David Knight. We're going to be going to Roger Stone.
[08:45.960 --> 08:54.960]  We have breaking news from Roger Stone. Of course, he's at the top of the New York Times calling him a trickster on Trump's side, saying he is under FBI security.
[08:54.960 --> 08:57.960]  He's going to break down what this is. We're going to go to him in just one moment.
[08:57.960 --> 09:02.960]  But before we do, I want to talk about this developing terror attack in London.
[09:02.960 --> 09:11.960]  We've had an individual who drove a car into pedestrians. At least 10 have been injured. They say 12 were attacked by a 4x4.
[09:11.960 --> 09:19.960]  A man got out with a knife, ran into Westminster, stabbed a police officer, and the police shot the man.
[09:19.960 --> 09:23.960]  And I don't know if he is dead or not as far as the information I'm seeing here.
[09:23.960 --> 09:26.960]  But here's the most interesting thing about this so far that has developed.
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.960]  And of course, that is the way CNN spends this story.
[09:30.960 --> 09:34.960]  Kit Daniels just handed this to me. He put up an article on infowars.com.
[09:34.960 --> 09:37.960]  CNN downplays this ISIS-style parliament attack.
[09:37.960 --> 09:42.960]  This is the MO that we have seen from Muslim terrorists, car attacks, knife attacks.
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.960]  That is what we've seen from them. They call it a firearms incident.
[09:46.960 --> 09:52.960]  Well, it's not an incident. The police shot the man and stopped the attack.
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.960]  That's what we keep saying about firearms. But they report it as a firearms incident, even though it was a knife attack, a car attack.
[09:58.960 --> 10:00.960]  They call it a firearms incident.
[10:00.960 --> 10:09.960]  We've got Roger Stone on the line now. We have, and he's gonna tell us, what is really behind these sinister attacks against Donald Trump.
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.960]  It's really a spy group in the State Department. Joining us now is Roger Stone. Roger.
[10:14.960 --> 10:22.960]  David, great to be with you. I was particularly interested in your comments on John Podesta.
[10:22.960 --> 10:28.960]  It's interesting that they want to now hyperscrutinize Maniford. They don't want to look at Podesta.
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.960]  When I said, in August, in a tweet, Podesta's Time in the Barrel will come,
[10:34.960 --> 10:42.960]  meaning his shady business practices in the Eastern European part of the world would come under greater scrutiny.
[10:42.960 --> 10:50.960]  I was referring, interestingly, to a long memo I had gotten from Dr. Jerry Corsi, now heading your Washington Bureau.
[10:50.960 --> 10:58.960]  Some of the best investigative stuff that I have seen about the inherent corruption of John and Tony.
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.960]  He urged me to look into some issues there. I published my own article in October.
[11:02.960 --> 11:08.960]  There's a whole spate of alternative conservative media stories that I'm referring to.
[11:08.960 --> 11:23.960]  Notice I didn't say, hashtag WikiLeaks. The idea that Stone knew in advance about the hacking of Podesta's email is a damnable lie.
[11:23.960 --> 11:31.960]  You've got some check out today in a David Block-funded bot saying, Stone's alibi destroyed.
[11:31.960 --> 11:39.960]  No, it's not destroyed. Give me a chance to testify in open hearing for the House or Senate Intelligence Committee.
[11:39.960 --> 11:43.960]  And I will put the lie to this Russian myth.
[11:43.960 --> 11:47.960]  But more importantly, David, we do have now the pieces coming together.
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.960]  You recall last time I was on with Alex, I talked about the slow-motion coup.
[11:53.960 --> 12:03.960]  And many Americans may not have been paying attention back in, I think it was 2017,
[12:03.960 --> 12:11.960]  when Obama quietly authorized in a National Defense Authorization Bill,
[12:11.960 --> 12:17.960]  essentially the Bureau of Fake News, meaning the Ministry of Truth.
[12:17.960 --> 12:23.960]  This is step one to suppress a coup.
[12:23.960 --> 12:30.960]  We have to silence the alternative voices, meaning any voice but the deep state and the government.
[12:30.960 --> 12:33.960]  We see this in the attack on Info Wars.
[12:33.960 --> 12:37.960]  We see this on the attack on Stone Cold Truths.
[12:37.960 --> 12:40.960]  We see this in the attack on Breitbart.
[12:40.960 --> 12:52.960]  We see this in the games that are being played at Google and Facebook to rig our logarithms to deny us our free speech rights.
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.960]  It's ironic that the left, who talks so much about free speech in the First Amendment,
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.960]  now offers censorship, Stalin style as their prescription.
[13:03.960 --> 13:05.960]  But it is all happening now.
[13:05.960 --> 13:09.960]  They are attacking Ron Paul as an agent of the Kremlin.
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.960]  John McCain attacked the patriotism of another senator.
[13:14.960 --> 13:18.960]  This is a blatant violation of the Senate rules.
[13:18.960 --> 13:21.960]  He should be censured for that.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.960]  And that should have been a jump the shark moment.
[13:23.960 --> 13:32.960]  I think as you're talking about how they're censoring Info Wars and Breitbart and the press that is not friendly to the administration,
[13:32.960 --> 13:35.960]  they're using bots to shut people down.
[13:35.960 --> 13:39.960]  And yet what they do is they say, you're using bots to get your information out.
[13:39.960 --> 13:42.960]  So they accuse us of doing what we know that they're doing.
[13:42.960 --> 13:44.960]  It's amazing how they are selective about this.
[13:44.960 --> 13:53.960]  If you go on Twitter, the torrent of hate directed at Alex Jones, directed at Roger Stone, directed at Steve Bannon,
[13:53.960 --> 13:56.960]  it's just vile.
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.960]  And it's all paid for.
[13:58.960 --> 13:59.960]  It's all ad get prop.
[13:59.960 --> 14:01.960]  It's all the same.
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.960]  This guy Brock is just a con man. He gets $30 million from dumb rich donors.
[14:06.960 --> 14:08.960]  He pockets most of it.
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.960]  He pays very little in taxes.
[14:10.960 --> 14:12.960]  That's been a complaint filed there.
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.960]  And he has these bots constantly attacking the supporters of Donald Trump.
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.960]  And he lost with the giant financial advantage he had.
[14:22.960 --> 14:23.960]  He lost.
[14:23.960 --> 14:30.960]  Now I guess he has conned some new fat rich sucker liberal donors in his plan to impeach
[14:30.960 --> 14:31.960]  the president.
[14:31.960 --> 14:33.960]  That will never happen.
[14:33.960 --> 14:37.960]  You know, I think it's very interesting when we go back and you mentioned John and Tony,
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.960]  and that's the two brothers, the Podesta brothers, both of them lobbyists,
[14:41.960 --> 14:43.960]  very well connected, a lot of connections to Russia.
[14:43.960 --> 14:46.960]  But of course they suppress that information.
[14:46.960 --> 14:49.960]  When we look at this report that came out today from the Daily Caller,
[14:49.960 --> 14:52.960]  this is Louis Gohmert from Texas calling this out.
[14:52.960 --> 14:59.960]  It was actually a state run company that was founded by Vladimir Putin, Russ Nano.
[14:59.960 --> 15:01.960]  And that was involved.
[15:01.960 --> 15:02.960]  Yeah.
[15:02.960 --> 15:03.960]  Yeah.
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.960]  It's Bill and Hillary and the Podestas who were making millions off the clique around
[15:07.960 --> 15:08.960]  Putin.
[15:08.960 --> 15:09.960]  Yes.
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.960]  So let's accuse Trump, who has never met Putin, crossed paths with him in some dressing
[15:14.960 --> 15:16.960]  room, but have never actually met.
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.960]  Let's blame him of being in Putin's pocket.
[15:20.960 --> 15:27.960]  It's almost, it's Kafka-esque, but it's also textbook for the Alinsky School.
[15:27.960 --> 15:30.960]  Attack your opponent for exactly what you are doing.
[15:30.960 --> 15:37.960]  Let me point out that the Ministry of Truth, as they call it, this censorship board,
[15:37.960 --> 15:42.960]  was actually put forward by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio.
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.960]  He is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bush family.
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.960]  I mean, his breath smells like George W's dairy air.
[15:51.960 --> 15:54.960]  Yeah, we have to understand that when they created this.
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.960]  He's a steward for the deep state in the defense contractors.
[15:58.960 --> 16:04.960]  If you look at his campaign contributions, he's owned by the defense contractors and
[16:04.960 --> 16:10.960]  those who make millions on war, he pushed this secret plan through Congress.
[16:10.960 --> 16:18.960]  And now from a war room, the Justice Department, the State Department, other intelligence agencies
[16:18.960 --> 16:20.960]  have begun the crackdown.
[16:20.960 --> 16:22.960]  Alex Jones must be silenced.
[16:22.960 --> 16:25.960]  Roger Stone must be silenced.
[16:25.960 --> 16:30.960]  They're having conniption fits about the fact that Tucker Carlson's on box.
[16:30.960 --> 16:33.960]  They'd like to figure out some way to shut him down.
[16:33.960 --> 16:37.960]  Yeah, anybody who pushes against the neocon military industrial establishment's agenda,
[16:37.960 --> 16:40.960]  who exposes information, they have to be shut down.
[16:40.960 --> 16:42.960]  As you pointed out, the connection is Rob Portman.
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.960]  It's the GOP that largely helped to pass this and put it into the NDAA.
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.960]  And so this is something that is bipartisan, it's the establishment, the military industrial complex
[16:53.960 --> 16:59.960]  of both parties that are now coming after our free speech attacking entire news organizations
[16:59.960 --> 17:02.960]  saying that we're guilty by alleged association.
[17:02.960 --> 17:04.960]  They're alleging association.
[17:04.960 --> 17:06.960]  They're not even saying you're guilty because you're associated.
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.960]  They're saying alleging this association and saying we need to take them down.
[17:10.960 --> 17:14.960]  No, David, that is exactly right.
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.960]  They can't compete in the marketplace of ideas and therefore they have to go full totalitarian.
[17:20.960 --> 17:23.960]  You have to be silenced.
[17:23.960 --> 17:31.960]  It is absolutely outrageous, but it's happening before our very eyes.
[17:31.960 --> 17:39.960]  And it is really why I keep telling people in all honesty, you know, if you want to buy my book,
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.960]  please do it for them for worse because they need the money for this fight.
[17:45.960 --> 17:48.960]  This is going to be a horrific fight.
[17:48.960 --> 17:51.960]  They intend to try to silence Alex Jones.
[17:51.960 --> 18:02.960]  I have at least four media questions from reporters wanting me to comment on the fact that Jones has been working with the Russians
[18:02.960 --> 18:10.960]  and that the Russians are taking his material by pre-arrangement and paying for its mass distribution by bots.
[18:10.960 --> 18:13.960]  These calls are from fake news sites.
[18:13.960 --> 18:18.960]  Yeah, and this is something that's being thrown out there shamefully by the FBI director himself.
[18:18.960 --> 18:24.960]  And when you look at the double standard, the fact that he's not going to enforce laws against Hillary Clinton,
[18:24.960 --> 18:29.960]  when she creates multiple felonies, but he tells people at that time, don't you try this?
[18:29.960 --> 18:33.960]  That should have been the point at which this guy loses his job and or goes to jail.
[18:33.960 --> 18:38.960]  If law enforcement is not going to enforce the laws against certain individuals or certain classes of people,
[18:38.960 --> 18:44.960]  as we see with the sanctuary city sheriffs like we've got here in Austin, if they're going to do that, they're not law enforcement.
[18:44.960 --> 18:47.960]  They ought to be removed from office and or jailed.
[18:47.960 --> 18:53.960]  And when we look at what you're talking about here, Roger, we've got the Daily Cause, of course, on the hard left,
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.960]  reporting on this saying the FBI is investigating Breitbart and Info Wars for possible Russian collusion.
[18:58.960 --> 19:01.960]  Then they report what the FBI said.
[19:01.960 --> 19:07.960]  And then they say one imagines that the timing of their articles would have been important for this plan to work.
[19:07.960 --> 19:13.960]  So assuming that there's a plan, assuming that there were bots promoting this, make all those assumptions as if they're fact,
[19:13.960 --> 19:19.960]  and then say, well, now we can make this assumption that they had to be coordinating this with the Russians in order for this to work.
[19:19.960 --> 19:21.960]  That's the way that they're rolling this.
[19:21.960 --> 19:25.960]  But we can see with the double standard that this is purely political.
[19:25.960 --> 19:28.960]  These are not investigations, they're allegations.
[19:28.960 --> 19:30.960]  It's not prosecutions, it's persecutions.
[19:30.960 --> 19:32.960]  Well, not only that, it's very interesting.
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.960]  You have Congressman Adam Schiff of California, a junior league, Joe McCarthy,
[19:37.960 --> 19:44.960]  attacking myself and others for alleged collusion.
[19:44.960 --> 19:51.960]  But that's not stopping him from having a fundraiser with a known Ukrainian arms deal or a Pasternak.
[19:51.960 --> 19:55.960]  That's right, and he's pushing that discredited Buzzfeed dossier.
[19:55.960 --> 20:24.960]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone. Stay with us.

[23:57.960 --> 24:17.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host. Alex will be joining us later in the show.
[24:17.960 --> 24:23.960]  We were just talking to Roger Stone. I want to go back and underscore some of the information that was also released about Podesta.
[24:23.960 --> 24:27.960]  You will not hear this from the mainstream media or from the FBI.
[24:27.960 --> 24:38.960]  They will not talk about Podesta and the Clinton campaign's connections to Vladimir Putin, which are far more direct than anything that has been alleged about Paul Manafort.
[24:38.960 --> 24:41.960]  But of course, everybody today is talking about Paul Manafort.
[24:41.960 --> 24:45.960]  Before we do, I just want to remind you that we have super blue fluoride toothpaste.
[24:45.960 --> 24:53.960]  That's the way you can support this operation and support your dental health. Quite frankly, and I just saw Alex's father in the hall yesterday.
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.960]  I was telling him that's the best toothpaste I've ever used. It freshens your mouth and keeps it fresh longer than anything else.
[24:59.960 --> 25:05.960]  And one of the reasons for that is it gets rid of the bacteria that's there. It's got nano silver. It's got iodine. It's got peppermint oil.
[25:05.960 --> 25:13.960]  It's a great toothpaste. It's been out of stock. They've had some packaging issues with it and it's been sold out for quite some time.
[25:13.960 --> 25:18.960]  Now we've gotten another shipment in and I just wanted to read this to you from the site because this is one person.
[25:18.960 --> 25:25.960]  They were talking about a different product, Winter Sun Vitamin D. They said, I love this. I have it on auto ship because it gets so mad for not reordering sooner.
[25:25.960 --> 25:32.960]  That's what's happened to me with the toothpaste. I love the toothpaste, but my wife and I ran out of it and we've been waiting for this to come back in stock.
[25:32.960 --> 25:42.960]  We're not on auto ship. I should be. If you get on auto ship, you save 10% on your orders and if your order is more than $50, you get your shipping for free.
[25:42.960 --> 25:51.960]  So we have the toothpaste now back in stock. We also have 30 to 40% off Infowars Select Storeable Food at infowarstore.com.
[25:51.960 --> 26:04.960]  And again, that's for a limited time only. You can help to support this operation. It's very important because we were talking just a couple of weeks ago about how Google's surrogate company was banning our ads for things like toothpaste.
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.960]  There's nothing political about our toothpaste ads. We don't say anything and we have a separate site for Infowars Store for Infowars Life.
[26:11.960 --> 26:16.960]  All it has are these products, these supplements, these things like toothpaste and storeable food.
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.960]  And that's all that's in our ads. They said, no, you're political. We're not going to serve your ads.
[26:21.960 --> 26:33.960]  Now they're going the other way around. If you have a website and you're trying to get ad revenue because you want to serve ads on your site,
[26:33.960 --> 26:36.960]  basically you can make your site available and people will then serve those ads.
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.960]  So they're taking the other direction now and Google is shutting that down. And why are they doing it?
[26:41.960 --> 26:50.960]  It's because people like HSBC said, well, we think that there are some sites that we don't really approve of and we want you to shut down that.
[26:50.960 --> 27:03.960]  Hold that thought there for a moment. HSBC, which is cited in the article by the Wall Street Journal as being the source of concern for saying we don't want to have controversial ads out there.
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.960]  HSBC has been convicted multiple times by the federal government for money laundering and reports overdone by the Rolling Stone.
[27:09.960 --> 27:16.960]  Perhaps they are too controversial. They revealed that they were laundering money for drug cartels, for terrorist organizations.
[27:16.960 --> 27:21.960]  As a matter of fact, Sinaloa Cartel, the cartel that's run by El Chapo.
[27:21.960 --> 27:24.960]  Remember all the talk about El Chapo and how he escaped from prison and so forth?
[27:24.960 --> 27:27.960]  Well, they didn't do a lot of talk about his money laundering operations, did they?
[27:27.960 --> 27:35.960]  Or the fact that HSBC had set up their own private window for the Sinaloa Cartel to launder their money.
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.960]  They had their own private window. They were convicted once, they were put on probation.
[27:39.960 --> 27:44.960]  We talked to a whistleblower who said, yeah, I came in after the first conviction.
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.960]  They added some more people and they were really not trying to vet this at all.
[27:49.960 --> 27:52.960]  They purposely brought in people that didn't know anything about it.
[27:52.960 --> 27:59.960]  According to his testimony and others, they had put things in the search terms that they were looking for
[27:59.960 --> 28:05.960]  that would indicate that money was being laundered to known individuals or organizations who put spaces or periods in there.
[28:05.960 --> 28:14.960]  So it wasn't even obvious to many of the people that they had been altered, deliberately keeping them from getting a flag.
[28:14.960 --> 28:16.960]  And so then they were caught a second time doing this.
[28:16.960 --> 28:26.960]  And now these people, HSBC are telling Google, we don't want you to allow certain websites that are too controversial.
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.960]  We don't want you to let them get any ad revenue from serving ads from other people.
[28:30.960 --> 28:33.960]  So they're coming in both directions, trying to shut everything down.
[28:33.960 --> 28:37.960]  So we appreciate your support. You've stuck by us and we try to offer you the very best products.
[28:37.960 --> 28:41.960]  And I tell you what, that toothpaste is the best toothpaste I've used.
[28:41.960 --> 28:47.960]  But let's go back to this attack on info wars that is being done by the FBI.
[28:47.960 --> 28:49.960]  It is going to be coming from the Ministry of Truth.
[28:49.960 --> 28:59.960]  We talked about this long and hard when it happened back in December when they snuck this again into the National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA.
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.960]  That's where they put indefinite detention by the military without trial, without accusation.
[29:04.960 --> 29:06.960]  Remember they slipped that in in 2012?
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.960]  Obama does a lot of controversy about that at the time when people first learned of it.
[29:10.960 --> 29:12.960]  He said, ah, I'm not going to sign that.
[29:12.960 --> 29:15.960]  And then on midnight, New Year's Eve, he signs it quietly.
[29:15.960 --> 29:17.960]  So I don't worry, I'm not going to enforce it.
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.960]  This is the way the tyranny is rolling out, this kind of deception.
[29:22.960 --> 29:27.960]  And so when we come back, I want to repeat what we said at the very top of the hour,
[29:27.960 --> 29:29.960]  because a lot of people don't get the news broadcast,
[29:29.960 --> 29:32.960]  I want to hit these points about what's going on with Podesta.
[29:32.960 --> 29:37.960]  And I want to talk about the double standard in terms of enforcing the law for immigrants,
[29:37.960 --> 29:43.960]  not just for the politically connected Democrats like Podesta and Hillary Clinton.
[29:43.960 --> 30:08.960]  This is what we have in this country. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[30:13.960 --> 30:17.960]  Donald Trump and Info Wars for colluding with the Russians
[30:17.960 --> 30:20.960]  in violating the National Defense Authorization Act.
[30:20.960 --> 30:25.960]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to I think the sphere's question
[30:25.960 --> 30:28.960]  that there are other RT's operating in the U.S.
[30:28.960 --> 30:30.960]  Can you describe them with them?
[30:30.960 --> 30:37.960]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[30:37.960 --> 30:39.960]  Info Wars comes to mind.
[30:39.960 --> 30:43.960]  George Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[30:43.960 --> 30:46.960]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory
[30:46.960 --> 30:53.960]  that far-right news organizations like Info Wars took action to assist Russian operatives
[30:53.960 --> 30:55.960]  to help Trump win the election.
[30:55.960 --> 31:20.960]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[32:21.960 --> 32:27.960]  It's the people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors,
[32:27.960 --> 32:29.960]  and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.960]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:32.960 --> 32:37.960]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[32:37.960 --> 32:43.960]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[32:43.960 --> 32:45.960]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:45.960 --> 32:52.960]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were,
[32:52.960 --> 32:53.960]  and this is a big part of it.
[32:53.960 --> 33:01.960]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfoWars.com today.
[33:01.960 --> 33:17.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:17.960 --> 33:21.960]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:21.960 --> 33:30.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.960 --> 33:36.960]  Answer to I think Miss Spears question that there are other RT's operating in the U.S.
[33:36.960 --> 33:38.960]  Can you describe them, list them?
[33:38.960 --> 33:39.960]  Sure, thank you.
[33:39.960 --> 33:50.960]  So you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[33:50.960 --> 33:54.960]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.960]  I know you're going to stop tyranny.
[34:00.960 --> 34:04.960]  George Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role on the Trump campaign?
[34:04.960 --> 34:08.960]  I'm not going to talk about any particular person here today, Mr. Schiff.
[34:08.960 --> 34:13.960]  This bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped,
[34:13.960 --> 34:16.960]  which developed on the kind of fringe right-wing media.
[34:16.960 --> 34:20.960]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then sort of saying,
[34:20.960 --> 34:24.960]  oh look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[34:24.960 --> 34:30.960]  And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing InfoWars.
[34:30.960 --> 34:37.960]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[34:37.960 --> 34:38.960]  Same answer.
[34:38.960 --> 34:42.960]  We're going to start shutting Alex Jones and others down, and we're going to sue him,
[34:42.960 --> 34:45.960]  and we're going to have the Justice Department come after him.
[34:45.960 --> 34:48.960]  And get this, folks, they can shut us down your next.
[34:48.960 --> 34:55.960]  I think it's really important as we sit here that we explain this to the American people in a way that they can understand it.
[34:55.960 --> 34:57.960]  We are at war with Russia.
[34:57.960 --> 35:05.960]  So would you say that Russia engaged in hybrid warfare in its effort to undermine our democratic process
[35:05.960 --> 35:08.960]  and engage in our electoral process?
[35:08.960 --> 35:09.960]  Director Comey.
[35:09.960 --> 35:18.960]  They engaged in a multifaceted campaign of active measures to undermine our democracy and hurt one of the candidates
[35:18.960 --> 35:20.960]  and hope to help one of the other candidates.
[35:20.960 --> 35:25.960]  I actually think that their engagement was an act of war.
[35:25.960 --> 35:27.960]  You said we were attacked by Russia.
[35:27.960 --> 35:28.960]  That's not a small thing.
[35:28.960 --> 35:29.960]  Yes.
[35:29.960 --> 35:33.960]  An attack doesn't just invite a counterattack, it demands one.
[35:33.960 --> 35:35.960]  Else you reveal your fundamental weaknesses and get attacked again.
[35:35.960 --> 35:39.960]  Never in the history of our elections has a country attacked us the way that Russia has.
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.960]  I think before government officials change our foreign policy and declare war against a sovereign country,
[35:45.960 --> 35:50.960]  as you are attempting to do, we citizens have a right to know on what basis you're doing that.
[35:50.960 --> 35:57.960]  If there is objection, and I note the senator from Kentucky on the floor, I will say before I read this,
[35:57.960 --> 36:02.960]  if there is objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.
[36:02.960 --> 36:10.960]  You're achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small country that has already been the subject of attempted coup.
[36:10.960 --> 36:18.960]  If they object, they are now carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.
[36:18.960 --> 36:19.960]  Senator from Kentucky.
[36:19.960 --> 36:20.960]  I object.
[36:20.960 --> 36:22.960]  Objection is heard.
[36:22.960 --> 36:26.960]  The senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[36:26.960 --> 36:28.960]  You're carrying water for the Kremlin.
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.960]  I'm not carrying water for the Kremlin. You're a sitting member of Congress on the Intel Committee,
[36:33.960 --> 36:35.960]  and you can't say they hacked.
[36:35.960 --> 36:39.960]  You're going to have to move your shoulder to RT Russian television, because this is perfect.
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.960]  You know what? That's just so beneath your office, because it's so dumb, and you're being duplicitous.
[36:44.960 --> 36:48.960]  I'm asking you, did they hack Vanessa's e-mails, and you can't say it?
[36:48.960 --> 36:52.960]  You just said I was carrying water for Putin.
[36:52.960 --> 36:54.960]  Russian scum.
[36:54.960 --> 36:58.960]  Our battleships weren't sunk, and our towers didn't collapse a lot.
[36:58.960 --> 37:01.960]  2011 would make no mistake.
[37:01.960 --> 37:08.960]  2016 is a year that we should mark on our calendars, and it's still going on.
[37:08.960 --> 37:10.960]  The attack didn't end on election day.
[37:10.960 --> 37:17.960]  Donald John Trump, a man who, to borrow a phrase from another December long ago, will live in infamy.
[37:17.960 --> 37:25.960]  If we discover that Donald Trump are his advocates, played a role in helping to devise strategy,
[37:25.960 --> 37:31.960]  if they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary, if they're the ones who came up with she's ill,
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.960]  something's wrong with her energy, and the way that he basically described her in the campaign,
[37:38.960 --> 37:47.960]  I think that is something that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not she should be impeached.
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.960]  Okay, you just heard Maxine Waters, and she said if those Russians created that idea that Hillary was sick,
[37:53.960 --> 37:56.960]  and she's doing that, if you're not watching this, if you're listening to it on the radio,
[37:56.960 --> 38:00.960]  we've got the video B-roll that somebody, fortunately, standing there with an iPhone,
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.960]  saw Hillary Clinton collapsing on that 9-11 day, and they had to grab her by the arms and drag her into the car.
[38:06.960 --> 38:11.960]  Nobody created that. People recorded that. They recorded the reality of what's going on,
[38:11.960 --> 38:14.960]  and I guess when we see Maxine Waters tweeting out, get ready for impeachment,
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.960]  the news is that Maxine Waters can spell impeachment.
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.960]  This is a lady who doesn't know the difference between Korea and Crimea.
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.960]  Vladimir Putin invaded Korea, according to her, not Crimea, and she's even wrong about the Crimea thing.
[38:29.960 --> 38:39.960]  But look, this would be funny if it wasn't so serious. And when we look at Adam Schiff, and he was in the Comey Hill presentation,
[38:39.960 --> 38:46.960]  again, pushing this absurd Buzzfeed dossier, and Buzzfeed was attacked by everybody.
[38:46.960 --> 38:52.960]  Even the Hillary Clinton supporters, the press that was pushing Hillary Clinton and attacking Donald Trump,
[38:52.960 --> 38:59.960]  the never-Trump press attacked Buzzfeed for putting that out, and Buzzfeed never did any further articles on it.
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.960]  They've been sued by a Russian company that they named, and they explained it as well.
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.960]  It was just a rumor. We don't necessarily believe it, but we just thought even if it wasn't true,
[39:09.960 --> 39:14.960]  even if we hadn't vetted it, that our responsibility as a journalist was to put this out there.
[39:14.960 --> 39:21.960]  That's the absurdity of where we are. And of course, you heard Matt Armstrong saying that info war is with Russia.
[39:21.960 --> 39:27.960]  You heard the New York Times in that clip saying they took our headline, that Trump is being wiretapped.
[39:27.960 --> 39:34.960]  Shame on info wars. They cited our own headline, and now Trump is citing our headline.
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.960]  So that's the absurdity of this. You know, folks, what we've got here. You want a Russian connection?
[39:41.960 --> 39:49.960]  Let me give you an FBI Russian connection. The real Russian connection is between James Comey and Joseph Stalin.
[39:49.960 --> 39:56.960]  Joseph Stalin said, bring me the man. I'll find the crime. And that's the way the FBI is operating right now.
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.960]  When you go back and you look at the duplicitous nature of these so-called investigations that the FBI is doing,
[40:02.960 --> 40:09.960]  and the fact that they don't investigate known crimes, we know that somebody illegally leaked the information about Michael Flynn.
[40:09.960 --> 40:13.960]  Why aren't they investigating it? Well, they won't say. Why aren't they investigating the Clinton Foundation?
[40:13.960 --> 40:20.960]  Can't comment on that. The only thing that they'll investigate on is allegations that there are connections somehow with Trump.
[40:20.960 --> 40:29.960]  And now they are investigating info wars, Breitbart, RT saying, well, we think that maybe they had something to do with the timing
[40:29.960 --> 40:36.960]  of these Russian bots that were putting out articles, not even establishing the fact that there were articles that were being promoted by bots.
[40:36.960 --> 40:42.960]  They're trying to put this out there as if you didn't retweet this. If you're retweeting info wars articles, if you're reading that,
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.960]  no, you're not doing that. It's a Russian bot that's doing that. Our audience, those of you who are listening right now,
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.960]  we don't have anybody listening to us. It's simply Vladimir Putin and his Russian bots listening to us.
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.960]  That's the narrative that they want to put out there, attacking us, saying that we're using bots when, in fact, they're using bots.
[40:58.960 --> 41:07.960]  The night before they started this attack, I had a guy contact me on Twitter who puts a lot of our information out.
[41:07.960 --> 41:13.960]  And I know this guy. I know his name. I know he's not a bot. And he sends this information to me.
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.960]  He sends screenshots showing that he has been shut down on Facebook. Why?
[41:17.960 --> 41:25.960]  Because he shared a video that some teenager had done about Thomas Jefferson attacking the Barbary pirates.
[41:25.960 --> 41:31.960]  And he put, Jefferson goes to war against Islam because they were Islamic and they were enslaving people.
[41:31.960 --> 41:37.960]  And they were attacking ships that belong to America as well as to European countries.
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.960]  Most of the European countries wanted to just pay them tribute. Jefferson said, we're not going to pay them tribute.
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.960]  We're not going to pay them blackmail. We're going to shut them down. So that's part of the Marine Hymn.
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.960]  From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli. That's what that's talking about.
[41:53.960 --> 42:00.960]  But of course, if you talk about actual history and you use Islam as part of it, their bots will ban you.
[42:00.960 --> 42:07.960]  So they use bots to control, to censor the narrative. And yet they say, we had bots that were pushing our narrative.
[42:07.960 --> 42:15.960]  And therefore, according to Daily Call, there must have been a coordination between us and them, according to Daily Cause.
[42:15.960 --> 42:20.960]  That's the way this all works. But when you look at Comey and you look at what he did.
[42:20.960 --> 42:29.960]  And we've talked about this many times. The fact that he would say, we know that there were multiple felony violations of national security by Hillary Clinton.
[42:29.960 --> 42:39.960]  But don't you try this. That is outrageous. The man should be removed. He should be removed at this point for having said that, for having done that.
[42:39.960 --> 42:43.960]  And they went on to attack people before and after Hillary Clinton.
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.960]  Of course, we've talked to Thomas Drake, who's one of the NSA whistleblowers.
[42:47.960 --> 42:54.960]  It was the Obama administration that attacked more whistleblowers and journalists than all the other administrations for the last 100 years.
[42:54.960 --> 43:02.960]  On the basis of a 1917 law, it was the Obama administration that attacked them more than all the other administrations combined.
[43:02.960 --> 43:11.960]  They went after the NSA whistleblowers, tried to put them in jail, specifically Thomas Drake, creating information to try to frame him.
[43:11.960 --> 43:17.960]  And yet, and after this, we saw also the individual who took a couple of pictures inside a submarine.
[43:17.960 --> 43:20.960]  They said, well, that would have been known to be confidential information.
[43:20.960 --> 43:30.960]  So we're going to send you to jail for a couple of years. And yet, Hillary Clinton can leak out information with her careless disregard
[43:30.960 --> 43:37.960]  and flaunting the rules of national security of information that is not only top secret, but above top secret.
[43:37.960 --> 43:40.960]  And she gets away with it because of James Comey.
[43:40.960 --> 43:46.960]  When you have selective law enforcement, you don't have law enforcement. What you have is corruption.
[43:46.960 --> 43:56.960]  What you have is Stalin. We say we're not going to prosecute some individuals, but we will allege and imply that other people are criminals.
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.960]  And we will look at them with a microscope to try to find something on them. That is Stalin-esque.
[44:02.960 --> 44:06.960]  And what we have now is a politicized police state. We don't have law enforcement.
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.960]  And I'm going to step back for a moment from this whole Russian narrative and give you a different example.
[44:11.960 --> 44:16.960]  This is the Rockville Rape. And we look at what's going on in this Rockville Rape.
[44:16.960 --> 44:23.960]  And I want to play a clip Jack Passoviet got of a woman who identified herself as a former bleeding heart liberal.
[44:23.960 --> 44:30.960]  She was very concerned about what she heard at the school hearings where they were talking about what was going on there.
[44:30.960 --> 44:38.960]  Let's play that clip from her. And I'm going to tell you what they're doing there that is exactly the same thing that we're seeing now
[44:38.960 --> 44:42.960]  with the selective prosecution, I would say persecution by the FBI.
[44:42.960 --> 44:46.960]  Let's play that clip of what this lady says about the Rockville Rape.
[44:46.960 --> 44:51.960]  We found a very unsatisfying ourselves.
[44:51.960 --> 44:59.960]  Now I changed my position. I was against money. I thought the public school should get all the dollars.
[44:59.960 --> 45:03.960]  Now I'm thinking maybe people should be able to take their money and go to school wherever they want.
[45:03.960 --> 45:12.960]  Because this changed my mind about a lot of my attitudes, you know, as a former bleeding heart liberal.
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.960]  So yeah, it's a little differently now.
[45:16.960 --> 45:19.960]  So she's that fed up with the school administration that she says,
[45:19.960 --> 45:23.960]  Well, maybe we ought to be able to create different schools on our own.
[45:23.960 --> 45:29.960]  Well, that's not really the problem. The problem goes back to the border to the immigration issues.
[45:29.960 --> 45:35.960]  WND reported sanctuary policies have led to this brutal bathroom rape of a 14 year old schoolgirl.
[45:35.960 --> 45:43.960]  And if you don't know the story, it came out that this 14 year old girl was brutally raped by an 18 and a 17 year old.
[45:43.960 --> 45:50.960]  We're told we don't know because we don't know anything about these individuals because they just self immigrated into our country.
[45:50.960 --> 45:53.960]  These are foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing in our country.
[45:53.960 --> 46:00.960]  But because they are foreign citizens criminally trespassing known as undocumented immigrants by the Democrats.
[46:00.960 --> 46:05.960]  They get a free pass on certain things, especially in sanctuary cities.
[46:05.960 --> 46:11.960]  What they did was a anally orally and vaginally rape this young 14 year old girl in the restroom.
[46:11.960 --> 46:15.960]  And of course, they're saying that one of them is 18 years old and from Guatemala.
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.960]  Another one is 17 years old and from El Salvador.
[46:19.960 --> 46:24.960]  They were wanted by immigration and customs enforcement by ICE.
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.960]  And yet it's a sanctuary city sanctuary area in Montgomery.
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.960]  As a matter of fact, in Montgomery, as WND points out, it's not just the Montgomery County,
[46:35.960 --> 46:41.960]  but Maryland itself gives in state tuition to illegal alien college students.
[46:41.960 --> 46:47.960]  And its legislature is considering a bill that would declare Maryland the country's first sanctuary state.
[46:47.960 --> 46:51.960]  Not just a county, not just a city, but the entire state.
[46:51.960 --> 46:58.960]  They're going to give them in state tuition preference over even Americans who want to go to college in Maryland.
[46:58.960 --> 47:00.960]  Montgomery County is already a sanctuary county.
[47:00.960 --> 47:06.960]  They denied 63 ICE requests to turn over illegal alien criminals last year, reports Fox News.
[47:06.960 --> 47:10.960]  They should have been deported, but they were in there as freshmen.
[47:10.960 --> 47:11.960]  They're like ninth graders.
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.960]  So they're in there with 14, 15 year old kids, even though they are reportedly 17 or 18 years old.
[47:16.960 --> 47:18.960]  But we don't know how old they are.
[47:18.960 --> 47:21.960]  These kids could be 20, they could be 25.
[47:21.960 --> 47:22.960]  Who knows?
[47:22.960 --> 47:23.960]  We don't know who these people are.
[47:23.960 --> 47:26.960]  We're not allowed to ask if you ask, you're racist.
[47:26.960 --> 47:33.960]  So we have created this whole class of people who are protected just like Hillary Clinton and John Podesta are protected by the FBI.
[47:33.960 --> 47:41.960]  We now have so-called law enforcement in these sanctuary cities, counties, now, presumably a state,
[47:41.960 --> 47:46.960]  that protect these criminally trespassing foreign citizens.
[47:46.960 --> 47:52.960]  And there was an article over the weekend from the Washington Post behind the rise in seemingly chaotic MS-13 violence,
[47:52.960 --> 47:53.960]  a structured hierarchy.
[47:53.960 --> 48:00.960]  In other words, these people with MS-13, they have a structured hierarchy just like the mafia does.
[48:00.960 --> 48:03.960]  What would you do with a prosecutor?
[48:03.960 --> 48:06.960]  What would you do with a sheriff or a police chief who said,
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.960]  oh, we're not going to do anything with the mafia?
[48:11.960 --> 48:13.960]  Wouldn't you put them in jail along with the mafia?
[48:13.960 --> 48:14.960]  You should.
[48:14.960 --> 48:17.960]  You should remove them from office and put them in the jail where they belong.
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.960]  But of course, they're going to allow these criminal gangs to continue.
[48:22.960 --> 48:27.960]  And as they point out in this Washington Post story, this is all in Maryland where they want to make it a sanctuary state.
[48:27.960 --> 48:35.960]  They said a 34 year old was lured into the woods in suburban Maryland where a sealant's armed with knives that already dug his grave.
[48:35.960 --> 48:39.960]  A 22 year old also taken into a wooded area was ordered to his knees, shot in the face.
[48:39.960 --> 48:46.960]  An 18 year old ambushed near a stream was stabbed and stoned as he crawled into the water and died under the bridge of the Capitol Beltway.
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.960]  And oh, by the way, if you want to say this is racist, a lot of these people, most of these people are Hispanic
[48:52.960 --> 48:59.960]  because these are disputes and competitions within the gang and against other gangs that are happening there.
[48:59.960 --> 49:08.960]  They say the shocking slayings 18 months ago signaled a resurgence in Montgomery County, the same county where they had these two older kids,
[49:08.960 --> 49:15.960]  four or five years older than the other kids in their class, if they're telling the truth about their age, brutally raped this girl, gang raped her.
[49:15.960 --> 49:19.960]  But these slayings that I just told you happened in the same county.
[49:19.960 --> 49:21.960]  They were also done by MS-13.
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.960]  They say now the federal government is starting to look at racketeering cases against these people.
[49:25.960 --> 49:28.960]  Let's protect the borders.
[49:28.960 --> 49:34.960]  See, the sanctuary city stuff and the illegal immigration stuff as a report further on in the article from the Washington Post,
[49:34.960 --> 49:40.960]  MS-13 was formed in the 1980s in Los Angeles by El Salvadoran immigrants,
[49:40.960 --> 49:44.960]  foreign citizens, criminally trespassing in the United States.
[49:44.960 --> 49:46.960]  They said, we want to create a gang.
[49:46.960 --> 49:48.960]  Ostensibly, they take their sides.
[49:48.960 --> 49:50.960]  Well, they're being picked on by other gangs.
[49:50.960 --> 49:53.960]  So they created a gang for protection and then they went back to El Salvador.
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.960]  Whether or not that is true, this is a multinational gang that is going throughout the United States.
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.960]  It is not just a presence in Montgomery County, not just a presence in Maryland.
[50:05.960 --> 50:10.960]  They're also massive gang activity on Long Island, New York, where my wife grew up.
[50:10.960 --> 50:14.960]  A lot of the cities that she knew are now being overrun by MS-13.
[50:14.960 --> 50:22.960]  But in LA, in California, where this began, we see that the immigrant rights groups wanted to block the lists of gang members
[50:22.960 --> 50:25.960]  from the Trump administration after Donald Trump won the election.
[50:25.960 --> 50:28.960]  He said, the first thing we're going to do is get rid of the criminals, the gangs.
[50:28.960 --> 50:29.960]  That's what we really want to get rid of.
[50:29.960 --> 50:31.960]  And they're killing everyone.
[50:31.960 --> 50:35.960]  Without regard to your background or your race or your nationality or whatever,
[50:35.960 --> 50:36.960]  they're killing everyone.
[50:36.960 --> 50:37.960]  So we want to get rid of them.
[50:37.960 --> 50:41.960]  Well, the immigrant rights groups in California said, no, we don't want him to get those gang lists.
[50:41.960 --> 50:45.960]  We don't even want the MS-13 gang members deported.
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.960]  That is the special protection that is being given to people.
[50:49.960 --> 50:55.960]  And here in Travis County in Austin, Texas, our sheriff said, we're not going to turn over to ICE sexual offenders.
[50:55.960 --> 50:57.960]  Same thing that happened in Maryland.
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.960]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[50:59.960 --> 51:00.960]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[51:00.960 --> 51:03.960]  I am a former congressman, physician and presidential candidate.
[51:03.960 --> 51:05.960]  The world is in turmoil.
[51:05.960 --> 51:09.960]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars and famines are commonplace.
[51:09.960 --> 51:13.960]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[51:13.960 --> 51:17.960]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[51:17.960 --> 51:21.960]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[51:21.960 --> 51:24.960]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[51:24.960 --> 51:28.960]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[51:28.960 --> 51:30.960]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[51:30.960 --> 51:34.960]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[51:34.960 --> 51:39.960]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years.
[51:39.960 --> 51:41.960]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[51:41.960 --> 51:45.960]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[51:45.960 --> 51:52.960]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-763-5999.
[51:52.960 --> 51:58.960]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-763-5999.
[51:58.960 --> 52:02.960]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension or 401K?
[52:02.960 --> 52:07.960]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings
[52:07.960 --> 52:10.960]  because it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[52:10.960 --> 52:13.960]  It's a question of when. It's going to happen.
[52:13.960 --> 52:16.960]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.960]  safely and predictably every single year?
[52:18.960 --> 52:23.960]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008
[52:23.960 --> 52:26.960]  and they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[52:26.960 --> 52:29.960]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out
[52:29.960 --> 52:32.960]  even when stocks, real estate and other investments tumble.
[52:32.960 --> 52:36.960]  A free report detailing this savings program is now available.
[52:36.960 --> 52:39.960]  This free report shows how you can get guaranteed growth,
[52:39.960 --> 52:43.960]  equity and wealth building power without risking your retirement in the Wall Street Casino.
[52:43.960 --> 52:46.960]  This is the best way to have a 100% secure retirement.
[52:46.960 --> 52:50.960]  It far outperforms any IRA or 401K.

[54:12.960 --> 54:15.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[54:15.960 --> 54:19.960]  We're going to go back and take another look at this push by the AP,
[54:19.960 --> 54:22.960]  by the mainstream media against Paul Manafort,
[54:22.960 --> 54:25.960]  which is directly an attack on Donald Trump.
[54:25.960 --> 54:29.960]  And we're going to look at how they have completely ignored
[54:29.960 --> 54:33.960]  what John and Tony Podesta have done, completely ignored it.
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.960]  And the way that they're implying this about Paul Manafort,
[54:36.960 --> 54:40.960]  that he had a plan to benefit Putin and his government.
[54:40.960 --> 54:42.960]  Okay, we're going to dissect that here in just a moment.
[54:42.960 --> 54:46.960]  But before we do, it's very important that you stay in contact with us.
[54:46.960 --> 54:50.960]  As we were talking about before, they're accusing InfoWars and Breitbart
[54:50.960 --> 54:54.960]  of we didn't get traction until Russian bots started pushing our stories out there.
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.960]  They're the ones who are using bots to suppress information from us.
[54:58.960 --> 55:02.960]  So they accuse us of using bots to get our information out.
[55:02.960 --> 55:04.960]  It's exactly the opposite. That's what they do.
[55:04.960 --> 55:07.960]  Just as they created this organization as part of the NDAA,
[55:07.960 --> 55:10.960]  they said we're going to counter disinformation and propaganda.
[55:10.960 --> 55:13.960]  No, they're going to create disinformation and propaganda.
[55:13.960 --> 55:17.960]  Just as the Patriot Act was unpatriotic and an attack on the Bill of Rights.
[55:17.960 --> 55:20.960]  They always call it exactly the opposite of what it is.
[55:20.960 --> 55:24.960]  They always accuse you of doing what they're doing, of their MO,
[55:24.960 --> 55:28.960]  and ignore the crimes of Hillary Clinton, the crimes of John Podesta.
[55:28.960 --> 55:30.960]  So you need to stay in contact with us.
[55:30.960 --> 55:32.960]  You need to stay in contact with the truth media.
[55:32.960 --> 55:35.960]  We have a newsletter. It is a free newsletter.
[55:35.960 --> 55:38.960]  And in that newsletter, we'll also give you specials.
[55:38.960 --> 55:41.960]  Today, in today's newsletter, only in the newsletter, you'll see it,
[55:41.960 --> 55:45.960]  but I'm going to tell you about this right now as a sample of what you'll find in that newsletter.
[55:45.960 --> 55:48.960]  Not only the information that we can get directly to you,
[55:48.960 --> 55:52.960]  that's not going to be censored by Twitter, not going to be censored by Facebook,
[55:52.960 --> 55:57.960]  but also we have specials like the Republic Defense Force t-shirt, 50% off today.
[55:57.960 --> 55:59.960]  So each day there'll be little specials there.
[55:59.960 --> 56:03.960]  But most importantly, you will stay in contact, direct contact with us.
[56:03.960 --> 56:06.960]  It's a free newsletter that you can pick up at Infowars.
[56:06.960 --> 56:09.960]  Make sure you sign up for that at infowars.com.
[56:09.960 --> 56:12.960]  Infowars.com.
[56:12.960 --> 56:15.960]  Where you can sign up for that free newsletter.
[56:15.960 --> 56:17.960]  Also, I just want to remind you again,
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.960]  super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is now back in stock after having been sold out.
[56:22.960 --> 56:24.960]  I'm going to get my supply of that.
[56:24.960 --> 56:30.960]  And of course, it's very important not just as a great mouth freshener for your toothpaste,
[56:30.960 --> 56:33.960]  but it's also a mouth freshener because it gets rid of bacteria.
[56:33.960 --> 56:36.960]  And bacteria is a very important thing.
[56:36.960 --> 56:41.960]  It's not just going to rot your teeth, but it also has an effect on your cardiac health.
[56:41.960 --> 56:46.960]  It's very important, and there's been proven links that show that your oral health
[56:46.960 --> 56:51.960]  is tied to issues of heart attacks, blood clots, and other issues.
[56:51.960 --> 56:56.960]  So this has in it, in this toothpaste, you'll have peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver.
[56:56.960 --> 57:02.960]  There aren't any other toothpaste that I know that have nano-silver and iodine in them.
[57:02.960 --> 57:05.960]  Or even peppermint oil, for there might be some natural toothpaste that have peppermint oil,
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.960]  but they don't put nano-silver in it.
[57:07.960 --> 57:12.960]  That's what gets rid of the harmful bacteria in your face and your mouth
[57:12.960 --> 57:16.960]  that endangers your health throughout the rest of your body.
[57:16.960 --> 57:20.960]  All right, I want to get back to this Podesta story that is coming out.
[57:20.960 --> 57:24.960]  And I'm calling it the Podesta story because that's really the dog that hasn't barked.
[57:24.960 --> 57:26.960]  What the mainstream media will not cover.
[57:26.960 --> 57:29.960]  First of all, we've got AP coming out and saying Manifold had a plan.
[57:29.960 --> 57:32.960]  No, this is something that happened 10 years ago.
[57:32.960 --> 57:35.960]  It had no bearing on this relationship, on this election here.
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.960]  But he had a plan to benefit the Putin government.
[57:38.960 --> 57:44.960]  Well, as he pointed out, the person that he worked with was a Russian billionaire.
[57:44.960 --> 57:49.960]  They say, according to AP and CNN, that he had close ties to Putin.
[57:49.960 --> 57:53.960]  But it wasn't a company that was owned or founded by Putin.
[57:53.960 --> 57:58.960]  It wasn't owned by the Russian government like the company that John Podesta worked with.
[57:58.960 --> 58:01.960]  John Podesta worked with a company called Rossnano.
[58:01.960 --> 58:06.960]  It was a state run. It's Russian run. It's run by the Russian government.
[58:06.960 --> 58:09.960]  That's who he was a lobbyist for. And it wasn't 10 years ago.
[58:09.960 --> 58:13.960]  It was five years ago that John Podesta and his brother were working in it.
[58:13.960 --> 58:17.960]  It was a company that was founded by Vladimir Putin.
[58:17.960 --> 58:19.960]  And they won't talk about that.
[58:19.960 --> 58:22.960]  Do you understand the double standard that's going on here?
[58:22.960 --> 58:29.960]  Do you understand that this information that AP is running with was put out by a Ukrainian lawmaker?
[58:29.960 --> 58:33.960]  Do you think the Ukrainians are trying to hack our election?
[58:33.960 --> 58:38.960]  Are they trying to depose our president? Are they interfering in our country?
[58:38.960 --> 58:40.960]  Think about that. We'll be right back.
[58:40.960 --> 58:49.960]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.960 --> 58:56.960]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic.

[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:19.960]  Give me liberty or give me death is Alex Jones.
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:32.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight. We have an update on the terror attack in London.
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  They're now reporting that two of the individuals that were run over by the car have now died.
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:44.960]  Others have catastrophic wounds. Another terror attack that was carried out by automobile by a four by four.
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.960]  They say a gray four by four crashed into the gates outside of Parliament.
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.960]  They mowed down a lot of pedestrians on the way to doing that.
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:56.960]  Then the individual got out with an eight inch knife, ran up to a policeman,
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:59.960]  stabbed him before being shot and killed by other policemen.
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.960]  This is being reported initially as we have a story by Kit Daniels.
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:08.960]  It was initially reported by CNN as being a firearms incident, a firearms incident.
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:14.960]  So you have someone carrying out all of the hallmarks of Islamic terror
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:18.960]  and in terms of vehicles in terms of knife attacks and so forth.
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:22.960]  The people who have the guns, the police who shot and killed this individual,
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:26.960]  then CNN focuses on it as a firearms attacks.
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:32.960]  It's not the terrorist, it's the evil guns that defended people from the terrorists that they focus on.
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:39.960]  And that's exactly what we're seeing here in this story that is being promoted throughout the mainstream media today about Paul Manafort.
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:44.960]  And without defending Paul Manafort, he could be guilty of connections.
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:50.960]  I don't know. I don't see though that he's done anything that John Podesta hasn't done.
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.960]  Isn't it interesting that they don't talk about John Podesta?
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  See, that's the double standard that we see here.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:01.960]  And that's how you know to first clue that this is politically motivated.
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:07.960]  The first clue that this is a Russian style FBI and press that we're dealing with.
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:09.960]  Bring me the man, I'll find the crime.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:14.960]  Let's get Paul Manafort because he's associated with Trump and then we can go after Trump later on.
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  Let's get Info Wars because they're associated with Trump, they supported Trump or Breitbart.
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:21.960]  And then we can go after Trump with that.
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:23.960]  That is what these people are doing.
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:29.960]  So you have a situation as I reported before and I'll talk about it later on if I'm still here.
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:33.960]  Alex is going to be coming in to take over the show in a little bit.
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:39.960]  But I want to also talk about the Obamacare vote that is coming up tomorrow.
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:46.960]  We have Rand Paul saying that there are easily 35 no votes against Obamacare 2.0.
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.960]  And people have called it Ryan Care.
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:50.960]  They've called it Ryan O. Care.
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:53.960]  We're going to break down the details of this on the other side of the break,
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:58.960]  but you have to understand Paul Ryan was the running mate of Mitt Romney.
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:01.960]  Mitt Romney had already done Obamacare in Massachusetts.
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:02.960]  It was Romney Care.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:05.960]  He put it together with Ted Kennedy of all people.
[1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:08.960]  And as he was running for president against Barack Obama,
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:13.960]  people rightfully pointed out that they were each calling for the same thing in 2012.
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:17.960]  And Paul Ryan was his running mate at the time.
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:23.960]  You see, the fix was in. The establishment had decided that they were going to put in Obamacare.
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:27.960]  And they were going to make sure that happened whether or not it was a Democrat or a Republican.
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:31.960]  Whether it was Barack Obama or whether it was Mitt Romney,
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:36.960]  the establishment was going to get a government takeover of your healthcare.
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:38.960]  And that's why they are fighting this so hard.
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:43.960]  Because the establishment still wants a bailout of insurance companies.
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.960]  And of course, one of the things has come out, we've got a couple of articles that are up on Dredge Report.
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:52.960]  In the last minutes here, what we're seeing is, as they're rushing this through,
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:04:00.960]  we see that millions of veterans could be ineligible to receive tax credits under this new Obamacare plan that they've got.
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.960]  They say late Monday night, leadership staff put out a 22-page technical amendment to the bill.
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:12.960]  And in their haste, they introduced language that could keep as many as 7 million veterans from participating in the GOP healthcare program.
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:19.960]  Whether by design or accident, leadership staffers struck that language that would have protected VA benefits.
[1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:25.960]  Now retired service members qualify only if they are not eligible for other types of government healthcare.
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:29.960]  So they put in some changes at the last minute, remove millions of veterans.
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:30.960]  But guess what?
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:36.960]  They also put in some changes at the last minute that took out the cuts for illegal immigrants.
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:41.960]  So illegal immigrants get coverage but not the veterans because of these last minute changes.
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  Do you see how this is happening?
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:49.960]  How many times have we seen veterans and American citizens and people who are citizens of this country not get tuition,
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:54.960]  not get healthcare, not get benefits from the government, but we give it to illegal aliens?
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:05:20.960]  This is just one of the issues. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:28.960]  You mentioned in your answer to I think the sphere's question that there are other RT's operating in the U.S.
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:30.960]  Can you describe them?
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:39.960]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, and then I think you have them feeding other entities. InfoWars comes to mind.
[1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:42.960]  Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:55.960]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory that far-right news organizations like InfoWars took action to assist Russian operatives to help Trump win the election.
[1:05:55.960 --> 1:06:20.960]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:26.960]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:32.960]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:35.960]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:39.960]  We're the solution. Americans. Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[1:06:39.960 --> 1:06:48.960]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Office General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:54.960]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Americans need to see this film.
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:58.960]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:05.960]  The reason InfoWars Live has five star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:11.960]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[1:07:11.960 --> 1:07:16.960]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:22.960]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good.
[1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:25.960]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:34.960]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my super-female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:41.960]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:43.960]  So obviously, a super-female is amazing. I love it.
[1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:47.960]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2.
[1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:53.960]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2.
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:08:10.960]  It's got a five-star rating. It's a win-win InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:21.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:24.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host.
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:29.960]  I want to talk about Obamacare because we've got a vote that is coming up in the next 24 hours.
[1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:32.960]  We've been told we had Rand Paul go on and talk to Lou Dobbs.
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:40.960]  I want to play that clip for you. He says unless things are changed radically in the next 24 hours, he said there are 35 votes against right now.
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:44.960]  It's not going to pass. Here's what he had to say to Lou Dobbs.
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:47.960]  Let's start with the president calling you out nicely.
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:55.960]  He seems to be a Rand Paul fan. He likes you very much. He would like your vote. Is he going to get it?
[1:08:55.960 --> 1:09:00.960]  Well, you know, I have a lot in common with the president that we both ran on repealing Obamacare.
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:07.960]  Conservatives across the country, we won in 2010, 2014, and again in 2016 on repealing Obamacare.
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:14.960]  So I think that brings us all together. But we ran on repealing it, not replacing it with Obamacare Lite.
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:22.960]  And I think Paul Ryan's plan, one, won't fix the problems. I think it will continue to allow the insurance premiums to skyrocket.
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:29.960]  And I just don't think it really fixes the problems. And we didn't run on replacing Obamacare with Obamacare Lite.
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:36.960]  So I'm a no vote and will continue to be. I think there are enough conservatives in the House to bring this to a halt.
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:42.960]  And my prediction is that Ryan will pull the bill within the next 24 hours or he'll take a vote and he'll lose.
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:48.960]  At that point, conservatives will have earned a seat at the table and then we can negotiate on a real repeal.
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:54.960]  And we should replace it with market forces that bring the price of insurance down.
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.960]  Absolutely. When you look at what Donald Trump ran on, he ran on, as he said, repeal.
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:06.960]  But he also ran on market forces replacing this, giving people purchasing power by giving them tax credits, health savings accounts,
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:14.960]  giving them competition with insurance companies being able to compete across state lines, giving them information about costs,
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.960]  about success rates on different procedures, different doctors, different hospitals.
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:22.960]  We need to have information. We need to have purchasing power and we need to have competition.
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:26.960]  All of those things were part of Donald Trump's package.
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  But we have to be suspicious of Paul Ryan. And there are many details in here that look like this is nothing but a continuation of Obamacare.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:46.960]  And as I said in the last segment, it was Mitt Romney who had a plan that was exactly identical to Obamacare in Massachusetts,
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:51.960]  as governor that he put together with Ted Kennedy. The fix was in four years ago.
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:56.960]  We were going to get Obamacare or we were going to get Romneycare and they were the same thing.
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:02.960]  And now we have Mitt Romney's running mate who is trying to run interference against any kind of repeal,
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:05.960]  certainly against any kind of substantive change.
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  The goal here is not just to do something quickly.
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:13.960]  The goal is to repeal this, to get rid of this.
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:20.960]  You have to understand that if we just make some little minor tweaks to it around the edges, that this thing is going to be firmly entrenched.
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:26.960]  We've already got something here that is less than four years old and people are saying no, no, it's too ingrained in people's lives.
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:29.960]  We can't get rid of it. That's the way these programs work.
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:35.960]  Remember, it was Ronald Reagan who said he was going to get rid of the Department of Education that had been recently created by Jimmy Carter.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:37.960]  It was less than four years old at the time.
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.960]  But instead of getting rid of it, it was firmly entrenched.
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  It was magnified. It got larger and larger and the inefficiencies of Obamacare.
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  We should say Obama tax because it is a tax.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:55.960]  This attacks on medical devices. This attacks on consumers forcing us to buy something from private suppliers.
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:12:00.960]  It is unconstitutional regardless of what Roberts says.
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:05.960]  And of course, he wrote the dissenting and consenting opinions, both sides of these opinions.
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:10.960]  We've said many times, I believe, that he was blackmailed by somebody.
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:14.960]  I don't understand how he could write both sides of the opinion.
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:16.960]  On the one hand, he's arguing with himself here.
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:19.960]  But look, let's understand just how bad this bill is.
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:24.960]  There's a couple of articles that are up on the Drudge Report talking about last minute changes that they've made.
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  Millions of veterans, up to 7 million veterans, could be ineligible to receive tax credits under this Republican plan
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:34.960]  because of last minute changes that were just put in.
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:42.960]  So the veterans would be taken out if they would only qualify if they are not eligible for any other kind of government healthcare.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:53.960]  So they would be taken off of these qualifications to get some of the benefits of this new Romney care.
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:13:04.960]  On the other hand, some other last minute changes were put in that would allow illegal immigrants to continue getting federal healthcare subsidy.
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:07.960]  See, this is the insanity of this.
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:10.960]  And the details really do matter.
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:12.960]  It's important that we get this right.
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:13.960]  It's important that we repeal it.
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:15.960]  That's the first thing we have to get right.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:17.960]  And then we can talk about what we replace it with.
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:27.960]  Just last week, we had the Congressional Budget Office say that a full repeal of Obamacare would result in less Americans losing their insurance
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:30.960]  than Paul Ryan's Obamacare light plan.
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:31.960]  Why is it?
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:36.960]  Well, that's because Obamacare light that were being given by Paul Rhino,
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:42.960]  that is going to continue these inefficiencies down the road and it is going to bankrupt these insurance companies.
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:45.960]  We just had a couple of insurance companies who were trying to merge.
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:48.960]  We had Etna and Humana were trying to merge.
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:49.960]  They're losing money.
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:51.960]  Humana got out of the marketplace.
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:53.960]  They said, we can't stay in this Obamacare marketplace.
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:54.960]  We're losing too much money.
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:55.960]  They're trying to merge.
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  You're trying to create a too big to fail scenario, just like we saw with the banks.
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:03.960]  Once they get too big to fail, these insurance companies who are losing money, they can merge together.
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:10.960]  Then they can come to the government and say, you have to bail us out because we're key to your Obamacare program.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.960]  We don't want to see that happen.
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:19.960]  And if we continue with the essence of Obamacare, as Paul Ryan wants to do, that's what they want to do with Mitt Romney,
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  with Paul Ryan, these people are part of the establishment.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.960]  Whether they're Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter.
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  So it's very important that the conservatives hang together.
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  You need to talk to your conservative representative and tell them you do not want Obamacare to continue.
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:36.960]  And that is precisely what they are doing.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:43.960]  There was an editorial by Rand Paul, and it was last Friday, I think, or Thursday.
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:44.960]  It was on Breitbart.
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:51.960]  He said, look, I'm kind of a half glass, half full guy, but what we need to do is we need to smash this thing to smithereens
[1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.960]  because there's too much that's bad in it.
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:15:01.960]  And in this editorial, he pointed out that for four straight elections, Republicans ran on repealing Obamacare.
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:05.960]  But now we want to continue insurance subsidies.
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:07.960]  We want to continue mandates.
[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:08.960]  We want to continue taxes.
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:13.960]  We want to continue bailouts for these insurance companies that are also failing.
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:14.960]  It's a bad deal for everybody.
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:17.960]  It's a bad deal for the medical device manufacturers.
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:18.960]  They're being taxed.
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:19.960]  That raises the cost.
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:24.960]  That doesn't provide more health care for anybody when you tax people and raise their costs.
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:26.960]  They're going to pass that along to you.
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:28.960]  It's going to make it more difficult for you.
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  So he says, when did Republicans, this is Rand Paul, asking these questions, very good questions.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:41.960]  When did Republicans begin to believe that insurance companies should be put on the dole, that they should be bailed out when their customers become sick?
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:51.960]  When did Republicans begin to believe that the federal government should force you to pay a penalty to a private insurance company if you can't afford insurance?
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:52.960]  Let me repeat that.
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.960]  Why should you have to pay a penalty to a private insurance company because you can't afford insurance?
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:00.960]  See, that's what's in this bill.
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:03.960]  That's what Paul Ryan is propagating.
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:06.960]  It was Romney, Ryan, Obama, all of them the same.
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:07.960]  Ted Kennedy.
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:11.960]  This is being propagated by the establishment of both parties.
[1:16:11.960 --> 1:16:17.960]  We do not need to fall in line on this simply because we've got to get something done.
[1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:21.960]  And we've got to mark off a checklist item saying, hey, I did something about Obamacare.
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:24.960]  No, we need to do the right thing about Obamacare.
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:34.960]  Rand Paul goes on to say, when did Republicans begin to believe that we should levy a special tax penalty on those who choose to buy really good health insurance?
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:37.960]  He said, the current Ryan plan Obamacare light is not about patients.
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:39.960]  It's not about better health care.
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:41.960]  It isn't about lowering costs.
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:43.960]  He goes on to say, it's plain and simple.
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:49.960]  It's about getting more money to the insurance companies and running more of your life from Washington.
[1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:50.960]  It is a tax.
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:51.960]  It is a mandate.
[1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:52.960]  We don't need this.
[1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:55.960]  He says, insurance is not the same as health care.
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:56.960]  You have to understand that.
[1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:05.960]  Going back to the Department of Education, we have to understand that there's a difference between education and the institutions that we create to help give us an education.
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:08.960]  So there's a difference between your education and the school.
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:12.960]  There's a difference between getting educated and having a Department of Education.
[1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.960]  One does not necessarily lead to the other.
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:20.960]  Having health insurance, having Obamacare does not give you health care.
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:24.960]  So we need to be looking at ways that we can get more affordable health care.
[1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:35.960]  We need to look at ways that we can educate people better and not ways that we can preserve the Department of Education or ways that we can preserve the current school system or ways that we can preserve Obamacare.
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:37.960]  That's not the goal here.
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  And so many times we get caught up in these institutional boxes that we've created and we can't think outside of those boxes as to what the original goal was, what the true purpose of those institutions are.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.960]  If they're not serving those purposes, they need to go.
[1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:53.960]  Remember the Declaration of Independence.
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:56.960]  Governments are instituted to protect our individual liberties.
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:02.960]  When they don't do that, it is not only our right but our duty to alter or abolish those institutions.
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:08.960]  And that's all these institutions, every government institution, and that certainly includes Obamacare.
[1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:11.960]  Obamacare is not doing what it's supposed to.
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:13.960]  Obamacare is destroying our liberty.
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:20.960]  It is our right and it is our duty to abolish Obamacare.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:22.960]  Let's declare independence from it.
[1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:28.960]  Rand Paul went on to say, I'm sick of insurance companies putting me on hold telling me to talk to their representative in a foreign country.
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:30.960]  He said, screw that.
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  I want to let every American be able to join a co-op to buy their healthcare.
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:37.960]  When that happens, the buying power returns to the patients.
[1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:39.960]  Let me tell you what I do.
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:41.960]  And there's multiple organizations that do this.
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:43.960]  We work with Samaritan Ministries.
[1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:45.960]  There's also Christian Care Metashare.
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:49.960]  There's also one that's not Christian called Liberty and I don't know the exact title of it.
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:55.960]  But if you get together in a co-op to buy health insurance, okay, we're not buying health insurance.
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:19:01.960]  There's a catastrophic healthcare clause that's there for the people.
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:04.960]  If you have cancer or something, that kicks in for the members.
[1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:08.960]  But what you're basically doing is you're sharing your costs with other people.
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:10.960]  It's a great idea.
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:12.960]  You are a cash patient.
[1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:18.960]  And when you negotiate with the doctors as a cash patient, even the LA Times,
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:21.960]  which supports the government running and controlling your healthcare,
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.960]  even the LA Times in an article a couple of years ago, did a study and they said,
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:30.960]  we looked at these cash patients who went to the doctors and hospitals for these procedures.
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:34.960]  And we compared it to people who had full-boat insurance.
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:39.960]  And we found that the people who had insurance were actually paying more by just paying their deductible.
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:44.960]  Their deductible costs were higher than what the cash patients were paying.
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:50.960]  In addition, there were a lot of unnecessary tests and other things that were being added to the bill because you had insurance.
[1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:53.960]  So you need to think outside of the box.
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:56.960]  You now have the ability that you can use these co-ops.
[1:19:56.960 --> 1:20:00.960]  You should investigate that for the most part, but talk to your representative will be right.
[1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:03.960]  It can seem endless. There's a new kind of storm brewing.
[1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:08.960]  One that could target our nation's power grid and turn off the power for not just days, but for months or longer.
[1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:12.960]  Veteran news anchor Ted Koppel's new book, Lights Out, details this exact scenario.
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:16.960]  And CENTCOM General Lloyd Austin says, it's not a question of if, but when.
[1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:24.960]  That's why Americans are rushing to secure solar power generators to provide an endless supply of life-saving electricity without gas, fumes or noise.
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:27.960]  And the breakthrough Patriot Power Generator 1500 has it all.
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:34.960]  Portable and lightweight, providing up to 1500 continuous watts of clean, quiet and free renewable solar power.
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:40.960]  If a blackout strikes, you'll have power for heat, lights, cell phones and computers and critical medical devices.
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:42.960]  All from the rechargeable solar power.
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:47.960]  Our first introduction sold out fast and with high demand, we can't guarantee keeping the supply in stock.
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:49.960]  Stay protected with the power you need.
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:51.960]  The Patriot Power Generator 1500.

[1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:25.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to be connecting to Alex Jones in just one moment, and we're going to have him on the line.
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:39.960]  He wants to comment about developments today. We have a very, very heavy news day. Again, we talked to Roger Stone earlier about what is truly behind these attacks on Donald Trump on Roger Stone on Info Wars.
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:57.960]  This is a spy group, as he pointed out, in the State Department. Do we have Alex on the line here? Alex has breaking news. Let's go to Alex right now. Alex?
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:05.960]  David, thank you so much for the great work you and the whole crew are doing. Again, this is beyond a spy novel. It's beyond Hollywood, and we're all right in the middle of it.
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:27.960]  Remember back on December 6th, Obama signed the NDAA with the Defense Authorization Act 2017, and it said it created a Ministry of Truth with the Board of Governors of the FCC and the CIA with the Pentagon, actively going to war with independent news in the United States.
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:37.960]  In some of those hearings they previously had, they listed Breitbart and Info Wars. Now remember, there aren't more patriotic, hardcore Americana groups out there than Info Wars and Breitbart.
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:47.960]  That's just incontrovertible. Now all this is happening, and I kept pointing out, Trump's got to kill this. Trump's got to kill this. Trump's got to come in and kill that office as soon as he gets in.
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:26:00.960]  Of course, then they'll say, oh, you're killing our investigation to Russians. So that's the perfect globalist takeover plan, is they put a rogue group in there, funded the NDAA for hundreds of millions of dollars, and now you're seeing it launch.
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  Then last week, they have the outgoing head of the Board of Governors, Mr. Armstrong, say, not I'm under investigation for being a Russian asset.
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:20.960]  Like the news is saying, and McClatchy is saying off the congressional reports, but that we are, you know, Russian operatives. I mean, this is incredible. None of us get called before the Congress.
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:29.960]  None of us get called on the shows. I talked to a person earlier who was on Charlie Rose, and I brought out the whole new NSA documents, cut out of Charlie Rose.
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:45.960]  There is a total blackout on this. So what I'm hitting at here is the magnitude of this, that we have the State Department in open mutiny against the president, set up by Obama, who admits he put all these sleeper groups in agencies to block America, getting out of the new world war,
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:56.960]  to block America, turning our energy back on, and cutting taxes for the middle class poor people, and, you know, skyrocketing the stock market, and coming roaring back from your death.
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:08.960]  This is the key group that is coordinating. We already knew it, but now it's documented. Now Trump's been in six or seven days, and they are coordinating out of that office with Congress publicly.
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:28.960]  And John McCain, to say that Senator Rand Paul is an agent of, that Alex Jones is an agent of, not dudes, not, no, no, no, not, not quizzing agents, and that next, it'll be Donald John Trump. They are building, building, building, building.
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:39.960]  And we've caught them, of course, in the WikiLeague 12.7, with the systems in place to break into Trump Tower computers with malware, make it look like Russian connections, that's now come out.
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:49.960]  Same thing over and over again. Guaranteed that the Mexico plan with malware at Breitbart, malware, whatever you call it, in the infowars, you name it.
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:28:01.960]  That's going to be the type of connections they claim that, oh, they're secret servers, and things to the order from the Russians, and Nancy Pelosi and others have let this out, saying, oh, my God, and it's those matching orders.
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:12.960]  Trump actually gets direct daily orders from Putin, who gives him ideas like drain the swamp, drain the swamps a hundred-year-old-plus term using the United States, also using Scotland.
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:23.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're now saying, again, the left always attacks language. They're now saying that literal language about Hillary being crooked is a Russian spy agency.
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:30.960]  So just like they try to demonize language, and the term father, mother, Christ, all this, they know what they're doing.
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:39.960]  They're actually going in and waging war against communication, against even talking and claiming the alphabet is Russian spy.
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:49.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, but here's the key. We have identified the spy network that is operating against the country. It's hiding in plain view.
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:57.960]  It is there to literally shut down the free press in America. Hillary had said that they were going to do that once she got in, but they failed.
[1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:03.960]  So we are in such an epic battle. They are moving forward as if they're intending to topple Trump. They're not going to stop. They're the violent ones.
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:09.960]  They're the aggressive ones. They're the ones that are engaged in all the crime, all the setups, the documents are admitted.
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:17.960]  In Vault 7 that they're planning malware, planning viruses to frame people and blame Russia. This is absolutely incredible.
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:22.960]  And then, David, we'll talk more about the next segment when you get back to the important work you're doing.
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:28.960]  They're having Google and everybody gain the web against us with bots and claiming we have bots. This is incredible.
[1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:33.960]  We'll be right back with David Knight in studio on Alex Jones via the phone. Stay with us.
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:04.960]  President Donald Trump and Info Wars have been accused of espionage.
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:20.960]  During this week's Senate hearings on Russian hacking, the establishment Democrats in rogue intelligence heads attempted to frame Donald Trump and Info Wars for colluding with the Russians in violating the National Defense Authorization Act.
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:30.960]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to I think the sphere's question that there are other RT's operating in the U.S. Can you describe them with some?
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:39.960]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, and then I think you have them feeding other entities. Info Wars comes to mind.
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:42.960]  Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:55.960]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory that far-right news organizations like Info Wars took action to assist Russian operatives to help Trump win the election.
[1:30:55.960 --> 1:31:24.960]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:31.960]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:38.960]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor. It works.
[1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:46.960]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest-level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:55.960]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family and finance the InfoWars against the globalists all at the same time.
[1:32:55.960 --> 1:33:17.960]  A total 360 win.
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:35.960]  The bottom line, everything we've warned up for 20-plus years is now coming true.
[1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:42.960]  Because it was always being developed, it was being set up, we are in a highly engineered planned world now.
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:48.960]  And so that's how everything I've told you is now happening because it's like blueprints for a house.
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:59.960]  And I can tell you how the house is going to look down to the color paint that's going to be on the walls and what type of roof it's going to have and what type of electrical outlet it's going to have and what type of chimney it's going to have.
[1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:07.960]  So listen, this is not my opinion. This is not my opinion. I'm not here dramatizing this like all the other people that make up crap in the false reality.
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:21.960]  In mainstream media, they create a whole complex of lies and prop each other up. We're giving you their stated facts because in their battle memos and in their funding under law, they've got to say what they're doing.
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:28.960]  Well, they put deep state networks hiding in plain view in every major agency commanded by the State Department.
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:38.960]  And the people on that committee and on that group that Rob do, and of course, David and I were exposing last night so well, we need to go into all that more here.
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:54.960]  They admit their goal is to demonize the free press and call us foreign assets and use foreign designations to literally define us as the enemy soldiers.
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  Because we're the real Americans trying to kick out the alien globalist program that's so alien to our people.
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:08.960]  Understand, ladies and gentlemen, this is the story that has to get out. Notice our NSA story came out.
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:17.960]  And he got picked up by World End Alien a few other places because drugs went to it and then he got buried by Google Results completely banned out of the news section,
[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:28.960]  driven down many pages in the web section. I mean, I can't tell people the behind the scenes stuff that's going on, but just understand this, ladies and gentlemen, this country is in the greatest battle.
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:40.960]  It's ever been these criminals in hijacked the country. They put the people to sleep. And we're seeing a real move by Rex Tillerson and President Trump and others to just ignore NATO that's totally globalist and communist now.
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:47.960]  Go right to Russia in that new alliance because China is about to start a war. And we can get Russia on our side. China will be checkmated.
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:54.960]  But China's arrogant. They think they can make a run at us, folks. We're in so much trouble. Your families are in so much danger.
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:36:05.960]  And the fact that they would come out and be so bold to say, when Paul, because he works for Putin, just shows these people are never going to stop.
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:16.960]  So we have to start having a public debate about what, as Americans, we're going to do against this globalist beachhead because this is the very definition of a foreign power, a foreign multinational system.
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:25.960]  This is the 21st century war, globalism. And it's dying. It's failing everywhere. They think if they can defeat us here in America, this is their Stalingrad.
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:37.960]  If they can defeat us here, folks, they win. And that's why they're now going to use intimidation. And that's why they're going to use demonization against them full wars and against Breitbart and against President Trump and against
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:57.960]  President Reagan and against Judge Napolitano, anybody that stands with the president, anybody that speaks out, they now keep it hired basically. And it was all a hoax. Now that was true, more fakeness. You see, takes off a couple of days, because that's just placing New Jersey.
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:02.400]  Everybody to get in line. I know mainstream reporters. They're scared. They know the truth
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:05.880]  I don't see they apologize and say they got to feed their families folks
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:10.720]  This country is overrun by criminals and we are in the desperate straits right now
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:14.480]  And say that I
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:20.680]  Criminal coordination
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:26.760]  In criminal coordination helps when they start making charges like that that could never be proven or totalized
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:32.240]  The next step is killing people just like I told you with Roger Stone
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:36.920]  They make accusations that will destroy them if we get our day in court
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:40.280]  They don't let that happen. They think they announced
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:45.720]  You've been you know caught with child porn or drugs or whatever it is to chip with heroin for you know
[1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:48.840]  Tell them with a hooker they run into you with a car when you're on the street
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:53.760]  They put polonium in your drink. This is standard. These people are operating in America right now
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:58.800]  Most of the intelligence agencies are aware of it. They're trying to leak everything they can good patriots
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:03.320]  We call seven a few weeks ago to try to expose this thing when they're saying Trump isn't being surveilled
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:08.880]  And then ball seven come down the shows everybody's being surveilled. That's how dumb they think you are. These are desperate
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:13.840]  I cannot tell you when you look at these people on TV at CNN MSNBC
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:20.600]  They couldn't take their jobs. They're at that high level unless they loathe you want to feed the low level people know
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:24.800]  It's a fraud. I don't know what's doing scared, but those high-level people you see on CNN
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:30.600]  Imagine wanting to destroy freedom imagine hating Christians and funding radical Muslims all over to take over
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:34.240]  Imagine the magnitude of these people. So listen to me
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:36.840]  I need to spread our articles and videos more than ever
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:41.000]  They are putting the screws to us all over the place. They're trying to cut our funding
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.360]  They are trying to knock us off everywhere
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:49.040]  But they can't stop people sharing links and people sharing videos because of it backfires it backfires big
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:54.720]  Everybody knows you try to censor something and suppress it and it's the truth that it explodes
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:00.120]  They think though that you're so drunk on info that there's so much information out there that you won't take it serious
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:06.100]  When your future and your pre-speech has been stolen. We aren't champions front line against the globalist
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:11.440]  Front line in their face. I'm going in through and beyond. I'm never stopping. I'm never backing down
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:14.260]  We can defeat these people and that is the most important thing
[1:39:14.260 --> 1:39:18.660]  In the universe for us to do is to take on this evil because this is a safe message home
[1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:22.220]  And you make no mistake they make jokes about it when I say that because they know it's true
[1:39:22.220 --> 1:39:26.580]  You look at what they do and what they stand for they commit so much corruption evil
[1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:31.740]  You can't even follow it all. It's so bad because it's their nature and they want us so bad in the dark
[1:39:31.820 --> 1:39:37.060]  They want us under their control under their sick thumb. They are so twisted and evil
[1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:40.100]  I need everybody to financially support us more than ever
[1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:46.460]  Everybody needs the toothpaste. We've got that's the very best with iodine and colloidal silver in it at info wars life comm
[1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:53.040]  Everybody needs the supplements and the water filters and then the t-shirts that spread the word and then support free speech
[1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:58.460]  Everything we do is symbiotic. Everything we do is non-zero some game. We need you to go there
[1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:04.820]  We just sign up for auto ship and the commit to keep supporting us if just a fraction of the listeners actually watch something
[1:40:04.820 --> 1:40:10.740]  I could hire 20 30 more people and take on the enemy instead of just trying to hold the line and not to attract
[1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:15.180]  Under their attacks and I'm not bitching or complaining. I'm saying you want victory
[1:40:15.700 --> 1:40:21.700]  You want war against the globalism and the information war you want to defeat the corrupt establishment? We're doing it
[1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:26.780]  We're having victories, but we are under massive attacks like the element. Okay, just you know
[1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:30.060]  That's what happened to Trump. He's completely surrounded and that's the elbow
[1:40:30.060 --> 1:40:34.900]  We are in the Alamo ladies and gentlemen or in or you know, 300 whatever you want. That's it folks
[1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:38.820]  And again, it's going to physical from their perspective
[1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:45.940]  Committing all these massive crimes it's Trump right now doing all these horrible things all these dirty things thousands of times
[1:40:45.940 --> 1:40:52.360]  What's the Nixon? He has to sit there totally clean and not fight back in any way because the public is so
[1:40:52.860 --> 1:40:58.060]  Gray-washed. Oh, they know they want freedom and they want some lower taxes. They don't know how epic and historical
[1:40:58.060 --> 1:41:00.940]  This battle is I want to thank you all for your previous support your prayers
[1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:08.580]  That's most important and I want to ask you to understand you're in a war this war affects you and your family like nothing ever will again in your lives
[1:41:08.580 --> 1:41:12.420]  We are in the critical point. We are in
[1:41:13.140 --> 1:41:19.340]  What is you the rebirth of America and the rebirth of liberty and the Renaissance or a new nightmare global authoritarianism?
[1:41:19.340 --> 1:41:23.780]  It'll make Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong look like angels
[1:41:23.780 --> 1:41:26.780]  Folks, they think you're afraid
[1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:32.580]  They think that when I get on there and talk about this at least in the past that you were cowards and I was scaring you showed
[1:41:32.580 --> 1:41:35.420]  I was left on there. I've been told not killed now
[1:41:35.420 --> 1:41:41.340]  They don't know what to do because you weren't cowards and I knew you weren't I knew you were just like me our hearts are just a
[1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:47.780]  Like I think okay, what color you are where you came from if you hate the devil and you don't like these comebacks of her children
[1:41:47.860 --> 1:41:49.540]  And you are with us
[1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:55.300]  They hate Trump because he has a good heart. He's a good man. He's not out to get you and they want to kill him
[1:41:55.300 --> 1:41:59.780]  And they want to kill truth and they can take down our champion and his other defenders
[1:42:00.820 --> 1:42:02.940]  How do you say this in closing? I am so honored
[1:42:02.940 --> 1:42:07.100]  I am so honored to be one of the main champions for the restoration of republics
[1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:12.780]  And I'm honored to be attacked and I am honored that there's these snakes hate my guts, but I take I don't want to lose
[1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:17.260]  So realize the epic moment. We are in history. I want to salute our supporters and friends
[1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:21.060]  Oh, it's just it's just amazing kind of be alive big stuff's about to happen
[1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:24.620]  Good and evil are on the field right now and understand you are on the field
[1:42:24.980 --> 1:42:30.140]  Now we've got a montage of all the Russian hysteria to show you how evil these people are we're gonna play that than David
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:35.900]  And I could take over I'm Alex Jones signing off again from the hotlines of the info war, which is now becoming a hot war
[1:42:40.340 --> 1:42:42.340]  Answer to I think this
[1:42:42.340 --> 1:42:47.660]  All right, let's go ahead and run that clip that you got the montage
[1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:54.260]  This is a montage has been put together from the hearing some last couple of days and the people who have been calling on television
[1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:55.380]  accusing
[1:42:55.380 --> 1:43:00.220]  People like Tucker Carlson not just Rand Paul, but accusing Tucker Carlson of being a
[1:43:00.860 --> 1:43:07.260]  Russian agent anybody that disagrees with him. How is it that the American public can't see through these lies?
[1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:11.340]  I think many of you do I think you clearly understand and you understand what was behind
[1:43:11.340 --> 1:43:12.900]  The
[1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:16.180]  Accusation from John McCain as he accused Rand Paul of being
[1:43:16.700 --> 1:43:20.700]  Vladimir Putin you saw how that plays out and we're gonna play that clip for you here
[1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:27.060]  First he says anybody that disagrees with the idea that we ought to bring in Montenegro as a dependent on NATO as
[1:43:27.420 --> 1:43:32.340]  Another tripwire to put us into a potential war with Russia
[1:43:32.860 --> 1:43:38.940]  Anybody who opposes that is with Vladimir Putin. So if you disagree with me, I'm gonna accuse you of being a Russian agent
[1:43:38.940 --> 1:43:46.860]  Let's play that clip right now. Um, answer to I think Miss Spears question that there are other RT's operating in the US
[1:43:47.140 --> 1:43:50.420]  Can you describe them list them? Sure? Thank you. So
[1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:55.180]  You have RT you have Sputnik you have Rupley
[1:43:55.980 --> 1:43:58.900]  And then I think you have them feeding
[1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:01.540]  other entities
[1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:08.580]  Info wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers
[1:44:11.580 --> 1:44:14.780]  George Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role on the Trump campaign?
[1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:22.700]  I'm not gonna talk about any particular person here today, Mr. Schiff this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a
[1:44:23.060 --> 1:44:29.420]  Theory that he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe right-wing media and then after his tweet storm
[1:44:29.420 --> 1:44:33.660]  Info wars then started saying well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story
[1:44:33.980 --> 1:44:39.140]  Miss reading our story and now a few weeks later the White House and the president are citing
[1:44:40.340 --> 1:44:41.580]  Info wars
[1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:47.260]  Are you aware that mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[1:44:48.180 --> 1:44:52.980]  Same answer. We're gonna start shutting Alex Jones and others down and we're gonna sue them
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:44:58.860]  And we're gonna have the Justice Department come after him and get this folks they can shut us down your next
[1:44:58.860 --> 1:45:06.580]  You know, I think it's really important as we sit here that we explain this to the American people in a way that they can understand it
[1:45:06.580 --> 1:45:09.900]  We are at war with Russia. So would you say that?
[1:45:10.780 --> 1:45:17.620]  Russia engaged in hybrid warfare in its effort to undermine our democratic process and engage in
[1:45:17.980 --> 1:45:23.300]  Our electoral process director Comey. They engaged in a multifaceted
[1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:31.300]  A campaign of active measures to undermine our democracy and hurt one of the candidates and hope to help one of the other candidates
[1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:38.740]  I actually think that their engagement was an act of war. You said we were attacked by Russia
[1:45:38.740 --> 1:45:43.100]  That's not a small thing. Yes an attack doesn't just invite a counter attack
[1:45:43.100 --> 1:45:46.980]  It demands one else you reveal your fundamental weeks as I get attacked again
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:53.020]  Never in the history of our elections has a country attacked us the way that Russia has I think before government officials
[1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:58.020]  Change our foreign policy and declare war against a sovereign country as you are attempting to do
[1:45:58.300 --> 1:46:01.540]  We citizens have a right to know on what basis you're doing that
[1:46:02.180 --> 1:46:08.140]  If there is objection and I note the senator from Kentucky on the floor, I will say before I read this
[1:46:08.700 --> 1:46:10.700]  If there's objection
[1:46:10.700 --> 1:46:13.700]  You are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin
[1:46:14.100 --> 1:46:21.260]  You're achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small country that has already been the subject of attempted coup
[1:46:21.260 --> 1:46:27.740]  If they object, they are now carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin
[1:46:27.740 --> 1:46:31.940]  And I do not say that lightly senator from Kentucky. I object
[1:46:33.260 --> 1:46:40.180]  Objection is heard the center from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin. You're carrying water for the Kremlin
[1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:48.940]  You're sitting on the inside and you can't say they hacked you're gonna you're gonna have to move your shoulder to our teeth
[1:46:48.940 --> 1:46:57.140]  Russian television because it's so dumb and you're being deplicitus. I'm asking you did they hack
[1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:00.940]  That's like that Tucker you just said I was
[1:47:04.380 --> 1:47:09.300]  Russian scum our battleships weren't sunk and our towers didn't collapse a lot to
[1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:10.980]  2011
[1:47:10.980 --> 1:47:12.980]  But make no mistake
[1:47:12.980 --> 1:47:18.900]  2016 is a year that we should mark on our calendars and it's still going on
[1:47:19.820 --> 1:47:21.820]  The attack didn't end on election day
[1:47:21.980 --> 1:47:29.700]  Donald John Trump a man who to borrow a phrase from another December long ago. We'll live in infamy if we discover
[1:47:30.220 --> 1:47:36.220]  That Donald Trump are his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy
[1:47:36.220 --> 1:47:44.020]  If they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary if they're the ones who came up with she's ill something's wrong with her
[1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:49.500]  Energy and the way that he basically, you know described her in the campaign
[1:47:49.500 --> 1:47:51.500]  I think that is
[1:47:51.940 --> 1:47:56.780]  Something that would put the question of squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached
[1:47:59.620 --> 1:48:05.900]  And again, you hear these amazing narratives who heard John McCain say basically you're either with the more warm
[1:48:05.900 --> 1:48:10.060]  Ongring neocon globalists or you're with Putin and then he accuses
[1:48:10.740 --> 1:48:13.660]  Rampal of being with Putin because he opposes
[1:48:14.380 --> 1:48:19.940]  McCain's policy that's the way these people operate whether they're Republican or Democrat. No, they're part of the neocon
[1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:22.820]  Warmongering globalist
[1:48:22.820 --> 1:48:27.260]  Establishment and if you're not with them, they're going to accuse you of being a Russian now
[1:48:27.260 --> 1:48:29.260]  I want to go to this clip that we had of
[1:48:29.260 --> 1:48:36.740]  Of Comey saying there is no evidence of collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign. Let's play that clip
[1:48:37.380 --> 1:48:44.300]  Have you seen any evidence of the any collusion between what I'll call Trump world associates?
[1:48:45.260 --> 1:48:47.180]  of campaign officials
[1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:53.740]  Trump world and the Russians to swing the 2016 presidential election. I give a very simple answer. No
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:49:00.660]  No evidence of any collusions. And this is after talking to getting this information from the FBI
[1:49:01.220 --> 1:49:03.460]  Up to speed at everything I have up to this morning
[1:49:04.180 --> 1:49:09.180]  Those without no evidence of collusion. Do you believe that there are
[1:49:10.460 --> 1:49:15.260]  Again, that was that Comey that was Nunes who is privy to this information because he's part of the
[1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:20.540]  Intelligence committee that is looking on this now. We do have some more information and this is coming out from Devin Nunes
[1:49:20.540 --> 1:49:26.620]  Congressman, he said the Trump transition members were under surveillance during the Obama administration
[1:49:27.420 --> 1:49:29.100]  surprise surprise
[1:49:29.100 --> 1:49:31.420]  We revealed this a couple of days ago at info wars
[1:49:31.420 --> 1:49:36.580]  We told you about project dragnet that came out of a whistleblower who was working with the CIA
[1:49:37.260 --> 1:49:40.980]  Sheriff our Pio got that information along with his investigator
[1:49:41.660 --> 1:49:42.940]  Mike Zullo
[1:49:42.940 --> 1:49:46.420]  They showed us how there was I think 18 different
[1:49:46.420 --> 1:49:53.700]  Addresses that were associated Donald Trump that were being spied on ten years ago as well as about eight or nine different employees
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:55.700]  People like his golf pro whatever
[1:49:55.740 --> 1:50:00.420]  This is something that our government is doing all the time. Why is this something that is controversial?
[1:50:00.420 --> 1:50:06.380]  We all know and we've told you for a long time because of what NSA whistleblowers are telling us what other whistleblowers are telling us
[1:50:06.380 --> 1:50:08.180]  That there was dragnet surveillance
[1:50:08.180 --> 1:50:14.220]  It was shown with the Snowden documents about a week or so after James Clapper denied it
[1:50:14.220 --> 1:50:21.700]  Lied to Congress lied to the American public when he was asked directly by Senator Wyden and of course
[1:50:22.220 --> 1:50:26.060]  Then he was exposed as a liar right after that, but then we still have
[1:50:26.860 --> 1:50:30.300]  Michael Hayden former director of the CIA former director the NSA
[1:50:31.060 --> 1:50:35.780]  Mocking Trump on co-bear saying well, hey, you know your television is not spying on you
[1:50:35.780 --> 1:50:41.540]  Even though we got the releases from vault seven got more documentation showing us what Samsung and other people have now admitted
[1:50:41.540 --> 1:50:45.340]  And then he says oh hey if Trump wants to know he can just ask him. Are you spying on me?
[1:50:45.340 --> 1:50:49.540]  Of course, they would tell him the truth, wouldn't they just like James Clapper stay with us
[1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:56.500]  We got more news that is just broken from the House intelligence chairman saying that Trump's personal communications may have been collected
[1:50:56.500 --> 1:50:58.500]  You know incidentally incidentally
[1:50:59.780 --> 1:51:03.020]  Hi, my name is John Kunkel. I'm 63 years of age

[1:54:24.860 --> 1:54:29.340]  And of course that was something that we pointed out back in December, and it wasn't just us
[1:54:29.980 --> 1:54:34.700]  There was a lot of media that was pointing out how we were creating a ministry of truth with the NDA a
[1:54:35.580 --> 1:54:42.180]  People like the new American the John Burt society the people who you will not find any more anti-russian people than the
[1:54:42.180 --> 1:54:49.580]  John Burt society a new American and they were pointing out that this tool that was being created was a tool to shut
[1:54:49.580 --> 1:54:56.500]  Down free speech in America to essentially create a monopoly for the government in terms of they will be the ones
[1:54:56.900 --> 1:55:02.420]  Who will vet truth? That's why we call the ministry of truth remember we talked about how the time they were going to turn it over to
[1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:05.820]  The cat lady and her husband who have now separated now
[1:55:05.820 --> 1:55:07.940]  I don't know who got custody of the couch and the cat
[1:55:07.940 --> 1:55:15.340]  But they were going to be the people that were going to be vetting it some small little organization in st. Petersburg, Florida was going to be
[1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:17.180]  vetting
[1:55:17.180 --> 1:55:23.420]  People as well. It's not even a college. They do seminars. I mean this is beyond ridiculous what they were doing at the time
[1:55:23.420 --> 1:55:29.100]  We'll talk about that in a little bit. We also have some breaking news. We have the house intelligence
[1:55:29.940 --> 1:55:35.820]  Chairman pointing out that yes Donald Trump's personal communications were collected incidentally
[1:55:35.820 --> 1:55:41.460]  That's his politico and CNN. It must really pain them must really pain them to report this
[1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:44.300]  I want to get back to that news. We're going to play you a clip
[1:55:45.060 --> 1:55:49.060]  About how they were planting malware at Trump power
[1:55:49.060 --> 1:55:52.380]  But before I do real quickly, I want to let you know that as they are using bots
[1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:57.820]  They're accusing infowars. I said well, you know, there were bots that were putting out conservative news and
[1:55:58.540 --> 1:56:02.380]  There must have been coordination with the Russians. So we're going to have the FBI investigate that
[1:56:02.380 --> 1:56:09.260]  So they're putting out the coordination the bots as an established fact and then alleging that there was collusion
[1:56:10.020 --> 1:56:15.620]  So they can come after us. Okay, understand. They're going to be shutting down. You already know, they're shutting down with their bots
[1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:19.500]  They are shutting down people on Facebook and Twitter who share information

[1:57:46.140 --> 1:57:52.780]  I've put this item on auto shipping due to its tremendous demand and its popularity give it a try see what you think as a matter of fact
[1:57:52.940 --> 1:57:57.740]  That's one of the things that I need to do is get set up on auto ship because we have our supply of toothpaste as well
[1:57:57.740 --> 1:58:01.100]  Now that is back in stock. Take a look at that. Take a look at the reviews

[1:58:06.900 --> 1:58:12.660]  I want to play a clip for you about the story this up on info wars.com reminder that the Department of Justice
[1:58:12.660 --> 1:58:18.860]  Found falsely planted malware at Trump Tower designed to mimic ties to Russia
[1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:22.500]  I'll play that clip for you on the other side of this break because we're out of time
[1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:23.700]  We've got to go to a break
[1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:29.820]  But of course they're doing that is that going to be investigated by the FBI. No, I don't think so probably not interested in that
[1:58:29.820 --> 1:58:35.660]  It's not something that was done by our enemy the conservative press or Donald Trump or Manafort
[1:58:35.660 --> 1:58:42.740]  So we're not going to investigate that stay with us. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN

[2:00:02.780 --> 2:00:08.620]  Coming to you from the former United States of America deep in the heart of Texas
[2:00:08.620 --> 2:00:15.060]  It's Alex Jones. I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live
[2:00:15.060 --> 2:00:23.060]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight your host and as we were just about to play before we went to break this video
[2:00:23.980 --> 2:00:29.620]  That relates to the story. We have a Department of Justice found falsely planted malware at Trump Tower
[2:00:29.620 --> 2:00:31.020]  I want to talk about this
[2:00:31.020 --> 2:00:36.940]  But I want to wait until we come back at 8 after because we have a lot of stations that carry us some carry the news
[2:00:36.940 --> 2:00:43.460]  So let me go to this other news about what's going on in France because France in the French election, which is next one coming up
[2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:50.100]  There's an important part of pushing back against the globalists. We had hoped that there would be some positive results in the Netherlands
[2:00:50.180 --> 2:00:52.180]  We did not see that in the last election
[2:00:52.620 --> 2:00:57.500]  We have some information about polling and that is up on info wars.com. It's a story from zero hedge
[2:00:57.500 --> 2:01:03.780]  It says the French presidential race Marine Le Pen is far ahead of her rivals in secret polling
[2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:07.700]  I say an editor at the French daily La Figaro has alluded to secret polling data
[2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:13.500]  Which shows the front nationals Marine Le Pen polling at close to 34%
[2:01:13.940 --> 2:01:18.420]  Among those with intentions to vote in the first round of the French French presidential election and of course
[2:01:18.500 --> 2:01:27.060]  She has taken a very nationalistic approach. She opposes the European Union. She essentially is trying to get France back to a
[2:01:27.740 --> 2:01:29.140]  Sovereign nation again
[2:01:29.140 --> 2:01:35.500]  And that's what all these individuals in all these different countries are trying to do and again at that point is Donald Trump has said as
[2:01:35.500 --> 2:01:40.620]  We've seen Ted Malik say we want to deal with people on a bilateral
[2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:46.660]  Relationship negotiate one-on-one with these other countries and work out our own one-on-one deals rather than
[2:01:47.660 --> 2:01:49.580]  empowering a
[2:01:49.580 --> 2:01:50.420]  multinational
[2:01:50.420 --> 2:01:57.060]  Organization like the European Union like the United Nations like the organization that would have been created with TPP or
[2:01:57.340 --> 2:02:01.300]  The transatlantic partnership that would have merged that and we understand
[2:02:01.300 --> 2:02:08.580]  Going back to that. What was behind that to create these multinational organizations that would then merge at another
[2:02:08.820 --> 2:02:11.460]  Global level we had it's a big new Brzezinski
[2:02:11.940 --> 2:02:17.020]  Who created the Trilateral Commission had talked about the three power centers of Asia
[2:02:17.500 --> 2:02:25.100]  North America and Europe and then merging those and so to create these economic unions with these multinational
[2:02:25.100 --> 2:02:33.900]  Trade organizations and then make a political union out of that and then merge those three different areas using
[2:02:34.260 --> 2:02:41.140]  America as the common spine and well of those two wings. That was the plan now Donald Trump
[2:02:41.940 --> 2:02:43.940]  Shutdown TPP right away
[2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:45.540]  that
[2:02:45.540 --> 2:02:48.520]  Folks is why they are after him so hard
[2:02:49.020 --> 2:02:52.020]  That is why the globalists are there as you heard with John McCain
[2:02:52.020 --> 2:02:56.780]  You're either with the globalists or you're with Vladimir Putin. That's the narrative that they're selling everybody
[2:02:56.900 --> 2:02:59.380]  But as we look at this as we hear
[2:03:00.060 --> 2:03:04.780]  The Russians hacked our election they manipulated our elections. They were saying the same thing about the French election as well
[2:03:04.940 --> 2:03:09.300]  Remember they said well, we know that they're going to do the same thing and France as well
[2:03:09.740 --> 2:03:15.460]  Let's talk about the reality the reality exposed by WikiLeaks talking about how the CIA and
[2:03:16.180 --> 2:03:18.180]  the last French election in
[2:03:18.180 --> 2:03:22.340]  2012 had infiltrated every single one of the French parties
[2:03:22.340 --> 2:03:30.020]  And they had all major French political parties were targeted for infiltration by the CIA's human intelligence and electronic
[2:03:30.260 --> 2:03:34.100]  Signals intelligence within the seven months leading up to France's
[2:03:34.540 --> 2:03:38.840]  2012 presidential elections and they say that this included people like
[2:03:39.340 --> 2:03:46.780]  Sarkozy as well as Marine Le Pen and Francois Holland. They went after everyone and every political party
[2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:48.780]  They infiltrated both with
[2:03:49.500 --> 2:03:55.140]  Individuals infiltrating their party and getting human intelligence and with signals intelligence electronics eavesdropping
[2:03:55.660 --> 2:03:57.860]  Do we manipulate other elections? Of course we do
[2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:04.060]  WikiLeaks pointed out we've had and this is based on a Carnegie Mellon study 81 different
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:12.420]  Elections that the United States has rigged over the years not including the CIA coups where we have overthrown other countries
[2:04:12.420 --> 2:04:16.500]  Well, you look at this. You have to understand this dark
[2:04:17.260 --> 2:04:24.420]  Organization that we have created here in America will choose these same tactics for their political purposes here in America
[2:04:24.780 --> 2:04:27.280]  If we come after their globalist agenda
[2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:34.100]  They will use these same tactics and we see this happening right now. That is what this NDA a
[2:04:35.260 --> 2:04:41.100]  Was about the countering disinformation and propaganda. They want to create disinformation propaganda
[2:04:41.100 --> 2:04:45.220]  They want to accuse people allege that we are colluding with Russians
[2:04:45.220 --> 2:04:51.500]  Just as they accuse Rand Paul of being on the Russian side if he opposes the globalist NATO
[2:04:52.220 --> 2:04:56.420]  Expansion then you're with Vladimir Putin, obviously stay with us when we come back
[2:04:56.420 --> 2:04:59.220]  We're gonna talk about the devices that they found at Trump Tower
[2:04:59.860 --> 2:05:04.820]  President Donald Trump and in full wars have been accused of espionage
[2:05:04.820 --> 2:05:11.740]  During this week's Senate hearings on Russian hacking the establishment Democrats and rogue intelligence heads
[2:05:12.180 --> 2:05:19.020]  Attempted to frame Donald Trump and in full wars for colluding with the Russians and violating the National Defense
[2:05:19.740 --> 2:05:22.100]  Authorization Act so Mr. Armstrong you mentioned in your
[2:05:23.060 --> 2:05:28.300]  Answer to I think this appears question that there are other RT's operating in the US
[2:05:28.300 --> 2:05:35.380]  Can you describe them with them? You have RT you have Sputnik, and then I think you have them feeding
[2:05:36.060 --> 2:05:38.060]  other entities
[2:05:38.140 --> 2:05:40.020]  Info wars comes to mind George Comey
[2:05:40.020 --> 2:05:42.580]  Are you aware that Roger Stone played a role on the Trump campaign?
[2:05:43.340 --> 2:05:51.820]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory that far-right news organizations like info wars took action to assist
[2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:55.460]  Russian operatives to help Trump win the election

[2:08:21.060 --> 2:08:25.700]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're gonna get to the bottom of this investigation
[2:08:25.700 --> 2:08:32.620]  We're going to investigate them back if they want to allege collusion without any proof that they want to smear and slander people in the press
[2:08:32.940 --> 2:08:39.060]  If they want to imply that we are doing what we know that they are doing in terms of using the box as a matter of fact
[2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:45.260]  Let's let's talk about that for just one moment before we get back to Trump Tower and before we get to these amazing revelations
[2:08:45.260 --> 2:08:47.660]  They came out today CNN and
[2:08:49.220 --> 2:08:53.900]  We've got Politico a reporting that the House Intelligence Chairman
[2:08:54.660 --> 2:08:56.660]  Nunes has reported
[2:08:56.900 --> 2:08:58.900]  that there was
[2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:05.620]  Information taken from the Trump transition team at Trump Tower and of course we have an article up at info wars calm
[2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:12.100]  Department of Justice found falsely planted malware at Trump Tower designed to mimic ties to Russia now
[2:09:12.100 --> 2:09:13.460]  These are not the same thing
[2:09:13.460 --> 2:09:16.740]  Understand they're saying well we got information on people at Trump Tower
[2:09:16.740 --> 2:09:22.180]  We just happened to incidentally collect it because you know we can listen to anybody under the FISA act and if
[2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:24.900]  There was somebody that was talking to someone in a foreign country
[2:09:25.140 --> 2:09:28.540]  Well now your fair game and we can listen to you as well now
[2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:34.900]  That's one part of it, but then the other part of it is to put malware on their computers to make it look
[2:09:35.380 --> 2:09:41.500]  Like they're trying to that they have ties to Russia that is framing people see that's the other part of
[2:09:42.180 --> 2:09:44.980]  The government being able to get into everybody's computers
[2:09:44.980 --> 2:09:50.100]  They can plant stuff on you to frame you at the same time. They are surveilling you
[2:09:50.380 --> 2:09:54.900]  So we have this article at info wars calm talking about the
[2:09:54.900 --> 2:10:02.780]  Possibly possible framing of people at Trump Tower trying to frame them to the Russians and then we have coming out today
[2:10:03.300 --> 2:10:07.380]  We have it. He did not learn this from the press. He said this came out of
[2:10:08.260 --> 2:10:13.100]  Reviewing intelligence reports. So this is the House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes
[2:10:13.260 --> 2:10:18.980]  He said today that President Trump's personal communications may have been picked up by investigators through quote-unquote
[2:10:18.980 --> 2:10:25.060]  Incidental collection and he said he got this found this while reviewing intelligence reports
[2:10:25.060 --> 2:10:31.820]  He said he told Speaker Ryan about the collection is traveling to the White House this afternoon and he said I'm actually alarmed by it
[2:10:31.860 --> 2:10:37.500]  Well good finally somebody in Washington is alarmed by the omniscient
[2:10:39.100 --> 2:10:46.100]  Unconstitutional police state that we have but then we have this other story about how they're actually planting malware on their computers
[2:10:46.100 --> 2:10:52.340]  I want to get to that first, but let me take another digression going back to this bot stuff as they're talking about this
[2:10:52.340 --> 2:10:54.340]  We know that they're censoring
[2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:59.460]  Conservative media using Facebook bots using other bots on other social media
[2:11:00.860 --> 2:11:03.740]  Let's go back. There was a great article from
[2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:07.780]  We are change and they went back and looked at
[2:11:08.860 --> 2:11:14.660]  The history of Hillary Clinton did Hillary Clinton use bots in her campaign. Why yes, she did we go back
[2:11:14.660 --> 2:11:19.220]  It was reported by Clinton friendly media like the Daily Beast and the LA Times
[2:11:20.060 --> 2:11:26.660]  The Daily Beast pointed out Hillary pack is spending $1 million to correct commenters on reddit and Facebook
[2:11:26.660 --> 2:11:28.540]  This is back during the election
[2:11:28.540 --> 2:11:35.020]  So she's spending money on bots that are coming after people the way the LA Times reported if you look at the LA Times
[2:11:35.900 --> 2:11:41.340]  Article here. You got a picture there of guess who David Brock right there smiling. Yes the Hillary Clinton
[2:11:41.340 --> 2:11:50.500]  Anyway, be nice to Hillary Clinton online says the LA Times or risk a confrontation with her super pack
[2:11:51.060 --> 2:11:55.300]  This is what the LA Times says when the internet's legions of Hillary hecklers
[2:11:55.620 --> 2:12:02.720]  Steal away to chat rooms and Facebook pages to vent grievances about Clinton express revulsion toward Clinton launch attacks on Clinton
[2:12:02.820 --> 2:12:07.940]  They now may find themselves in a surprising place confronted by a multi-million dollar
[2:12:07.940 --> 2:12:10.940]  Super pack working with Clinton
[2:12:11.060 --> 2:12:18.180]  So we know that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were using bots to try to control the narrative to try to censor any
[2:12:18.340 --> 2:12:25.540]  Criticism to push back against criticism. We know that Facebook and other social media are censoring us with bots
[2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:29.740]  as I reported the individual who showed me that he shared a
[2:12:30.500 --> 2:12:34.180]  Video about Thomas Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates and it was titled
[2:12:34.180 --> 2:12:41.060]  Jefferson goes to war with Islam. They shut it down. They said we are suspending your Facebook account for posting this you have been
[2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:43.580]  Noticed you are unmutual
[2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:51.060]  Well, you know, this is going on folks what they do what they actually do and what they have confessed to that is what they're
[2:12:51.060 --> 2:12:58.100]  Accusing us of doing and we didn't do that. If you shared our articles, they want to pretend that you're a bot
[2:12:58.100 --> 2:13:03.860]  That you didn't really build info wars. No, you did you did by sharing that information
[2:13:04.260 --> 2:13:08.700]  And then of course we got Donna Brazil doubling down on this and she said neither the party committee
[2:13:09.060 --> 2:13:14.820]  Nor the Clinton campaign have used bots to widen the reach of the anti-trump message
[2:13:14.820 --> 2:13:17.060]  She said and she's the former chair of the DNC remember
[2:13:17.060 --> 2:13:23.500]  She took over after it was learned that the DNC was hacking the election against Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton
[2:13:23.940 --> 2:13:25.940]  again everything that they do
[2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:31.740]  That they're caught doing they allege and imply even though there's no evidence and they don't ever prove it
[2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:37.460]  But they continue with this narrative that the other side did what we know they did
[2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:45.540]  They come after the whistleblowers and of course, this is the same Donna Brazil that is no longer working at CNN because she was caught
[2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:48.980]  feeding information to Hillary Clinton giving her questions to
[2:13:49.660 --> 2:13:53.460]  Programs in advance now there's one more side of this that is important
[2:13:53.460 --> 2:13:55.460]  And that is the fact that
[2:13:56.340 --> 2:14:03.620]  The and this was put out by wicked leaks the fact that DNC knew of Hillary paid troll factory that was attacking Bernie Sanders online
[2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:09.460]  But also others they say then there's a leaked email. This is the article from we are changed
[2:14:09.460 --> 2:14:15.700]  There's a leaked email by alleged Russian operative through wicked leaks that shows the Clinton campaign wanting to conspire with
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:18.100]  correct the record and
[2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:26.020]  Media matters to defend Huma avidant and they point out that both media matters and correct their record are mostly 501 C3
[2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:30.020]  Organizations that are barred from it getting involved in partisan politics
[2:14:30.260 --> 2:14:35.500]  So what do we see from these people who have 501 see our organizations that are?
[2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:37.900]  rigging
[2:14:37.900 --> 2:14:40.380]  Social media rigging the narrative pushing back
[2:14:41.020 --> 2:14:44.140]  Against people setting up bots. Well, we see from media matters
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:46.660]  They come out and say
[2:14:46.660 --> 2:14:48.660]  Report FBI investigation
[2:14:49.020 --> 2:14:56.980]  Russian operatives are using bots to spread stories from Breitbart RT and info wars investigators exploring whether the far-right news operatives took any actions
[2:14:57.260 --> 2:14:59.460]  To assist Russia's operatives
[2:14:59.460 --> 2:15:05.220]  So they put it out as a given that Russia is doing this then they allege that we colluded with them
[2:15:05.220 --> 2:15:07.220]  And that's what the daily cause
[2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:11.220]  Puts out they say collusion in their headline and at the bottom
[2:15:11.220 --> 2:15:15.420]  They say one imagines that the timing of these articles would have to be important for the plan to work
[2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:19.860]  So in other words there is some plan they haven't proved anything they alleged that there's some plan
[2:15:19.860 --> 2:15:22.740]  They allege that there are bots that are out there pushing the stuff and then
[2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:25.580]  Because of those that they treat like fact
[2:15:26.020 --> 2:15:32.660]  They come back and say well then that means that all these conservative organizations had to be timing their articles
[2:15:32.860 --> 2:15:36.620]  So they're colluding and that's what the FBI is insinuating
[2:15:36.620 --> 2:15:44.500]  But let's take a look at the reality of what's really going on. That's the fantasy side. That's the red herring the red scare
[2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:48.460]  The witch hunt the McCarthyism that is going on on the left
[2:15:48.460 --> 2:15:51.940]  But let's take a look at the reality of what is really happening
[2:15:52.100 --> 2:15:59.420]  Let's play this clip about the malware that was planted at Trump Tower designed to mimic ties to Russia
[2:16:00.540 --> 2:16:02.540]  Wasn't very well reported
[2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:09.900]  The Department of Justice revealed just last week that in fact some of these ties that they had witnessed between
[2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:14.260]  Trump Tower servers and Russian entities in fact were
[2:16:15.060 --> 2:16:20.180]  Stooged what that means is that there was malware on some of these computers that were
[2:16:20.580 --> 2:16:25.180]  mimicking contact between these entities in what looks like an attempt to
[2:16:26.220 --> 2:16:31.180]  Put Trump in a tight position or in fact lead to claims that there was some sort of
[2:16:31.620 --> 2:16:37.740]  Collusion so in fact the more evidence that comes out the more we're seeing that in fact these claims were either
[2:16:37.740 --> 2:16:41.740]  Manufactured or that like the official said today
[2:16:42.380 --> 2:16:49.220]  Intelligence was released in a partial fashion and some of that intelligence as they said on the Hill was quote-unquote dead wrong
[2:16:49.740 --> 2:16:55.300]  So let's understand what's going on here. What he's talking about is trying to frame Trump
[2:16:56.060 --> 2:17:01.740]  That he was colluding with the Russians by putting malware on his computer on computers at Trump Tower
[2:17:01.740 --> 2:17:05.820]  That was Washington free beacon writer Adam Credo. It was reporting that
[2:17:05.820 --> 2:17:10.260]  Now we've seen other evidence of this as WikiLeaks has reported
[2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:17.100]  There was a CIA and this is also in the article by Steve Watson. That's up on info worse calm breaking that down
[2:17:17.100 --> 2:17:24.020]  You can see that video as Steve Watson is reporting and as we talked about with John McAfee on Monday night
[2:17:24.020 --> 2:17:27.860]  We broke this down. There's a CIA project identified as umbrage
[2:17:27.860 --> 2:17:33.380]  And it maintained a substantial library of Russian cyber attack techniques
[2:17:33.380 --> 2:17:38.300]  That were stolen from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation as we talked to
[2:17:38.620 --> 2:17:42.260]  John McAfee and he's been on multiple times before as well as many cyber
[2:17:42.500 --> 2:17:43.940]  Experts when they came out and said well
[2:17:43.940 --> 2:17:50.460]  We found certain things that look like Russian fingerprints like they were like this code was written on a Cyrillic keyboard or whatever
[2:17:50.940 --> 2:17:54.460]  As John McAfee said you would have to be an absolute idiot
[2:17:55.180 --> 2:18:00.740]  To leave those kinds of simple tell-tale things behind he said no
[2:18:00.740 --> 2:18:05.460]  In addition to all of this we're not talking about the malware now
[2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:10.420]  That's a trump tower, but we're talking about the alleged malware that was part of the hacking
[2:18:10.420 --> 2:18:14.860]  And it's not clear even whether that was truly a hacker whether that information was turned over
[2:18:14.860 --> 2:18:17.860]  But the alleged hacking software was actually
[2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:24.660]  Years old it was out of rev and it was widely circulated among hacking communities
[2:18:24.660 --> 2:18:27.740]  It was not something that a state organization would do and
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:31.740]  In addition to that as he said if they were to use old
[2:18:32.380 --> 2:18:37.180]  Out of rev software to attack somebody they would justly be fired
[2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:43.940]  But also the idea that we see with umbrage what they did was they maintained a library that would allow them to look as
[2:18:43.980 --> 2:18:50.780]  If they were another country if you're going to hack into somebody you want it to look like you're somebody else and not
[2:18:51.540 --> 2:18:57.660]  Who you are you don't want to leave fingerprints that have your address there at Langley do you you don't want to look like an
[2:18:57.660 --> 2:19:02.300]  American organization you don't want to look like a state organization instead you want to look like a
[2:19:03.140 --> 2:19:08.780]  Chinese organization or a Russian organization or a German or a French or whatever anybody, but who you are
[2:19:09.300 --> 2:19:14.660]  So when they talk about these very simplistic fingerprints if that were the Russians the Russians would be so incompetent
[2:19:15.060 --> 2:19:16.740]  We don't really have to worry about anything
[2:19:16.740 --> 2:19:22.820]  I mean they would be like Kim Jong-un who has his rockets blow up on the launch pad and again
[2:19:22.820 --> 2:19:29.740]  There's a story that's up on info wars.com did this go off and explode on its own out of sheer incompetence
[2:19:29.740 --> 2:19:36.420]  Or was it helped along by somebody who helped to take out that last missile test as I said at the top of the program
[2:19:36.420 --> 2:19:38.420]  Maybe we should create a new verb
[2:19:38.620 --> 2:19:44.860]  We could call it on launch and that would be any rockets that blow up on the first stage
[2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:50.420]  And that could be a new verb that we have that could be the one positive
[2:19:50.420 --> 2:19:57.660]  Contribution that we have from Kim Jong-un and that would be to unlaunch a rocket in other words blow it up on the launching pad
[2:19:57.660 --> 2:20:03.500]  Did that happen by accident or did we help their incompetence money into an IRA pension or 401k then?

[2:20:24.180 --> 2:20:26.540]  And they won't lose a penny in the next crash

[2:24:29.060 --> 2:24:32.540]  Formula for toothpaste. It has peppermint oil iodine
[2:24:32.900 --> 2:24:36.620]  Nano silver you won't find that in any other toothpaste as far as I know
[2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:44.100]  Very important in controlling the bacteria that can infect your gum cause gun gum disease as well as heart disease
[2:24:44.700 --> 2:24:50.500]  Very well known fact that gum disease can lead to heart attacks to blood clots to other things
[2:24:50.500 --> 2:24:55.020]  So nano silver and the iodine that you have there is very important and of course it does not contain
[2:24:55.420 --> 2:24:58.660]  Fluoride so it's very important what it has and what it doesn't have we've got a review here
[2:24:58.660 --> 2:25:01.860]  And of course you can read the reviews on info wars life calm
[2:25:01.860 --> 2:25:08.460]  This one says use this every day love it wonderful idea to add iodine to toothpaste and leave out the fluoride
[2:25:08.740 --> 2:25:13.460]  So happy I found this hope to never be without again does white and teeth. Thank you very much for all the good products
[2:25:13.460 --> 2:25:15.100]  I'm not through ordering this month
[2:25:15.100 --> 2:25:21.060]  More things to add to make my life healthier and better. I tell you what I use it. It is a great toothpaste
[2:25:21.060 --> 2:25:24.260]  It's been out of stock for a while. It is now back in stock and again
[2:25:24.540 --> 2:25:29.260]  It is an information war that you are supporting with these products that we sell
[2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:32.900]  And as we've been talking about throughout the day here
[2:25:33.020 --> 2:25:39.260]  There is a concerted effort to try to shut down our voice as part of the conservative media anybody who is
[2:25:39.260 --> 2:25:45.860]  Putting out something that is opposed to the globalist warmongering agenda. Then you're with Putin as we heard John McCain
[2:25:45.860 --> 2:25:49.780]  He made it very clear Rand Paul you're with Putin anybody. He said it wasn't just Rand Paul
[2:25:49.780 --> 2:25:53.580]  Rand Paul was the only one who had the guts to stand up and say no
[2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:59.740]  I think we need to have not just a voice vote, but we need to talk about whether or not we want to bring another
[2:26:00.260 --> 2:26:04.860]  dependent into NATO we just had Germany here last week and as
[2:26:04.860 --> 2:26:09.260]  Merkel left Donald Trump said they owe us a lot of money
[2:26:09.700 --> 2:26:15.260]  These NATO countries are supposed to pay 2% for their defense and they're paying just over 1%
[2:26:15.260 --> 2:26:20.460]  And yet they've got a budget surplus of over 200 billion dollars
[2:26:20.460 --> 2:26:25.620]  So we don't need another freeloader on the United States and of course Montenegro
[2:26:26.180 --> 2:26:28.620]  Is not going to be able to contribute much to their defense
[2:26:28.620 --> 2:26:36.820]  But they would contribute to the uncertainty to the hair triggers that NATO establishes everywhere somebody does something to Montenegro
[2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:40.860]  Then we immediately are triggered into war if we bring them into NATO
[2:26:40.860 --> 2:26:45.820]  That's why Rand Paul said we got to debate this but hey if you oppose the globalist
[2:26:45.820 --> 2:26:50.180]  You're with the Russians even if you want to just debate this we can't have that debate
[2:26:50.180 --> 2:26:55.180]  So if you want to stay connected to what's going on stay connected to info wars to find out

[2:27:32.980 --> 2:27:38.980]  From us without being filtered or censored as I said, we have an update on this shooting
[2:27:39.860 --> 2:27:44.500]  Well, actually that's the way that CNN reports that they see it as a firearms incident
[2:27:44.500 --> 2:27:49.140]  We see it as an Islamic radical terrorist incident because it involved a
[2:27:49.900 --> 2:27:56.140]  4x4 that was running people down in the streets between 10 and 12 people run down the streets two of those people have now died
[2:27:56.740 --> 2:27:59.620]  then the person got out of the car and
[2:28:00.740 --> 2:28:08.500]  Took an 8-inch knife and attacked the policeman that policeman is now dead and then the attacker was shot dead by other police
[2:28:08.500 --> 2:28:15.980]  Stopping further murder by this terrorist, but when CNN reports it we got a story up that kid Daniels caught it
[2:28:15.980 --> 2:28:20.580]  They put it out as a firearms incident near Parliament. They look at it and they see
[2:28:21.260 --> 2:28:25.380]  Bad firearms even though the firearms were protecting people they reported that way
[2:28:25.380 --> 2:28:30.140]  They do not and cannot see radical Islamic terrorism and let's take a look at that picture there
[2:28:30.140 --> 2:28:32.140]  That is the alleged
[2:28:32.180 --> 2:28:36.380]  Shooter that is there and look at get a close-up. You can see his beard there
[2:28:36.380 --> 2:28:41.820]  I said when I saw that because you can see the MO of radical Islamic terrorism
[2:28:41.820 --> 2:28:46.740]  I said all we need to know is what Mohammed's last name was and look at the picture there
[2:28:46.740 --> 2:28:52.340]  This is not some news agencies reported an Asian. I don't think so. He looks like he's got a
[2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:58.780]  Islamic beard and it is exactly the type of method that we have seen used over and over again
[2:28:59.180 --> 2:29:04.660]  By these radical Islamic terrorists and that's the individual who was shot and killed
[2:29:04.660 --> 2:29:11.380]  After he stabbed a policeman after he ran over a dozen people and two of those people have died
[2:29:11.380 --> 2:29:15.980]  The others are seriously seriously injured as we continue to see
[2:29:16.580 --> 2:29:21.780]  All right, so when we come back I want to take some phone calls from you get your comments as to what's going on
[2:29:21.780 --> 2:29:27.180]  Let me give that number. It's 800 259 9231 that number is 800
[2:29:27.700 --> 2:29:29.820]  259 9231
[2:29:29.820 --> 2:29:33.660]  We'll try to get as many calls as we can in this final half hour of the show
[2:29:33.660 --> 2:29:36.500]  And then we're gonna have Roger Stone coming on for the fourth hour
[2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:44.180]  Breaking down the spy state this internal coup that has now come back to America that is coming out of the State Department
[2:29:44.180 --> 2:29:46.180]  Stay with us to be right back
[2:29:48.500 --> 2:29:55.380]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:55.380 --> 2:30:01.020]  President Donald Trump and infowars have been accused of espionage
[2:30:01.460 --> 2:30:05.380]  During this week's Senate hearings on Russian hacking the establishment
[2:30:05.380 --> 2:30:07.780]  Democrats and rogue intelligence heads
[2:30:07.780 --> 2:30:15.380]  Attempted to frame Donald Trump and infowars for colluding with the Russians and violating the National Defense
[2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:21.380]  Authorization Act I'm Mr. Armstrong. You'd mentioned in your answer to I think the sphere's question
[2:30:21.380 --> 2:30:26.380]  That there are other RT's operating in the US. Can you describe them listen?
[2:30:26.380 --> 2:30:31.380]  You have RT you have Sputnik and then I think you have them feeding
[2:30:32.380 --> 2:30:38.380]  Other entities infowars comes to mind. Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role on the Trump campaign?
[2:30:38.380 --> 2:30:47.380]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory that far-right news organizations like Infowars took actions to
[2:30:47.380 --> 2:30:54.380]  Assist Russian operatives to help Trump win the election. You can learn more right now at info wars.com
[2:31:17.380 --> 2:31:24.380]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, folvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others

[2:31:59.380 --> 2:32:08.380]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk
[2:32:08.380 --> 2:32:16.380]  Here now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom
[2:32:16.380 --> 2:32:21.380]  And seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula
[2:32:21.380 --> 2:32:27.380]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors
[2:32:27.380 --> 2:32:29.380]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that
[2:32:29.380 --> 2:32:35.380]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking
[2:32:35.380 --> 2:32:43.380]  You used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[2:32:43.380 --> 2:32:46.380]  This is the engine of the life essence
[2:32:46.380 --> 2:32:53.380]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were
[2:32:53.380 --> 2:32:54.380]  And this is a big part of it
[2:32:54.380 --> 2:32:59.380]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at infowarslife.com today
[2:32:59.380 --> 2:33:05.380]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future
[2:33:05.380 --> 2:33:08.380]  Not a future that will be but one that might be
[2:33:08.380 --> 2:33:10.380]  This is not a new world
[2:33:10.380 --> 2:33:15.380]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one
[2:33:15.380 --> 2:33:23.380]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time
[2:33:23.380 --> 2:33:25.380]  It has refinements
[2:33:25.380 --> 2:33:31.380]  Technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom
[2:33:31.380 --> 2:33:37.380]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule
[2:33:37.380 --> 2:33:41.380]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:48.380]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:33:48.380 --> 2:33:52.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:59.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:59.380 --> 2:34:02.380]  I'm David Knight, we're going to go to our callers in just one moment
[2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:08.380]  If you want to call in, we're going to take phone calls in the next half hour
[2:34:08.380 --> 2:34:14.380]  The number is 800-259-9231
[2:34:14.380 --> 2:34:17.380]  That's 800-259-9231
[2:34:17.380 --> 2:34:21.380]  And I just want to remind people that we've had breaking news through the day
[2:34:21.380 --> 2:34:29.380]  We've had House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes reporting that he came across and discovered himself
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:36.380]  While reviewing intelligence reports that yes, they did collect information on Donald Trump and on his transition team
[2:34:36.380 --> 2:34:38.380]  He says he's notified Speaker Paul Ryan about it
[2:34:38.380 --> 2:34:41.380]  And he says, I am actually alarmed by it
[2:34:41.380 --> 2:34:42.380]  Good, he should be
[2:34:42.380 --> 2:34:46.380]  You should be alarmed by the surveillance state
[2:34:46.380 --> 2:34:48.380]  And also we have an article on info wars
[2:34:48.380 --> 2:34:54.380]  Reminder, the Department of Justice used falsely planted malware at Trump Tower designed to mimic ties to Russia
[2:34:54.380 --> 2:34:57.380]  So at the same time they're listening to Donald Trump, yes, they really are
[2:34:57.380 --> 2:35:00.380]  And yes, it doesn't have to be wired
[2:35:00.380 --> 2:35:03.380]  And no, they don't have to get a search warrant
[2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:09.380]  Let's explain that to Stephen Colbert and all the skeptics who are rolling on the floor laughing about all this stuff
[2:35:09.380 --> 2:35:13.380]  No, we live in a warrantless, wireless world
[2:35:13.380 --> 2:35:15.380]  They're listening to everybody
[2:35:15.380 --> 2:35:17.380]  They brag about the fact that they do
[2:35:17.380 --> 2:35:21.380]  Listen to you on your phones, your television sets, and on your appliances
[2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:23.380]  Just like Kellyanne Conway said
[2:35:23.380 --> 2:35:24.380]  You want to make fun of that?
[2:35:24.380 --> 2:35:28.380]  Colbert, you want to say, oh, they're listening to me through my microwave
[2:35:28.380 --> 2:35:29.380]  They turn it into a television
[2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:37.380]  Any device, if you are going to have a refrigerator or a iron even or whatever you want
[2:35:37.380 --> 2:35:41.380]  If it has the capability to listen to you
[2:35:41.380 --> 2:35:43.380]  If you can control it from your iPhone
[2:35:43.380 --> 2:35:45.380]  If it is connected to the internet in other words
[2:35:45.380 --> 2:35:47.380]  And if it has voice recognition
[2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:50.380]  You can guarantee they can turn that into a listening device
[2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:53.380]  David Petraeus was saying that five years of the day
[2:35:53.380 --> 2:35:58.380]  Before Stephen Colbert was engaging in this disinformation comedy campaign
[2:35:58.380 --> 2:36:00.380]  And so, yeah, they can do that
[2:36:00.380 --> 2:36:01.380]  And they do do that
[2:36:01.380 --> 2:36:03.380]  And they did it at Trump Tower
[2:36:03.380 --> 2:36:07.380]  Not only are they listening to Donald Trump and his transition team
[2:36:07.380 --> 2:36:13.380]  But they put malware on the computer to make it look as if they have ties to Russia
[2:36:13.380 --> 2:36:15.380]  That's framing people
[2:36:15.380 --> 2:36:20.380]  And they're framing infowars and the rest of the conservative media Breitbart and others saying
[2:36:20.380 --> 2:36:26.380]  We somehow colluded with supposed Russian bots that were promoting our stories
[2:36:26.380 --> 2:36:30.380]  Well, you know what, we know that they used bots to
[2:36:30.380 --> 2:36:33.380]  In the Hillary Clinton campaign to come after their opponents
[2:36:33.380 --> 2:36:37.380]  To change the narrative on Reddit, on social media
[2:36:37.380 --> 2:36:40.380]  That was widely reported by the LA Times, by the Daily Beast
[2:36:40.380 --> 2:36:42.380]  Not even by conservative media
[2:36:42.380 --> 2:36:43.380]  It was widely reported
[2:36:43.380 --> 2:36:45.380]  They want to pretend that doesn't exist
[2:36:45.380 --> 2:36:52.380]  They want to pretend that John and Tony Podesta don't have deep ties to a state-operated
[2:36:52.380 --> 2:36:56.380]  Russian state-operated organization that was founded by Vladimir Putin
[2:36:56.380 --> 2:37:02.380]  Instead, they go back ten years to connections that Paul Manafort had with a Russian billionaire
[2:37:02.380 --> 2:37:04.380]  They say, well, he has close ties to Putin
[2:37:04.380 --> 2:37:07.380]  Not as close as the Podesta ties
[2:37:07.380 --> 2:37:11.380]  Now, if they were reporting both of those, you could say, okay, well, yeah, there's a lot of corruption
[2:37:11.380 --> 2:37:16.380]  But if they only report one of those, you have to understand there's a political nature to this
[2:37:16.380 --> 2:37:21.380]  As I said before, we now have an FBI that operates like Joseph Stalin's Cheka did
[2:37:21.380 --> 2:37:23.380]  Or the KGB did
[2:37:23.380 --> 2:37:25.380]  Bring me the man I will find the crime
[2:37:25.380 --> 2:37:26.380]  That is what's truly behind all this
[2:37:26.380 --> 2:37:29.380]  And as I pointed out before, back in December
[2:37:29.380 --> 2:37:31.380]  Everybody knew where this was all headed
[2:37:31.380 --> 2:37:34.380]  As they created, everyone said, the Ministry of Truth
[2:37:34.380 --> 2:37:36.380]  The New American, as anti-Russian as you can get
[2:37:36.380 --> 2:37:40.380]  The John Birch Society, critics slam Congress for creating an Orwellian Ministry of Truth
[2:37:40.380 --> 2:37:42.380]  That was headlined in December
[2:37:42.380 --> 2:37:47.380]  Zero hedge, Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act into law
[2:37:47.380 --> 2:37:51.380]  Just like that, the US Ministry of Truth is officially born
[2:37:51.380 --> 2:37:52.380]  And that's precisely what they have done
[2:37:52.380 --> 2:37:55.380]  They hide it inside the NDAA
[2:37:55.380 --> 2:38:00.380]  And they're going to bring together bureaucrats from the State Department, the Pentagon, intelligence bureaucracies
[2:38:00.380 --> 2:38:03.380]  And the organization, as they point out in the New America
[2:38:03.380 --> 2:38:07.380]  And the Wallace foreign aid bureaucracy known as USAID
[2:38:07.380 --> 2:38:10.380]  That is run by the CIA folks
[2:38:10.380 --> 2:38:12.380]  Foreign governments and others are going to bring them in
[2:38:12.380 --> 2:38:14.380]  Because why? We need to get these other foreign governments in
[2:38:14.380 --> 2:38:16.380]  Because this is defending globalism, right?
[2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:20.380]  You're either with the globalists or you are a dangerous, subversive
[2:38:20.380 --> 2:38:22.380]  Most likely allied with the Russians, I'm sure
[2:38:22.380 --> 2:38:26.380]  In addition to establishing what one critic described as a propaganda factory
[2:38:26.380 --> 2:38:28.380]  To pump out government-backed propaganda
[2:38:28.380 --> 2:38:32.380]  The bill also authorizes spying on journalists
[2:38:32.380 --> 2:38:37.380]  Funding media outlets willing to serve as US government propaganda organs
[2:38:37.380 --> 2:38:42.380]  They're going to be training journalists to do journalism their way
[2:38:42.380 --> 2:38:44.380]  And at the same time, they'll be telling them, look
[2:38:44.380 --> 2:38:46.380]  You do it the way we want you to
[2:38:46.380 --> 2:38:48.380]  We'll give you access
[2:38:48.380 --> 2:38:50.380]  That's the way this is happening
[2:38:50.380 --> 2:38:52.380]  And just one final thing too that I didn't mention before
[2:38:52.380 --> 2:38:56.380]  When I was talking about planting malware on Trump computers
[2:38:56.380 --> 2:38:58.380]  Understand, as WikiLeaks pointed out
[2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:04.380]  They put out this information about how the CIA was using these vulnerabilities
[2:39:04.380 --> 2:39:08.380]  And they had identified specific vulnerabilities in specific software
[2:39:08.380 --> 2:39:10.380]  And they said, we notified all these organizations
[2:39:10.380 --> 2:39:12.380]  Now some of them, like Mozilla, which does Firefox
[2:39:12.380 --> 2:39:16.380]  They have responded with us trying to fix their software
[2:39:16.380 --> 2:39:18.380]  That's what a white-hat hacker does
[2:39:18.380 --> 2:39:24.380]  They find vulnerabilities and then they notify the people who own that software
[2:39:24.380 --> 2:39:26.380]  So they can make that software secure again
[2:39:26.380 --> 2:39:30.380]  A black-hat hacker, like the CIA, doesn't do that
[2:39:30.380 --> 2:39:32.380]  They use it for their own purposes
[2:39:32.380 --> 2:39:34.380]  And so they say, we told companies like Google
[2:39:34.380 --> 2:39:38.380]  And they don't respond except to confirm that they received our information
[2:39:38.380 --> 2:39:40.380]  They have not agreed or disagreed or questioned what we have told them
[2:39:40.380 --> 2:39:42.380]  In other words, they don't care
[2:39:42.380 --> 2:39:44.380]  And they said, and it gets worse than this
[2:39:44.380 --> 2:39:46.380]  They said, you have to understand that organizations like Google
[2:39:46.380 --> 2:39:52.380]  That have government contracts, that have employees who have security clearance
[2:39:52.380 --> 2:39:56.380]  They do not fix security holes
[2:39:56.380 --> 2:40:02.380]  Why? Because the American government creates and funds these security holes
[2:40:02.380 --> 2:40:06.380]  The American government wants you to be unsecure
[2:40:06.380 --> 2:40:08.380]  They don't want to keep you safe
[2:40:08.380 --> 2:40:10.380]  It's not about keeping you safe
[2:40:10.380 --> 2:40:12.380]  They want to tell you, you're going to have to sacrifice your privacy and your money
[2:40:12.380 --> 2:40:16.380]  And then we're going to have the CIA and these organizations make you safe
[2:40:16.380 --> 2:40:18.380]  No, the CIA is making you unsafe
[2:40:18.380 --> 2:40:22.380]  They put these vulnerabilities in, they leave them in
[2:40:22.380 --> 2:40:24.380]  They release this information, they lost track of it
[2:40:24.380 --> 2:40:26.380]  Remember, we had that discussion, John McAfee was talking about it
[2:40:26.380 --> 2:40:30.380]  He debated with one of these security experts and the guy said, well, we need a key to the iPhone
[2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:32.380]  He goes, you get a key to the iPhone, you're going to lose it
[2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:36.380]  It's going to go out in public domain, then all the criminals will have it
[2:40:36.380 --> 2:40:38.380]  That's precisely what's happened with Vault 7
[2:40:38.380 --> 2:40:40.380]  That's what WikiLeaks is telling us
[2:40:40.380 --> 2:40:44.380]  And now, what WikiLeaks is telling us, Julian Assange says, they're not interested in fixing it
[2:40:44.380 --> 2:40:47.380]  They don't even want to know what's going on here
[2:40:47.380 --> 2:40:49.380]  They have security clearance and they don't want to fix this
[2:40:49.380 --> 2:40:54.380]  They don't want to protect you from individual criminals
[2:40:54.380 --> 2:40:56.380]  Who might go in and steal all your bank account information
[2:40:56.380 --> 2:40:58.380]  They could care less about that
[2:40:58.380 --> 2:41:00.380]  They couldn't care less about any of your security
[2:41:00.380 --> 2:41:04.380]  It's a lie that they're doing this to make you safe
[2:41:04.380 --> 2:41:07.380]  They're doing this for their own selfish purposes
[2:41:07.380 --> 2:41:10.380]  And they will throw your safety, your liberty under the bus
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:14.380]  You can't trade your privacy and your liberty for safety and security
[2:41:14.380 --> 2:41:15.380]  It doesn't ever work, it doesn't ever work
[2:41:15.380 --> 2:41:17.380]  Let's go to the calls, I've talked a good bit here
[2:41:17.380 --> 2:41:18.380]  I want to get some of these calls
[2:41:18.380 --> 2:41:22.380]  Let's go to Dominic in Canada, go ahead, Dominic
[2:41:22.380 --> 2:41:26.380]  Hello, I'm calling in for the first time
[2:41:26.380 --> 2:41:29.380]  My girlfriend is a U.S. citizen
[2:41:29.380 --> 2:41:35.380]  I plan to legally immigrate into the U.S. in the next two or three years
[2:41:35.380 --> 2:41:39.380]  My question is, it's a two-parter
[2:41:39.380 --> 2:41:45.380]  How do you think, since right now the current reports are that
[2:41:45.380 --> 2:41:52.380]  the attack near the British Parliament was done by an extremist preacher
[2:41:52.380 --> 2:41:54.380]  will be played off?
[2:41:54.380 --> 2:41:59.380]  And two, do you think we'll see, because of the stance
[2:41:59.380 --> 2:42:05.380]  that he will see copycat attacks in the near future?
[2:42:05.380 --> 2:42:08.380]  Well, yeah, I mean, what we saw today, and the reason I said right away
[2:42:08.380 --> 2:42:11.380]  that I knew that it was a radical Islamic terrorist
[2:42:11.380 --> 2:42:13.380]  was because it's the same MMO
[2:42:13.380 --> 2:42:15.380]  Of course, it is a copycat attack of what we've seen before
[2:42:15.380 --> 2:42:18.380]  We've seen knife attacks, we've seen axe attacks
[2:42:18.380 --> 2:42:22.380]  We've seen multiple attacks that have been conducted by vehicles
[2:42:22.380 --> 2:42:23.380]  So yes, there will be more of those
[2:42:23.380 --> 2:42:29.380]  And we need to understand, even though the British government is not going to
[2:42:29.380 --> 2:42:30.380]  they're going to downplay this
[2:42:30.380 --> 2:42:33.380]  You know they're going to downplay it in a politically correct way
[2:42:33.380 --> 2:42:37.380]  There will be some, like Nigel Farage, who will point out the obvious facts
[2:42:37.380 --> 2:42:39.380]  that are staring people in the face about this
[2:42:39.380 --> 2:42:43.380]  But they will downplay it, and there will be more copycat attacks
[2:42:43.380 --> 2:42:48.380]  What has to happen, and it just shows the vulnerability of a free and open society
[2:42:48.380 --> 2:42:53.380]  to this, we have to address this at the border
[2:42:53.380 --> 2:42:56.380]  We have to have vetting at the border
[2:42:56.380 --> 2:43:00.380]  One of the things that I just can't believe that the left gets away with
[2:43:00.380 --> 2:43:02.380]  We're talking about these double standards
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:05.380]  The fact that they had absolutely nothing to say about Barack Obama
[2:43:05.380 --> 2:43:07.380]  going to war with seven different countries
[2:43:07.380 --> 2:43:09.380]  And these countries that he's at war with
[2:43:09.380 --> 2:43:12.380]  These countries that he's bombing, these countries that he's sending troops to
[2:43:12.380 --> 2:43:15.380]  are presumably dangerous, wouldn't you think?
[2:43:15.380 --> 2:43:19.380]  And yet, if we want to say these people that we have presumed to be so dangerous
[2:43:19.380 --> 2:43:22.380]  that we go to war with them with bombs and troops
[2:43:22.380 --> 2:43:25.380]  We should look at who is coming to us from those countries
[2:43:25.380 --> 2:43:28.380]  They throw up their hands and fits a political correctness
[2:43:28.380 --> 2:43:30.380]  and say, no, that's racist to do that
[2:43:30.380 --> 2:43:33.380]  So we have to do vetting
[2:43:33.380 --> 2:43:37.380]  Actually, I think we need more countries on the list than we currently have
[2:43:37.380 --> 2:43:41.380]  But we have to do control vetting of these countries that we're currently at war with
[2:43:41.380 --> 2:43:44.380]  If they're not dangerous, then let's stop the war against them
[2:43:44.380 --> 2:43:46.380]  I think these wars are not productive
[2:43:46.380 --> 2:43:51.380]  I think we have created chaos in Syria and Libya and elsewhere
[2:43:51.380 --> 2:43:55.380]  Everything that the American government has done and Obama's wars have made things worse
[2:43:55.380 --> 2:43:58.380]  So I'm not in favor of continuing those wars quite frankly
[2:43:58.380 --> 2:44:00.380]  But as long as they got these wars going on
[2:44:00.380 --> 2:44:04.380]  Don't you think we ought to vet people coming in, Dominic?
[2:44:04.380 --> 2:44:12.380]  I don't think that if we're going to consider them an enemy to the states
[2:44:12.380 --> 2:44:17.380]  That they should be considered admissible to a country now
[2:44:17.380 --> 2:44:19.380]  Yeah, I think we need to know who these people are
[2:44:19.380 --> 2:44:24.380]  And quite frankly, the default position is not that everybody in the world has a right to immigrate into America
[2:44:24.380 --> 2:44:26.380]  There's nothing about that
[2:44:26.380 --> 2:44:30.380]  When they say that, well, we incidentally and legally collected this information on Donald Trump
[2:44:30.380 --> 2:44:33.380]  What they're saying is that non-U.S. persons
[2:44:33.380 --> 2:44:36.380]  And that was a very clever legalism that they use
[2:44:36.380 --> 2:44:38.380]  They're non-U.S. persons
[2:44:38.380 --> 2:44:45.380]  Non-U.S. persons don't have these protections that are afforded to Americans in the Bill of Rights
[2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:51.380]  But yet, they're trying to tell us that these non-American persons, these foreign citizens, have a right to immigrate
[2:44:51.380 --> 2:44:55.380]  And if we say that they don't, then we're somehow bad and we're racist and so forth
[2:44:55.380 --> 2:45:02.380]  We have to understand that if they're coming from a country that we currently judge to be dangerous enough that we're going to war with them
[2:45:02.380 --> 2:45:04.380]  Then we need to know who they are
[2:45:04.380 --> 2:45:09.380]  If we can't know who they are, if we can't vet them, if there is no reliable information on these people, they don't come
[2:45:09.380 --> 2:45:10.380]  It's just that simple
[2:45:10.380 --> 2:45:12.380]  I think, thank you, Dominic
[2:45:12.380 --> 2:45:14.380]  Let me go to some of the other callers so we can get through as many as we can
[2:45:14.380 --> 2:45:16.380]  Let's go to Kevin in Florida
[2:45:16.380 --> 2:45:18.380]  Kevin, go ahead
[2:45:18.380 --> 2:45:20.380]  Thank you, David
[2:45:20.380 --> 2:45:22.380]  I'm a huge InfoWars fan
[2:45:22.380 --> 2:45:24.380]  I just want to start off by saying that
[2:45:24.380 --> 2:45:28.380]  My brother was the one who turned me on to InfoWars about five, six years ago
[2:45:28.380 --> 2:45:30.380]  That's really woken me up
[2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:32.380]  I was originally from Detroit
[2:45:32.380 --> 2:45:35.380]  And I was raised a hardcore Democrat
[2:45:35.380 --> 2:45:38.380]  You know, Democrats are for the working Republicans for the wealthy
[2:45:38.380 --> 2:45:43.380]  And then as I got older, I realized that that was just a fraudulent scam
[2:45:43.380 --> 2:45:50.380]  I just want to say what's going on right now is a well orchestrated plan by the people in power
[2:45:50.380 --> 2:45:57.380]  That are electing these officials who are not carrying out what we the people want
[2:45:57.380 --> 2:45:59.380]  They think they're above the law
[2:45:59.380 --> 2:46:03.380]  They're controlled by lobbyists because of the corruption
[2:46:03.380 --> 2:46:05.380]  And most aspects of the government
[2:46:05.380 --> 2:46:08.380]  I mean, you have a few senators in Congress
[2:46:08.380 --> 2:46:10.380]  And they're actually trying to carry out the will of the people
[2:46:10.380 --> 2:46:14.380]  But for the vast majority of it, it's just so corrupt
[2:46:14.380 --> 2:46:19.380]  And they're using that as well as the propaganda of the media
[2:46:19.380 --> 2:46:25.380]  To weaken the public to try and carry out this agenda
[2:46:25.380 --> 2:46:29.380]  And I mean, we keep on hoping it's not going to happen
[2:46:29.380 --> 2:46:32.380]  But I just believe in order for anything to really change
[2:46:32.380 --> 2:46:35.380]  There's going to be a revolution, part two
[2:46:35.380 --> 2:46:40.380]  Because the informed people are fed up with what's going on in the government
[2:46:40.380 --> 2:46:46.380]  The corruption and you can only poke it back too much before the bear fights back
[2:46:46.380 --> 2:46:48.380]  Absolutely. You say you're from Michigan
[2:46:48.380 --> 2:46:52.380]  So you have seen the policies of the Democrats at work
[2:46:52.380 --> 2:46:55.380]  And you have seen one of the most prosperous states in the union
[2:46:55.380 --> 2:46:57.380]  Become one of the poorest states in the union
[2:46:57.380 --> 2:47:01.380]  As they shipped our jobs overseas and shut down our factories
[2:47:01.380 --> 2:47:04.380]  And then applied their welfare state to everyone
[2:47:04.380 --> 2:47:08.380]  Not even able to supply clean water to the individuals there
[2:47:08.380 --> 2:47:10.380]  Absolute total failure
[2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:16.380]  And yet applying these politics of envy is the way that they got this through in Michigan
[2:47:16.380 --> 2:47:19.380]  You're right, there are individuals who are above the law
[2:47:19.380 --> 2:47:23.380]  We can see that very clearly and we are not going to be able to move forward
[2:47:23.380 --> 2:47:27.380]  To drain the swamp, to do whatever you want to, how you want to phrase this
[2:47:27.380 --> 2:47:31.380]  We're not going to be able to do that unless we get rid of these so-called law enforcement people
[2:47:31.380 --> 2:47:35.380]  Who give certain individuals like Hillary Clinton a pass
[2:47:35.380 --> 2:47:37.380]  After saying that she has committed a felony
[2:47:37.380 --> 2:47:40.380]  Comey gives her a pass and then says, but don't you try this
[2:47:40.380 --> 2:47:46.380]  Then he comes out and comes after people for whom he has absolutely no proof
[2:47:46.380 --> 2:47:52.380]  Ignoring the crimes of people who have leaked information illegally about Michael Flynn
[2:47:52.380 --> 2:47:54.380]  I'm not going to talk about any investigations there
[2:47:54.380 --> 2:47:57.380]  Or the people who are running the sanctuary cities
[2:47:57.380 --> 2:48:04.380]  Who say we are going to give an entire class of people special protections
[2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:08.380]  Because they came here from a foreign country illegally
[2:48:08.380 --> 2:48:10.380]  Criminally trespassing in our country, foreign citizens
[2:48:10.380 --> 2:48:13.380]  What we're going to give them special protection
[2:48:13.380 --> 2:48:16.380]  We're not going to deport people or turn them over to ICE
[2:48:16.380 --> 2:48:21.380]  Even if we know that they are guilty of criminal sexual offenses
[2:48:21.380 --> 2:48:26.380]  That's what happened here in Travis County in Austin, Texas with a sheriff here
[2:48:26.380 --> 2:48:29.380]  Refusing to turn over except for three particular crimes
[2:48:29.380 --> 2:48:31.380]  And that did not include child molestation
[2:48:31.380 --> 2:48:33.380]  I think she's now added that to her list
[2:48:33.380 --> 2:48:35.380]  Very generous of her to do that, don't you think?
[2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:38.380]  But we see the same thing happening in Montgomery County
[2:48:38.380 --> 2:48:41.380]  Throughout the state of Maryland, they want to turn the entire state of Maryland
[2:48:41.380 --> 2:48:44.380]  Into a sanctuary state and what did we just see?
[2:48:44.380 --> 2:48:50.380]  We saw these individuals, two guys, 18 and 17 in class with 14 year olds
[2:48:50.380 --> 2:48:52.380]  And we don't even know if that's their real age
[2:48:52.380 --> 2:48:56.380]  They raped this girl in multiple ways
[2:48:56.380 --> 2:49:00.380]  And these are people that ICE wanted but the sanctuary law enforcement
[2:49:00.380 --> 2:49:03.380]  Quote, quote, law enforcement would not turn them over to ICE
[2:49:03.380 --> 2:49:05.380]  That is what is truly criminal
[2:49:05.380 --> 2:49:07.380]  And so yes, there are people who are above the law
[2:49:07.380 --> 2:49:10.380]  There are entire classes of people who are above the law
[2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:13.380]  There's no protection if you come here illegally
[2:49:13.380 --> 2:49:15.380]  And that's the way the Democrats want to run this
[2:49:15.380 --> 2:49:20.380]  Let's go to Beto in Iowa, does that pronounce the name correctly?
[2:49:20.380 --> 2:49:22.380]  Go ahead
[2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:24.380]  Yes, hello
[2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:26.380]  Hello, yeah, gotcha
[2:49:26.380 --> 2:49:30.380]  Yes, I just wanted to answer your question, I have a statement
[2:49:30.380 --> 2:49:32.380]  First, why are they going after you in Breitbart?
[2:49:32.380 --> 2:49:35.380]  Well, because you guys are completely exposing their blueprint
[2:49:35.380 --> 2:49:42.380]  And of course, the government is overtaken by the elite globalists that you've been exposing for over 20 years
[2:49:42.380 --> 2:49:48.380]  And it's time, well, back in the day, they used to get rid of you guys with a bullet
[2:49:48.380 --> 2:49:52.380]  Unfortunately, the internet that they assumed was never going to overtake the media
[2:49:52.380 --> 2:49:54.380]  Has done the exact opposite
[2:49:54.380 --> 2:49:58.380]  So now they can't, of course, destroy you with a bullet
[2:49:58.380 --> 2:50:00.380]  Now they've got to come after you with social media
[2:50:00.380 --> 2:50:08.380]  You know, I'm reading a book right now called Spooked by Nicholas Hsu, which was the guy who was behind the Kill the Messenger
[2:50:08.380 --> 2:50:12.380]  Killing the Messenger with Jeremy Renner, the guy who was exposing the whole CIA thing
[2:50:12.380 --> 2:50:18.380]  So this thing just goes back to so much of corruption that you guys are exposed from
[2:50:18.380 --> 2:50:25.380]  Not only, you know, CIA, drugs, 9-11, I mean, you guys are the epicenter of what is America
[2:50:25.380 --> 2:50:27.380]  And that's why they're going after you in Breitbart
[2:50:27.380 --> 2:50:30.380]  Remember what happened to Gary Webb? You talked about Kill the Messenger
[2:50:30.380 --> 2:50:35.380]  Remember what happened to him? He did this expose talking about how the CIA had created a crack cocaine epidemic
[2:50:35.380 --> 2:50:38.380]  And you were using it to fund the Contras
[2:50:38.380 --> 2:50:40.380]  He first won prizes for that journalism
[2:50:40.380 --> 2:50:46.380]  Then mainstream media set up entire divisions to attack him, to destroy him personally
[2:50:46.380 --> 2:50:51.380]  And to shut that down, that's the process that they're coming after with Breitbart and Infowars
[2:50:51.380 --> 2:50:58.380]  Anybody who opposes their agenda, say with us, we'll be right back with more phone calls

[2:55:00.380 --> 2:55:13.380]  This is our fluoride free toothpaste that has iodine and nano silver to protect against gum disease, the bacteria that causes gum disease, which also causes heart disease
[2:55:13.380 --> 2:55:18.380]  Very important, very fine toothpaste. That's why it sold out so quickly. It's now back in stock at infowarslife.com
[2:55:18.380 --> 2:55:26.380]  And also we have 30 to 40% off info war select storeable food. You'll find that at infowarsstore.com for just a limited time
[2:55:26.380 --> 2:55:31.380]  I want to go back to the callers real quickly and we're going to have Roger Stone joining us at the top of the hour
[2:55:31.380 --> 2:55:39.380]  Let's go to Monty and Texas. Monty, I see you wanted to talk about the squatter report that I filed last week. Go ahead
[2:55:39.380 --> 2:55:54.380]  Yes, David. Great job. I won't keep you long. My son is a law enforcement officer here in Texas and he confirmed pretty much everything that you reported
[2:55:54.380 --> 2:56:04.380]  This problem is widespread. They know about it and due to the structure of the civil laws there's not a lot they can do about it
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:14.380]  I was just wondering, I'll keep you quick, quick. Have you had any updates on this and how I'll drop off and let other callers at the end?
[2:56:14.380 --> 2:56:29.380]  Yeah, I can't really go into what they did to get the people out, but it was very effective. Nobody was harmed and they were able to get them out using methods that were outside the legal system
[2:56:29.380 --> 2:56:38.380]  But I want to point out to people that this is something, as far as I'm aware of, if you look at the comments on that article, you'll see a lot of people sharing stories about things that have happened
[2:56:38.380 --> 2:56:50.380]  It's not always a group of criminal illegals who come in and take over your house by changing the utilities registration. And then when the police show up, they say, but wait a minute, we're on the utilities bill
[2:56:50.380 --> 2:57:00.380]  So we have a informal verbal lease with these people. We pay them on a month-to-month basis on cash and so we really are legitimate tenants here
[2:57:00.380 --> 2:57:08.380]  But at that point, as you point out, your son is a police officer, the police say, well, we're not set up to where we can judge as to who the rightful owners are
[2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:14.380]  So now it's got to go to court. Now that's a long drawn-out process that can take months to try to evict somebody out of that situation
[2:57:14.380 --> 2:57:23.380]  It got so bad in Florida that they did pass a law in Florida and there are things that can be done and some utility companies will do this
[2:57:23.380 --> 2:57:37.380]  I've been told by some people here that when they got an apartment at the apartment complex, had it on file with the utility company, that they could not change the utilities unless they had a lease in hand
[2:57:37.380 --> 2:57:43.380]  So perhaps there's something you can do with your utility company if your state does not have the proper laws there
[2:57:43.380 --> 2:57:45.380]  But here's the bottom line, folks
[2:57:45.380 --> 2:57:56.380]  If we have a government that will not protect our borders, if we have a government that doesn't see that its true job is to set there and to record properly deeds and transitions
[2:57:56.380 --> 2:58:05.380]  And to make sure that we have the legal structure that is required for orderly transition and possession of property, then we wind up with these types of things
[2:58:05.380 --> 2:58:11.380]  These are people who came in here illegally and you have other situations where we had illegal aliens who were taking advantage of
[2:58:11.380 --> 2:58:18.380]  A group of people were sold by a dishonest realtor, were sold a house for $5,000 and the family came back for vacation
[2:58:18.380 --> 2:58:21.380]  They had listed their house there on vacation so it could be shown
[2:58:21.380 --> 2:58:25.380]  When they came back, these other people genuinely thought they had bought the house with that ridiculous amount of money
[2:58:25.380 --> 2:58:34.380]  But what happens when the government won't follow the laws and won't be the appropriate referee, then you just widen the circle of people who are defrauded
[2:58:34.380 --> 2:58:39.380]  So check out that report and educate yourself about how you can lose your home
[2:58:39.380 --> 2:58:41.380]  We're going to be right back with Roger Stone
[2:59:09.380 --> 2:59:11.380]  We know asses that your body absolutely needs
[2:59:11.380 --> 2:59:17.380]  In the history of M4's life, we brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2
[2:59:17.380 --> 2:59:19.380]  SuperMail Vitality and so many others
[2:59:19.380 --> 2:59:25.380]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects
[2:59:25.380 --> 2:59:29.380]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products
[2:59:29.380 --> 2:59:31.380]  And this part is most important
[2:59:31.380 --> 2:59:38.380]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard
[2:59:38.380 --> 2:59:41.380]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure
[2:59:41.380 --> 2:59:44.380]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war
[2:59:44.380 --> 2:59:47.380]  That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion
[2:59:47.380 --> 2:59:49.380]  Take action now before we sell out
[2:59:49.380 --> 3:00:10.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:10.380 --> 3:00:26.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I'm David Knight and we're going to be going to Roger Stone
[3:00:26.380 --> 3:00:29.380]  He's going to be covering the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[3:00:29.380 --> 3:00:33.380]  And I'm sure he's going to want to talk about these recent developments
[3:00:33.380 --> 3:00:38.380]  I apologize to the callers who are still on hold, we didn't have time to get through to everybody that had called in
[3:00:38.380 --> 3:00:40.380]  But we need to move forward to Roger Stone
[3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:42.380]  Roger are you on the line?
[3:00:42.380 --> 3:00:43.380]  I'm with you
[3:00:43.380 --> 3:00:49.380]  Alright Roger, and of course I want to get your reaction to this news that has come out from Devin Nunes
[3:00:49.380 --> 3:00:54.380]  Saying that he's now learned from his own personal investigation while reviewing intelligence reports himself
[3:00:54.380 --> 3:00:58.380]  And of course he is chair of the House Intelligence Committee
[3:00:58.380 --> 3:01:06.380]  So he's looking through intelligence reports and he sees that there was information collected about the Trump transition team
[3:01:06.380 --> 3:01:11.380]  He says it looks like it was done incidentally and legally
[3:01:11.380 --> 3:01:14.380]  But he says I'm actually alarmed by it, he should be
[3:01:14.380 --> 3:01:17.380]  And at the same time we have this other reported info wars.com
[3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:26.380]  Where the Department of Justice had found falsely planted malware at Trump Tower that was designed to mimic ties to Russia
[3:01:26.380 --> 3:01:29.380]  So we see that, yes in fact, as we reported earlier in the week
[3:01:29.380 --> 3:01:37.380]  We had this project dragnet and other things that showed that we had addresses of Donald Trump's quite some time ago
[3:01:37.380 --> 3:01:39.380]  Many of his employees were being surveilled
[3:01:39.380 --> 3:01:43.380]  We now know that they have collected this based on the House Intelligence Committee Chairman
[3:01:43.380 --> 3:01:50.380]  And we also see that they put software on to frame Donald Trump and other people to make it look as though they are talking to the Russians
[3:01:50.380 --> 3:01:52.380]  Your comments on this
[3:01:52.380 --> 3:02:00.380]  Busted. I mean for the last two weeks the heads of the various agencies in the deep state have vehemently denied
[3:02:00.380 --> 3:02:04.380]  That there was any surveillance of Trump Tower
[3:02:04.380 --> 3:02:08.380]  I have repeatedly urged the President not to back off
[3:02:08.380 --> 3:02:15.380]  Meanwhile his weak-meet advisor Sean Spicer and Reintz Priebus have been trying to convince him to walk it back
[3:02:15.380 --> 3:02:19.380]  Just apologize to Obama wrong
[3:02:19.380 --> 3:02:25.380]  Thanks to Infowars we now know that surveillance of Donald Trump started much earlier than we thought
[3:02:25.380 --> 3:02:32.380]  They began having his phone calls in New York and Florida monitored under the Bush administration
[3:02:32.380 --> 3:02:36.380]  And that continued into the Obama administration
[3:02:36.380 --> 3:02:44.380]  Now Chairman Nunes has learned that they weren't spying on candidate for President Trump
[3:02:44.380 --> 3:02:48.380]  They were spying on President Trump
[3:02:48.380 --> 3:02:52.380]  Because they were spying on the transition offices
[3:02:52.380 --> 3:03:03.380]  I know for myself, David, that based on a New York Times story of January 20, 1917
[3:03:03.380 --> 3:03:09.380]  That the FBI was wiretapping me, was monitoring my phone calls
[3:03:09.380 --> 3:03:15.380]  Which means they were listening to my phone calls with candidate Donald Trump
[3:03:15.380 --> 3:03:20.380]  You know, Roger, I put up a report again because it was, I think, three years old
[3:03:20.380 --> 3:03:26.380]  I put it up on my YouTube channel because Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and the CIA
[3:03:26.380 --> 3:03:30.380]  Went to Washington Lee University and he was talking to the law students there
[3:03:30.380 --> 3:03:35.380]  And he said, we don't listen to bad people, we listen to interesting people
[3:03:35.380 --> 3:03:40.380]  Who would be more interesting than the President-elect for these people to listen to
[3:03:40.380 --> 3:03:45.380]  And he also bragged, Roger, about the fact that he didn't need the Patriot Act
[3:03:45.380 --> 3:03:47.380]  He didn't need a special section of the Patriot Act
[3:03:47.380 --> 3:03:51.380]  He had a direct order from the President and he said that as he pointed to his chest
[3:03:51.380 --> 3:03:54.380]  That is a recipe for dictatorship
[3:03:54.380 --> 3:03:58.380]  And that is precisely what we're seeing here, is dictatorship and coup foundation
[3:03:58.380 --> 3:04:04.380]  The fact that we even know about this program, blockbuster story, written by Dr. Jerry Corsi
[3:04:04.380 --> 3:04:12.380]  Is because a disgruntled and disillusioned CIA agent who realized that this was all unconstitutional
[3:04:12.380 --> 3:04:15.380]  And highly illegal became a whistleblower
[3:04:15.380 --> 3:04:16.380]  Yes
[3:04:16.380 --> 3:04:20.380]  In this particular case, as I said to you earlier today
[3:04:20.380 --> 3:04:25.380]  And also yesterday, this is a slow motion coup
[3:04:25.380 --> 3:04:31.380]  The Ministry of Truth, the National Censorship Board
[3:04:31.380 --> 3:04:39.380]  That will decide what can and cannot be said is step one of the proposed, I should say planned, Trump takedown
[3:04:39.380 --> 3:04:42.380]  And just as we see, there's multiple aspects of this
[3:04:42.380 --> 3:04:46.380]  As we see that they're listening to Trump, but then they're also planting stuff to frame him
[3:04:46.380 --> 3:04:48.380]  That is what this Ministry of Truth is about
[3:04:48.380 --> 3:04:55.380]  They're going to control the narrative, but then they're also going to apply and ledge collusion to people as well
[3:04:55.380 --> 3:04:58.380]  Stay with us, we're going to have Roger Stone taking over the fourth hour of the broadcast
[3:04:58.380 --> 3:04:59.380]  We'll be right back
[3:04:59.380 --> 3:05:04.380]  President Donald Trump and Info Wars have been accused of espionage
[3:05:04.380 --> 3:05:07.380]  During this week's Senate hearings on Russian hacking
[3:05:07.380 --> 3:05:11.380]  The establishment Democrats and rogue intelligence heads
[3:05:11.380 --> 3:05:15.380]  Attempted to frame Donald Trump and Info Wars
[3:05:15.380 --> 3:05:20.380]  For colluding with the Russians and violating the National Defense Authorization Act
[3:05:20.380 --> 3:05:25.380]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to, I think, the sphere's question
[3:05:25.380 --> 3:05:30.380]  That there are other RT's operating in the US, can you describe them?
[3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:37.380]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, and then I think you have them feeding other entities
[3:05:37.380 --> 3:05:39.380]  Info Wars comes to mind
[3:05:39.380 --> 3:05:42.380]  Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[3:05:42.380 --> 3:05:46.380]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory
[3:05:46.380 --> 3:05:50.380]  That far-right news organizations like Info Wars
[3:05:50.380 --> 3:05:55.380]  Look at action to assist Russian operatives to help Trump win the election
[3:05:55.380 --> 3:06:21.380]  You can learn more right now at infowars.com

[3:06:56.380 --> 3:07:24.380]  The reason Info Wars Live has five star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family
[3:07:24.380 --> 3:07:26.380]  It was life-changing for me
[3:07:26.380 --> 3:07:29.380]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my Super Female
[3:07:29.380 --> 3:07:34.380]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again
[3:07:34.380 --> 3:07:37.380]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good
[3:07:37.380 --> 3:07:41.380]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again
[3:07:41.380 --> 3:07:44.380]  So obviously Super Female is amazing, I love it
[3:07:44.380 --> 3:07:54.380]  Nascent Iodine is essential, Survival Shield X2, if there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2
[3:07:54.380 --> 3:07:58.380]  It's got a five star rating, it's a win-win, InfoWarsLive.com
[3:07:58.380 --> 3:08:00.380]  InfoWars.com
[3:08:28.380 --> 3:08:32.380]  I'm sitting in for Public Enemy Number One of the Deep State
[3:08:32.380 --> 3:08:35.380]  That would be Alex Jones
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:39.380]  We now nakedly see the attempt to frame him
[3:08:39.380 --> 3:08:43.380]  Claiming that he was in league with the Russians
[3:08:43.380 --> 3:08:55.380]  That the Russians were expending millions in bots to take presumably feeds from InfoWars.com and spread them to the world
[3:08:55.380 --> 3:08:57.380]  This is a damnable lie
[3:08:57.380 --> 3:09:01.380]  In terms of exposure, I wish we were that lucky
[3:09:01.380 --> 3:09:04.380]  But InfoWars is the tip of the spear, folks
[3:09:04.380 --> 3:09:12.380]  They've got to take InfoWars down first because we are the ones telling you about the surveillance of the President of the United States
[3:09:12.380 --> 3:09:19.380]  We are the ones exposing the small-time Joe McCarthy's on the House Intelligence Committee
[3:09:19.380 --> 3:09:29.380]  We are the ones exposing the corruption and the greed of John and Tony Podesta and their patrons, Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton
[3:09:29.380 --> 3:09:33.380]  So please go to the InfoWars.com store
[3:09:33.380 --> 3:09:40.380]  Now there's a lot of fine products, but I want to recommend one that my wife thinks is particularly effective
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:46.380]  That is their blue toothpaste, which is the super blue fluoride
[3:09:46.380 --> 3:09:50.380]  She absolutely swears by this product
[3:09:50.380 --> 3:09:54.380]  She has a much, much better smile than mine
[3:09:54.380 --> 3:10:00.380]  I'm afraid an occasional cigar and a heavy addiction to espresso
[3:10:00.380 --> 3:10:02.380]  Make mine a quadruple, please
[3:10:02.380 --> 3:10:04.380]  Has stained my teeth
[3:10:04.380 --> 3:10:08.380]  I find that I get some assistance, but her teeth gleam
[3:10:08.380 --> 3:10:17.380]  I have seen the product reports on this, the feedback is amazing, many, many, many testimonials
[3:10:17.380 --> 3:10:26.380]  So if you want to have a winning smile, a Ronald Reagan-type smile, a Donald Trump-type smile
[3:10:26.380 --> 3:10:33.380]  Get your super blue fluoride toothpaste now, it's back in stock, so I'd move quickly
[3:10:33.380 --> 3:10:42.380]  If any of you saw the House Intelligence Committee meeting this week, it was a veritable kangaroo court
[3:10:42.380 --> 3:10:48.380]  I don't know how many small clowns they could have stuffed in this car
[3:10:48.380 --> 3:11:09.380]  I saw Representative Adam Schiff and Representative Eric Swowell acting as demagogues, engaging in red-baiting, fear-mongering, the worst form of distortion, half-truths, and in some cases, no truths
[3:11:09.380 --> 3:11:15.380]  I had to go through the transcripts because I couldn't believe how egregious so much of this was
[3:11:15.380 --> 3:11:19.380]  Let's go to page one, Mr. Schiff to Mr. Comey
[3:11:19.380 --> 3:11:24.380]  Are you familiar, pardon me, do you know who Roger Stone is?
[3:11:24.380 --> 3:11:27.380]  Director Comey, generally yes
[3:11:27.380 --> 3:11:31.380]  Are you aware that he is a partner of Paul Manafort?
[3:11:31.380 --> 3:11:34.380]  Thank you for the guilt by association
[3:11:34.380 --> 3:11:42.380]  Paul Manafort is formally accused of nothing and served Donald Trump's campaign with distinction
[3:11:42.380 --> 3:11:52.380]  Going to the second page, Mr. Comey says Mr. Stone acknowledged Mr. Podesta's time in the barrel was coming in August of 2016
[3:11:52.380 --> 3:11:59.380]  Which would have been prior to the public release of the stolen emails by WikiLeaks of Mr. Podesta's
[3:11:59.380 --> 3:12:06.380]  Do you know how Mr. Stone would have known that Mr. Podesta's emails were going to be leaked?
[3:12:06.380 --> 3:12:08.380]  Listen here, numbnuts
[3:12:08.380 --> 3:12:11.380]  I never said I knew in advance
[3:12:11.380 --> 3:12:19.380]  I had already seen an incredible memo by Dr. Jerome Corsi on the massive corruption of Tony and John
[3:12:19.380 --> 3:12:26.380]  I knew that there were a number of investigative journalists working on this, their connections to organized crime
[3:12:26.380 --> 3:12:32.380]  I would write my own piece on this in October, which took a longer
[3:12:32.380 --> 3:12:38.380]  Today, if you go online, there's a piece that says Stone's alibi falls apart
[3:12:38.380 --> 3:12:43.380]  Because some of the facts in that piece came from WikiLeaks
[3:12:43.380 --> 3:12:46.380]  Yes, they had been published months before
[3:12:46.380 --> 3:12:48.380]  Extraneous, irrelevant
[3:12:48.380 --> 3:12:50.380]  Brock, you need better writers
[3:12:50.380 --> 3:12:55.380]  If you see any bot telling you that my alibi has fallen apart
[3:12:55.380 --> 3:12:58.380]  Please, members of the House committee, invite me
[3:12:58.380 --> 3:13:02.380]  I'll be happy to bitch slap all of you in public
[3:13:02.380 --> 3:13:04.380]  Because you have defamed me
[3:13:04.380 --> 3:13:09.380]  Mr. Swalwell says that if I am called to testify, I will lie
[3:13:09.380 --> 3:13:11.380]  That's defamatory
[3:13:11.380 --> 3:13:15.380]  Wave your congressional immunity, congressmen
[3:13:15.380 --> 3:13:21.380]  Let's let a federal judge and jury decide whether you are telling the truth
[3:13:21.380 --> 3:13:33.380]  Again, Mr. Schiff says that Mr. Stone was in touch with the Russian hacker, crucifer 2.0
[3:13:33.380 --> 3:13:40.380]  And subsequently wrote an article about crucifer's role in the hack of DNC documents
[3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:42.380]  Wrong, num nuts
[3:13:42.380 --> 3:13:47.380]  I wrote the article substantially before the brief
[3:13:47.380 --> 3:13:54.380]  Now fully disclosed exchange with a man alleged
[3:13:54.380 --> 3:13:59.380]  Alleged by the people who just said the president wasn't, Trump Tower wasn't under surveillance
[3:13:59.380 --> 3:14:01.380]  We just learned it is
[3:14:01.380 --> 3:14:05.380]  Alleged by those people to be a Russian asset
[3:14:05.380 --> 3:14:09.380]  Just because the boys in Langley say something is true
[3:14:09.380 --> 3:14:12.380]  Does not make it true
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:22.380]  So, any inference that my now entirely public exchange with crucifer 2.0 constitutes
[3:14:22.380 --> 3:14:30.380]  Collusion is disproved by the content, by the facts, and by the timeline
[3:14:30.380 --> 3:14:33.380]  There is no proof of collusion
[3:14:33.380 --> 3:14:40.380]  I did write an article on Breitbart for August 15th, I believe it was
[3:14:40.380 --> 3:14:46.380]  Or probably August 5th that outlined the role of a crucifer 2.0
[3:14:46.380 --> 3:14:51.380]  I was unaware of allegations, and that's what they are, that he is a Russian asset
[3:14:51.380 --> 3:14:57.380]  That makes my conversation beyond being banal, it also makes it unwitting
[3:14:57.380 --> 3:15:01.380]  But they say, well, Roger Stone, you're a dirty trickster
[3:15:01.380 --> 3:15:10.380]  You know, politics ain't beanbag, and I am certainly prepared to use sharp elbows to win
[3:15:10.380 --> 3:15:16.380]  But there's one trick that is not in my bag of tricks, that's treason
[3:15:16.380 --> 3:15:21.380]  And the implication that because I am not for war with Syria
[3:15:21.380 --> 3:15:24.380]  And because I think Hillary and Bill Clinton are epically corrupt
[3:15:24.380 --> 3:15:30.380]  And I applaud the fact that Julian Assange, who does not work for the Russians
[3:15:30.380 --> 3:15:38.380]  Congressman, exposed their corruption, that does not constitute a crime
[3:15:38.380 --> 3:15:44.380]  Now, I know that I have personally been wiretapped
[3:15:44.380 --> 3:15:49.380]  Page 1 of the New York Times, January 20th
[3:15:49.380 --> 3:15:56.380]  Wiretapped data used an inquiry of Trump aides
[3:15:56.380 --> 3:16:00.380]  On what evidence? On what probable cause?
[3:16:00.380 --> 3:16:03.380]  A Hillary Clinton press release?
[3:16:03.380 --> 3:16:08.380]  Certainly not because of my exchange with crucifer 2.0
[3:16:08.380 --> 3:16:14.380]  Because since the folks at the FBI have already been in my Twitter feed
[3:16:14.380 --> 3:16:19.380]  They know when they leak this story to the smoking gun in violation of federal law
[3:16:19.380 --> 3:16:22.380]  That it's a canard
[3:16:22.380 --> 3:16:25.380]  They're already aware of that
[3:16:25.380 --> 3:16:33.380]  Numerous other incidental details of my personal and business life appear in both the New York Times
[3:16:33.380 --> 3:16:35.380]  And in the smoking gun
[3:16:35.380 --> 3:16:39.380]  If the surveillance was done on me
[3:16:39.380 --> 3:16:42.380]  On the basis of a FISA court warrant
[3:16:42.380 --> 3:16:46.380]  I should say secret FISA court warrant
[3:16:46.380 --> 3:16:51.380]  Well then the leaking of that information constitutes a felony
[3:16:51.380 --> 3:16:54.380]  I have committed no felonies
[3:16:54.380 --> 3:17:01.380]  But those who are accusing me, they have committed multiple felonies
[3:17:01.380 --> 3:17:06.380]  Now, as for this entire question
[3:17:06.380 --> 3:17:10.380]  The Congressman James Himes from Connecticut, my native state
[3:17:10.380 --> 3:17:16.380]  Says that Roger Stone and Manafort are high on the list of those who should be called
[3:17:16.380 --> 3:17:18.380]  Amen brother
[3:17:18.380 --> 3:17:21.380]  Let's have an open hearing in the public
[3:17:21.380 --> 3:17:28.380]  So we can go through Mr. Schiff's words, sentence by sentence, and dissect them
[3:17:28.380 --> 3:17:32.380]  And let's go to the true historical record
[3:17:32.380 --> 3:17:35.380]  There is no evidence of collusion here
[3:17:35.380 --> 3:17:39.380]  It is part and parcel of the plan to bring down the president
[3:17:39.380 --> 3:17:46.380]  The deep state has to rationalize their surveillance of Donald Trump
[3:17:46.380 --> 3:17:51.380]  And they do so by creating this fake Russian narrative
[3:17:51.380 --> 3:17:54.380]  And then when you seek to dispute it
[3:17:54.380 --> 3:18:02.380]  They use their technological crackdown of censorship to stop you from having your side of the story aired
[3:18:02.380 --> 3:18:14.380]  This is precisely what the Ministry of Truth censor board signed into law by Barack Obama in 2017 was created for
[3:18:14.380 --> 3:18:21.380]  It is not ironic that Bush family operative Rob Portman, Senator from Ohio
[3:18:21.380 --> 3:18:25.380]  Is the sponsor of this big brother program
[3:18:25.380 --> 3:18:31.380]  That allows the entire widespread censorship
[3:18:31.380 --> 3:18:36.380]  And violation of our constitutional First Amendment rights
[3:18:36.380 --> 3:18:48.380]  Believe me, silencing those who would fight is the first step in the silent coup that is planned to take out our new president
[3:18:48.380 --> 3:18:54.380]  They have now been caught red-handed spying on him, bugging him
[3:18:54.380 --> 3:18:58.380]  I know my calls again with him were recorded
[3:18:58.380 --> 3:19:02.380]  We now know they were monitoring Trump Tower
[3:19:02.380 --> 3:19:05.380]  If you want to get the facts on this by the way
[3:19:05.380 --> 3:19:11.380]  You don't have to wait for the congressional hearings if they have the cojones to invite me
[3:19:11.380 --> 3:19:18.380]  You can go right now to the InfoWars store and get the making of the president 2016 by Roger Stone
[3:19:18.380 --> 3:19:21.380]  I address the story of John Podesta

[3:19:25.380 --> 3:19:32.380]  I address the entire fraudulent, corrupt, feted Russian lie

[3:21:58.380 --> 3:22:01.380]  When a storm causes power loss for a whole day, it can seem endless
[3:22:01.380 --> 3:22:08.380]  There's a new kind of storm brewing, one that could target our nation's power grid and turn off the power for not just days, but for months or longer
[3:22:08.380 --> 3:22:12.380]  Veteran news anchor Ted Koppel's new book, Lights Out, details this exact scenario
[3:22:12.380 --> 3:22:16.380]  And Centcom General Lloyd Austin says, it's not a question of if, but when
[3:22:16.380 --> 3:22:23.380]  That's why Americans are rushing to secure solar power generators to provide an endless supply of life-saving electricity without gas, fumes or noise
[3:22:23.380 --> 3:22:27.380]  And the breakthrough Patriot Power Generator 1500 has it all

[3:24:18.380 --> 3:24:19.380]  Hi, I'm Roger Stone
[3:24:19.380 --> 3:24:24.380]  Sitting in for the Revolution's MVP, Alex Jones
[3:24:24.380 --> 3:24:29.380]  Alex has recently been targeted by the deep state, along with yours truly
[3:24:29.380 --> 3:24:33.380]  In the effort to stop free speech
[3:24:33.380 --> 3:24:36.380]  And for us to bring you the very latest news
[3:24:36.380 --> 3:24:43.380]  About the deep state's efforts to undermine the democratically elected president of the United States, Donald Trump
[3:24:43.380 --> 3:24:47.380]  Donald Trump tweeted over a week ago
[3:24:47.380 --> 3:24:51.380]  That he had been the subject of surveillance at Trump Tower
[3:24:51.380 --> 3:24:56.380]  He was ridiculed across the board by mainstream media
[3:24:56.380 --> 3:25:02.380]  Now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee tells us that Trump was right
[3:25:02.380 --> 3:25:05.380]  Tip of the iceberg, folks
[3:25:05.380 --> 3:25:09.380]  As I told Charlie Rose on CBS yesterday
[3:25:09.380 --> 3:25:13.380]  Took over a year for the Watergate cover-up to unravel
[3:25:13.380 --> 3:25:16.380]  Nixon's men denied everything also
[3:25:16.380 --> 3:25:20.380]  But ultimately the facts became known
[3:25:20.380 --> 3:25:26.380]  The facts on the efforts to spy on President Trump
[3:25:26.380 --> 3:25:30.380]  President-elect Trump, not candidate Trump
[3:25:30.380 --> 3:25:33.380]  Have now in the last few hours come to light
[3:25:33.380 --> 3:25:40.380]  This just in, David Brock has reportedly suffered a major heart attack
[3:25:40.380 --> 3:25:43.380]  It is one of two things in my opinion
[3:25:43.380 --> 3:25:48.380]  The multiple crimes and the millions he owes the IRS
[3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:52.380]  From tax evasion is weighing on him
[3:25:52.380 --> 3:25:56.380]  Perhaps he has heard from the Trump Justice Department
[3:25:56.380 --> 3:26:01.380]  Based on the public complaints against him filed with the Federal Election Commission
[3:26:01.380 --> 3:26:08.380]  He is clearly guilty of numerous transgressions in 2016
[3:26:08.380 --> 3:26:11.380]  But there's one other possibility
[3:26:11.380 --> 3:26:13.380]  He could have been poisoned
[3:26:13.380 --> 3:26:18.380]  With a poison made to look like a heart attack by George Soros
[3:26:18.380 --> 3:26:24.380]  Who's very angry about the fact that he gave David Brock 30 or 40 million dollars
[3:26:24.380 --> 3:26:29.380]  And Mr. Brock has nothing whatsoever to show for it
[3:26:29.380 --> 3:26:32.380]  Also big news
[3:26:32.380 --> 3:26:37.380]  The MSNBC is reporting that my former partner Paul Manafort
[3:26:37.380 --> 3:26:46.380]  Worked for a Russian billionaire named, let me get this exactly right, Derapaska
[3:26:46.380 --> 3:26:49.380]  I believe is Oleg Derapaska
[3:26:49.380 --> 3:26:54.380]  What seems to be missing from the MSNBC story
[3:26:54.380 --> 3:27:01.380]  Is the fact that John and Tony Podesta worked for Mr. Derapaska
[3:27:01.380 --> 3:27:05.380]  Except for their contracts
[3:27:05.380 --> 3:27:12.380]  And payments were far, far larger than those paid to Paul Manafort
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:20.380]  Mr. Manafort has said today publicly that he had no role in lobbying the federal government
[3:27:20.380 --> 3:27:27.380]  And this appears to be part and parcel of the smear to prop up the notion
[3:27:27.380 --> 3:27:35.380]  That the Trump campaign was involved with nefarious characters in Eastern Europe
[3:27:35.380 --> 3:27:41.380]  More on this story from Mr. Manafort, I assure you
[3:27:41.380 --> 3:27:47.380]  At the White House, we have had, as I indicated earlier
[3:27:47.380 --> 3:27:51.380]  Weak need established from Republican aides
[3:27:51.380 --> 3:27:56.380]  Urging the president to apologize or back down for his claim that he was under surveillance
[3:27:56.380 --> 3:27:59.380]  The president has now been proven right
[3:27:59.380 --> 3:28:07.380]  They have been proven to be the weak need sisters that we had prophesied
[3:28:07.380 --> 3:28:12.380]  The man to watch inside the Trump White House, though, to watch very carefully
[3:28:12.380 --> 3:28:16.380]  Would be economic advisor Gary Cohen
[3:28:16.380 --> 3:28:22.380]  Mr. Cohen has been very aggressively pushing the president to support a carbon tax
[3:28:22.380 --> 3:28:31.380]  A terrible idea, but the giant and most, the largest beneficiary of this carbon tax
[3:28:31.380 --> 3:28:40.380]  Ironically would be Goldman Sachs, the previous employer for liberal Democrat Cohen
[3:28:40.380 --> 3:28:44.380]  Who is Donald Trump's chief economic advisor
[3:28:44.380 --> 3:28:50.380]  I think Donald Trump had the most dynamic, exciting economic proposal
[3:28:50.380 --> 3:28:53.380]  For any presidential candidate in this race
[3:28:53.380 --> 3:28:58.380]  It involved a cut in the corporate tax rate below that of Mexico and China
[3:28:58.380 --> 3:29:04.380]  Which would bring companies back to the US to create jobs here, to hire here, to expand here
[3:29:04.380 --> 3:29:11.380]  It included inversion, a program to bring dollars back into the country for fair taxation
[3:29:11.380 --> 3:29:15.380]  Almost two trillion that is sitting offshore or more
[3:29:15.380 --> 3:29:22.380]  And, of course, and across the board, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan's style tax cut
[3:29:22.380 --> 3:29:33.380]  Please, Mr. Cohen, would you focus on that agenda and forget the carbon tax that would be so lucrative for your previous employer
[3:29:33.380 --> 3:29:48.380]  Stay with us here at infowars.com and we will bring you even more inside scoop from Washington D.C. and beyond
[3:30:04.380 --> 3:30:08.380]  During this week's Senate hearings on Russian hacking
[3:30:08.380 --> 3:30:15.380]  The establishment Democrats and rogue intelligence heads attempted to frame Donald Trump and infowars
[3:30:15.380 --> 3:30:20.380]  For colluding with the Russians and violating the National Defense Authorization Act
[3:30:20.380 --> 3:30:25.380]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to, I think, the sphere's question
[3:30:25.380 --> 3:30:30.380]  That there are other RT's operating in the US, can you describe them with some?
[3:30:30.380 --> 3:30:37.380]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, and then I think you have them feeding other entities
[3:30:37.380 --> 3:30:39.380]  InfoWars comes to mind
[3:30:39.380 --> 3:30:42.380]  Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[3:30:42.380 --> 3:30:49.380]  Investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory that far-right news organizations like InfoWars
[3:30:49.380 --> 3:30:55.380]  Took action to assist Russian operatives to help Trump win the election

[3:32:30.380 --> 3:32:33.380]  It's time to ride, boys, we need a thousand paul with beers
[3:32:33.380 --> 3:32:39.380]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie

[3:34:06.380 --> 3:34:24.380]  Be welcome on the island
[3:34:24.380 --> 3:34:39.380]  Hello, I'm Roger Stone, New York Times bestselling author, and I'm honored to be here today
[3:34:39.380 --> 3:34:54.380]  It is a high priority for the fascists to close down infowars.com
[3:34:54.380 --> 3:34:59.380]  Infowars exists only when you help, and it's win-win
[3:34:59.380 --> 3:35:14.380]  Now, there's a lot of great products on the website. I like the ones that give you political expression. For example, when I was in Orlando the other night, terrific a book event put on by Jacob Engels and his friend L.A.
[3:35:14.380 --> 3:35:23.380]  Blowout crowd, massive crowd, 18 people in the crowd wearing their Trump Pence 2020 t-shirts
[3:35:23.380 --> 3:35:29.380]  These are hot folks. This t-shirt will also end up in the Smithsonian
[3:35:29.380 --> 3:35:41.380]  So when you go to the infowars.com store and you buy this t-shirt, or the Trump is my president t-shirt, or the Hillary for prison 2017 t-shirt, you're helping the cause
[3:35:41.380 --> 3:35:43.380]  You're helping the fight for freedom
[3:35:43.380 --> 3:35:58.380]  Now, we're going to take some calls because, let me say this now, the number is 1-800-259-9231. That's 1-800-259-9231
[3:35:58.380 --> 3:36:17.380]  Last night, I had the privilege of speaking in Boca to the American First Committee. Terrific turnout there. I met Stanley Tate, one of Donald Trump's earliest partners, and a major mover and shaker in the National Republican Party
[3:36:17.380 --> 3:36:35.380]  But many people in the crowd said to me, why don't you take more calls when you're on info wars? So you asked, we respond. Let's start with Keith in Arizona. Keith, what's on your mind?
[3:36:35.380 --> 3:36:36.380]  Yeah, Roger.
[3:36:36.380 --> 3:36:42.380]  Keith, there you go. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Keith, you're with us.
[3:36:42.380 --> 3:36:56.380]  Yeah. Why can't Trump declare martial law, round up all these traitors from Congress and the judicial, put them in prison, and then when that's done, declare martial law over?
[3:36:56.380 --> 3:37:03.380]  Well, he can't do that because we do have a constitutional form of government and we revere the constitution.
[3:37:03.380 --> 3:37:26.380]  But he could urge the Justice Department to arrest and indict George Soros because he has paid people to advocate violence in the assassination of the president, a serious federal crime that could earn Mr. Soros already in his 80s, a good 15 or 20 years in the slam.
[3:37:26.380 --> 3:37:44.380]  He could have the IRS commissioner and the Department of Justice review David Brock's failure to pay taxes and his shuffling money between nonprofits and hard money political committees and other activities that others have gone to prison for.
[3:37:44.380 --> 3:37:59.380]  He could order his government to release all of the documents pertaining to Russian collusion. And then we'll see exactly what the government does not have.
[3:37:59.380 --> 3:38:12.380]  So he has awesome powers. Don't sell him short. He will ultimately use them. Jason in Florida, my home state of Florida. Jason, what's on your mind?
[3:38:12.380 --> 3:38:15.380]  Yes, sir, Mr. Stone. God bless you, brother.
[3:38:15.380 --> 3:38:18.380]  Thank you, sir.
[3:38:18.380 --> 3:38:32.380]  Well, I have a question. I'm just wondering why basically why they are attacking you when you have your article that you put out there that is public.
[3:38:32.380 --> 3:38:46.380]  And why is Komi still basically the FBI director? Why hasn't Trump talked about Komi and his corruption with Hillary Clinton and Lenny Hergo?
[3:38:46.380 --> 3:38:52.380]  Not to mention the hundreds of millions he's made helping HSSBC break the law.
[3:38:52.380 --> 3:39:11.380]  Look, Mr. Komi was the federal prosecutor in charge of the Sandy Burger case. You remember that burger snuck into the National Archives, stuffed classified documents down his pants that showed that Bill Clinton could have taken out bin Laden and did not do so.
[3:39:11.380 --> 3:39:23.380]  And he, of course, was not prosecuted. Mark Rich, a fugitive from justice, funneled millions of dollars through his wife to the Clinton Foundation. In return, he got a pardon, a federal crime.
[3:39:23.380 --> 3:39:29.380]  Neither Bill Clinton nor Mr. Rich was prosecuted by Mr. Komi.
[3:39:29.380 --> 3:39:38.380]  Mr. Komi acknowledged that Hillary Clinton had broken the law repeatedly in her unsecured server, no prosecution from Mr. Komi.
[3:39:38.380 --> 3:39:49.380]  Mr. Komi announced the week before the election that there were 650,000 new emails and that he was reopening the investigation into Hillary's emails.
[3:39:49.380 --> 3:40:02.380]  Although it took him two years to go through 33,000 emails, he managed to read through all 650,000 in a weekend and he shared us there was nothing there. That is a lie.
[3:40:02.380 --> 3:40:13.380]  So Mr. Komi has no public credibility. They used him to blacken my name because you see when he says, they asked a question about Roger Stone, is he under investigation?
[3:40:13.380 --> 3:40:28.380]  He says, well, I couldn't comment on that. You see, this is a kabuki dance. It's like a circus. That's meant to hang in the air, you know, pregnantly implying yes.
[3:40:28.380 --> 3:40:48.380]  Let me say this. I fear nothing from an FBI investigation. The idea that crucifer 2.0 and my brief public exchange with him constitutes collusion is a steaming pile of dung as an argument.
[3:40:48.380 --> 3:41:01.380]  The idea that I do about Podesta's email hacking in advance is proved nowhere. Conjecture, speculation, we operate in this country on proof.
[3:41:01.380 --> 3:41:13.380]  And lastly, I've been quite forthright about the fact that I heard through an intermediary, back channel, intermediary, mutual friend, same thing.
[3:41:13.380 --> 3:41:25.380]  He told me two things and two things only. Julian Assange, who does not work for the Russians, who is an opponent of the deep state and who, yes, I think is a hero.
[3:41:25.380 --> 3:41:30.380]  Representative Schiff, he doesn't work for the Russians if you're listening.
[3:41:30.380 --> 3:41:50.380]  The idea that I knew anything other than the fact that he had a treasure trove on Hillary Clinton, and that it included everything, which I took to mean many of the emails that had been erased in Hillary's unsecure illegal server.
[3:41:50.380 --> 3:42:05.380]  I said both those things publicly. Does that mean I knew the topics, the timing, the strategy behind their release? No. And anyone who says that is making a false and unsupportable charge.
[3:42:05.380 --> 3:42:19.380]  So trust me, if I have my opportunity to confront my accusers, we'll find out whether they can handle the truth. Thanks for your call.
[3:42:19.380 --> 3:42:29.380]  Pardon me. Let's go to Kevin in the bluegrass state of Kentucky. Kevin, you're on Info Wars.
[3:42:29.380 --> 3:42:41.380]  Yeah, I know that Trump is not a big fan of UNDs, but I want to know if Trump's going to look into the 1958 Atlantic Treaty or Antarctica Treaty.
[3:42:41.380 --> 3:43:01.380]  It's a question I cannot address. I think the president has got a very aggressive agenda. I am one of those who thinks he should deal with the economy first, that he should drive, as I said earlier, over the objections of his chief economic advisor, Mr. Cohen,
[3:43:01.380 --> 3:43:08.380]  to get a pro-growth dynamic tax reform package passed to get this economy moving.
[3:43:08.380 --> 3:43:26.380]  As John F. Kennedy said, a rising tide lifts all boats. So I think the economy, immigration, and trade probably first on his agenda. But thanks for your call. Let's go to Cora in California.
[3:43:26.380 --> 3:43:37.380]  Hi, Mr. Stone. I have a question regarding you being poisoned and how you knew and how you're feeling now.
[3:43:37.380 --> 3:43:56.380]  I am feeling pretty good. I sustained some minor injuries in a hit-and-run car crash when I was driving to Orlando. As many of you know, the car I was riding in, the passenger seat, was t-boned at a high speed.
[3:43:56.380 --> 3:44:11.380]  Thankfully, the driver was trained in evasive maneuvers. What could have been much worse, still bent the frame and may have totaled the car. We're waiting to hear from the insurance company.
[3:44:11.380 --> 3:44:33.380]  The airbags deployed. I had a scratch on my nose. No real injuries. But the fact that my right eye, for which I had surgery about a year ago to reattach a retina, a mishap, came from an ill-advised boxing match, is now giving me trouble.
[3:44:33.380 --> 3:44:46.380]  I hope to see a specialist early next week. I am hopeful I do not have to have another reattachment surgery. The recovery process is quite difficult.
[3:44:46.380 --> 3:44:55.380]  Cora, thank you for your call. Let's go to Rich in the Empire State. Rich, lay it on us.
[3:44:55.380 --> 3:45:12.380]  Excellent. Just have one question. Do you think there's any kind of antitrust laws being violated by Google, the fact that they have such a hold over the Internet with search?
[3:45:12.380 --> 3:45:34.380]  I have been consulting with a very well-known attorney here in Florida who makes that very case. It's a very compelling case. Now that President Trump has control of the massive federal bureaucracy, he should see if he can use it for the purposes of broadening free speech,
[3:45:34.380 --> 3:45:45.380]  of broadening choices, of broadening options. That is a legitimate function of government. So I would hope that legal minds better than mine would examine your idea.
[3:45:45.380 --> 3:45:54.380]  Rich, thanks very much for calling. Let's see. Shane, in Ohio, Shane, you're on Infowars.
[3:45:54.380 --> 3:45:58.380]  Roger, it's great to talk to you. You're a great man.
[3:45:58.380 --> 3:46:00.380]  Thank you, sir.
[3:46:00.380 --> 3:46:17.380]  You talked to Trump, still, and you need to advise him that he needs to think about giving a daily, nightly address to the nation every night until this Russian ignorance is over with.
[3:46:17.380 --> 3:46:19.380]  It needs to happen, Roger.
[3:46:19.380 --> 3:46:33.380]  Well, that's a very interesting proposal. As you know, Franklin Roosevelt used the fireside chat, a radio invention of his. You could almost picture him sitting in front of a fire to communicate very directly.
[3:46:33.380 --> 3:46:46.380]  Downfront, of course, uses his Twitter feed with precise efficiency. It allows him to reach 16 million people without going through the filter of the mainstream media.
[3:46:46.380 --> 3:47:01.380]  This is why they hate him. This is why the drum beat that he must stop tweeting because it isn't presidential. Mr. President, if you're listening, double up on the tweets. Shane, thanks for calling.
[3:47:01.380 --> 3:47:05.380]  Jeff in California.
[3:47:05.380 --> 3:47:16.380]  Roger, it's good that I'm glad to hear that you're okay, sir. My question is, and I know that I speak on behalf of thousands upon thousands of people that are waiting for these trials to happen.
[3:47:16.380 --> 3:47:22.380]  You know, these people, you know, the corruption runs so deep, and they just keep piling on the line.
[3:47:22.380 --> 3:47:35.380]  And following Hitler's advice, you know, that the lie make it big, say it over and over again. There's so many people involved. How long do you anticipate the trials to last once they get started?
[3:47:35.380 --> 3:47:44.380]  And, you know, I'm waiting every day. I know a lot of people are waiting for these people to be arrested and died it. I know that you're ready.
[3:47:44.380 --> 3:47:54.380]  That being said, I hope someday there's a statue erected of you. I was part of stop is still dot org and I'm sorry, sir, your courage and
[3:47:54.380 --> 3:47:59.380]  Also, do you think these these trials will happen in how long?
[3:47:59.380 --> 3:48:11.380]  Well, you know, we are a nation of laws, not men. Sometimes when you look at the way the Clintons have been treated, you have to question that but we have due process in this country from a strictly political point of view.
[3:48:11.380 --> 3:48:29.380]  However, I think that those who are attempting to topple the president and doing through it is doing so through illegal and unconstitutional means are only going to motivate him to use his awesome powers to clean up this rigged system
[3:48:29.380 --> 3:48:45.380]  and put the deep state criminals in their military industrial financiers behind bars. I put my faith in Donald Trump. He's just getting his feet wet in the job.
[3:48:45.380 --> 3:49:00.380]  But the personal attacks on him on his family, the lies, the creation of the whole Russian fraud, you noticed as soon as Trump laid out that he'd been under surveillance at Trump Tower.
[3:49:00.380 --> 3:49:11.380]  Suddenly the talking heads in the deep state start saying, Oh, there really is no evidence of Russian influence. They started this. Now they just like it to all go away.
[3:49:11.380 --> 3:49:18.380]  They're not going to. Jeff, thanks for your call. Eddie in New York. Let's go, Eddie.
[3:49:18.380 --> 3:49:20.380]  Hi, Mr. Felon. Good to hear you.
[3:49:20.380 --> 3:49:22.380]  Thank you.
[3:49:22.380 --> 3:49:37.380]  Thank you. This Russian accusation has gone into a whole other world to a fantasy world that, you know, the mainstream media and world elements of government and multinational corporations are trying to
[3:49:37.380 --> 3:49:55.380]  collude us into thinking that we are Russian. It is ridiculous. And no, no greater example is attacking you by using, you know, I'm not just trying to run you over, not letting you speak in front of a hearing.
[3:49:55.380 --> 3:49:57.380]  This is an outrage.
[3:49:57.380 --> 3:50:09.380]  Yeah, no, it is. Look, it is very difficult to explain the feeling you get. Let me put it this way. When I was a young man working for Senator Bob Dole in Washington.
[3:50:09.380 --> 3:50:22.380]  My wife and I lived in a small house in Arlington, Virginia, which was a kind of a quaint wooden house that had been there. We thought since the turn of the century.
[3:50:22.380 --> 3:50:30.380]  And our landlord was a Native American named Jeff Bushey had. He was a fine guy. He charged a fair price for a nice place.
[3:50:30.380 --> 3:50:43.380]  One day while I was at work, someone broke in a window and ransacked the entire house. The feeling of violation that you get cannot be described.
[3:50:43.380 --> 3:50:55.380]  And so it is when you realize that people have been looking at your emails to your wife, to your children, to your grandchildren, to your friends. That is the big brother that the Obamas have brought.
[3:50:55.380 --> 3:50:59.380]  Thanks for your calls and thanks for joining us at Infowars and Eddie, thank you.

[3:54:02.380 --> 3:54:22.380]  Hello, I'm Roger Stone, back with you at Info Wars and filling in with Super Patriot Alex Jones.
[3:54:22.380 --> 3:54:32.380]  As you know, it's now become a target of the deep state. I, myself, this past week, got at least four inquiries from mainstream media reporters,
[3:54:32.380 --> 3:54:41.380]  seeking to document the millions that Vladimir Putin has paid on bots pushing the Info Wars stories.
[3:54:41.380 --> 3:54:53.380]  This is, of course, a total fraud. It's a lie, but it's meant to destabilize. You know, I've always had an interest in men's style.
[3:54:53.380 --> 3:55:06.380]  If you're not familiar with it, I have an entire website. I edit StoneOnStyle.com, in which I talk about classic elements of men's style of clothing.
[3:55:06.380 --> 3:55:19.380]  Look good, feel good. But last week, when I appeared on this very show, wearing a leather jacket, a black beret, a black t-shirt,
[3:55:19.380 --> 3:55:29.380]  and some shades, well, some woman named Cardly Ledbetter seemed to think that this was a little over the top.
[3:55:29.380 --> 3:55:37.380]  Now, she described me, according to the Huffington Post, as looking like a cat burglar.
[3:55:37.380 --> 3:55:44.380]  I guess she's thinking Carrie Grant and to catch a thief, but that's the wrong homage.
[3:55:44.380 --> 3:55:55.380]  This is straight out of Oakland, down and dirty, black panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seal homage.
[3:55:55.380 --> 3:56:07.380]  It's a homage. You see, classic styles never go out of, classic styles never go out of date, and that leather jacket look still works.
[3:56:07.380 --> 3:56:13.380]  You see, they were radicals. I am a radical.
[3:56:13.380 --> 3:56:25.380]  But what I found now is, people not only want to criticize my clothing, they want to criticize my hair, what I have left of it,
[3:56:25.380 --> 3:56:30.380]  they want to criticize my dog, they didn't like the name that I picked.
[3:56:30.380 --> 3:56:41.380]  They try to poison me, they try to hit me on the highway, because I will stand up against the two-party duopoly.
[3:56:41.380 --> 3:56:50.380]  You see, for many years, I was part of the system. I helped the Bushes attain power so they could steal millions.
[3:56:50.380 --> 3:56:58.380]  I helped George H.W. Bush become president. I helped his son become president.
[3:56:58.380 --> 3:57:05.380]  I'm sure that I will get my just punishment in hell for those transgressions.
[3:57:05.380 --> 3:57:19.380]  But now I can tell you, despite my long-time sentimental attachment to the old Republican Party, the two-party elite leadership have run this country into the ditch.
[3:57:19.380 --> 3:57:24.380]  Donald Trump's election was the hostile takeover of one of our two major parties.
[3:57:24.380 --> 3:57:30.380]  But that doesn't mean the core of establishment Republicans are still opposing his mission.
[3:57:30.380 --> 3:57:42.380]  Yet your copy of the making of the president 2016, if you want to understand this epic struggle between the two-party duopoly and their hand-picked candidates,
