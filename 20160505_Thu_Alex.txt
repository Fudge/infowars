[00:00.000 --> 00:07.240]  It's really important for us to remember our history, you know, unless you're one of the
[00:07.240 --> 00:12.160]  first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else.
[00:12.160 --> 00:13.160]  Somebody brought you.
[00:13.160 --> 00:20.720]  We trade that regulation, value of that regulation, and the value of its people, the value of
[00:20.720 --> 00:31.680]  its air, the value of its carbon emissions are traded on Wall Street and done in Bradst
[00:31.680 --> 00:35.200]  Street, done in Bradst Street, it's listed.
[00:35.200 --> 00:43.240]  So we haven't even hit on all these swindles that Wall Street is visiting upon the people
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.240]  of America.
[00:44.240 --> 00:53.920]  You're nothing but a bunch of coupons for the United States government and the people
[00:53.920 --> 00:55.920]  who run it.
[00:55.920 --> 00:57.760]  That's it.
[00:57.760 --> 01:04.560]  American people, you're a commodity and you don't deserve anything else.
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.160]  And they're going to make sure you continue to be a commodity as long as the empire exists,
[01:09.160 --> 01:14.680]  as long as you allow the Constitution to be raped.
[01:14.680 --> 01:20.160]  As the flood of illegals surges over the southern border, President Obama is going for
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.680]  broke, literally.
[01:21.680 --> 01:27.880]  CNS News reports that since the budget deal was signed in November of 2015, in just six
[01:27.880 --> 01:34.160]  months, Obama has added another trillion to our national debt, bringing it to a monstrous
[01:34.160 --> 01:35.680]  19 trillion.
[01:35.680 --> 01:40.880]  While more taxpayer money is thrown at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deportation
[01:40.880 --> 01:46.760]  Budget, deportations themselves have decreased by nearly 43 percent.
[01:46.760 --> 01:51.840]  Breitbart reports, according to a recent chart from the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration
[01:51.840 --> 01:57.480]  and National Interest, ICE removed nearly 43 percent fewer total aliens from the United
[01:57.480 --> 02:03.080]  States in the fiscal year of 2015 than it did in the fiscal year of 2012, and nearly
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.240]  62 percent.
[02:05.240 --> 02:10.840]  More aliens from the interior of the United States, ironically, as the number of deportations
[02:10.840 --> 02:16.960]  the Obama administration carried out tumbled, its budget for removals and detention continued
[02:16.960 --> 02:31.480]  to grow from 2,750,843,000 in fiscal year 2012 to 3,431,444,000 in fiscal year 2015.
[02:31.480 --> 02:39.080]  But the most alarming statistic from Breitbart's report is that ICE removed 235,390 criminal
[02:39.080 --> 02:46.920]  aliens from the United States in fiscal year 2012, as compared with 139,368 in fiscal year
[02:46.920 --> 02:55.520]  2015, meaning that it deported nearly 41 percent fewer criminal aliens last year, with 25 percent
[02:55.520 --> 02:59.600]  more resources than it had in fiscal year 2012.
[02:59.600 --> 03:05.000]  As illegal immigrant crimes in the U.S. go largely unreported, even mentioning the unwarranted
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.920]  murders of American citizens by illegal immigrants is deemed racist by New World Order brainwashed
[03:10.920 --> 03:11.920]  dupes.
[03:11.920 --> 03:16.960]  And if you think the perpetual raping going on by ungrateful Islamic hordes is only occurring
[03:16.960 --> 03:18.920]  in Europe, think again.
[03:18.920 --> 03:23.840]  New documents say the man accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a gas station worker
[03:23.840 --> 03:26.920]  uttered Allah Akbar during the assault.
[03:26.920 --> 03:31.680]  More illegal aliens from Guatemala are charged in the rape of a Massachusetts woman and the
[03:31.680 --> 03:33.680]  vicious beating of her boyfriend.
[03:33.680 --> 03:37.880]  And one of the suspects was arrested less than a month before the attack.
[03:37.880 --> 03:41.520]  The quartet has been saddled with a slew of charges.
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.560]  It's been two years since Fusion reported that a staggering 80 percent of Central American
[03:47.560 --> 03:53.200]  girls and women crossing Mexico on route to the United States are raped along the way.
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.960]  Meanwhile, Panama announced they are transferring 3,000 U.S.-bound Cuban migrants to Mexico
[03:58.960 --> 04:01.200]  as Cuban migration spikes.
[04:01.200 --> 04:07.200]  And in 2016, immigrant families crossing the border is 40 percent higher than the previous
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.880]  record in 2014, when the history books are written, the flood of a great unknown and
[04:12.880 --> 04:19.000]  unchecked exodus of chaos in the face of all reason, civility, and legality, revolving
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.600]  around the enforcement of immigration laws that have dictated the policy for immigration
[04:23.600 --> 04:29.400]  for centuries, will go down as one of the most reckless acts instigated by a U.S. president
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.400]  in modern history.
[04:30.400 --> 04:36.160]  But every time you try to get away from the government, they'll kill you.
[04:36.160 --> 04:52.200]  I'll put you in prison, or I'll let you become an American if you catch my drift, because
[04:52.200 --> 04:59.480]  you're the new Indian, you're the new American Indian, congratulations, welcome to the club.
[04:59.480 --> 05:01.480]  John Bound for InfoWars.com.
[05:01.480 --> 05:06.120]  Joe Vicks here with InfoWars.com, today I want to talk to you about guns.
[05:06.120 --> 05:11.320]  Why we have them, why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them, and why my right to
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.880]  have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[05:15.880 --> 05:20.560]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered
[05:20.560 --> 05:23.160]  more essential than the First Amendment.
[05:23.160 --> 05:29.120]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated,
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.440]  dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Red Copes.
[05:33.440 --> 05:39.320]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.720]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional
[05:43.720 --> 05:46.480]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[05:46.480 --> 05:49.120]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.280]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth, it protects not just the rights of actors
[05:54.280 --> 05:58.680]  or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[05:58.680 --> 06:10.880]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[06:10.880 --> 06:35.640]  Thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've
[06:35.640 --> 06:53.140]  not done it.
[06:53.140 --> 06:59.260]  Visit infowarsalife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[06:59.260 --> 07:01.260]  from InfoWars Life.

[07:49.740 --> 07:50.740]  the globalist.
[07:50.740 --> 07:52.380]  Bottom line, it's time to get prepared.
[07:52.380 --> 07:57.980]  So for a limited time, 40 to 30% off all the infowars select storable food at infowarsstore.com
[07:57.980 --> 08:26.500]  or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[08:26.500 --> 08:41.180]  It had not been announced until about an hour ago, on this Thursday, May 5th, 2016, officially
[08:41.180 --> 08:46.740]  at the Donald Trump website, Donald J. Trump for President, we're going to link to this
[08:46.740 --> 08:52.980]  in our story that is red linked or should be up on infowars.com.
[08:52.980 --> 09:05.140]  I pledge to you that we're going to keep Donald Trump honest or die trying metaphorically.
[09:05.140 --> 09:08.500]  But things are complex, Trump needs watchdogs in what he's doing.
[09:08.500 --> 09:11.900]  When he came out and said, hey, you know, they're murdering Christians, we got to bring
[09:11.900 --> 09:18.460]  them here from Syria, our own government tried to overthrow Syria, Obama was horrible to
[09:18.460 --> 09:21.620]  do it but now they're murdering hundreds of thousands of Christians, we got to bring
[09:21.620 --> 09:23.380]  them here.
[09:23.380 --> 09:27.860]  And then when he found out it was jihadis they were bringing in unvetted, he went, whoa,
[09:27.860 --> 09:32.540]  until we vet these people, stop them all.
[09:32.540 --> 09:38.620]  So he went from a radical Muslim coddler to someone that hates all Muslims in the media
[09:38.620 --> 09:40.300]  spin machine.
[09:40.300 --> 09:44.660]  But when Trump got criticized on that and appraised the info, he said, whoa, I didn't
[09:44.660 --> 09:48.940]  know we were bringing unvetted people, shut it down until they're checking it.
[09:48.940 --> 09:50.740]  That's common sense.
[09:50.740 --> 09:55.300]  It's like there's a gas leak in your house and until you find it, you go out to the
[09:55.300 --> 09:58.540]  side of the house, you turn it off.
[09:58.540 --> 10:02.060]  Or if there's a broken pipe in your house, you go out to the front of the house to the
[10:02.060 --> 10:10.100]  water main, you open up the little manhole and you turn it off.
[10:10.100 --> 10:12.740]  Japan doesn't let any Muslims emigrate their period.
[10:12.740 --> 10:17.620]  They have the lowest crime rate, by the way, in much of the world.
[10:17.620 --> 10:20.740]  It's because their government has deemed that it's incompatible with their culture.
[10:20.740 --> 10:26.820]  I don't think all Muslims are bad or out to get everybody, but at the same time, when
[10:26.820 --> 10:30.420]  they're jihadis and they're saying they're going to come here and make us go under their
[10:30.420 --> 10:34.980]  rule and their law and want to conquer us, and that that's the whole attitude, absolutely
[10:34.980 --> 10:35.980]  not.
[10:35.980 --> 10:38.620]  But see, that's how the spin machine works.
[10:38.620 --> 10:43.540]  I'm digressing, though, on a rabbit trail of my example of many times when Trump finds
[10:43.540 --> 10:47.460]  out he's wrong about something, he will then come out and say, I was wrong and explain
[10:47.460 --> 10:49.780]  why he did it.
[10:49.780 --> 10:54.060]  Hillary, along with Obama, for about 10 years, has been saying they want to shut down all
[10:54.060 --> 10:59.260]  coal power plants, and then, of course, that means shut down coal mines, both surface Lignite
[10:59.260 --> 11:06.580]  and also deep mines, like they have in Kentucky and West Virginia.
[11:06.580 --> 11:11.380]  She came out, of course, last year and again this year, just a month ago, and said, on
[11:11.380 --> 11:16.540]  the campaign trail, we're going to bankrupt coal, we're going to shut down the coal miners.
[11:16.540 --> 11:18.540]  Obama has said we're going to bankrupt coal.
[11:18.540 --> 11:21.620]  You can build a coal power plant, but we will bankrupt you.
[11:21.620 --> 11:26.820]  She now says she means that that meant to save everyone, so see, that's a total twisted
[11:26.820 --> 11:31.180]  lie, flip-flop.
[11:31.180 --> 11:34.820]  When Trump is wrong about something, he goes, I was wrong when I got more info, I changed
[11:34.820 --> 11:35.820]  my mind.
[11:35.820 --> 11:39.540]  That's the opposite, that's doing the right thing, that's not a flip-flop.
[11:39.540 --> 11:44.500]  So, I have talked about the way these campaign works and that most people in the power structure
[11:44.500 --> 11:46.380]  are establishment.
[11:46.380 --> 11:50.620]  Most people in the power structure are attached to Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and or the
[11:50.620 --> 11:54.980]  Council on Foreign Relations, or both.
[11:54.980 --> 11:59.900]  And so, Trump's going to have problems being able to run a campaign against Hillary without
[11:59.900 --> 12:01.980]  getting some insiders.
[12:01.980 --> 12:06.580]  That's why I wasn't against him meeting with Richard Haas, the head of the CFR, a month
[12:06.580 --> 12:11.620]  ago, but I said, watch if Trump changes his foreign policy statements and watch if Haas
[12:11.620 --> 12:12.620]  says he likes him.
[12:12.620 --> 12:17.180]  Haas came out a week later and said Trump is horrible, he's the worst possible choice
[12:17.180 --> 12:23.700]  ever, and you notice Trump's gotten more nationalistic in his speeches.
[12:23.700 --> 12:27.060]  That said, our story isn't exclusive, it's up on infowars.com.
[12:27.060 --> 12:32.980]  I've talked to multiple people in and around the Trump campaign at the highest levels.
[12:32.980 --> 12:37.460]  I've talked to Roger Stone, who is even the latest trip to New York today to research
[12:37.460 --> 12:42.740]  this, but he is researching right now, and we'll be popping into there tomorrow to give
[12:42.740 --> 12:49.220]  his take on it, but I have other sources as well that first alerted me to this last night
[12:49.220 --> 12:50.820]  and then this morning.
[12:50.820 --> 12:57.780]  And then Paul Watson had finished his report.
[12:57.780 --> 13:02.180]  Will you guys bring me the Trump press release again?
[13:02.180 --> 13:05.700]  I know you brought it to me, but I've moved it around on my stack and I can't find it.
[13:05.700 --> 13:06.700]  Thank you.
[13:06.700 --> 13:08.300]  Someone bring it to me again, thank you.
[13:08.300 --> 13:11.580]  Oh, here it is, it's on the back, it's stuck inside here.
[13:11.580 --> 13:13.500]  Teleprompter free folks, it's unscripted.
[13:13.500 --> 13:17.340]  We actually operate with our intellects and history and understanding and our will and
[13:17.340 --> 13:21.620]  our love of truth.
[13:21.620 --> 13:27.900]  And so Paul Watson and I began researching this and this was nowhere, but on one site
[13:27.900 --> 13:31.620]  that had noticed that this guy's name had been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal
[13:31.620 --> 13:38.020]  yesterday in the headlined article, Donald Trump won't sell fund general election campaign
[13:38.020 --> 13:45.260]  presumptive Republican nominee plans to create world class finance organization to back campaign.
[13:45.260 --> 13:48.500]  And then he sent out Corey Lewandowski and others.
[13:48.500 --> 13:51.940]  This is outside of Paul Manford and Roger Stone.
[13:51.940 --> 13:53.860]  I know that they're not involved in this.
[13:53.860 --> 13:57.940]  They can't speak to it yet, but they weren't aware of this.
[13:57.940 --> 14:00.860]  And we went and checked the Trump website early this morning.
[14:00.860 --> 14:02.420]  Nothing about this guy's name.
[14:02.420 --> 14:03.420]  No statements.
[14:03.420 --> 14:04.420]  Nowhere.
[14:04.420 --> 14:05.420]  Boom.
[14:05.420 --> 14:12.380]  As I went live on air, Roger Stone sent me an email saying it's official.
[14:12.380 --> 14:15.420]  He's going to find out who put it out.
[14:15.420 --> 14:16.420]  Donald J.
[14:16.420 --> 14:30.420]  Trump announces national finance chairman, Steve Munchen, M-N-C-M-U-C-H-N.
[14:30.420 --> 14:47.220]  Steve Munchen, M-N-U-C-H-I-N to serve critical role as Trump campaign gears up for general
[14:47.220 --> 14:55.420]  election to be the head finance chair to run the gathering of donations both small and
[14:55.420 --> 14:56.420]  large.
[14:56.420 --> 14:59.420]  And what Trump has always said is he's not going to take lobbyist money.
[14:59.420 --> 15:01.060]  He's not going to take big PAC money.
[15:01.060 --> 15:06.820]  And he's the only person I've ever seen in modern history who ran the last 16-month campaign
[15:06.820 --> 15:09.700]  without big corporate money and without PACs.
[15:09.700 --> 15:15.300]  Now, his lawyers have gone after PACs that have been set up by Jesse Benton and others
[15:15.300 --> 15:18.300]  claiming that they're working for Trump when they're not.
[15:18.300 --> 15:19.900]  And that's official from the Trump campaign.
[15:19.900 --> 15:22.780]  Not attacking Jesse Benton, the former head of the Ron Paul campaign.
[15:22.780 --> 15:27.140]  It's just the reality.
[15:27.140 --> 15:33.500]  But Stone is running unofficial PACs that just promote open elections and voter rights.
[15:33.500 --> 15:37.700]  And that's why I've been supportive of those moves on air as the listeners have and the
[15:37.700 --> 15:45.140]  integrity of our election system in this country under the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[15:45.140 --> 15:48.500]  But this new development is very, very troubling.
[15:48.500 --> 15:54.100]  And we have an article detailing it all from the inside sources, the best we know.
[15:54.100 --> 16:02.020]  Exclusive, Coke Soros insiders attempt to take over Trump campaign, establishment in
[16:02.020 --> 16:06.540]  last-ditch effort to co-opt New York billionaire.
[16:06.540 --> 16:11.460]  A major effort is underway to co-opt the Donald Trump campaign by infiltrating it with Coke
[16:11.460 --> 16:19.860]  brothers, George Soros-like operatives, inside sources of exclusively told in FullWars.com.
[16:19.860 --> 16:29.380]  Yesterday it was revealed that Stephen Munchen would become the Trump campaign's national
[16:29.380 --> 16:33.180]  finance chair.
[16:33.180 --> 16:40.620]  Munchen was an investment professional with Soros fund management, LLC, and spent 17
[16:40.620 --> 16:41.940]  years at Goldman Sachs.
[16:41.940 --> 16:44.420]  So he's a specter alumni.
[16:44.420 --> 16:50.780]  He also has enumerable other affiliations with establishment financial institutions
[16:50.780 --> 16:51.780]  and corporations.
[16:51.780 --> 16:57.220]  However, the appointment was engineered by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
[16:57.220 --> 16:58.220]  It appears.
[16:58.220 --> 17:06.180]  I mean, that's who reportedly is making these decisions, who himself has close ties with
[17:06.180 --> 17:12.140]  and has worked for the Coke brothers, having overseen the New Hampshire chapter of the Americans
[17:12.140 --> 17:13.140]  for prosperity.
[17:13.140 --> 17:17.060]  And they've come out and said they'd rather have Hillary than Trump.
[17:17.060 --> 17:24.540]  The advocacy group founded by Coke brothers, although Lewandowski is not directly responsible
[17:24.540 --> 17:30.780]  for the infiltration, he is being used as a dupe by Munchen and others as part of a move
[17:30.780 --> 17:35.900]  to either take control of the Trump campaign or contrive a media narrative that Trump has
[17:35.900 --> 17:38.540]  sold out to the establishment.
[17:38.540 --> 17:40.380]  And I'll be quite honest with you.
[17:40.380 --> 17:46.500]  When Trump comes out and uses big establishment financial organizers, it's pretty much all
[17:46.500 --> 17:47.500]  you can do sometime.
[17:47.500 --> 17:51.140]  But if he's making the shots and calling the shots and he thinks he can control these
[17:51.140 --> 17:52.980]  people, that's just how it works.
[17:52.980 --> 17:59.500]  I mean, it's pretty clear that American Airlines was working with the globalist to cover up
[17:59.500 --> 18:00.860]  what really happened on 9-11.
[18:00.860 --> 18:06.460]  I still get on American Airlines aircraft because the pilots, the flight crew, the people
[18:06.460 --> 18:12.340]  on the control towers are good people.
[18:12.340 --> 18:16.900]  The flight attendants are good people, the stewardesses to be politically incorrect.
[18:16.900 --> 18:21.460]  It's criminal executives at the top that are compromised.
[18:21.460 --> 18:28.580]  So this is still a dangerous direction to be going in because Trump has done so well
[18:28.580 --> 18:30.900]  not hiring any of these people.
[18:30.900 --> 18:36.180]  We've seen Hillary and Ted Cruz being escoriated by the media, the alternative media by the
[18:36.180 --> 18:41.460]  people, and really being discredited for their close alliances with the corruptor elements
[18:41.460 --> 18:46.900]  of Wall Street, the globalist elements, the crony elements, the banker bailout elements,
[18:46.900 --> 18:53.540]  the anti-gun Goldman Sachs elements, the Soros elements.
[18:53.540 --> 19:01.540]  And so I have an issue with this, and the article goes on to break it all down.
[19:01.540 --> 19:09.860]  No campaign, it goes on, or contrive a media narrative that Trump has sold out to the establishment.
[19:09.860 --> 19:16.700]  A sign that Trump is, well, it just goes on from there.
[19:16.700 --> 19:23.260]  I'm going to be breaking more of this down when we come back from break, because I think
[19:23.260 --> 19:28.460]  I'm missing a page of this article, it's kind of in the day of that.
[19:28.460 --> 19:32.340]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we have the press release right here.
[19:32.340 --> 19:34.300]  This is not really the top story of the day.
[19:34.300 --> 19:37.900]  I just wanted to go ahead and get it out of the way up front and continue to move forward
[19:37.900 --> 19:44.340]  and also give you our pledge to analyze every facet of the Trump campaign and vet what's
[19:44.340 --> 19:46.460]  real and what's not.
[19:46.460 --> 19:51.700]  Last week it was that he's basically having sex with underage girls or something with
[19:51.700 --> 19:55.980]  no evidence, and of course that turned out to be a giant hoax, and we said it was a hoax.
[19:55.980 --> 19:59.220]  They've got all these other hoaxes they're pushing against Trump, but we will dig into
[19:59.220 --> 20:01.900]  every single one of them, stay with us.
[20:01.900 --> 20:06.420]  How would you like to make 17% on your money in only 90 days?
[20:06.420 --> 20:11.580]  That's right, gold owners made 17% in only three months as gold had its best quarterly
[20:11.580 --> 20:13.420]  gain in 30 years.
[20:13.420 --> 20:18.260]  Gold is on the move, and you need to get government issued legal tender gold coins starting at
[20:18.260 --> 20:20.740]  only $139 each.
[20:20.740 --> 20:24.780]  The US money reserve, one of the largest gold distributors in the country, announces the
[20:24.780 --> 20:33.940]  first ever at-cost gold release on this station for only $139 each, 1-866-944-GOLD, or online
[20:33.940 --> 20:35.980]  at USMoneyReserve.com.
[20:35.980 --> 20:42.860]  Official US government issued legal tender solid gold coins at cost for only $139 each,
[20:42.860 --> 20:50.620]  call 1-866-944-GOLD, ask for a free 55 page gold buyers book, plus get a free walking
[20:50.620 --> 20:54.700]  liberty half dollar, just for reading this must have book all about gold.
[20:54.700 --> 21:01.900]  Remember gold is on the move, up 17%, call 1-866-944-GOLD.
[21:01.900 --> 21:06.660]  Are you concerned about the power grid, about the new war on the power grid?
[21:06.660 --> 21:12.300]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[21:12.300 --> 21:13.300]  Here's why.
[21:13.300 --> 21:17.860]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just
[21:17.860 --> 21:18.860]  been written.
[21:18.860 --> 21:24.020]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only for a limited
[21:24.020 --> 21:26.180]  time to GCN listeners.
[21:26.180 --> 21:30.980]  He simply asked that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[21:30.980 --> 21:35.940]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book
[21:35.940 --> 21:36.940]  to you.
[21:36.940 --> 21:37.940]  Why do this?
[21:37.940 --> 21:41.460]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[21:41.460 --> 21:46.180]  The answer is simple, America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are
[21:46.180 --> 21:47.180]  clueless.
[21:47.180 --> 21:51.420]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author
[21:51.420 --> 21:53.780]  gets is, do you fear for your life?

[22:01.380 --> 22:05.660]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[22:05.660 --> 22:10.380]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[22:10.380 --> 22:12.860]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:12.860 --> 22:17.540]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[22:17.540 --> 22:24.420]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[22:24.420 --> 22:30.460]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[22:30.460 --> 22:34.220]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[22:34.220 --> 22:39.780]  The gold standard in water purification, and our filters last for years at less than two
[22:39.780 --> 22:41.260]  cents per gallon.
[22:41.260 --> 22:45.820]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[23:57.780 --> 24:19.780]  All right, so the story with all the inside baseball and details is up on Infowars.com.
[24:19.780 --> 24:24.540]  Exclusive Cot Soros Insiders attempt to take over the Trump campaign.
[24:24.540 --> 24:29.020]  The establishment is in last-ditch effort to co-opt the Newark billionaire.
[24:29.020 --> 24:31.380]  We'll see how Trump responds to this.
[24:31.380 --> 24:36.420]  Quite frankly, it's hard to be involved in a major national campaign and not have some
[24:36.420 --> 24:37.620]  of these people in there.
[24:37.620 --> 24:45.260]  If he ever starts changing his policies or he ever stops his pledge to repeal Obamacare
[24:45.260 --> 24:52.940]  or to try to control our borders, I will turn on him like 50-day-old milk, I mean, instantly.
[24:52.940 --> 24:58.220]  But we are watching this closely, and we've seen some other troubling things out of Lewandowski
[24:58.220 --> 24:59.220]  before.
[24:59.220 --> 25:02.100]  And the question is, is he trying to co-opt the campaign?
[25:02.100 --> 25:03.660]  Well, regardless, it's happening.
[25:03.660 --> 25:05.700]  Is he behind it?
[25:05.700 --> 25:08.500]  Is he the one that's made a lot of the big missteps?
[25:08.500 --> 25:09.500]  Absolutely.
[25:09.500 --> 25:13.460]  And I don't have it out for Lewandowski, but I remember here in the Ron Paul campaigns,
[25:13.460 --> 25:18.300]  Jesse Benton just always came up with causing the problems.
[25:18.300 --> 25:22.140]  In two different campaigns, and I would hold my tongue, and then years later, everybody
[25:22.140 --> 25:27.540]  turned against him, and all the stuff came out, and then it's him again running this
[25:27.540 --> 25:32.220]  big supposed Trump pack that isn't a Trump pack.
[25:32.220 --> 25:34.860]  And they won't stop doing it when Trump asks him to stop doing it.
[25:34.860 --> 25:40.420]  So really what I'm getting at is, there's all these forces that try to get into a campaign
[25:40.420 --> 25:41.420]  at this high level.
[25:41.420 --> 25:46.180]  I mean, you've got a successful restaurant, people are going to try to get a job there
[25:46.180 --> 25:48.060]  and do weird stuff inside of it.
[25:48.060 --> 25:50.660]  Or if you have a business, I mean, everybody's experienced this.
[25:50.660 --> 25:55.980]  If you're in the media and you're very successful, there's always people trying to weasel in.
[25:55.980 --> 26:01.100]  So when I'm covering this, it's not to go, hey, let's make hay out of a Goldman Sachs
[26:01.100 --> 26:06.060]  Soros connected people, Koch brother connected, got the trafecta going on here.
[26:06.060 --> 26:08.100]  Let's just point it out and let's watch it.
[26:08.100 --> 26:10.380]  Let's ask the larger question.
[26:10.380 --> 26:17.300]  Trump said he wasn't going to take big corporate money, and he wasn't going to take big lobbyist
[26:17.300 --> 26:19.740]  money.
[26:19.740 --> 26:22.500]  Now the media is going to be able to spend this that he's going into the general election
[26:22.500 --> 26:27.180]  trying to raise money now and not sell financing as if he's going back on a promise.
[26:27.180 --> 26:34.140]  Now he said he would try to mainly sell finance selling baseball hats and shirts and using
[26:34.140 --> 26:35.140]  his own money.
[26:35.140 --> 26:38.540]  But Hillary's got a billion dollars left to spend.
[26:38.540 --> 26:44.780]  So obviously he's going to have to get some organizations and groups to donate.
[26:44.780 --> 26:46.860]  And I don't see that as going back on a promise.
[26:46.860 --> 26:51.460]  But if he starts taking globalist money, then we're going to have a big problem.
[26:51.460 --> 26:54.260]  And so this is all part of keeping people honest.
[26:54.260 --> 26:55.260]  That's what we're doing.
[26:55.260 --> 26:58.980]  Now I do not want to get into this anymore, because this is not near our top story today.
[26:58.980 --> 27:06.140]  It is an exclusive to infowars.com, but our integrity will continue on no matter what.
[27:06.140 --> 27:08.220]  It's just like Ted Cruz.
[27:08.220 --> 27:10.380]  He had a good voting record in the Senate.
[27:10.380 --> 27:15.940]  He had a really bad pedigree, really bad connections to nasty globalist, and he uncloaked
[27:15.940 --> 27:19.740]  about six months ago and really showed us who he was.
[27:19.740 --> 27:25.460]  And now I'm very, very sad that I was ever supportive of Ted Cruz.
[27:25.460 --> 27:31.580]  I frankly, a year ago I was supporting him overall over Donald Trump, but I liked the
[27:31.580 --> 27:34.860]  nationalist bent of Donald Trump.
[27:34.860 --> 27:38.940]  And now we have New Yorker magazine saying Ted Cruz is Goldman Sachs problem.
[27:38.940 --> 27:44.900]  And so Trump has got his people bringing in Goldman Sachs people and Soros connected people
[27:44.900 --> 27:47.140]  to run his finance system.
[27:47.140 --> 27:52.860]  My biggest issue, I guess, is the optics of that.
[27:52.860 --> 27:57.900]  If Trump's going to criticize Cruz for that, and Hillary, then what's he thinking?
[27:57.900 --> 28:03.060]  And the word is, Trump does not know and did not know.
[28:03.060 --> 28:08.580]  And there were scrabbling phone calls last night and this morning over this, and it came
[28:08.580 --> 28:13.340]  down to Lewandowski, but then no one wants to actually burn him.
[28:13.340 --> 28:16.660]  So there's an investigation, and while the investigation's going on this morning, an
[28:16.660 --> 28:20.300]  hour ago, this press release shoots out.
[28:20.300 --> 28:24.340]  And if he's just tuned in and you're saying, okay, then what is it, Alex, is it a big deal
[28:24.340 --> 28:25.340]  or isn't it?
[28:25.340 --> 28:26.340]  I wore game openly.
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.860]  I wear my brain on my sleeve.
[28:28.860 --> 28:30.780]  Quite frankly, I don't know what's going on.
[28:30.780 --> 28:31.780]  It smells.
[28:31.780 --> 28:32.780]  I don't like it.
[28:32.780 --> 28:33.780]  I have a nauseous feeling.
[28:33.780 --> 28:34.780]  Okay?
[28:34.780 --> 28:39.940]  And not that Trump's betraying anybody, it's just that these people are everywhere.
[28:39.940 --> 28:42.460]  They run the system.
[28:42.460 --> 28:46.060]  And you've got so many of these campaign managers who'll make deals with the system, like Jesse
[28:46.060 --> 28:53.740]  Benton and the Senate Majority Leader from Kentucky having deals, when he supposedly
[28:53.740 --> 28:58.980]  has been working for Senator Paul, and now see where Senator Paul is being betrayed by
[28:58.980 --> 29:01.940]  the Republican Party.
[29:01.940 --> 29:08.020]  So these campaign managers, nine times out of 10, are double-minded in my view.
[29:08.020 --> 29:09.540]  And I'm going to just stop right there.
[29:09.540 --> 29:16.340]  But we need to see what Trump does now with the optics of this, because he definitely
[29:16.340 --> 29:20.140]  doesn't want to start taking Goldman Sachs money.
[29:20.140 --> 29:23.660]  It's one thing if you hire somebody that's been Soros connected, Soros knows how to run
[29:23.660 --> 29:29.460]  campaigns and Goldman Sachs, that starts ringing alarm bells.
[29:29.460 --> 29:33.980]  But if you take Goldman Sachs money, I think I'm going to have a heart attack.
[29:33.980 --> 29:34.980]  All right.
[29:34.980 --> 29:36.660]  We'll open phones later.
[29:36.660 --> 29:38.060]  You can give me your view on this.
[29:38.060 --> 29:39.740]  That's a complex issue, obviously.
[29:39.740 --> 29:43.620]  But I'm going to get into Hillary, boy, you talk about lying with the coal miners and
[29:43.620 --> 29:44.620]  more.
[29:44.620 --> 29:45.620]  We're going to play these clips coming up.
[29:45.620 --> 29:49.220]  Some of the great things Trump's been saying about Obamacare and the open borders, and
[29:49.220 --> 29:50.220]  a lot more.
[29:50.220 --> 29:51.220]  He's been doubling down there.
[29:51.220 --> 29:52.220]  That's very encouraging.
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.220]  We're on the march.
[29:53.220 --> 29:54.220]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.220 --> 29:57.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.980 --> 30:04.980]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course
[30:04.980 --> 30:07.940]  as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit.
[30:07.940 --> 30:12.260]  By consolidation of power first, and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[30:12.260 --> 30:16.420]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the
[30:16.420 --> 30:19.620]  world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[30:19.620 --> 30:21.300]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[30:21.300 --> 30:25.700]  We now live in a neo-futalistic society which were treated as indentured servants who only
[30:25.700 --> 30:28.140]  exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[30:28.140 --> 30:31.420]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation
[30:31.420 --> 30:35.260]  process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[30:35.260 --> 30:39.060]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed
[30:39.060 --> 30:42.620]  by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the
[30:42.620 --> 30:43.620]  world.
[30:43.620 --> 30:46.260]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white.
[30:46.260 --> 30:49.900]  One extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once
[30:49.900 --> 30:51.460]  more of us realize this truth.
[30:51.460 --> 30:55.660]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions
[30:55.660 --> 30:58.900]  of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[30:58.900 --> 31:28.340]  This is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com.
[31:28.340 --> 31:32.540]  And now you're listening right by all the nutraceuticals, acuefx, nascent, iodine,
[31:32.540 --> 31:33.540]  iodine.
[31:33.540 --> 31:34.540]  Right.
[31:34.540 --> 31:35.540]  Let me ask you a question.
[31:35.540 --> 31:36.540]  Have they worked for you?
[31:36.540 --> 31:37.540]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[31:37.540 --> 31:38.540]  What products are you taking?
[31:38.540 --> 31:39.540]  Are you taking?
[31:39.540 --> 31:47.060]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[31:47.060 --> 31:50.700]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[31:50.700 --> 31:55.780]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[31:55.780 --> 31:56.780]  That's infowarslife.com.
[31:56.780 --> 32:01.780]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[32:01.780 --> 32:05.780]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[32:05.780 --> 32:11.260]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[32:11.260 --> 32:16.220]  Number one, when you choose Autoship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[32:16.220 --> 32:17.820]  at infowarsore.com.
[32:17.820 --> 32:21.660]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[32:21.660 --> 32:25.740]  Autoship because we hold back a surplus for Autoship customers.
[32:25.740 --> 32:30.980]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[32:30.980 --> 32:35.060]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[32:35.060 --> 32:36.860]  the products that you need each month.
[32:36.860 --> 32:41.460]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on Autoship and
[32:41.460 --> 32:44.580]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[32:44.580 --> 32:49.900]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new Autoship feature at infowarslife.com,
[32:49.900 --> 32:51.300]  this is a sure win.
[32:51.300 --> 32:52.860]  10% off on Autoship.
[32:52.860 --> 32:58.660]  Win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items
[32:58.660 --> 33:26.380]  are never out of stock when you sign up for Autoship.
[33:29.340 --> 33:38.460]  I don't just half bake my political views, my geopolitical views, my cultural views.
[33:38.460 --> 33:39.460]  I really try to research.
[33:39.460 --> 33:44.380]  That's why when I spent a few hours with Paul Watson working on this exclusive story
[33:44.380 --> 33:53.540]  at infowars.com, Coke, Soros and Siders attempt to take over Trump campaign from within.
[33:53.540 --> 33:57.540]  I basically got up here on air the first 30 minutes and just war-gamed in my mind.
[33:57.540 --> 34:02.340]  I was so busy just putting the facts down on the article that afterwards I was trying
[34:02.340 --> 34:07.140]  to come to my conclusion on air as to what I thought about it.
[34:07.140 --> 34:13.820]  I think despite all of my inherent and incoherent babbling sometimes, that's why this broadcast
[34:13.820 --> 34:20.260]  is so popular because it inherently is real and is totally honest down to my guts.
[34:20.260 --> 34:23.300]  Now, going over the news, it's all just over the top.
[34:23.300 --> 34:26.100]  I somehow have to cover all of this today.
[34:26.100 --> 34:30.420]  We also have two really informative guests, James O'Keefe, with the Veritas Project has
[34:30.420 --> 34:34.220]  had some new amazing coos, projectveritas.com.
[34:34.220 --> 34:39.020]  Wayne Madsen was on yesterday for 10 minutes, he's on for a full hour today to break down
[34:39.020 --> 34:46.540]  all the big developments in campaign 2016 that he continues to be one of the main investigative
[34:46.540 --> 34:51.380]  journalists with more big breaking stories nationwide than pretty much anybody else.
[34:51.380 --> 34:57.060]  We're very proud that he works as a correspondent for InfoWars.com, so he's going to be joining
[34:57.060 --> 34:58.060]  us.
[34:58.060 --> 35:00.700]  We'll also have open phones as well.
[35:00.700 --> 35:05.980]  Edward James O'Keefe leaves us and then into the Wayne Madsen interview, Rob Doome, InfoWars
[35:05.980 --> 35:07.300]  news director.
[35:07.300 --> 35:14.620]  We'll be on showing the fourth hour today on this Thursday transmission, good old 5-5,
[35:14.620 --> 35:17.580]  May 5th, 2016.
[35:17.580 --> 35:22.020]  I want to get into the Trump situation where he says, total disaster, repeal Obamacare,
[35:22.020 --> 35:25.260]  again, again, not backing off on that, wonderful.
[35:25.260 --> 35:30.780]  Also continuing to say again and again that we should not have the disaster that Europe's
[35:30.780 --> 35:39.020]  had flooding this country with massive Muslim immigration from the most radical countries
[35:39.020 --> 35:40.020]  in the world.
[35:40.020 --> 35:43.700]  But there's a whole bunch of clips, I guess there's five of them dealing with Hillary
[35:43.700 --> 35:49.700]  and the coal miners, and coal mining is what built the British Empire in its last hundred
[35:49.700 --> 35:50.700]  years.
[35:50.700 --> 35:56.140]  It's what funded and powered the industrial revolution, it's what drove our industrial
[35:56.140 --> 36:01.580]  revolution, and it's now the cleanest burning fuel there is with technology, the cheapest
[36:01.580 --> 36:02.580]  form as well.
[36:02.580 --> 36:09.220]  And I harp on this constantly, I have no coal stocks, no energy stocks, not involved
[36:09.220 --> 36:10.220]  in it.
[36:10.220 --> 36:14.140]  And I just know my power bill has more than doubled the last eight years because they've
[36:14.140 --> 36:20.900]  shut down more than a thousand coal power plants, and it's a big deal, and it's a bigger
[36:20.900 --> 36:24.500]  deal when she comes out and says, we're going to bankrupt coal, we're going to shut down
[36:24.500 --> 36:30.420]  the coal miners, just like Obama said to audiences that support that, that get off on shutting
[36:30.420 --> 36:38.980]  the country down, the post-industrial nihilistic transhumanist eugenicist.
[36:38.980 --> 36:42.940]  They love China and all the plants they want are Mexico, they just don't want us to, it's
[36:42.940 --> 36:45.620]  a sick cult of control freaks.
[36:45.620 --> 36:49.380]  You know, the folks that want you to have a 200 square foot coffin apartment, these
[36:49.380 --> 36:50.660]  are very bad people.
[36:50.660 --> 36:56.020]  Then she comes out and says, well, what I meant by that was, it's inevitable unless
[36:56.020 --> 37:01.940]  we save them, no, you're the person running the program to destroy them.
[37:01.940 --> 37:06.380]  And you know who set all this up in the 80s with Al Gore was Inron, they were in a wheel
[37:06.380 --> 37:13.460]  company, they don't like to compete against cheap energy, do they?
[37:13.460 --> 37:20.100]  Just like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and BP, and Bruce Trollium, just search engine it,
[37:20.100 --> 37:26.340]  they're all the top funders, they're all the top 10 funders of shutting down coal power
[37:26.340 --> 37:29.220]  plants.
[37:29.220 --> 37:34.700]  And again, they always point video cameras at power plants in the winter when hot water
[37:34.700 --> 37:40.420]  vapor and CO2 are coming out and they go, look at the smoke, look at the pollution.
[37:40.420 --> 37:46.500]  That's not pollution, that's like when you breathe and you see what looks like smoke,
[37:46.500 --> 37:47.700]  that's water vapor.
[37:47.700 --> 37:51.580]  And I know that our listeners know that, but let me tell you who don't know, the general
[37:51.580 --> 37:54.740]  public actually thinks that smoke.
[37:54.740 --> 37:58.140]  Now in China and Mexico, it is smoke.
[37:58.140 --> 38:02.660]  That's why it goes on for five miles and then dissipates as it gets aerosolized, but it's
[38:02.660 --> 38:06.340]  still there, it just gets diluted.
[38:06.340 --> 38:12.060]  European and US coal power plants, the smoke is not smoke, it's water vapor and carbon
[38:12.060 --> 38:19.940]  dioxide, it ends in about 100 yards, just like any other washer or dryer on the side
[38:19.940 --> 38:21.500]  of your house in the winter.
[38:21.500 --> 38:28.220]  Notice, you only see that in the winter because it's hot, moist air blowing out, you don't
[38:28.220 --> 38:31.180]  see that in the summer.
[38:31.180 --> 38:35.420]  You look at Mexico City or you look at Calcutta or you look at Beijing or Peking, they're
[38:35.420 --> 38:44.940]  living hell holes with the smog because their governments don't want to be outcompeted so
[38:44.940 --> 38:46.340]  they have no environmental standards.
[38:46.340 --> 38:50.060]  I think we should all have standards and do something about it, but instead only we have
[38:50.060 --> 38:51.060]  the standards.
[38:51.060 --> 38:55.820]  So I'm digressing, but this is so fundamental to understand artificial scarcity, globalism
[38:55.820 --> 38:56.980]  and how they operate.
[38:56.980 --> 39:02.780]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[39:02.780 --> 39:09.900]  I also want to add that we were able to extend this through Sunday, but it will end then.
[39:09.900 --> 39:14.860]  I was able to extend it basically a week and we have the very best high-quality, swarble
[39:14.860 --> 39:19.820]  foods we're going to find out there the last 25 years produced by my Patriots supply, it's
[39:19.820 --> 39:20.820]  called InfoWars Select.
[39:20.820 --> 39:23.220]  It's the exact same food, just 30 to 40% off.
[39:23.220 --> 39:26.140]  I'm able to give you that discount only a few times a year.
[39:26.140 --> 39:27.860]  That's why I'm trying to extend it this time.
[39:27.860 --> 39:32.940]  We normally are about 10% lower than my Patriot, the exact same pool spectrum, exact same meals.
[39:32.940 --> 39:38.220]  You can buy my Patriots supply in their full catalog at infowarstore.com and support the
[39:38.220 --> 39:42.900]  broadcast and they already have a great deal, but you have the exact same food, 30 to 40%
[39:42.900 --> 39:46.580]  off, it will be ending soon and don't worry, next week it will still be about 10% less
[39:46.580 --> 39:50.500]  and we'll have some other specials as well, just nothing like this.
[39:50.500 --> 39:54.980]  And with the buildup for global riots and the buildup for global war and all the crazy
[39:54.980 --> 39:59.420]  stuff and earth changes going on, the increased earthquakes and the ring of fire and the volcanoes
[39:59.420 --> 40:01.820]  getting active all over the U.S.
[40:01.820 --> 40:04.980]  I hope I don't need my swarble food, but I'll tell you this, I've been getting more for
[40:04.980 --> 40:11.860]  the office, more for my home, medical supplies, getting my firearms in place, getting my security
[40:11.860 --> 40:18.460]  plan in place because civilization is teetering and all over the world it's been collapsing
[40:18.460 --> 40:22.900]  into road warrior-like scenarios in the Middle East and Africa and areas of Asia and areas
[40:22.900 --> 40:28.260]  of Eastern Europe, it's getting really bad, civilization is unraveling.
[40:28.260 --> 40:32.780]  And now is the time to get prepared, infowarstore.com or call toll free, we can tell you about
[40:32.780 --> 40:36.260]  all the different specials when you call or different discounts, the mega sale is going

[42:45.420 --> 42:46.420]  support.
[42:46.420 --> 42:51.980]  Again, why are they shutting down the power plants?
[42:51.980 --> 42:59.340]  To move the jobs to globalist industrial bases where the top controllers have moved production
[42:59.340 --> 43:05.180]  the last 50 years, they're accelerating what's left now with their environmental regulations
[43:05.180 --> 43:10.340]  and taxes and controls, we have the highest corporate taxes in the world in the United
[43:10.340 --> 43:17.420]  States, lobbied for by the big corporations to force even smaller corporations to move
[43:17.420 --> 43:25.100]  offshore to complete our deindustrialization, then they write in the provisos that they
[43:25.100 --> 43:33.180]  can be tax exempt offshore, that's how the screw job works, why would you want to compete
[43:33.180 --> 43:37.500]  when you could just rig the deal with the communist Chinese, with the post-imperial
[43:37.500 --> 43:43.740]  Indians and the folks in Mexico who've never really gotten out from under colonialism,
[43:43.740 --> 43:50.220]  before I get to the coal debacle, I want to cover this, I get tweets, I get asked questions,
[43:50.220 --> 43:56.220]  I get emails saying what do you think of Cinco de Mayo, and I say I think it's great, I'm
[43:56.220 --> 44:00.380]  all about overthrowing the Spanish, you're all about overthrowing the French, which is
[44:00.380 --> 44:08.780]  this particular holiday, and it's the most important holiday in Mexico, Cinco de Mayo
[44:08.780 --> 44:14.620]  is Spanish for May 5th, is a celebration held on May 5th, the date is observed to commemorate
[44:14.620 --> 44:20.380]  the Mexican army's unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla, I pronounced
[44:20.380 --> 44:29.700]  that correctly, on May 5th, 1862, now let's just stop right there, that said in the United
[44:29.700 --> 44:36.860]  States, Cinco de Mayo has become a Mechiloraza holiday for many gang member type folks who
[44:36.860 --> 44:41.820]  then try to go around with the Ford Foundation and the media and the globalist controlled
[44:41.820 --> 44:47.940]  press in bully Hispanics to say you're not American or you're not whatever your identity
[44:47.940 --> 44:51.140]  is, you're not a Venezuelan, you're not a Chilean, you're not, because those folks I've
[44:51.140 --> 44:58.340]  talked to get bullied, you're a Mexican, and it turns into this weird nationalist thing
[44:58.340 --> 45:02.620]  where they burn American flags, I videotaped it in downtown Austin at the Capitol and run
[45:02.620 --> 45:08.780]  around holding babies up going Mexico, Mexico, La Raza, La Raza, race, race, race, I find
[45:08.780 --> 45:12.300]  the Ku Klux Klan running around doing that to be very, very untasteful and I've protested
[45:12.300 --> 45:19.860]  them, but when you go out and cover the mainly Mexican nationals, it's their holiday running
[45:19.860 --> 45:25.020]  around saying Texas belongs to Mexico, no, you couldn't take it from the Comanches, so
[45:25.020 --> 45:29.380]  you brought in the Tennesseans and Alabamans who were in giant Indian wars, as they were
[45:29.380 --> 45:35.340]  called, said to have a big death battle, and yes, the people in the South were pretty much
[45:35.340 --> 45:43.580]  psychotic and enjoyed giant battles, and defending their families and the Indians loved it too.
[45:43.580 --> 45:46.260]  I'm going to use the word Indians because everybody says use the word Native American,
[45:46.260 --> 45:50.940]  I mean the point was is that it was just two groups that just love fighting and love killing
[45:50.940 --> 45:55.180]  each other, and quite frankly it's not that the Mexicans wouldn't fight, their people
[45:55.180 --> 45:58.420]  wouldn't colonize it, they didn't want to be up here, they didn't like the Indian
[45:58.420 --> 46:05.420]  rates, that's a historical fact, so the Mexican government when it was the Spanish government
[46:05.420 --> 46:09.780]  came and told Tennesseans and Alabamans and others they said we're going to give you huge
[46:09.780 --> 46:14.340]  pieces of land basically free, you got to convert to Catholicism and you can bring
[46:14.340 --> 46:19.140]  your guns in and we want you to wipe out the natives, because they hadn't been able to
[46:19.140 --> 46:28.220]  do it and the Spanish facilities, the Spanish missions that were really military operations
[46:28.220 --> 46:33.780]  and the Jesuit systems, they were unable to get the Plains Indians to convert, they got
[46:33.780 --> 46:38.060]  everybody else to do it and move into the reservation and become agrarian, it did not
[46:38.060 --> 46:42.980]  work well with the Comanches, the Apaches and some of the other groups, the Blackfoot
[46:42.980 --> 46:47.820]  and others, they just never got their missions set up, you notice in the Midwest and Texas
[46:47.820 --> 46:50.980]  except right around the border areas because they all got slaughtered, so that's the big
[46:50.980 --> 46:58.180]  dirty secret, the Spanish brought in a bunch of rewilded cavemen from Europe, that's what
[46:58.180 --> 47:01.660]  happened and you took the civilized people of Europe who were really under Imperial
[47:01.660 --> 47:04.940]  condition and slavery, they turned them loose here, then one generation they were completely
[47:04.940 --> 47:09.860]  psychotic and ran around murdering everybody, but also building things in Indian home and
[47:09.860 --> 47:14.220]  taking over and then the natives were always trying to hire them to kill the other group
[47:14.220 --> 47:18.500]  but it just didn't work out and that's what really happened, so they lost the conquest,
[47:18.500 --> 47:22.980]  anyways I'm just telling you the facts and so that's what it is and now you got a bunch
[47:22.980 --> 47:28.260]  of folks from Mexico that never got out from under colonialism, you may have gotten rid
[47:28.260 --> 47:33.540]  of the Spanish and the French and then the Austrian Hungarian Empire but the system stayed
[47:33.540 --> 47:39.220]  and so it's a day to just now claim independence over El Norte and run around burning American
[47:39.220 --> 47:43.420]  flags, holding your kids up going Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, hey if Mexico was better than
[47:43.420 --> 47:48.340]  the US and had lower taxes and was a freer country, I'll go down there and I'll Mexico,
[47:48.340 --> 47:52.860]  Mexico baby, I mean I'm thinking about going to Switzerland down the road, I don't care
[47:52.860 --> 47:57.220]  what color you are, if I can not get mugged and put mine in the bank and not get robbed
[47:57.220 --> 48:02.460]  and have lower taxes and have prosperity and people be nice, I don't care, but just you're
[48:02.460 --> 48:07.140]  up here yelling Mexico while your country's got 170,000 people dead in the last decade,
[48:07.140 --> 48:11.620]  100,000 dead, 70 something thousand missing, total battle of mass murder, most areas of
[48:11.620 --> 48:16.420]  collapse, women being 80% of the women coming across the border as part of the unspoken
[48:16.420 --> 48:23.820]  payment are raped but then they have this weird thing at the liberal schools, the colleges
[48:23.820 --> 48:30.140]  where they teach that gringos are all evil, gringos all rape women, western cultures all
[48:30.140 --> 48:37.780]  evil but radical Muslims are wonderful and the whole super arrogant macho machismo stuff
[48:37.780 --> 48:42.900]  that certainly had its place in the frontiers or in ancient Spain you know when the Muslims
[48:42.900 --> 48:48.300]  are invading whatever, that's all cute and funny, you know women being kept like property
[48:48.300 --> 48:52.740]  and the men slapping the women around and cheating on their wives and raping 80% of
[48:52.740 --> 48:58.460]  them but then you get up here to the United States trailblazing women's rights, trailblazing
[48:58.460 --> 49:04.740]  the end of slavery with England and everybody thinks we invented it, that's the brainwashing
[49:04.740 --> 49:11.100]  of the Ford Foundation and all the rest of it and it's absolutely ridiculous, so that's
[49:11.100 --> 49:17.660]  where I stand on Cinco de Mayo, I'm all about, it's shall I forth, throw the foreign globalist
[49:17.660 --> 49:25.180]  out but Texas has had eight flags over it, not six and they really had to claim by Mexico
[49:25.180 --> 49:31.340]  over the Southwest, I mean you had a few missions in California, a few in Arizona, a few in
[49:31.340 --> 49:40.140]  what's New Mexico, a few in Texas and most of them were deserted before the Spanish
[49:40.140 --> 49:46.340]  even pulled out of Mexico and then you got Santa Ana such a bloodthirsty crazy dictator
[49:46.340 --> 49:51.980]  that Mexico lost a third of its country, Guatemala and south was Mexico, I mean is that my fault
[49:51.980 --> 50:03.380]  too, did the United States steal that from Mexico, Mexico was a colony with natives being
[50:03.380 --> 50:12.100]  used as slaves, they just didn't call it slavery, but if you didn't do your work they'd burn
[50:12.100 --> 50:19.940]  you alive, I always love in the Mexican American studies they teach, Mexico was against slavery
[50:19.940 --> 50:27.580]  and against the evil of America, I mean you know it just, I just know too much history
[50:27.580 --> 50:36.220]  and you notice I said many of the people going west, the first waves of those were crazed,
[50:36.220 --> 50:41.940]  crazed fighters, people like David Crockett and folks were foaming at the mouth when they
[50:41.940 --> 50:45.380]  came to wanting to fight, I mean they were really intelligent tough people but they wanted
[50:45.380 --> 50:50.820]  fights, they wanted to go out and engage large groups of people, I mean it was written about
[50:50.820 --> 50:54.660]  by the French who were on the Indian side a lot of the time, you know Sam Houston was
[50:54.660 --> 50:58.980]  five arrows sticking out of him in Tennessee, like killing like twelve people with a hatchet
[50:58.980 --> 51:01.540]  and they were just, they loved it, we'll be back.

[54:27.460 --> 54:35.660]  I was talking to Alejandra during the break and she was correcting me and she was reminding
[54:35.660 --> 54:39.780]  me because I know she's correct because I've read about this controversy a lot and I just
[54:39.780 --> 54:48.020]  went off Wikipedia today that said Slingo de Maya is the most important holiday in Mexico
[54:48.020 --> 54:50.100]  concerning its sovereignty.
[54:50.100 --> 54:55.580]  But I've always heard it's big in the United States and that down there it's not Slingo
[54:55.580 --> 54:59.420]  de Maya, but how do you say it, Dacis Sace, and I don't speak Spanish well, I speak very
[54:59.420 --> 55:02.820]  little, but she said no, that's right, that's correct, she's from Mexico.
[55:02.820 --> 55:05.980]  I thought she does a great job too.
[55:05.980 --> 55:12.220]  And so that's what this is all coming down to is how our media basically creates all
[55:12.220 --> 55:16.620]  these new combines and all these new things and then sells it as reality.
[55:16.620 --> 55:22.980]  And that's why I've always seen Slingo de Maya as this weird get-el-norte thing here
[55:22.980 --> 55:28.300]  in the United States that is basically run by the mainstream media to create more vulcanization.
[55:28.300 --> 55:32.940]  But I bet you know more than I do, so thanks for reminding me that I was going off mainstream
[55:32.940 --> 55:34.740]  media and was wrong, Allie.
[55:34.740 --> 55:36.740]  Yeah, no problem.
[55:36.740 --> 55:41.460]  I've noticed that ever since I came to the United States Slingo de Maya is a big deal
[55:41.460 --> 55:47.340]  and in Mexico we only celebrate 16th of September, which is the independence and it happened in
[55:47.340 --> 55:57.060]  1810 and then Puebla that battled the Slingo de Maya represents, it was actually in 1861
[55:57.060 --> 56:04.460]  so it was actually way later when Mexico was suffering some financial problems and Britain
[56:04.460 --> 56:10.220]  and Spain was, they made like a good deal with Mexico, but the friends, they were like
[56:10.220 --> 56:14.220]  oh let's take the opportunity and take over Mexico and that's when Napoleon III was like
[56:14.220 --> 56:18.900]  oh yeah I'm going to take over and it was just a battle that we won and everything and
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.220]  it's not like a huge deal, it was just more like oh look for it.
[56:22.220 --> 56:25.540]  So why do you think the media up here says it's the main Mexican holiday?
[56:25.540 --> 56:30.140]  Because I knew that was the case but I still went ahead and just read what they say.
[56:30.140 --> 56:38.540]  I think, well from what I know and I think most people found out as like a way to celebrate
[56:38.540 --> 56:42.740]  or like just celebrate and enjoy the party scene.
[56:42.740 --> 56:46.380]  I hear you and so the Ford Foundation others are trying to grab it.
[56:46.380 --> 56:51.060]  So the real independence day from Spain that's called Decesse, am I saying it wrong?
[56:51.060 --> 56:53.060]  Yeah, Decesse septiembre.
[56:53.060 --> 56:56.060]  Okay good, so I'm totally butchering at this.
[56:56.060 --> 56:57.620]  No you didn't get it.
[56:57.620 --> 57:01.020]  Okay, alright, well that's, I mean my dad always talks about that because he's a big
[57:01.020 --> 57:05.500]  historian and so is my mom and they're always just irritated when they hear Slingo de Mayo,
[57:05.500 --> 57:09.180]  the main Mexican holiday and they're just like that's not the holiday, they don't celebrate
[57:09.180 --> 57:13.580]  that in Mexico, that's all bull and I'm just and here I am getting it wrong and that's
[57:13.580 --> 57:16.260]  why we have a great crew folks to correct me when I am wrong.
[57:16.260 --> 57:17.260]  Thank you so much Allie.
[57:17.260 --> 57:18.340]  No problem.
[57:18.340 --> 57:23.620]  But I was right, this is literally something celebrated in El Norte for people to run around
[57:23.620 --> 57:29.700]  and burn pinatas of Donald Trump which is in the news today up on info wars.com.
[57:29.700 --> 57:31.820]  I haven't gotten to the whole coal thing yet.
[57:31.820 --> 57:38.060]  These are some riveting clips, very very sad clips of these coal miners losing everything
[57:38.060 --> 57:45.380]  and it's good clean energy we need and sorry bye bye.
[57:45.380 --> 57:51.220]  But meanwhile this story just went up on info wars.com, Roger Stone, info wars supporters
[57:51.220 --> 57:53.500]  helped make the Trump revolution.
[57:53.500 --> 57:59.540]  Trump is a force of nature, he's not going to be stopped a new article and blurb by Roger
[57:59.540 --> 58:05.020]  Stone and nice little comments he's made up on info wars.com and the mainstream media
[58:05.020 --> 58:08.460]  has really picked up on that, they've been trying to demonize Trump's affiliation with
[58:08.460 --> 58:13.540]  us and his campaign's affiliation with us and others and Trump has not run away from
[58:13.540 --> 58:14.540]  it.
[58:14.540 --> 58:15.540]  Said a lot of nice things on the campaign trail.
[58:15.540 --> 58:18.060]  I know he's intending to come on soon but that's not that big a deal.
[58:18.060 --> 58:21.740]  We're promoting the ideas of Donald Trump and I've got some clips that I'm going to
[58:21.740 --> 58:25.980]  get to and then I'm going to get to the situation with the coal where Hillary has been caught
[58:25.980 --> 58:29.220]  in flagrant lies and disinformation.
[58:29.220 --> 58:30.660]  I'm Alex Jones.

[1:00:21.860 --> 1:00:34.260]  All right, coming up, James O'Keefe's going to join us after he leaves us at the bottom
[1:00:34.260 --> 1:00:35.260]  of the hour.
[1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:40.060]  I've got to get to all these coal clips because there's five different clips.
[1:00:40.060 --> 1:00:43.260]  There's Hillary saying we're going to get rid of the coal miners and get rid of coal.
[1:00:43.260 --> 1:00:45.060]  Then she said she never said that.
[1:00:45.060 --> 1:00:48.780]  Then she said that, no, I mean, we're going to save you.
[1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:51.180]  That's what my statement means.
[1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:56.780]  But then her policies and Obama's policies have been to, quote, bankrupt coal in this
[1:00:56.780 --> 1:01:02.260]  country and it's really got the coal miners upset and people are really clicking that
[1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:05.300]  Hillary is out to get the little person.
[1:01:05.300 --> 1:01:10.220]  I mean, there aren't harder working people that work in more danger than coal miners
[1:01:10.220 --> 1:01:16.060]  around the world, whether it's in Latin America, Europe, the United States, and now they can't
[1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:20.500]  even have their ancestral job that many of them have had in places like England.
[1:01:20.500 --> 1:01:25.420]  Some families for 300 years.
[1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:30.500]  There have been mining coal for almost 180 years in West Virginia and Kentucky.
[1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.180]  It's incredible.
[1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:37.700]  That's globalism, stroke of the pen, your job's gone, and people go, I don't care about
[1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:38.700]  a coal miner.
[1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:39.700]  Well, guess what?
[1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:41.220]  Your energy prices just went up.
[1:01:41.220 --> 1:01:42.220]  So incredible.
[1:01:42.220 --> 1:01:43.700]  But let's go to some of these clips I mentioned earlier.
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:48.980]  Some of the good stuff Trump's doing, why he's got the establishment so scared of him.
[1:01:48.980 --> 1:01:52.660]  There's a double down coming out saying repeal Obamacare, it's a total disaster.
[1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:56.060]  I wish he'd go further and say it's been great for the big insurance companies, ripping
[1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.940]  everybody off who wrote it.
[1:01:57.940 --> 1:01:58.940]  That's how you destroy it.
[1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:00.060]  You kill the left cover.
[1:02:00.060 --> 1:02:01.580]  It's not free health care.
[1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:03.060]  It increases premiums.
[1:02:03.060 --> 1:02:06.500]  And then poor people that could still get charity care go, well, I got free care.
[1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:09.980]  They just call that Obamacare.
[1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:13.940]  Oh, man.
[1:02:13.940 --> 1:02:18.580]  Remember Obama said over and over again that it would be free?
[1:02:18.580 --> 1:02:19.580]  So you could keep your doctor?
[1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:23.500]  I mean, the insurance companies wrote it.
[1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:28.060]  And I'm all for free market businesses and companies and stuff, but man, insurance companies
[1:02:28.060 --> 1:02:31.620]  are as dirty as it gets internationally.
[1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:35.980]  You think they, oh, by the way, though, it's the first four or five years they make a profit.
[1:02:35.980 --> 1:02:39.660]  Next year it goes up so much, though, and it's so uncompetitive, they're then allowed
[1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:41.460]  to selectively pull out of it.
[1:02:41.460 --> 1:02:44.340]  So really Obamacare is like a five-year screw job.
[1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:46.620]  That's how you decode it.
[1:02:46.620 --> 1:02:49.300]  But guess what, a lot of people aren't going to be able to opt out, though.
[1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:53.660]  The insurance companies can opt out of giving you coverage, but you can't opt out of getting
[1:02:53.660 --> 1:02:55.380]  it no matter how much it costs.
[1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:59.660]  I mean, boy, you talk about having your hands tied, written by the insiders, baby, this
[1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:00.660]  is it.
[1:03:00.660 --> 1:03:06.940]  But let's go to the short clip of Trump vows to repeal the total disaster Obamacare on
[1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:08.660]  CNBC.
[1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:12.300]  In terms of the Affordable Care Act and just health care in the country, another first
[1:03:12.300 --> 1:03:15.260]  hundred days issue, would you, would you immediately try to?
[1:03:15.260 --> 1:03:21.220]  Well, if you go back to when this was originally passed, I said whoever, this was long before
[1:03:21.220 --> 1:03:29.700]  I thought about running for president, I said 2016 and 2017 and particularly 17 is going
[1:03:29.700 --> 1:03:36.380]  to be a total disaster for our country because of the so-called Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.
[1:03:36.380 --> 1:03:38.540]  And it is a disaster.
[1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:39.540]  And I've been saying it.
[1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:43.060]  I said whoever's president's going to have a problem because the numbers are going to
[1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:48.100]  be staggering for not only for people and not only for insurance companies for the country.
[1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:51.620]  I mean, look at the kind of numbers we're talking about for the country.
[1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:54.660]  And the fact is you have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
[1:03:54.660 --> 1:03:56.780]  The country cannot afford it.
[1:03:56.780 --> 1:03:58.460]  People cannot afford it.
[1:03:58.460 --> 1:04:00.780]  It's good for almost no one.
[1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:07.180]  And we have to repeal it, and we have to replace it, and we have to get it, we have to get
[1:04:07.180 --> 1:04:08.180]  better.
[1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:12.660]  Frankly, we have to get better than what we have right now because what we have right
[1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:13.660]  now isn't working.
[1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:18.140]  Look at the premiums that people, if I forget the insurance companies, the premiums are
[1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:23.380]  going up 25, 35, 45% and sometimes more than that.
[1:04:23.380 --> 1:04:27.180]  And look at the deductible.
[1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.380]  Deductibles are going up to numbers that nobody can even believe.
[1:04:30.380 --> 1:04:34.580]  I mean, you have to almost die to be able to even use it.
[1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:37.940]  It's a horrible thing for the country.
[1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:43.020]  I hear for the insurance companies, and I certainly know for the people because their
[1:04:43.020 --> 1:04:47.060]  numbers are going up so high and so rapidly, it is a total failure.
[1:04:47.060 --> 1:04:49.220]  It is a disaster.
[1:04:49.220 --> 1:04:50.220]  Except for the globalists.
[1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:51.220]  He said almost nobody.
[1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:52.220]  We're going to break.
[1:04:52.220 --> 1:04:55.340]  He said it's really bad for almost everyone.
[1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:59.380]  Oh, it's real good for the global insurance companies that the first year of it being
[1:04:59.380 --> 1:05:03.780]  implemented, global profits went up 47% with infowars.com.
[1:05:03.780 --> 1:05:05.980]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:07.060]  Why we have them.
[1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:12.040]  Why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why my right to have a gun
[1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:15.820]  is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[1:05:15.820 --> 1:05:20.500]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the second amendment must be considered
[1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:23.100]  more essential than the first amendment.
[1:05:23.100 --> 1:05:28.020]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[1:05:28.020 --> 1:05:33.700]  outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:39.260]  So it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[1:05:39.260 --> 1:05:43.660]  The original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contain 10 of what the constitutional
[1:05:43.660 --> 1:05:46.420]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[1:05:46.420 --> 1:05:49.060]  The bill of rights came to us with blinders on.
[1:05:49.060 --> 1:05:51.900]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[1:05:51.900 --> 1:05:57.020]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to
[1:05:57.020 --> 1:05:58.620]  those we love to hate.
[1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:04.420]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston for a limited time info wars select storeable
[1:06:04.420 --> 1:06:09.420]  foods that are the highest quality longest lasting produce right here in the U.S. foods
[1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:14.460]  are 30 to 40% off retail and let me tell you why that's so important when we do this special
[1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:20.060]  twice a year and we are contractually allowed to offer prices even lower than the prices
[1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:23.220]  that my patron supply offers and that super this is a food.

[1:06:26.820 --> 1:06:32.460]  It's incredibly good deal, but right next to it is our food the same food private labeled
[1:06:32.460 --> 1:06:37.300]  and it's a contract loophole where we can offer it lower than anyone else including their
[1:06:37.300 --> 1:06:38.300]  other distributors.
[1:06:38.300 --> 1:06:43.700]  I did this because of info wars power in the market to leverage in free market to bring
[1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:49.660]  you the very best deals and quite frankly that helps us then sell even more food and
[1:06:49.660 --> 1:06:51.420]  help fund this operation.

[1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:11.180]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:15.900]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:08:15.900 --> 1:08:20.340]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is stuck in traffic he should be in his office in the
[1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:21.340]  next 3-4 minutes.
[1:08:21.340 --> 1:08:24.300]  We'll punch him up on skype and get him here on the broadcast.
[1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:28.980]  He shot the viral video last week that went up on Drudge and other major sites.
[1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:36.860]  Video North Carolina officials enable reporters posing as tranny bathroom sexual predators.
[1:08:36.860 --> 1:08:41.020]  They come in and say I like to get in bathrooms with women I've got a fetish it's sexual and
[1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:46.140]  they say listen don't incriminate yourself stop talking go enjoy yourself basically and
[1:08:46.140 --> 1:08:52.060]  this is what this is all about Obama's threatening North Carolina over you know saying that men
[1:08:52.060 --> 1:08:57.340]  use men's bathrooms women use women's bathrooms while they announce that Obamacare premiums
[1:08:57.340 --> 1:09:01.620]  are set to double again while they announced they're going to bring in record numbers of
[1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:12.860]  Muslims into the country with no vetting and while they announce U.S. jobless claims rising
[1:09:12.860 --> 1:09:20.820]  layoffs intensifying we're all being distracted with this type of garbage meanwhile the Daily
[1:09:20.820 --> 1:09:27.100]  Mail reports that they have I guess elected their first Muslim mayor of London that will
[1:09:27.100 --> 1:09:34.380]  put that headline up it's on drudgereport.com it's also on info wars.com and then meanwhile
[1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:39.300]  women should not be allowed to travel more than 48 miles without a male chaperone says
[1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:45.780]  British Muslim group and they're pushing for that.
[1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:52.820]  Parts of London now 50% Islamic doubles in a decade what will it be well I guess 80%
[1:09:52.820 --> 1:09:59.180]  of a decade could be majority within 10 years and the issue is the majority of Muslims now
[1:09:59.180 --> 1:10:08.740]  the dominant Islam is radical Islam that politically culturally economically militarily physically
[1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:23.860]  comes after you first Muslim mayor of London Stan is it that just special labor set so
[1:10:23.860 --> 1:10:28.620]  they're they're saying it's all done he's so many 20 something points ahead labor that's
[1:10:28.620 --> 1:10:33.060]  the Communist Party basically over there is set to recapture London after bitter mayoral
[1:10:33.060 --> 1:10:43.180]  campaign writers sequit con their candidate was set today to become the first Muslim to
[1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:48.900]  be elected mayor of London loosening the ruling conservatives hold on Britain's financial
[1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:55.780]  center after a campaign marred by charges of anti-Semitism and extremism here's one
[1:10:55.780 --> 1:11:09.820]  I know there isn't a Muslim country on earth that allows anyone of any other major religion
[1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:19.420]  to be in a major governmental position or elected other than Iraq and Saddam Hussein
[1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:25.900]  he wanted playboy on the store shelves rock and roll on the radio and women go into college
[1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:33.700]  he was a former CIA operative put in by Eisenhower as an assassin then installed later in 79 told
[1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:43.300]  to invade told to attack Iran told to go ahead and invade Kuwait and set up that's that's
[1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:46.260]  what he got because they were getting rid of that old policy of trying to westernize
[1:11:46.260 --> 1:11:49.740]  the Middle East and you said no we're not doing knocking out and I'm not saying it's
[1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:52.100]  good to have playboy on the store shelves because people's rights and they want to you
[1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:56.260]  know what I mean but he's the opposite of head shopping Saudi Arabia his arch enemy
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:12:04.420]  and he's dead in doornail now dug out of his spider hole the media calling Saddam a coward
[1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:10.220]  you read about that guy's life far from a coward very interesting person very brutal
[1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:15.060]  to people that tried to kill Jews and Christians and non-radical Muslims very brutal to people
[1:12:15.060 --> 1:12:20.220]  that wanted to blow up women going to college Saddam didn't like his daughters going around
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:26.340]  wearing hoods over their head sorry didn't like it but I know mustaches are out big
[1:12:26.340 --> 1:12:35.740]  beards are in and that's what dominant Islam is now pushing the bath party wasn't perfect
[1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:38.620]  but it tried to modernize the Middle East that's why it was the big enemy of the globalist
[1:12:38.620 --> 1:12:46.220]  and it has been basically taken out who else's bath Assad Assad the only other country that
[1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:52.060]  where you could have Muslims and Christians living in peace along with Jews and now that's
[1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:55.660]  that's been destroyed basically so that's who our government runs that's that's who
[1:12:55.660 --> 1:13:00.780]  our government protects and they bring them in let them attack us and I've been in London
[1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:07.140]  a lot the Muslims are so arrogant and aggressive you'll be videotaping big Ben and they'll run
[1:13:07.140 --> 1:13:12.100]  over and say you do not take me and you're like hey buddy free speech I'll do what I
[1:13:12.100 --> 1:13:15.100]  want and then they back off they're so used to Brits and I'm not knocking Brits used to
[1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:18.980]  be the toughest people in the world they're so politically correct they almost start
[1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:27.220]  urinating on themselves just so cold your brown let me buy you all I mean that's what
[1:13:27.220 --> 1:13:32.660]  this has turned to so we're busy trying to create special bathrooms and letting men into
[1:13:32.660 --> 1:13:37.420]  bathrooms and colleges are you know shredding constitutions and banning them because they're
[1:13:37.420 --> 1:13:42.420]  so evil and racist as James O'Keefe was documented all over the world we're bringing in people
[1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:46.540]  who fundamentally say your daughter shouldn't be able to leave home shouldn't be able to
[1:13:46.540 --> 1:13:50.620]  drive a car and we're going to enforce it and your women belong to us you dumb weak
[1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:58.580]  Europeans and the weird leftist that radical lo raza feminist are always celebrating Islam
[1:13:58.580 --> 1:14:05.580]  and all this weird craziness now the story is up on info wars dot com and I'm just going
[1:14:05.580 --> 1:14:11.580]  to have the man himself introduce it it's also obviously a project very toss dot com
[1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:16.620]  one of their latest coups the folks that brought down acorn and other vicious organizations
[1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:20.220]  and their shades of that where James O'Keefe walks in with a so-called hooker and goes
[1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:26.180]  I got underage sex slaves I want to run they will just cover it up good job we'll we'll
[1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:30.740]  help you know run this operation with you that's what we do in the Democratic Party
[1:14:30.740 --> 1:14:34.340]  you want the facility at facility just like they went around Texas and the Democrats went
[1:14:34.340 --> 1:14:38.100]  the white Democrats to a person we're going to have elections fraud and take over and
[1:14:38.100 --> 1:14:41.620]  bring in Mexicans and overthrow the state and we'll get the guns don't worry this is
[1:14:41.620 --> 1:14:50.620]  a crazed groups with what I call criminal energy criminal intent their conquerors it's
[1:14:50.620 --> 1:14:56.140]  all these weird radical Muslims weirdo groups pedophile groups Namba at the UN they're taking
[1:14:56.140 --> 1:15:00.900]  over so we've got a three and a half minute video but let's play just the short one minute
[1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:05.620]  long boil down of this and then have O'Keefe break it down for us and talk about election
[1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:10.700]  2016 where he sees it all going and more but here's part of that report.
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:38.660]  Are you familiar with snapchat you know I'll like take a snap in the in the bathroom my
[1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:45.540]  friend's like oh my god you're so gross I can be a little bit bad and it sort of pushes
[1:15:45.540 --> 1:15:50.980]  the envelope so you know I mean there has been some snapchats but they self-destruct
[1:15:50.980 --> 1:15:56.820]  well they don't really self-destruct I hope they self-destruct like you're taking snapchats
[1:15:56.820 --> 1:16:01.460]  of women you're alerting me to what we call sexual exploitation you don't tell me anything
[1:16:01.460 --> 1:16:05.060]  more you don't tell me anything more when people take don't don't say it don't don't
[1:16:05.060 --> 1:16:09.940]  say it just listen all right now that audio may not transfer too good over a but it transfers
[1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:14.180]  pretty clear on FM and the internet but to go over it is James O'Keefe the president's
[1:16:14.180 --> 1:16:19.540]  big issue now is North Carolina saying we're not going to have six foot five men that self
[1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:24.660]  identifies a five-year-old girl you know in the bathroom with your daughter this is now
[1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:28.860]  the ultimate issue the feds are threatening civil rights lawsuits arrest that's in the
[1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:33.980]  news today while they're bringing in hundreds of thousands of people that say they want
[1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:38.980]  to put a beekeeper suit over your wife and daughter's head I mean this is crazy town
[1:16:38.980 --> 1:16:43.460]  and then to watch these university officials kind of giggle and laugh about taking photos
[1:16:43.460 --> 1:16:48.020]  of people going to the bathroom which is a whole liberal perv universe this is all just
[1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:53.260]  a bunch of pervs in my view that want to get laws passed to be able to do whatever they
[1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:57.380]  want this is what happens when civilization is about to collapse James O'Keefe of project
[1:16:57.380 --> 1:17:02.260]  veritas do you agree with that statement or what would you add to it I think it's Alex
[1:17:02.260 --> 1:17:07.060]  thanks for having me on again yeah the video shows these officials at these North Carolina
[1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:11.300]  state officials because it's all happening in North Carolina that the that the gender
[1:17:11.300 --> 1:17:15.660]  neutral bathrooms could actually be used as a cover for sexual predators so we went
[1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:22.100]  straight to the heart of this whole controversy by sending in people undercover posing as
[1:17:22.100 --> 1:17:27.260]  sexual predators talking to these not just like low ranking officials these are these
[1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:32.140]  are chancellors of universities provost title nine officials so what we have here is the
[1:17:32.140 --> 1:17:39.700]  title nine federal laws that that require people to feel comfortable require any federal
[1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:44.900]  program from receiving federal assistance there's no discrimination on the basis of
[1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:51.740]  sex there's there's no denial of feeling comfortable which have these tyrant title nine officials
[1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:58.380]  in in conflict with the gender neutral bathrooms they cannot coexist so we expose this by going
[1:17:58.380 --> 1:18:03.220]  in and saying hey we want to use these restrooms of course we're posing as these predators
[1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:08.580]  we want to use these these these female restrooms because it gets us turned on to use them and
[1:18:08.580 --> 1:18:14.340]  to take photographs in there and they tell us don't say anything more about it don't
[1:18:14.340 --> 1:18:19.100]  don't talk about it when they should be calling the police one official actually encourages
[1:18:19.100 --> 1:18:24.300]  us to keep doing it creatively these are the and then of course there's the cover up of
[1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:28.980]  this and and we'll talk about that too because they the video came out and they went scrambling
[1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:32.860]  so we're trying to get to the heart of the matter here which is about that these these
[1:18:32.860 --> 1:18:37.620]  these gender neutral bathrooms have their positive characteristics but it could be
[1:18:37.620 --> 1:18:44.380]  an enabler for sexual predators and by the way I was out at dinner the other night and
[1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:49.540]  my daughters who are 11 and 8 wanted me to go to the bathroom with them which they had
[1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:54.740]  done in years and they pointed at the bathrooms you know walk with them because they could
[1:18:54.740 --> 1:19:00.340]  see them and they could see that it said gender neutral and here in Austin they just done
[1:19:00.340 --> 1:19:05.580]  it there wasn't a choice and then I went well guys that's okay I think that's a single person
[1:19:05.580 --> 1:19:14.340]  bathroom I went and looked it wasn't I mean this is crazy town what they've done well
[1:19:14.340 --> 1:19:19.660]  in the video that's it's it's both you know enlightening and raging and funny and funny
[1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:24.100]  in a dark way because in the video the you know I was in there I was actually doing this
[1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:29.020]  hidden camera work this time and I and I said to the official I said well there have been
[1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:34.140]  some snapchat photographs that were taken in these women's bathrooms and she and and
[1:19:34.140 --> 1:19:39.740]  she's oh really and I said well they self-destruct don't they they disappear after a few minutes
[1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:43.940]  or after a few hours and she said well they're on some server somewhere and I said I hope
[1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:48.060]  they self-destruct because otherwise I'm gonna get in trouble and she says well don't say
[1:19:48.060 --> 1:19:52.020]  she covered you know don't covers her ears don't tell me anything else when the state
[1:19:52.020 --> 1:19:56.260]  laws and the federal laws says that that's exactly what she's supposed to do but she
[1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:03.300]  doesn't want this incident to get in the way of a broader desire which is to keep keep
[1:20:03.300 --> 1:20:09.060]  the status quo keep these restrooms being well let's expand on that though this is about
[1:20:09.060 --> 1:20:12.580]  taking all of our other liberties all of our other freedoms in this country for the private
[1:20:12.580 --> 1:20:16.700]  Federal Reserve the banker bailouts the NSA spy on the open borders the lawlessness and
[1:20:16.700 --> 1:20:21.100]  giving us these new little weird rights that never existed it's a it's a giant joke honest
[1:20:21.100 --> 1:20:26.940]  but I didn't realize that this has become a huge issue in schools and culture I hadn't
[1:20:26.940 --> 1:20:32.460]  talked to my daughters about this and there I was suddenly in a normal supposed restaurant
[1:20:32.460 --> 1:20:40.620]  and they've changed it now and my children were concerned and scared I mean I'll say
[1:20:40.620 --> 1:20:45.340]  where I was I was at a cheesecake factory folks I mean it's just it's actually affecting
[1:20:45.340 --> 1:20:50.100]  me now I can't believe it and they're scared they don't want to be in a bathroom with strange
[1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:55.740]  men I get it I don't really like I was going to you know communal bathroom ago oh good
[1:20:55.740 --> 1:20:59.220]  there's nobody in here you know I don't like being around other men quite frankly you know
[1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:02.940]  with their pants off or whatever I mean I'll just be honest or women for that matter but
[1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:06.900]  it's not my wife or whatever it's just it's creepy whatever happened to privacy in the
[1:21:06.900 --> 1:21:11.740]  old Soviet Union they only took you know your wages away and made you work as a slave you
[1:21:11.740 --> 1:21:16.420]  could at least go home and be a man be a woman have kids and just be normal what is happening
[1:21:16.420 --> 1:21:21.500]  here these people are trying to conquer us what's behind this James O'Keefe well that
[1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:27.700]  that's a great question you know I it's a broader question I think I genuinely think
[1:21:27.700 --> 1:21:33.980]  that you're seeing the collision of two different competing philosophies and one of those philosophies
[1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:39.700]  like title nine which is a controversial program it says that no person in the United States
[1:21:39.700 --> 1:21:44.460]  shall a basis of sex be excluded in participation of or denied the benefits of or subjected
[1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:51.820]  to discrimination under any education program or activity and these these title nine philosophies
[1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:58.940]  have become so pushed upon these these universities and these organizations and now you're seeing
[1:21:58.940 --> 1:22:03.900]  the conflict now you're seeing people want to want to do nefarious things sneak into
[1:22:03.900 --> 1:22:10.580]  other restrooms be become predators and they're not they're not able to coexist so and we
[1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:14.420]  did it with Lucky Charms trying to ban Lucky Charms because the racist we've done it with
[1:22:14.420 --> 1:22:19.780]  campus speech codes with with the campus being banned at Yale University they banned the Halloween
[1:22:19.780 --> 1:22:24.500]  costumes I mean ten years ago this was irony now it's become reality and they fired the
[1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:29.220]  professors that spoke up and who are liberals and said we should allow costume parties we
[1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:33.860]  had a we had a student at Yale University walk up to this is on video walk up to one
[1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:38.300]  of the deans and say and and and she said to the dean she says your job is to create
[1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:43.500]  a safe space here and the dean says I don't agree with you to his credit he said are the
[1:22:43.500 --> 1:22:48.500]  job is the marketplace of ideas and she screamed at him and she cursed at him and she said then
[1:22:48.500 --> 1:22:55.140]  you should be fired and eventually one of those people did resign so you have everything's
[1:22:55.140 --> 1:22:59.860]  coming to a boiling point in this country and they're competing philosophies some of which
[1:22:59.860 --> 1:23:03.860]  are on the left competing with each other about safe spaces about the ability to peep
[1:23:03.860 --> 1:23:08.580]  in restrooms and we're just trying to expose it we're trying to visualize it for people
[1:23:08.580 --> 1:23:14.500]  and we're trying to acknowledge it now Alex after we did this report we want to know what
[1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:19.980]  was happening afterwards we call them for comment this is the the chancellor of of UNC
[1:23:19.980 --> 1:23:22.980]  and they submitted a police report but the interesting thing about the police board is
[1:23:22.980 --> 1:23:29.180]  guess what you're in it was filed after the fact and and we know that it was filed after
[1:23:29.180 --> 1:23:33.780]  the fact so they're trying to cover up their tracks which is you know just another surprise
[1:23:33.780 --> 1:23:37.220]  they didn't try to charge you and say that covering it's what's evil but but at least
[1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:40.140]  they're trying to act like they're doing the right thing well what about the pro life
[1:23:40.140 --> 1:23:44.140]  groups that clearly have been exposing some criminal activity we now know what the body
[1:23:44.140 --> 1:23:49.300]  parts sales we now the women aren't being told isn't a national service they're getting
[1:23:49.300 --> 1:23:54.540]  arrested from California to Texas in SWAT team raids so David DeLyden is the one that
[1:23:54.540 --> 1:23:59.500]  you're talking he he's a friend of mine he's a colleague of mine and he was actually his
[1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:02.940]  he was raided his home was raided three weeks to go by the California Attorney General's
[1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:07.780]  office while he was while he was taking his trash out during lunchtime they hit I think
[1:24:07.780 --> 1:24:12.660]  they had a dozen state Attorney General this is Kamala Harris who's running for Senate
[1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:18.900]  in California who's currently the Attorney General of California 12 state agents to
[1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:24.140]  raid they took all of his video cameras they took all of his equipment and and they want
[1:24:24.140 --> 1:24:29.900]  to try to prosecute this this citizen journalist for exposing Planned Parenthood it's all political
[1:24:29.900 --> 1:24:35.260]  it's all political and just so that your audience knows Veritas my organization does have an
[1:24:35.260 --> 1:24:42.060]  ongoing undercover investigation into the California Attorney General's office because it's absolutely
[1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:48.700]  unconscionable that these agents are playing politics their job is to enforce law not to
[1:24:48.700 --> 1:24:52.780]  not to retaliate against people for their for their journalists I agree it's not just there
[1:24:52.780 --> 1:24:59.060]  they had folks down in Houston pull an indictment of of journalists this is getting dangerous
[1:24:59.060 --> 1:25:04.620]  for the free yeah Texas is Texas is perceived by like people in the northeast to be a conservative
[1:25:04.620 --> 1:25:09.540]  place but you guys have Travis County of Harris County you have kangaroo courts and you have
[1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:15.660]  people who do political things and the only solution that I can see is for is for people
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:21.260]  like us as I've said on your program many many times to to you know it's not about pitchforks
[1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:25.780]  anymore it's about video cameras I agree and the answer is more people doing what you've
[1:25:25.780 --> 1:25:30.660]  done what we do I mean I say get more people out of these Trump rallies to show how horrible
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:34.620]  these anti-free speech social justice warriors are we're not trying to run a monopoly of
[1:25:34.620 --> 1:25:38.700]  this you've written a book about it you try to teach folks how to do it we try to do it
[1:25:38.700 --> 1:25:43.180]  we just want more citizen journalists out there because James O'Keefe I think it's fair
[1:25:43.180 --> 1:25:47.420]  to say we are starting to win I think people are waking up all over the world not just
[1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:53.100]  here but the establishment is striking back trying to censor free speech yes and that
[1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:59.020]  that is that is the fight that I I fight is is they're trying to say that of CBS News
[1:25:59.020 --> 1:26:02.940]  or NBC News shows up with a camera they're not going to arrest you or detain you they're
[1:26:02.940 --> 1:26:06.980]  not going to try to destroy you but if but if we do that they're going to try to censor
[1:26:06.980 --> 1:26:11.300]  us and discredit us you asked about the election I'd love to give you my thoughts about what's
[1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:16.780]  happening in 2016 you know I read this book by Charles Murray called by the people and
[1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:21.260]  I think he says it best that our government and country is in such an advanced state of
[1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:25.980]  sclerosis and that solutions are far beyond the reach of the electoral and legislative
[1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:30.020]  process and maybe Trump will change things maybe maybe this election someone who gets
[1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:34.380]  in will change things but I do think that the restoration of a great lasting and moral
[1:26:34.380 --> 1:26:39.420]  society is not going to happen by getting people on the courts or even winning elections
[1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:45.140]  the citizenry must create new counterweights and those counterweights include the types
[1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:49.500]  of things that we're doing you have to you have to hold the people accountable at the
[1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:55.980]  local level and if it's a UNC provost who's covering the filing false police reports because
[1:26:55.980 --> 1:27:00.900]  their people were advising a sexual or would be sexual predator whatever the case is we
[1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:06.420]  have to create the counterweights we can't put all of our faith in government or in or
[1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:09.540]  in the legislative process I totally agree we shouldn't bet everything on Trump but his
[1:27:09.540 --> 1:27:13.500]  populism and his popularity and the mainstream media throwing everything they've got against
[1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:18.660]  him and it backfiring is a good gauge and a bellwether of just how discredited these
[1:27:18.660 --> 1:27:24.500]  people are I mean the AP poll 6% of Americans trust the mainstream media that's a stick
[1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:30.140]  of fork in it it's done I will tell you that you know anyone who's saying that that Trump
[1:27:30.140 --> 1:27:34.380]  can't beat Hillary I mean these people have been wrong about every single thing they have
[1:27:34.380 --> 1:27:38.980]  they have they have lied and in most cases they have it they have a fiduciary interest
[1:27:38.980 --> 1:27:42.540]  they have a stake in the game they've skin in the game oh Trump's gonna destroy her
[1:27:42.540 --> 1:27:47.020]  because he's gonna take the gloves off right but the people have been wrong and you see
[1:27:47.020 --> 1:27:51.340]  in the articles come out now and the Washington Post Chris delays that come out and says I've
[1:27:51.340 --> 1:27:55.500]  been wrong and they're they're printing their maya culpas but they've been wrong about every
[1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:59.860]  single thing do not believe them whatever advice they give you in the media about what's
[1:27:59.860 --> 1:28:04.860]  gonna happen here it's probably the exact opposite and I do think that people are waking
[1:28:04.860 --> 1:28:10.700]  up Alex I do think that people are really upset and our job is to is to keep is to
[1:28:10.700 --> 1:28:17.740]  keep them informed and and I'm happy that people are finally able to not trust the information
[1:28:17.740 --> 1:28:23.940]  that they're given and this whole process this whole election as as as made people distrust
[1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:28.100]  these these folks even more and as much as we can do to inform the people directly that's
[1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:32.580]  what we got to do I agree with you what else are you working on this big whoa when's the
[1:28:32.580 --> 1:28:37.220]  next shoe drop absolutely well we have a lot of we have a lot of things going on we were

[1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:15.620]  of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago
[1:31:15.620 --> 1:31:22.020]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:28.980]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food
[1:31:28.980 --> 1:31:35.300]  and water and the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate

[1:33:34.500 --> 1:33:40.420]  they're going to destroy us
[1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:44.500]  Camille Paglia who is a true intellectual i read several of her books a lot of her writing
[1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:47.380]  she actually knows what she's talking about let's come out and said
[1:33:48.100 --> 1:33:53.300]  Hillary wants to make this all about sexism and all about women versus men this is about
[1:33:53.300 --> 1:33:59.140]  elitism and bitter garbage and insiders playing games donald trump's the way to go
[1:33:59.140 --> 1:34:05.860]  it doesn't matter that donald trump hires more women for executive positions than any other
[1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:12.900]  executive out there they've done studies on it it doesn't matter that he doesn't doesn't have any
[1:34:12.900 --> 1:34:19.140]  history of abusing women or anything wrong they're just going to say he does while they defend
[1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:29.620]  radical islam that turns women into total slaves it's not about sexism she says
[1:34:29.860 --> 1:34:36.580]  Camille Paglia on trump hillary's restless bitterness and the end of elites a salon story
[1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:41.700]  it's good to see salon get it right occasionally instead of promoting pedophilia like they've
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:46.900]  done in five different articles the last year i mean give me a break keep your hands off my kids
[1:34:46.900 --> 1:34:54.180]  it's keep your hands off their minds too you you you control freaks all right i want to get
[1:34:54.180 --> 1:34:58.420]  into the coal mine news and i mentioned because it's not about coal miners it is but it's bigger
[1:34:58.420 --> 1:35:07.460]  than that it's about screwing everyone over in their face but first i want to get into
[1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:13.220]  the republican establishment saying the republican party's dead because of trump
[1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:17.220]  and and herbert walker bush and george bush saying they won't be part of the party
[1:35:18.580 --> 1:35:23.780]  because trump said it i mean they say he's discredited it these are the people bringing
[1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:29.060]  in world government deindustrializing us that launched all the evil wars
[1:35:30.580 --> 1:35:36.500]  that have been rejected just like we reject hillary we don't reject jab bush because he's a white guy
[1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:44.100]  we're rejecting because he's from a serial killer family and a con man
[1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:48.180]  same thing with hillary
[1:35:50.340 --> 1:35:54.740]  and i shouldn't have to sit up and say i'm against hillary because she's an evil person
[1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:59.780]  not because she's a woman i would vote for a good woman so quick and make my head spin i mean
[1:35:59.780 --> 1:36:07.380]  it's not even debatable as if the grassroots birthplace of the renaissance is against women
[1:36:07.380 --> 1:36:15.460]  how did the west ever get to the point where we think we are the creators of all oppression
[1:36:17.700 --> 1:36:21.300]  because we are we're so much of the liberty movement started worldwide
[1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:26.740]  we are the prime suspects because we're so liberal we love our daughter so much
[1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:34.980]  we love our son so much we love everybody that at least was a large vein of renaissance culture
[1:36:34.980 --> 1:36:44.500]  in the last 500 years and you just compare the history of the west in the last 500 years to
[1:36:44.500 --> 1:36:52.420]  everybody else and it is enlightened it is awesome compare it's got a lot of boy it's got a lot of
[1:36:52.420 --> 1:36:59.620]  problems but it's where the world learned to start trying to truly progress and then you get this
[1:36:59.620 --> 1:37:04.820]  leftist communist globalist anti-human garbage saying they're the progressives
[1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:16.340]  it's it's it's scary i'm gonna get to these clips here in a moment and get into the call mining
[1:37:16.340 --> 1:37:20.260]  story and then open the phones up and take some of your calls you can also call in if you want to
[1:37:20.260 --> 1:37:25.780]  talk to Wayne Madsen with any 2016 questions he's got a lot of breaking news coming up but first
[1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:30.980]  i kept saying we're extending it one day one day the last few days and i just called him up and said
[1:37:30.980 --> 1:37:35.780]  look i'm gonna stop arguing every day about extending the sale our major suppliers in
[1:37:35.780 --> 1:37:41.460]  utah super high-quality horrible food i said i want to get the maximum i can push this contractually
[1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:47.060]  as a private labeler and what your factory can supply and they said okay at current sales rates
[1:37:47.060 --> 1:37:53.540]  we can go until sunday and because our rule at my patriot supply is to get it out within a week
[1:37:54.260 --> 1:38:00.740]  and because they're so fresh such high quality and we private label build sometimes get around
[1:38:00.740 --> 1:38:03.940]  they're already lowest prices to the very lowest prices in the industry because they got a lot of
[1:38:03.940 --> 1:38:07.620]  other distributors and suppliers and quite frankly a lot of folks don't like prices down there with
[1:38:07.620 --> 1:38:12.340]  you know 10 profit or whatever they want 30 40 percent or 50 percent and sell less that that's
[1:38:12.340 --> 1:38:19.460]  not how i work i want the deal i'd want i want a relationship i want you to get quality food i
[1:38:19.460 --> 1:38:24.340]  want you to enjoy it i want you to know you got a good deal on it and i hope you don't ever have
[1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:29.940]  to use it with talk of revolution and war and and the economy and the bubbles and the elites
[1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:35.940]  running into bunkers and all the craziness i hope that we're prepared we're ready and that we don't
[1:38:35.940 --> 1:38:39.780]  have to use the horrible food but it's not like insurance you get for fire you never have a fire
[1:38:39.780 --> 1:38:44.020]  for 50 years or auto insurance for a decade you don't have a wreck you're like well at least
[1:38:44.020 --> 1:38:48.980]  i didn't ever have a wreck yeah but you wasted all that money with storable food let's say things
[1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:54.100]  get better in five years you eat it taste as good as the day you bought it super high quality this is
[1:38:54.100 --> 1:39:00.180]  insurance you don't lose on in fact with inflation going up you probably gain money in in many different
[1:39:00.180 --> 1:39:06.340]  analyses so 30 to 40 off depending on the package we have the full spectrum of my patriot and
[1:39:06.340 --> 1:39:12.580]  info or select exact same food side by side you can buy it my patriot they're full selection
[1:39:13.140 --> 1:39:16.980]  or you can buy it from info or select it's the exact same food info wars life
[1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:22.660]  dot com is the nutraceuticals info or select dot com is the storeable food but you can find it all
[1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:30.100]  at info wars store dot com and because we have sold a lot of food the last two weeks i am in a
[1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:36.420]  better position to really send a full crew to billarberg next month to send a giant crew to
[1:39:36.420 --> 1:39:42.980]  cleveland and to the dnc in philadelphia and to send a crew to oregon this weekend to cover
[1:39:42.980 --> 1:39:48.260]  the anti-free speech social justice warriors and to hire a couple more reporters and to be able to
[1:39:49.140 --> 1:39:54.100]  get some bonuses into these well-deserved reporters that quite frankly aren't paid that much so
[1:39:54.100 --> 1:40:01.460]  so thank you for your support folks we are hardcore patriots that love freedom and whether
[1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:05.860]  it's non-gmo heirloom seeds or whether it's high quality water filtration systems or whether it's
[1:40:05.860 --> 1:40:13.620]  the super high quality nutraceuticals they're all 10 off right now as part of this preparedness
[1:40:13.620 --> 1:40:17.940]  special and i'm going to run that until next wednesday and that's the day that ends but this
[1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:24.500]  sunday it ends to get 30 to 40 off on the high quality storeable foods at infowarstore.com
[1:40:25.220 --> 1:40:29.380]  we sold out a super mill that tally is just a bunch of known cold pressed organic herbs
[1:40:29.380 --> 1:40:33.780]  that just get your body in your glands operating the way god intended them to all i know is it's
[1:40:33.780 --> 1:40:39.620]  changed my life i've lost weight libido stamina it's incredible quite frankly i said look i know
[1:40:39.620 --> 1:40:43.620]  that formula is similar to super mail that are cold pressed or a hundred bucks and ours is basically
[1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:52.980]  half that but i said i said i want to come out with a one that is organic but dry herbs so it's a
[1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:58.740]  bigger dose but not as powerful kind of a poor man's super mail vitality and it's not a poor man's
[1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:06.340]  but it's it's it's very inexpensive 24 26 similar dry powder brands are $80 that you buy at major
[1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:12.580]  stores and they're worth it in my view and a lot of folks argue with me in marketing they go listen
[1:41:12.580 --> 1:41:18.340]  shell for more there's more perceived value i will not play that game ever i need to be
[1:41:18.340 --> 1:41:20.020]  punched in the nose the day i do okay
[1:41:25.060 --> 1:41:29.220]  anyway so the point is i appreciate you and i appreciate your support i want you to be
[1:41:29.220 --> 1:41:35.620]  blown away by anthroplex now be careful with it because i've had some temper issues i'll just be
[1:41:35.620 --> 1:41:41.540]  honest uh and i already had them so if you don't have a temper problem it's it's not a game in fact
[1:41:41.540 --> 1:41:46.980]  consult your physician this is all seen as fda grass recognize safe that's the whole law we don't
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:52.500]  saw anything that isn't seen as grass that doesn't mean grass on the ground folks just say it's a
[1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:58.580]  law but still whether it's the liver cleanse or x2 or anthroplex consult a physician because you
[1:41:58.580 --> 1:42:02.580]  it may interact with something you're taking or whatever this is powerful stuff you may detox
[1:42:02.580 --> 1:42:07.140]  big time on the liver cleanse you may detox big time on the x2 nascent iodine because you're already
[1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:13.460]  so deficient and your thyroid was already about to go over the edge so buyer beware we're not selling
[1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:21.940]  sugar water these aren't placebo Easter bunny eggs baby okay just get that and know it experience it
[1:42:21.940 --> 1:42:27.780]  for yourself that's where i detoxed three weeks on survival still x2 it was like when i carry one
[1:42:27.780 --> 1:42:31.300]  of my kids and they were a little up a big you know mountain or something of you know a couple
[1:42:31.300 --> 1:42:35.540]  thousand feet and when you finally take your four-year-old off your shoulders you you feel
[1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:40.740]  like you're flying about three weeks into this i felt like crud for about a week and doctor group
[1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:46.020]  predicted that but man after that it was just like all the stuff came out of my skin other things
[1:42:46.020 --> 1:42:51.220]  happened i mean it was spectacular because it was an element i needed all along that wasn't
[1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:56.660]  available in the food chain basically for most people i know i was deficient yeah i'm gonna

[1:44:23.060 --> 1:44:31.060]  in a white house contest as if that crazy man participates in anything he was never even president
[1:44:31.060 --> 1:44:37.700]  he was a puppet chaining around the show president george dubby bush the fake texan i'm just sick of
[1:44:37.700 --> 1:44:42.900]  people coming down here and doing it in texas's name like ted cruise and you know george bush and
[1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:48.180]  all these guys i love folks from connecticut but goby criminals in connecticut president george
[1:44:48.180 --> 1:44:55.860]  w bush lbj was a texan and was a criminal we get the blame for that one president super texan he
[1:44:55.860 --> 1:45:02.100]  was the real deal a criminal version look out president george w bush is staying out of presidential
[1:45:02.100 --> 1:45:08.100]  campaign politics a spokesman said wednesday an announcement that came just after donald trump
[1:45:08.100 --> 1:45:13.140]  became the republican party's presumptive nominee president bush does not plan to participate or
[1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:19.380]  comment on the presidential campaign bush spokesman freddy ford told cnn that's because he's hopped
[1:45:19.380 --> 1:45:25.300]  up on so many uh psychotrophics painting in his bathtub remember that that guy is gone gone gone
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:37.940]  gone to drink gone to pills gone gone gone i have already drunk your money he said to quote true grit
[1:45:41.220 --> 1:45:44.580]  and it goes on to other republican establishment is against him as if that means something
[1:45:44.580 --> 1:45:50.260]  you have a discredited warmonger saying he doesn't like you and these other people and dick chaney and
[1:45:50.260 --> 1:45:56.180]  and and and all the rest of them and i've got one here with uh john mccain the keating five swindler
[1:45:56.180 --> 1:46:03.700]  the it goes on and on not a war hero he was in the lavish area with the prostitutes and the fine
[1:46:03.700 --> 1:46:09.700]  meals he was a guy that said whatever they wanted i mean i've interviewed the folks that were in
[1:46:09.700 --> 1:46:17.700]  the hanoi hilton with him but he's a war hero according to these traders well glenn beck who
[1:46:17.700 --> 1:46:22.420]  who really is so irrelevant i don't want to even attack him i wish he would have turned around i wish
[1:46:22.420 --> 1:46:29.460]  you would have stopped he has been lying about us 24 7 i've had lawyers look at what he said before
[1:46:29.460 --> 1:46:33.300]  and they said undoubtedly you'd win this but you don't want to waste your time doing that to him i
[1:46:33.300 --> 1:46:37.780]  said no he's so discredited that it doesn't matter what he said about me what he said about me didn't
[1:46:37.780 --> 1:46:45.060]  hurt me but he always is there to deceive conservatives and libertarians and to defeat
[1:46:45.060 --> 1:46:50.340]  movements at key periods and that was his total commitment his job to do even if he destroyed
[1:46:50.340 --> 1:46:56.660]  himself and he is now a shadow of the former self on ratings you name it his money everything
[1:46:56.660 --> 1:47:02.100]  he claims he's real proud of that that you know he he did all this the guy's a piece of work and he
[1:47:02.100 --> 1:47:07.700]  says we'll never have another republican president now because of donald trump not because of killing
[1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:11.940]  a million iraqis and george bush and not clinton you know keeping the sanctions on and killing
[1:47:11.940 --> 1:47:16.260]  hundreds of thousands and albright saying it was okay not all the nsa spying not all the torture
[1:47:16.260 --> 1:47:23.620]  not all the open borders not all the globalism none of that matters all that matters is that
[1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:28.020]  donald trump said oh we can't bring in any muslims right now if we're not checking their ides i
[1:47:28.020 --> 1:47:32.820]  didn't know that yeah oh hey listen mexico has some of the tupas immigration things out there we've
[1:47:32.820 --> 1:47:37.780]  got to control our border we're allowed to have a border we got bad deals with china his mistake
[1:47:37.780 --> 1:47:43.860]  was thinking he'd try to be president and just take a few of the bowling balls tied to our legs the
[1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:49.060]  ball and chains off because this whole crew like george will says we don't count your votes we don't
[1:47:49.060 --> 1:47:56.100]  listen to the plurality of the people we are sovereign that means royal we're royal he actually
[1:47:56.100 --> 1:48:02.900]  said we're royal you don't count and the and these collection of bought-off minions get together and
[1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:10.260]  just say we've arrived we rule like like north korean communist party members you don't think kim

[1:55:24.340 --> 1:55:28.860]  sorry for me by my products. I'm in the hospital. I'm really skiing but I'm in
[1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:33.460]  the hospital. I'm wearing a little new little sweater. A new little sweater with
[1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:40.220]  a smiley face. Get in my ice cream truck. Oh hi little girl. I've got free ice

[1:56:06.860 --> 1:56:13.500]  But here's what happens. Because Donald Trump is the GOP candidate and I believe
[1:56:13.500 --> 1:56:21.460]  Hillary Clinton is going to win because of this. You will never elect another GOP
[1:56:21.460 --> 1:56:27.140]  person to high office ever again. Because what's going to happen is
[1:56:27.140 --> 1:56:33.180]  you are now going to have Hillary Clinton legalize as many voters as you can.
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:38.740]  The GOP is going to be completely racist whether it's true or not because of
[1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:45.460]  Donald Trump. You will never have another Republican president ever again.
[1:56:45.460 --> 1:56:50.140]  Let me say this to him and his whole fake authoritarian garbage. Let me be
[1:56:50.140 --> 1:56:55.180]  totally insincere and try to be like an actor and just say here's what's going to
[1:56:55.180 --> 1:57:00.180]  happen to you Glenn Beck. Talk radio is moving into its final phases in the old
[1:57:00.180 --> 1:57:05.500]  format and you are universally reviled by everyone you work with because what a
[1:57:05.500 --> 1:57:10.300]  nasty narcissist Messiah complex person you are and you're going to accelerate

[1:57:16.660 --> 1:57:21.100]  Rockefeller Republicans who've been hijacking the party for the social
[1:57:21.100 --> 1:57:26.620]  engineers are going to be run out of the party and you better hope you don't
[1:57:26.620 --> 1:57:29.740]  push too far and many of you end up getting arrested for treason and we're
[1:57:29.740 --> 1:57:33.460]  going to expose your globalist plan with China and others that have sold out our
[1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:37.700]  industrial base and we're going to restore this Republic and defeat the
[1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:41.380]  social justice warriors and the sickening engineers that hope to bring
[1:57:41.380 --> 1:57:45.340]  this country down and we're going to secure our borders we're going to deport
[1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:50.140]  the criminal illegals and promote good legal honest immigration and promote

[1:59:53.100 --> 1:59:58.460]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:03.100 --> 2:00:08.460]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones only
[2:00:08.460 --> 2:00:14.420]  on the GCN radio network I'm gonna play the coal mine and pieces coming up the
[2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:18.460]  next segment that haven't had some about 15 after and then take your calls but
[2:00:18.460 --> 2:00:22.860]  when you talk about Beck he's a true benedict Arnold the true slimer trying
[2:00:22.860 --> 2:00:27.300]  to undermine constitution below rights trying to deceive and get evangelicals
[2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:32.420]  on his bandwagon under his mind control that's clear he's destroyed himself but
[2:00:32.420 --> 2:00:36.660]  people like pierce Morgan that's a pure mercenary so I've noticed pierce Morgan
[2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:40.260]  last few months sounds like alex jones on almost every subject that's because he
[2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:44.820]  has no audience and has nowhere to go and it's trying to get a job with Fox News
[2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:51.020]  a little birdie told me but up here's Morgan Trump slaying DC elite Hillary
[2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:55.460]  shaking in her Goldman Sachs finance boots well I mean Morgan went in and
[2:00:55.460 --> 2:01:00.300]  took over Larry King's show that had declined because of the rest of CNN's
[2:01:00.300 --> 2:01:03.300]  programming but still had four million viewers on good nights two million
[2:01:03.300 --> 2:01:07.260]  regularly and brought it down to about 300,000 his biggest night ever was when
[2:01:07.260 --> 2:01:11.020]  I was on he had highest ratings for two weeks after that was a like the death
[2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:14.340]  star blowing up it looks bigger but it's actually blown up that's a dead cat
[2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:19.300]  bounce and so now he comes out and tries to sound like alex jones and people
[2:01:19.300 --> 2:01:23.780]  all report on it because you see they have to to have any pertinence to be in
[2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:27.380]  the game this is called changing the culture from within it's called
[2:01:27.380 --> 2:01:34.260]  dominating it's called berserking you know I'm not a of the school of gonzo
[2:01:34.260 --> 2:01:37.880]  journalism to try to make myself a story but when you are in the school of
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:42.460]  berserk journalism and truth journalism you will become the story you will
[2:01:42.460 --> 2:01:45.940]  become the narrative you will become the culture you will become the
[2:01:45.940 --> 2:01:50.660]  civilization you will become the planet you will become the future you will
[2:01:50.660 --> 2:01:54.580]  become the victory you will become the success because nothing succeeds like
[2:01:54.580 --> 2:02:00.300]  success and they've tried and tried they had full control but their attempt to
[2:02:00.300 --> 2:02:06.340]  knock out any resistance their attempt to kill any final embers of humanity
[2:02:06.340 --> 2:02:13.300]  will and is the undoing of the global system so we'll take your calls with
[2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:16.740]  Wayne Madsen at the bottom of the hour if you'd like to queue up linebacker
[2:02:16.740 --> 2:02:22.980]  linebacker operation operation goblin possum toll-free number that doesn't
[2:02:22.980 --> 2:02:27.820]  have any secret meeting I'm just being so silly I was just thinking about
[2:02:27.820 --> 2:02:33.900]  lineback use the embodiment of the like a staypuff marshmallow man like a fake
[2:02:33.900 --> 2:02:39.220]  rubber android body and really it's just some like computer program of like a
[2:02:39.220 --> 2:02:44.700]  obnoxious frat leader or something trying to act arrogant for a beta male
[2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:50.100]  trying to act dominant is what we're dealing with their true alpha males are
[2:02:50.100 --> 2:02:53.180]  seething with energy and aggression and intelligence to points they can't even
[2:02:53.180 --> 2:02:59.940]  control it so there's guts metaphorically snapping like giant salt
[2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:08.500]  water crocodile jaws constantly trying to govern the tectonic volcanic forces
[2:03:08.500 --> 2:03:14.900]  of white hot magma spewing into the galaxy and then there's a little piggy
[2:03:14.900 --> 2:03:19.100]  eyed wimps that get together little piggy piggy clubs and try to piggy and
[2:03:19.100 --> 2:03:28.780]  slime around and go we decide the election you don't have any power I mean
[2:03:28.780 --> 2:03:34.820]  that's who these people are floating around just little little little little
[2:03:34.820 --> 2:03:42.500]  little tics stopping alright I'm sorry let's go to break that with another club
[2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:45.580]  I'm gonna come back with the whole cold story that's so important and then I'm
[2:03:45.580 --> 2:03:53.060]  gonna get to our next guest this is a Trump on the radical Muslims pouring in
[2:03:53.060 --> 2:03:57.540]  destroying Europe here it is do you still believe that Muslims hit pause
[2:03:57.540 --> 2:04:03.020]  another nobody beta male want to be elitist you know do you still believe
[2:04:03.020 --> 2:04:10.060]  just do you still like you're so pathetic looky you still act you so
[2:04:10.060 --> 2:04:16.860]  pathetic after you're defeated Dale Earnhardt you just want another major
[2:04:16.860 --> 2:04:24.100]  race Daytona you still think you still you still here let's go to that here it
[2:04:24.100 --> 2:04:27.660]  is do you still believe that Muslims should be banned from entering the
[2:04:27.660 --> 2:04:31.260]  country until we can figure out what's going on as you've said we have to be
[2:04:31.260 --> 2:04:35.260]  very vigilant we have to find out exactly what's going on we have some major
[2:04:35.260 --> 2:04:39.260]  major problems and nobody wants to talk about it we have a president that won't
[2:04:39.260 --> 2:04:43.820]  mention the term radical Islamic terrorism he won't even mention it even
[2:04:43.820 --> 2:04:48.220]  though it's obvious that some terrible things are happening and we have to be
[2:04:48.220 --> 2:04:52.580]  extremely careful and we have to be vigilant yes we have to find out what
[2:04:52.580 --> 2:04:56.300]  the hell is going on so that proposal stands out about it general election
[2:04:56.300 --> 2:04:59.940]  assuming you make it that far blue back stay with us that guy's not that
[2:04:59.940 --> 2:05:02.780]  negative reporter I should be something it was Thomas Jefferson who once said
[2:05:02.780 --> 2:05:06.100]  that our country is now taking so steady of course as to show by what rodeo will
[2:05:06.100 --> 2:05:09.660]  pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then
[2:05:09.660 --> 2:05:13.220]  corruption it's necessary consequence Jefferson was warning us about the
[2:05:13.220 --> 2:05:17.020]  global elite the 1% of the 1% consolidating the world's wealth and
[2:05:17.020 --> 2:05:20.220]  subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't
[2:05:20.220 --> 2:05:23.980]  heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society which were treated
[2:05:23.980 --> 2:05:27.300]  as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment
[2:05:27.300 --> 2:05:30.500]  political office no longer represents the voice of the people but rather the
[2:05:30.500 --> 2:05:34.060]  initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the
[2:05:34.060 --> 2:05:37.980]  aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture
[2:05:37.980 --> 2:05:41.340]  yet we're suppressed by tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that
[2:05:41.340 --> 2:05:44.340]  operate governments around the world we falsely believe that everything is
[2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:48.020]  simply black and white one extreme against the other conservative versus
[2:05:48.020 --> 2:05:51.540]  liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as Thomas
[2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:54.940]  Jefferson also said in light of the people generally and tyranny and
[2:05:54.940 --> 2:05:58.100]  oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of

[2:08:33.100 --> 2:08:39.980]  getting clear past is gone
[2:08:41.220 --> 2:08:47.640]  isn't donald trump's hair ridiculous but it's original he's proud of it he
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:53.100]  likes it it's confident so people love it I do too I'm jealous of his hair
[2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:57.540]  there's a conspiracy theory that's actually an alien entity from another
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:01.580]  planet that is infesting and sitting on top of his head that's not here at all
[2:09:01.580 --> 2:09:05.940]  we're seeing an alien invasion in front of our very eyes
[2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:10.740]  do you think about that if you believe that you believe Obamacare doesn't have
[2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:16.660]  death panels and you can keep your doctor if you believe that you believe
[2:09:16.660 --> 2:09:21.780]  Hillary doesn't want to bankrupt big coal that means increase your prices
[2:09:21.780 --> 2:09:26.260]  and screw over all the hundreds of thousands of coal related jobs in this
[2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:28.620]  country
[2:09:32.220 --> 2:09:42.180]  that's one of the songs right here I have lived and learned from fools and
[2:09:42.180 --> 2:09:47.180]  from sages that is so well written by Aerosmith that's not Aerosmith singing
[2:09:47.180 --> 2:09:55.680]  in its Ronnie James but that is important because you learn from fools
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:10:01.220]  and from sages all right let me get reset here and get focused as we're
[2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:08.380]  live we got Wayne Madsen coming up in five minutes it's incredible but see the
[2:10:08.380 --> 2:10:11.660]  globalist moving our jobs to India Mexico China and a hundred other plus
[2:10:11.660 --> 2:10:15.580]  third world countries to see the Bush family soar over Trump certainly won't
[2:10:15.580 --> 2:10:18.940]  support him that is a godsend who wants a bunch of war criminals world
[2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:23.580]  government globalist the daddy Bush that moved our jobs to China first made
[2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:26.940]  the deal with them back when he was ambassador to China probably a Chinese
[2:10:26.940 --> 2:10:31.700]  communist double agent he was the first US ambassador to China once relations
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:35.940]  were opened this is amazing and now they've shot off over a thousand of our
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:41.180]  coal power plants Obama said he'd bankrupt coal and the media runs around
[2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:44.380]  saying he never said that that's their goal that's their plan because it
[2:10:44.380 --> 2:10:48.940]  competes with all the other energy giants it lowers prices and if other folks
[2:10:48.940 --> 2:10:53.780]  have cheap energy what will they do out compete us no one will develop here
[2:10:53.780 --> 2:10:57.140]  build here because of that but don't worry as long as they keep that in place
[2:10:57.140 --> 2:11:01.500]  Hillary and the bushes and all them get good deals so along comes Trump he says
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:05.940]  hey I'll forget the carbon taxes forget shutting down our plants I won't do it
[2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:09.140]  forget these unfair trade deals forget the tariffs I'm not gonna do it and they
[2:11:09.140 --> 2:11:15.260]  say racist the communist Chinese so let's play a clip of Hillary quote we're
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:19.620]  going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business now she
[2:11:19.620 --> 2:11:23.500]  claims she meant to say that to warn people even though her policies are
[2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:29.740]  shut it all down here it is I'm the only candidate which has a policy about how
[2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:34.420]  to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key it's
[2:11:34.420 --> 2:11:39.300]  going to cold country because we're gonna put a lot of coal miners and coal
[2:11:39.300 --> 2:11:44.580]  companies out of business right Tim and we're gonna make it clear that we don't
[2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:49.380]  want to forget those people those people labored in those mines for
[2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:54.180]  generations losing their health often losing their lives turn on our lights
[2:11:54.180 --> 2:11:57.740]  and power so that's the spin we're gonna give you windmills and scams that
[2:11:57.740 --> 2:12:00.740]  bankrupted Spain other areas of the United States as well things that
[2:12:00.740 --> 2:12:04.700]  mentally don't work but but but the boondoggle works the billions per
[2:12:04.700 --> 2:12:09.900]  project given to the little insiders those work very very nicely so she's
[2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:12.820]  acting like here I'm gonna chop your legs off here's some crutches but but
[2:12:12.820 --> 2:12:16.820]  Obama was very very clear as candidate Obama three months before he was elected
[2:12:16.820 --> 2:12:22.180]  president in this clip of what the main game plan was here it is so if somebody
[2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:25.940]  wants to build a coal power plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them
[2:12:25.940 --> 2:12:31.780]  because they're gonna be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:36.140]  being emitted and who makes the carbon money who's on the Chicago mercantile
[2:12:36.140 --> 2:12:41.740]  he's set to make billions himself talk about racketeering now let's get to the
[2:12:41.740 --> 2:12:46.860]  new clips here because now the coal miners are coming after her we've got
[2:12:46.860 --> 2:12:49.380]  three of these clips and we're going to Wayne Madsen but but this is what's
[2:12:49.380 --> 2:12:52.780]  really happening and again a lot of folks go well I don't care if coal gets
[2:12:52.780 --> 2:12:56.860]  bankrupt there's enough coal for a thousand years in our current rate here
[2:12:56.860 --> 2:13:00.060]  that's been discovered it burns completely clean in the scrubbers
[2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:05.060]  nothing comes out and all the byproducts can be used to make steel and other
[2:13:05.060 --> 2:13:14.580]  alloys nothing goes to waste coal is magic good but this country doesn't have
[2:13:14.580 --> 2:13:17.580]  one lead smelting plant you can say that's toxic you need it for a lot of
[2:13:17.580 --> 2:13:20.620]  different things don't worry all the bullets can be made in China now but
[2:13:20.620 --> 2:13:25.460]  Obama can sign an order banning the importation of bullets see oh outside of
[2:13:25.460 --> 2:13:31.460]  law but he's the president shrug of the pin law of the land kind of cool huh yeah
[2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:34.860]  kind of cool if you're at all Hitler want to be let's go to this next clip of
[2:13:34.860 --> 2:13:39.100]  the coal miners what they have to say about her hitlery she said and she did
[2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:42.060]  not make it a secret that she is going to continue with the policies of the past
[2:13:42.060 --> 2:13:45.260]  seven and a half years and expand upon there's no other way to perceive that
[2:13:45.260 --> 2:13:50.660]  pure simple we are doomed feel like she was basically just having this in the
[2:13:50.660 --> 2:13:54.020]  back I mean how can you say that you're going to put this all out of work the
[2:13:54.020 --> 2:13:57.260]  co-cultures bankrupt the co-cultures and come here and lie to our face the way
[2:13:57.260 --> 2:14:01.500]  she did I I have nothing for and as a matter of fact I agree with our mayor
[2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:06.020]  she can just stay out both plans can stay out of our state and that's because
[2:14:06.020 --> 2:14:08.740]  the clubs are there she's down coming said I didn't mean that you're gonna
[2:14:08.740 --> 2:14:13.620]  have your coal jobs don't worry see that's spending work I'm gonna shut you
[2:14:13.620 --> 2:14:19.380]  down and give you a job at one of the windmills yeah we bet you are those
[2:14:19.380 --> 2:14:22.380]  companies are all far and owned it's all about screwing the American worker
[2:14:22.380 --> 2:14:26.420]  because we were too uppity we had guns they want to make us dependent this is
[2:14:26.420 --> 2:14:30.460]  a 60 year project to make us dependent and dumb us down and hadn't they done a
[2:14:30.460 --> 2:14:34.700]  great job here's another one coal miner confront Hillary face-to-face here it is
[2:14:34.700 --> 2:14:39.140]  I just want to know how you can say you will put a lot of coal miners out of
[2:14:39.140 --> 2:14:44.180]  out of jobs and they come in here and tell us how you're gonna be our friend
[2:14:44.180 --> 2:14:51.620]  because those people out there don't see you as a friend I know that and you
[2:14:51.620 --> 2:14:57.940]  know I'm I don't know how to explain it other than what I said was totally out of
[2:14:57.940 --> 2:15:02.100]  context from what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal
[2:15:02.100 --> 2:15:08.900]  country for a very long time and I did put out a plan last summer and it was a
[2:15:08.900 --> 2:15:14.180]  misstatement because what I was saying is that the way things are going now we
[2:15:14.180 --> 2:15:18.060]  will continue to lose jobs that's what I meant to say and I think that that seems
[2:15:18.060 --> 2:15:23.540]  to be supported by the facts I didn't mean that we were going to do it what I
[2:15:23.540 --> 2:15:29.300]  said was that is going to happen unless we take action to try to help and
[2:15:29.300 --> 2:15:36.220]  prevent it so I don't I don't mind anybody being upset or angry that's a
[2:15:36.220 --> 2:15:42.220]  perfect right for people to feel that way I'm a little bit sad and sorry that I
[2:15:42.220 --> 2:15:46.900]  gave folks the reason or the excuse to be so upset with me because that is not
[2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:50.980]  what I intended shut her up I mean look at that evil sincerity that witch I mean
[2:15:50.980 --> 2:15:54.460]  police child come get in the car I got free candy I mean that is a vampire
[2:15:54.460 --> 2:15:58.300]  chain get in the car get in the car put the handcuffs on I'm Ted Bundy you're

[2:16:13.980 --> 2:16:21.220]  the Balkans I mean in a crowd of evil people she's one of the worst ever but
[2:16:21.220 --> 2:16:24.580]  she comes out and says we're getting rid of coal they've since that they've shut
[2:16:24.580 --> 2:16:29.020]  down a thousand plants or more they admit that's their plan she goes that's not
[2:16:29.020 --> 2:16:32.340]  what I meant you're gonna keep your coal and get other stuff no they've been
[2:16:32.340 --> 2:16:36.100]  shutting it down and it's not like they're shutting down something that's
[2:16:36.100 --> 2:16:42.020]  obsolete like whale oil I'm all for them finding other forms of oil or plant oil
[2:16:42.020 --> 2:16:46.500]  to run lanterns and not kill all the whales it's not like you know we got rid
[2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:53.060]  of something that was bad got something good I'd be for progress no coal is the
[2:16:53.060 --> 2:16:56.020]  cheapest thing we got and it's totally clean now with the technology on record
[2:16:56.020 --> 2:17:00.380]  and it's our prices have gone up it's austerity Obama said you can't have a
[2:17:00.380 --> 2:17:03.580]  car can't have air conditioning remember but he's gonna fly around it's
[2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:08.540]  austerity it's slavery it's making you so poor and so dumb down you can't
[2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:13.060]  resist them and they're in a whole other world in a breakaway civilization I
[2:17:13.060 --> 2:17:16.420]  want to get into the big developments on the campaign I want to get into big
[2:17:16.420 --> 2:17:20.420]  breaking news exclusive coke soros insiders attempt to take over from
[2:17:20.420 --> 2:17:24.020]  campaign info wars.com but first getting into Hillary getting into coal
[2:17:24.020 --> 2:17:27.700]  the Lewis the rest of the hour with Wayne Madsen and Wayne Madsen report.com
[2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:33.900]  what is your take on Hillary overall well I'm telling you I mean after the
[2:17:33.900 --> 2:17:42.900]  last several months of of pinpointing issues with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz I'm
[2:17:42.900 --> 2:17:48.660]  and others are refocusing now on Hillary and that's easy because we have a track
[2:17:48.660 --> 2:17:55.180]  record with her but I think it's safe to say that there'll be some other scandals
[2:17:55.180 --> 2:17:59.700]  of people have not heard about we're not talking about the email stuff for or
[2:17:59.700 --> 2:18:05.700]  there you know the other stuff but when she was the first lady and you know she
[2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:10.020]  might have been upset with her husband Bill and his extra curricular affairs
[2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:15.060]  but there's gonna be some focus on her own as first lady well didn't she just
[2:18:15.060 --> 2:18:18.380]  get mad if it was a woman she wanted and was jealous of Bill I mean she would
[2:18:18.380 --> 2:18:21.220]  kind of like two guys getting a fight over her girls what I've been told is
[2:18:21.220 --> 2:18:27.100]  that correct and what she she made a few trips one one in particular I'm
[2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:33.660]  looking at and others in night and October 1998 I just tell people to
[2:18:33.660 --> 2:18:40.500]  stand by for those that expose which are well you did the whole deal looking of
[2:18:40.500 --> 2:18:44.780]  Cruz was connected to JFK we know he was there and the rest of it that's big
[2:18:44.780 --> 2:18:47.620]  national news so much of what you've broken becomes national news and gets
[2:18:47.620 --> 2:18:54.180]  vetted later what else is on your radar well I still think the aftermath of
[2:18:54.180 --> 2:18:59.700]  this cruise leaving the campaign so suddenly after he said we're gonna take
[2:18:59.700 --> 2:19:04.060]  it to California we're gonna take it to Cleveland what I've been told is that
[2:19:04.060 --> 2:19:10.180]  the people associated with the central intelligence agency said to him and
[2:19:10.180 --> 2:19:17.180]  probably the dad too although he's not talking look 53 years later we thought we
[2:19:17.180 --> 2:19:23.340]  had the JFK assassination put to bed and all of a sudden here's the mainstream
[2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:28.140]  media looking at it again in detail I would add you know the same stuff that
[2:19:28.140 --> 2:19:33.620]  district attorney of New Orleans Garrison Jim Garrison was looking at and I
[2:19:33.620 --> 2:19:40.420]  understand they basically said look you know leave this race both stone says
[2:19:40.420 --> 2:19:44.020]  he's talked to some of the other folks that that knew Oswald and that they
[2:19:44.020 --> 2:19:48.700]  said no we knew we knew Ted Cruz's dad he was all part of the crew yeah and
[2:19:48.700 --> 2:19:53.900]  isn't it funny why Raphael Cruz the dad never responded directly because you
[2:19:53.900 --> 2:19:58.140]  know if if he would stay there yeah I mean if somebody says something true you

[2:23:39.580 --> 2:23:44.340]  to the doctor in over 25 years his excuse he simply couldn't afford it he
[2:23:44.340 --> 2:23:48.620]  wasn't a rich man by any means at less than $107 per month liberty on call

[2:24:06.020 --> 2:24:11.580]  it was a month ago that our guest Wayne Madsen first wrote about research and
[2:24:11.580 --> 2:24:21.460]  connections to Ted Cruz's father and the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald since then it's
[2:24:21.460 --> 2:24:25.580]  been in hundreds of newspapers dozens and dozens just dealing with the Roger
[2:24:25.580 --> 2:24:33.100]  Stone interview here yesterday stones can be back on by the way tomorrow this is
[2:24:33.100 --> 2:24:37.140]  your short segment long segments coming up Wayne getting back into this and then
[2:24:37.140 --> 2:24:44.580]  also expanding into the campaign and current developments yeah so let's let's
[2:24:44.580 --> 2:24:53.180]  take this Rafael Cruz Cruz's dad Ted Cruz's dad if if he came out and denied
[2:24:53.180 --> 2:24:58.220]  himself that that was him with Oswald and if he denied he had any association
[2:24:58.220 --> 2:25:01.660]  with Oswald because I've also reported you can look at the interlocking
[2:25:01.660 --> 2:25:06.820]  relationships between Cruz's employer which was his own company then purchased
[2:25:06.820 --> 2:25:12.740]  by Schlumberger oil services company and perm index which was the company owned
[2:25:12.740 --> 2:25:18.420]  by Clay Shaw who was indicted by district attorney Garrison for conspiracy
[2:25:18.420 --> 2:25:23.380]  to kill president Kennedy if it later turned out that all this was verified
[2:25:23.380 --> 2:25:29.140]  guess what he would have just done he would have he would have proved that he
[2:25:29.140 --> 2:25:40.380]  was evading in a capital crime and that's murder it's you know any DA was it
[2:25:40.380 --> 2:25:45.300]  could get standing to indict him either in Texas or Louisiana and the fact that
[2:25:45.300 --> 2:25:53.060]  he may have left for Calgary in 1967 to avoid Jim Garrison subpoena to testify
[2:25:53.060 --> 2:25:57.140]  makes it a federal crime because he crossed international borders and
[2:25:57.140 --> 2:26:01.100]  that's where the FBI comes in I'm not saying anything like this would happen
[2:26:01.100 --> 2:26:05.380]  but he was certainly leaving this I mean look you come out and say this a
[2:26:05.380 --> 2:26:10.140]  month ago it gets some traction I can see him still not responding but once it
[2:26:10.140 --> 2:26:14.180]  was Donald Trump saying it for weeks and it being a huge story why did he come
[2:26:14.180 --> 2:26:18.500]  out and just say see these cooks are nuts this is wrong yeah I bet after he
[2:26:18.500 --> 2:26:22.780]  talked to his son Teddy talked to his attorney and his attorney said you best
[2:26:22.780 --> 2:26:27.100]  not say anything that's my advice because anything you say that's proven
[2:26:27.100 --> 2:26:31.700]  wrong you you're liable for criminal prosecution listen when you hear
[2:26:31.700 --> 2:26:34.860]  crickets on something like this if you were wrong and you're not saying this
[2:26:34.860 --> 2:26:37.540]  is what happened you just said it there's some evidence we should look at
[2:26:37.540 --> 2:26:41.980]  there's there's there's something going on over here maybe nothing you know the
[2:26:41.980 --> 2:26:45.780]  Sun came up this morning maybe nothing either and then now nothing but crickets
[2:26:45.780 --> 2:26:49.860]  that really tells us something yeah and this afternoon I'll be sending two
[2:26:49.860 --> 2:26:54.740]  FOIA requests off to the Central Intelligence Agency asking for all
[2:26:54.740 --> 2:27:00.860]  correspondence all information all documents on both Rafael B Cruz Jr. that's
[2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:07.100]  the father but also Rafael B Cruz Sr. the grandfather who worked for a radio
[2:27:07.100 --> 2:27:13.540]  corporation of America RCA in Cuba a well-known US intelligence conduit in the
[2:27:13.540 --> 2:27:17.900]  early 50s so I'm asking on everything they have on both the father and the
[2:27:17.900 --> 2:27:23.340]  grandfather and the grandfather from the time the CIA was created in 1947 to the
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:27.500]  present time to include any correspondence within the last couple of
[2:27:27.500 --> 2:27:31.460]  weeks because of the Donald Trump well that's what he's making investigative
[2:27:31.460 --> 2:27:37.100]  journalist files frame of information at request on Cruz family CIA ties that's
[2:27:37.100 --> 2:27:42.180]  pretty important yeah of course I've got all kinds of pending FOIA requests out
[2:27:42.180 --> 2:27:46.780]  to various agencies and of course you know now they don't feel like they even
[2:27:46.780 --> 2:27:50.500]  have to respond they're getting away with violating the Freedom of Information
[2:27:50.500 --> 2:27:57.060]  Act of 1966 as amended over the years because they know they can get away with
[2:27:57.060 --> 2:28:01.860]  it so I'll be lucky to get any kind of response let me shift gears out of that
[2:28:01.860 --> 2:28:06.580]  and then two minutes we've got we got a break and come back in the long segment
[2:28:06.580 --> 2:28:10.460]  what's the battle space right now how are things going from Soros to Clinton
[2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:13.820]  camps and others looks to me like all over the world stuff's not going too well
[2:28:13.820 --> 2:28:21.100]  yeah you know I would I Donald Trump now is a very critical decision to make on
[2:28:21.100 --> 2:28:25.940]  who he runs with remember what Ronald Reagan never wanted to pick George HW
[2:28:25.940 --> 2:28:30.500]  Bush as his running mate he didn't like him he didn't like the Rockefeller
[2:28:30.500 --> 2:28:35.580]  Trilateral Commission elites that he was associated with and you know what 10
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:41.740]  years I mean this 10 10 weeks after he was inaugurated in 1981 a family friend
[2:28:41.740 --> 2:28:48.460]  of the Bush family takes a shot at him almost kills him and I I would really
[2:28:48.460 --> 2:28:54.780]  caution mr. Trump to be very very careful who he picks there's rumors about
[2:28:54.780 --> 2:29:00.300]  Newt Gingrich look Newt Gingrich he's owned and operated by Sheldon Adelson
[2:29:00.300 --> 2:29:05.500]  who funded his last campaign for president in 2012 there's talk about
[2:29:05.500 --> 2:29:09.820]  some others sure they've had Gingrich from the start right up next to him
[2:29:09.820 --> 2:29:13.620]  playing nice that's their inside guy I hope Trump is smart enough not to pull
[2:29:13.620 --> 2:29:21.780]  that move yeah he would do well to avoid these political insiders and go for
[2:29:21.780 --> 2:29:27.260]  somebody outside of Washington perhaps with you know executive governor
[2:29:27.260 --> 2:29:32.420]  governor experience and there's a wealth of Republican governors who fairly kept
[2:29:32.420 --> 2:29:35.340]  their nose clean certainly not people what do you think about him like a war
[2:29:35.340 --> 2:29:39.700]  hero a general or something not good he needs that he needs to get somebody with
[2:29:39.700 --> 2:29:44.700]  some government experience and like I say there's there's a ample number of
[2:29:44.700 --> 2:29:49.860]  those who are you know I have good ratings well stay there give us your
[2:29:49.860 --> 2:29:56.460]  astute observations Wayne stay with us fires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[2:29:56.460 --> 2:29:59.460]  radio network
[2:29:59.460 --> 2:30:06.260]  Joe Bix here with info wars.com today I want to talk to you about guns why we
[2:30:06.260 --> 2:30:10.380]  have them why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them and
[2:30:10.380 --> 2:30:14.820]  why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against
[2:30:14.820 --> 2:30:19.020]  it in the press I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second
[2:30:19.020 --> 2:30:23.020]  Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment this
[2:30:23.020 --> 2:30:28.020]  may be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[2:30:28.020 --> 2:30:32.980]  outdated dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Red
[2:30:32.980 --> 2:30:39.260]  Coats no it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776 the
[2:30:39.260 --> 2:30:42.820]  original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the
[2:30:42.820 --> 2:30:47.740]  constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the Bill of Rights came to us
[2:30:47.740 --> 2:30:52.540]  with blinders on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not
[2:30:52.540 --> 2:30:57.540]  just the rights of actors or editors or reporters but extends even to those we

[2:33:15.020 --> 2:33:18.020]  the resistance
[2:33:29.620 --> 2:33:34.620]  what mother music is this? I'll place it then
[2:33:34.620 --> 2:33:47.420]  now I didn't choose this this is not my mother music I don't care I just want to
[2:33:47.420 --> 2:33:55.540]  know this is not my we need that song I believe my soul's on fire I tell you
[2:33:55.540 --> 2:33:59.780]  folks there is so much going on in this world so much unfolding so much
[2:33:59.780 --> 2:34:03.980]  happening I'm your host Alex Jones I've studied history I'm not a rocket
[2:34:03.980 --> 2:34:08.580]  science major but you can clearly see we're going into a very decadent cycle
[2:34:08.580 --> 2:34:12.580]  right now the elites are so arrogant they believe that voting doesn't even
[2:34:12.580 --> 2:34:16.660]  exist they think they can steal our pension funds raid our bank accounts
[2:34:16.660 --> 2:34:23.620]  bring in foreigners to be Balkanization counterweights to us and play us off
[2:34:23.620 --> 2:34:27.020]  against each other I'm not against these other humans but I'm against the
[2:34:27.020 --> 2:34:30.820]  brainwashing they've been under and how they're being set up as an enemy how
[2:34:30.820 --> 2:34:35.660]  they're being set up as a deindustrializer how they're being set up to destroy the
[2:34:35.660 --> 2:34:42.660]  very fragile remnants of a middle class we have that is a stairway for the poor
[2:34:42.660 --> 2:34:50.020]  into wealth we're going into the agenda 21 post-industrial system based on
[2:34:50.020 --> 2:34:54.060]  poverty based on control based on global elites and combines their tax
[2:34:54.060 --> 2:34:59.340]  exempt and above the law the ultimate form of dissent of discrimination and
[2:34:59.340 --> 2:35:02.380]  that's why I'm here fighting as hard as I can with other great researchers and
[2:35:02.380 --> 2:35:06.100]  journals to just folks that are pro-human and believe in a level playing
[2:35:06.100 --> 2:35:10.860]  field and believe in industry and free will and free market and free
[2:35:10.860 --> 2:35:18.460]  association of every race color creed region religion whatever as long as you
[2:35:18.460 --> 2:35:25.540]  want basic freedom I stand for you and with you the problem is there's a lot of
[2:35:25.540 --> 2:35:30.300]  folks in the establishment a lot of people in the grassroots that believe
[2:35:30.300 --> 2:35:36.180]  in government and success by conquest and that always degenerates and implodes
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:39.380]  we're going back to Wayne Madsen Wayne Madsen report.com here in just a moment

[2:37:33.740 --> 2:37:38.420]  at the heart of what we're doing Wayne I don't know your view on this I want to
[2:37:38.420 --> 2:37:41.460]  find out now I mean clearly I mean you know about the stuff going on in the
[2:37:41.460 --> 2:37:45.700]  world why are elites running around digging into redouts moving to New
[2:37:45.700 --> 2:37:50.100]  Zealand saying it ready for collapse moving armored vehicles around buying
[2:37:50.100 --> 2:37:53.980]  massive amounts of riot control gear I mean it's all over the news billions of
[2:37:53.980 --> 2:37:58.420]  rounds more of bullets saying the patriots of their enemy Europe arresting
[2:37:58.420 --> 2:38:01.900]  nationalist party members that aren't racist at all but even they were races
[2:38:01.900 --> 2:38:05.900]  shouldn't be arrested you know free speech what are the preparations for what
[2:38:05.900 --> 2:38:10.140]  do you think the establishments tricks are up their sleeves and obviously there
[2:38:10.140 --> 2:38:14.540]  are different camps of the establishment how does it all tie into the
[2:38:14.540 --> 2:38:17.900]  failed bid to overthrow Syria what's happening with Russia kind of a big
[2:38:17.900 --> 2:38:21.580]  picture look of where the world is because the Pentagon says we've never
[2:38:21.580 --> 2:38:25.260]  been in a more dangerous position I tend to agree Obama says the economy's
[2:38:25.260 --> 2:38:28.780]  never been better and the world is absolutely stable and wonderful and the
[2:38:28.780 --> 2:38:34.620]  moon is made of Swiss cheese well I think what they're concerned about is what
[2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:40.260]  happened in this country with Donald Trump basically overthrowing the
[2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:46.420]  Republican establishment and Bernie Sanders attempting to overthrow with
[2:38:46.420 --> 2:38:50.620]  some success the Democratic establishment that coupled with Boris
[2:38:50.620 --> 2:38:56.220]  Johnson who's pushing against the Britain remaining in the EU and if they
[2:38:56.220 --> 2:39:01.060]  vote to exit the EU that's the end of Cameron and that's the beginning of a
[2:39:01.060 --> 2:39:06.020]  Boris Johnson Prime Minister ship the transatlantic trade and investment
[2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:11.340]  partnership is dead because the French had basically said nothing doing we're
[2:39:11.340 --> 2:39:18.780]  pulling out and so look all these constructs the Trans Pacific partnership
[2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:23.060]  is in trouble the Prime Minister of Japan said oh we're not going to do
[2:39:23.060 --> 2:39:26.500]  anything on that until after our elections because his popularity is
[2:39:26.500 --> 2:39:31.180]  plummeting because of that the world the world is waking up to these trade
[2:39:31.180 --> 2:39:36.980]  agreements and this tent to whittle away at national sovereignty and and and who
[2:39:36.980 --> 2:39:40.340]  was the first leader to say I don't have anything to do with this stuff was
[2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:45.020]  Vladimir Putin in Russia and let me just interrupt you because what you're
[2:39:45.020 --> 2:39:48.980]  saying is so historic so cogent that's why we imagine it's so amazing he just
[2:39:48.980 --> 2:39:51.220]  boiled it all down because I'm thinking of all these different angles he says
[2:39:51.220 --> 2:39:54.460]  look global government's in trouble unelected corporate world government is
[2:39:54.460 --> 2:39:58.420]  on the run everywhere they went too far it's imploding on the verge of collapse
[2:39:58.420 --> 2:40:02.060]  and so they're openly saying let's get ready to take up with the media
[2:40:02.060 --> 2:40:05.140]  internet regional kill switches Zuckerberg meeting with the communist
[2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:09.940]  Chinese admitting that beta testing it getting ready to try to jump you know
[2:40:09.940 --> 2:40:13.900]  off the cliff here with us off the high dive as if they'll get away with it you
[2:40:13.900 --> 2:40:17.740]  guys couldn't even get away with stealing the election I think they're
[2:40:17.740 --> 2:40:22.420]  desperate as you just said undoubtedly and they've miscalculated but so many
[2:40:22.420 --> 2:40:27.460]  times historically megalomaniacs go all the way when cornered that's my
[2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:31.620]  concern so a what do you think they'll do flesh it out more great points you
[2:40:31.620 --> 2:40:37.500]  just made and B what happens if they go ahead and double down and go crazy what
[2:40:37.500 --> 2:40:40.060]  could that meltdown look like and of course I should give the number out
[2:40:40.060 --> 2:40:45.820]  800 259 92 31 to talk to Wayne Madsen gotta give the number out eight thanks
[2:40:45.820 --> 2:40:51.820]  for reminding me John 800 259 92 31 Wayne please continue with that incredible
[2:40:51.820 --> 2:40:57.420]  analysis well I'll tell you look I mean they can't rig enough elections now
[2:40:57.420 --> 2:41:02.700]  because too many people are voting against the status quo and you know
[2:41:02.700 --> 2:41:08.060]  they'll try in in in the UK look Obama was over there basically interfering in
[2:41:08.060 --> 2:41:12.300]  now two of their elections the referendum on Scottish independence he
[2:41:12.300 --> 2:41:15.900]  said it's better for Scotland to stay in the UK and I recently went over there
[2:41:15.900 --> 2:41:20.740]  says best for the UK to stay in EU people in Scotland don't want to be part of
[2:41:20.740 --> 2:41:24.420]  the UK and the people in the UK don't want to be part of the EU but he's over
[2:41:24.420 --> 2:41:27.340]  there because he represents time is on our side even though they block
[2:41:27.340 --> 2:41:31.660]  Catalonia divided like 90% they say no you can't well yeah they are I mean
[2:41:31.660 --> 2:41:35.780]  almost every person's against it bye bye and then absolutely Scotland what like
[2:41:35.780 --> 2:41:39.700]  70% were against it still didn't pass so so you're kind of predicting the
[2:41:39.700 --> 2:41:44.780]  Brexit will be a fraud as well what I'm being what I'm being told is at this
[2:41:44.780 --> 2:41:49.580]  point time but that if that's a fair election over there the British electorate
[2:41:49.580 --> 2:41:53.420]  will vote to leave the European Union and then it's and then it's curtains for
[2:41:53.420 --> 2:41:58.420]  that organization because there's other countries waiting to leave to primarily
[2:41:58.420 --> 2:42:03.100]  Austria Greece already got a taste of that they can get rid of their sorrows
[2:42:03.100 --> 2:42:07.940]  influence well so what's the next domino to fall once that happens well I mean I
[2:42:07.940 --> 2:42:12.740]  think well we'll see they will see the EU come to an end I think we'll see the
[2:42:12.740 --> 2:42:17.180]  end of the open borders essentially that's already happened with Merkel's
[2:42:17.180 --> 2:42:22.300]  invasion by these Muslim refugees of Europe but also coming in with that
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:28.180]  crowd as a bunch of Islamic State terrorists and this is where I say you
[2:42:28.180 --> 2:42:32.700]  know Trump really has to be careful who he picks as his vice president right now
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:37.660]  I would say he should pick a woman a governor or maybe an ex-governor and Mary
[2:42:37.660 --> 2:42:42.540]  Fallon of Oklahoma is very high on his list and former governor Jan Brewer of
[2:42:42.540 --> 2:42:47.620]  Arizona's high on his list because Hillary is going to use all that stuff
[2:42:47.620 --> 2:42:51.660]  if he doesn't pick a woman he's stupid and I don't think he's stupid if he
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:54.660]  doesn't pick a good one a lot of great candidates a lot of qualified women if he
[2:42:54.660 --> 2:42:59.700]  doesn't it really shows that he's a ringer which I don't think Trump is right
[2:42:59.700 --> 2:43:05.660]  I so I you know he could pick Christy but the problem there is it's not like
[2:43:05.660 --> 2:43:10.700]  Clinton picking Al Gore neighboring states Arkansas, Tennessee, Al Gore spent
[2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:15.460]  very little time in Tennessee he grew up in DC Christy's right across the Hudson
[2:43:15.460 --> 2:43:19.580]  River in New Jersey that's not a geographical balance he needs geographical
[2:43:19.580 --> 2:43:23.540]  balance Oklahoma and Arizona would provide that especially in
[2:43:23.540 --> 2:43:28.220]  Arizona with this issue with the border would be very very good for him I
[2:43:28.220 --> 2:43:33.940]  mean if I were advising him I'd say look at failing or look at Brewer but you
[2:43:33.940 --> 2:43:38.900]  know that's up to him great points getting back to Putin and some phone
[2:43:38.900 --> 2:43:43.780]  calls 800 2 5 at 9 9 2 3 1 folks your chance to talk to Wayne Madsen's a few
[2:43:43.780 --> 2:43:49.580]  of those calls coming up say what you want about Putin but it's kind of like
[2:43:49.580 --> 2:43:53.740]  Trump said he said oh he's killed people show me the proof they just say that and
[2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:57.380]  then nine times out of ten it turns out to be some globalist foundation killing
[2:43:57.380 --> 2:44:01.900]  somebody and doing a false flag the truth is Putin said carbon tax is a
[2:44:01.900 --> 2:44:05.540]  global government fraud we're not gonna teach people to break down the family
[2:44:05.540 --> 2:44:10.780]  we're gonna cut taxes he's going after corruption in all their states and he's
[2:44:10.780 --> 2:44:14.980]  very very popular 80 plus percent so they've got a major problem on their
[2:44:14.980 --> 2:44:19.540]  hands he's the opposite of the dictator he's super star popular and he's
[2:44:19.540 --> 2:44:24.180]  criticizing the corrupt you know elites the oligarchs that have seized us
[2:44:24.180 --> 2:44:30.460]  that's basically what Trump is doing and it scares the daylights out of them so
[2:44:30.460 --> 2:44:34.580]  wow what happens to the New World Order if Trump turns out to win and is for
[2:44:34.580 --> 2:44:38.900]  real and the boy you're gonna see major power structures trying to start a new
[2:44:38.900 --> 2:44:44.180]  fight yeah if you if you could foresee a Trump administration abort Prime
[2:44:44.180 --> 2:44:49.620]  Minister Boris Johnson and in Britain and Putin remaining in Russia you're
[2:44:49.620 --> 2:44:54.020]  gonna see a different world entirely all these international structures that
[2:44:54.020 --> 2:44:59.620]  whittle away at national sovereignty are gonna come to an end I think NATO will
[2:44:59.620 --> 2:45:06.460]  be you know people wake up and realize that that's nothing more than a
[2:45:06.460 --> 2:45:12.220]  contrivance to get European countries to buy weapons expensive weapons systems
[2:45:12.220 --> 2:45:16.580]  from the United States that's why it existed and as far as you know Russian
[2:45:16.580 --> 2:45:21.100]  aircraft doing barrel rolls over US spy planes what do you expect when you got a
[2:45:21.100 --> 2:45:27.100]  US series of US spy planes flying near the Kaliningrad Russian naval base in
[2:45:27.100 --> 2:45:31.580]  a Baltic all they're doing are getting close to see watch the Russians fire up
[2:45:31.580 --> 2:45:35.060]  their radar these are called ferret missions so they can collect all the
[2:45:35.060 --> 2:45:39.060]  electronic intelligence and communications and then try to break the
[2:45:39.060 --> 2:45:43.300]  encryption codes of course the Russians are gonna react negatively to that just
[2:45:43.300 --> 2:45:49.540]  as we would if a Russian planes flew off of Norfolk Virginia or off of San
[2:45:49.540 --> 2:45:53.860]  Diego California can you imagine if Russian jets were flying like five
[2:45:53.860 --> 2:45:57.460]  miles off the US coast what would happen complete connection fits doing more
[2:45:57.460 --> 2:46:02.660]  than barrel rolls on and would be shooting them down Trump Trump thinks
[2:46:02.660 --> 2:46:05.620]  he's weak on being too friendly to the Russians so he's made this comment about
[2:46:05.620 --> 2:46:09.020]  yeah they don't do what we say shoot them down so I hope the Russians know
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:14.340]  that is rhetoric yeah yeah and he also he also said he can get along he can get
[2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:17.540]  along with Putin and I and you know Putin has indicated he could get along with
[2:46:17.540 --> 2:46:23.020]  the president Trump as far as China you know we've heard various things that you
[2:46:23.020 --> 2:46:27.340]  know Trump says I love the Chinese he's gonna be a lot harder on the trade
[2:46:27.340 --> 2:46:32.580]  issues with them but I don't think he's gonna be rattling sabers by sending US
[2:46:32.580 --> 2:46:37.460]  Navy ships into the South China Sea you know the South China Sea China's in that
[2:46:37.460 --> 2:46:41.660]  name of that thing an ancient Chinese map show that those islands were
[2:46:41.660 --> 2:46:46.980]  historically part of China so I think he'll recognize that fact and and and
[2:46:46.980 --> 2:46:52.980]  stop encouraging countries like the Philippines and and Vietnam and other
[2:46:52.980 --> 2:46:56.820]  countries over there to try to you know ratchet things up the west is clearly
[2:46:56.820 --> 2:47:00.380]  using Vietnam as a chess piece against China not defending the communist
[2:47:00.380 --> 2:47:04.260]  murderers it's just that it's totally sickening to see them trying to stir all
[2:47:04.260 --> 2:47:08.540]  this up I want to go to some phone calls for Wayne Madsen we got George and Jeff
[2:47:08.540 --> 2:47:17.780]  and Dwight Bill and Jason let's go ahead and take a call from Jeff in Canada
[2:47:17.780 --> 2:47:22.700]  you're on the air with Wayne Madsen go ahead good afternoon Alex we are winning
[2:47:22.700 --> 2:47:27.780]  whether Trump gets in the White House or not Trump has definitely said the pace
[2:47:27.780 --> 2:47:32.540]  and we need to continue and accelerate that base Wayne a question for you it's
[2:47:32.540 --> 2:47:40.940]  just the two parts very simple when do you foresee the FBI taking their
[2:47:40.940 --> 2:47:46.620]  investigation a little bit further with Hillary do you foresee the FBI doing
[2:47:46.620 --> 2:47:52.220]  anything before the election because I mean she's caught red-handed and then
[2:47:52.220 --> 2:47:55.180]  still they keep saying well the Justice Department needs to do it well that's
[2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:59.780]  Hillary that's Obama well I don't see the FBI doing anything what that what a
[2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:05.620]  federal judge in DC ruled was that the the group judicial watch well we'll be
[2:48:05.620 --> 2:48:12.300]  able to depose Hillary Clinton and all of her a Tsuma Abedin and others in
[2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:18.780]  this email issue I don't see Comey the FBI director doing he's a political
[2:48:18.780 --> 2:48:23.820]  creature the FBI is not a law enforcement agency it's a political police force
[2:48:23.820 --> 2:48:28.540]  they'll take action when the administration wants them to and when
[2:48:28.540 --> 2:48:31.860]  the Obama administration doesn't want action taken against her former
[2:48:31.860 --> 2:48:37.180]  Secretary of State and to present the Democratic nominee nominee I don't
[2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:40.380]  think you're gonna take any well I agree but it does discredit these
[2:48:40.380 --> 2:48:43.620]  institutions even more when they sit there and do nothing when she's
[2:48:43.620 --> 2:48:50.220]  completely guilty exactly I mean I've had the FBI visiting me recently well
[2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:55.340]  actually over the last year or so year and a half and you know they asked me
[2:48:55.340 --> 2:48:59.220]  about this and I says look if you're after Chinese spies go up to the National
[2:48:59.220 --> 2:49:03.100]  Archives where they're making copies of all the US patents you know don't come
[2:49:03.100 --> 2:49:07.580]  don't come here and you know lean on me for information but you know they're a
[2:49:07.580 --> 2:49:10.580]  political police force you never told I mean I know you've been visited by a lot
[2:49:10.580 --> 2:49:15.100]  of folks and threatened to let's thank you caller good questions you have tell
[2:49:15.100 --> 2:49:22.380]  us about the FBI visit yeah I mean I you know I took I made a trip to Iran a year
[2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:26.660]  and a half ago I was invited to attend a conference there I thought it was a good
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:30.300]  conference I'd never been there before I managed to gain access to the old US
[2:49:30.300 --> 2:49:37.820]  embassy which is almost like it was when it was taken hostage and you know so that
[2:49:37.820 --> 2:49:45.220]  engendered a couple of visits and then because I have been to China I went to
[2:49:45.220 --> 2:49:50.220]  China in 2012 that was another visit and you know there now are they wanting
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:54.500]  info from you or trying to imply you were a bad guy I think both you know it's
[2:49:54.500 --> 2:50:03.380]  good cop bad cop and look the FBI was set up by Jagger Hoover as a intelligence
[2:50:03.380 --> 2:50:08.300]  gathering operation it never had anything to do sure I mean until the 50s
[2:50:08.300 --> 2:50:12.940]  they said organized crime didn't exist yeah because because my Erlansky had the
[2:50:12.940 --> 2:50:18.060]  photo of Jagger Hoover in flagrante delecto with his deputy Clyde Tolstin
[2:50:18.060 --> 2:50:22.100]  at the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami and they have that building in Washington
[2:50:22.100 --> 2:50:25.180]  named it they're gonna move out of that building I understand the new FBI
[2:50:25.180 --> 2:50:31.900]  building won't be named after Jay Jagger Hoover was always on the mob payroll
[2:50:31.900 --> 2:50:37.060]  it's just just crazy yeah I call him Jay well you know we call him Jay Edna
[2:50:37.060 --> 2:50:41.540]  Hoover but you know it's not a big deal that he was a cross dresser that's his
[2:50:41.540 --> 2:50:45.620]  right to do that exactly exactly it's just they use that the blackmailing
[2:50:45.620 --> 2:50:49.180]  absolutely I mean look he was the Caitlyn Jenner of his time I mean you
[2:50:49.180 --> 2:50:52.900]  know they built on it an amazing amazing career shipping drugs into the
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:55.900]  country all right folks we'll be right back final seven more phone calls with

[2:54:46.100 --> 2:54:51.100]  totalitarianism but it's not working it's blowing up in their face big time
[2:54:51.100 --> 2:54:54.780]  let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut George you're on the air
[2:54:54.780 --> 2:55:00.140]  with Wayne Madsen go ahead hi there I'm wondering once we get everything sort of
[2:55:00.140 --> 2:55:03.660]  squared away for Trump and moving in the right direction and we know there's not
[2:55:03.660 --> 2:55:08.260]  much of a chance of backsliding I think we should move on to build a burger as a
[2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:14.540]  major focus and maybe hook up with some of the people in Europe that basically
[2:55:14.540 --> 2:55:19.700]  have been against this anti-immigration stuff that with the with the Muslims in
[2:55:19.700 --> 2:55:24.140]  particular especially in Dresden since sure and point out that it's a
[2:55:24.140 --> 2:55:28.700]  Bilderberg member Peter Southerland and others that engineered opening the
[2:55:28.700 --> 2:55:32.660]  borders merging all the countries together and destroying sovereignty using
[2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:38.860]  him incompatible groups absolutely Wayne Wayne Madsen a lot of sympatic go
[2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:46.780]  groups in Europe that you know distrust these groups like Bilderberg's and you
[2:55:46.780 --> 2:55:51.060]  find them on the on the right and on the left the ones in the center that's
[2:55:51.060 --> 2:55:55.740]  where they get their support and they you know the so-called social Democrats
[2:55:55.740 --> 2:55:59.820]  and Christian Democrats there's not a whole lot of difference between them
[2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:06.460]  they're all controlled by people like Soros and the other people behind the
[2:56:06.460 --> 2:56:13.820]  scenes George anything else one other thing is that since the leader of
[2:56:13.820 --> 2:56:18.060]  a pedigree however you pronounce it correctly is right there at Dresden so
[2:56:18.060 --> 2:56:22.060]  he'd be a good person to coordinate this if we ever got something going there
[2:56:22.060 --> 2:56:25.180]  that's a good idea we should we should you talk to some of the folks over there
[2:56:25.180 --> 2:56:28.900]  about when we go to Germany to you know cover their events and things great
[2:56:28.900 --> 2:56:32.860]  great idea sir thank you speaking of Europe let's go to France let's talk to
[2:56:32.860 --> 2:56:38.700]  Sherri in France Sherri you're on the Irwin Madsen go ahead oh hi hi to Wayne
[2:56:38.700 --> 2:56:45.740]  and to you I'm calling about the vice presidential pick and there is mention
[2:56:45.740 --> 2:56:50.100]  of maybe someone with a military experience but from what you've said
[2:56:50.100 --> 2:56:54.500]  Wayne it would be better someone who has governmental experience and I was
[2:56:54.500 --> 2:57:01.620]  thinking about what what do you think of Susana Martinez the Hispanic governor
[2:57:01.620 --> 2:57:06.540]  from New Mexico just getting much better up and he seemed to think that would be a
[2:57:06.540 --> 2:57:10.780]  good idea and I don't know if it is do you know can you tell us more about
[2:57:10.780 --> 2:57:15.220]  Susana Martinez do you know I think Susana Martinez would be an excellent
[2:57:15.220 --> 2:57:19.220]  choice there's only one problem and it would be used against the ticket if he
[2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:23.820]  chooses her she had a very well publicized incident with public drunkenness
[2:57:23.820 --> 2:57:31.500]  in New Mexico basically was ordering her driver to take her back to her
[2:57:31.500 --> 2:57:36.980]  residence look it's it's stuff like that that is going to be magnified a hundred
[2:57:36.980 --> 2:57:43.180]  times why not go with somebody with a relatively clean record and not somebody
[2:57:43.180 --> 2:57:48.780]  who had a well publicized problem with alcohol well I'm always impressed by how
[2:57:48.780 --> 2:57:52.140]  informed our listeners and our guest art thank you Sherri anything else from
[2:57:52.140 --> 2:57:58.260]  France um yeah just a question another question is if anything should happen to
[2:57:58.260 --> 2:58:04.140]  Trump then he'd need to pick someone who really has the America first in mind
[2:58:04.140 --> 2:58:10.340]  that's a great point that's a great point I think I think based on the fact
[2:58:10.340 --> 2:58:15.580]  that Mary Phelan has been governor for a while she's had a lot of emergencies
[2:58:15.580 --> 2:58:21.220]  national you know state emergencies Jan Brewer on the border with Mexico I think
[2:58:21.220 --> 2:58:25.620]  either one of those could be the first no you're right I'm not for gimmicks but
[2:58:25.620 --> 2:58:29.300]  these are good smart women who have good records and seem like pretty trustworthy
[2:58:29.300 --> 2:58:33.620]  not you know avarice filled people like some of these other guys I think it's
[2:58:33.620 --> 2:58:37.140]  great to counter her gimmick with a woman but not make it a gimmick actually
[2:58:37.140 --> 2:58:40.220]  a good person we'll be back with five more minutes of Wayne then the next

[3:00:50.260 --> 3:00:57.140]  regulations CNBC but this other report out of Reuters as well US jobless claims
[3:00:57.140 --> 3:01:04.420]  rise planned layoffs surge so one concern I have Wayne I'll take a few calls
[3:01:04.420 --> 3:01:07.860]  is Trump gets in they hold the collapse in the west off
[3:01:07.860 --> 3:01:11.780]  until he gets in and then kind of blame nationalism and blame nationalism rising
[3:01:11.780 --> 3:01:15.060]  in Europe with a more nationalist conservative or
[3:01:15.060 --> 3:01:18.820]  non-conservative just common sense person in austria getting elected
[3:01:18.820 --> 3:01:22.740]  what's your take on that yeah well he's gonna have a tough time as president
[3:01:22.740 --> 3:01:26.660]  because he's gonna have a very hostile democratic party
[3:01:26.660 --> 3:01:30.020]  in the congress an hostile republican party for the most
[3:01:30.020 --> 3:01:33.460]  part in congress and you know rose perot had he been elected
[3:01:33.460 --> 3:01:41.380]  in 1992 it had the very same problem and he's going to have to be able to finesse
[3:01:41.380 --> 3:01:46.020]  like no other president has before because he's going to have it
[3:01:46.020 --> 3:01:50.180]  essentially he's going to have two opposition parties in the congress
[3:01:50.180 --> 3:01:54.740]  his own republican party isn't his answer go right to the american people day one
[3:01:54.740 --> 3:01:57.780]  and say look it's the establishment again a bunch of arrogant parties
[3:01:57.780 --> 3:02:01.540]  they've taken control help me well obama's done that he's going around the
[3:02:01.540 --> 3:02:04.340]  white house press corps to directly the american people
[3:02:04.340 --> 3:02:07.860]  and uh you know maybe uh that's one thing uh
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:12.260]  trump can borrow from obama i'd say probably the only thing he ought to
[3:02:12.260 --> 3:02:16.580]  is how he can bypass the the media to go directly to the people
[3:02:16.580 --> 3:02:20.180]  uh but uh yeah he it's going to be very very difficult
[3:02:20.180 --> 3:02:24.260]  he's going to have to also i mentioned a vp thing he's going to have to be very
[3:02:24.260 --> 3:02:27.780]  selective in who he picks for his cabinet because that's where he can
[3:02:27.780 --> 3:02:33.620]  probably bring in people who can uh work with a hostile congress that's right
[3:02:33.620 --> 3:02:37.140]  let's uh talk to uh delight in washington and melin costa rica
[3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:42.500]  delight you're on the air with wane madson yes i was wondering about uh
[3:02:42.500 --> 3:02:47.460]  if those cruise ships uh going back and forth to cuba
[3:02:47.460 --> 3:02:51.220]  might possibly at some point be used to bring
[3:02:51.220 --> 3:02:58.660]  uh cuban soldiers over and also uh if it was even possible for synthia mckinney
[3:02:58.660 --> 3:03:03.460]  to be vice president uh since she's not a republican
[3:03:03.460 --> 3:03:06.100]  sure sure i mean here's i don't really think the cubans are going to invade us
[3:03:06.100 --> 3:03:08.820]  folks the globalists are going to benefit cheap labor and drive our
[3:03:08.820 --> 3:03:12.020]  drive our cost of living now some of our guests have said that and
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:15.220]  you know it's it's it's globalization of our police military to begin with
[3:03:15.220 --> 3:03:18.100]  that's how they take over uh but as for something mechanic you know she's a
[3:03:18.100 --> 3:03:21.620]  really great lady and she's liking donald trump you know all these real people
[3:03:21.620 --> 3:03:24.820]  on the left like trump they see what's happening
[3:03:24.820 --> 3:03:28.180]  yeah synthia is a friend of mine she's been for many years and
[3:03:28.180 --> 3:03:33.620]  i think she'd be an excellent uh vp's pick but uh i think uh you know right
[3:03:33.620 --> 3:03:38.100]  now we see the the republican money people are gonna be in there i i think
[3:03:38.100 --> 3:03:42.500]  synthia uh barring a vp uh pick uh which i don't
[3:03:42.500 --> 3:03:46.260]  think trump is going to do would be a very good secretary of state
[3:03:46.260 --> 3:03:49.700]  what about ron paul uh in there in the treasury of the secretary of state that'd
[3:03:49.700 --> 3:03:53.380]  be wild absolutely i mean treasury ron paul i
[3:03:53.380 --> 3:03:55.940]  think rand paul would be more effective in this
[3:03:55.940 --> 3:03:59.780]  senate as as somebody that can help trump there he's going to need all the
[3:03:59.780 --> 3:04:02.500]  friends he can get i agree let's real fast melin
[3:04:02.500 --> 3:04:06.180]  costa rica real real quick question for wane go ahead
[3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:10.900]  yes wane uh do you think there'll be some attempts on his life during the
[3:04:10.900 --> 3:04:13.940]  campaign or during maybe if he wants to get selected
[3:04:13.940 --> 3:04:16.900]  yeah what's the danger zone is it more now or more later thank you great point
[3:04:16.900 --> 3:04:19.540]  mel i'll tell you that the danger thing for me
[3:04:19.540 --> 3:04:22.660]  was when he was in a debate in houston an old man bush
[3:04:22.660 --> 3:04:26.100]  poppy 41 was sitting in the audience and he did this
[3:04:26.100 --> 3:04:31.860]  you know the thing across the neck uh you know the guy the guy's halfway
[3:04:31.860 --> 3:04:34.260]  senile but i don't think that was an act of
[3:04:34.260 --> 3:04:37.460]  senility i think he was showing his true colors
[3:04:37.460 --> 3:04:40.900]  but trump's got to be very very careful careful especially since
[3:04:40.900 --> 3:04:44.340]  that my source on the marco rubio photos
[3:04:44.340 --> 3:04:48.020]  uh gary welch an attorney and blogger in indianapolis
[3:04:48.020 --> 3:04:51.940]  was uh they say hold on if you couldn't do it i'm punching out
[3:04:51.940 --> 3:04:55.460]  but i want to have you five more minutes with rob do talk about your source i
[3:04:55.460 --> 3:04:58.660]  forgot in indianapolis found dead a few days ago
[3:04:58.660 --> 3:05:02.500]  in a stairwell that is huge stay there wane it was thomas jefferson who once
[3:05:02.500 --> 3:05:05.540]  said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what
[3:05:05.540 --> 3:05:09.620]  rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then
[3:05:09.620 --> 3:05:13.460]  corruption its necessary consequence jefferson was warning us about the global
[3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:16.900]  elite the one percent of the one percent consolidating the world's wealth and
[3:05:16.900 --> 3:05:20.100]  subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't
[3:05:20.100 --> 3:05:22.660]  heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic
[3:05:22.660 --> 3:05:25.700]  society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to
[3:05:25.700 --> 3:05:29.140]  serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents the
[3:05:29.140 --> 3:05:32.420]  voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go
[3:05:32.420 --> 3:05:35.940]  through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people
[3:05:35.940 --> 3:05:39.140]  are responsible for civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny
[3:05:39.140 --> 3:05:42.100]  elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around
[3:05:42.100 --> 3:05:44.260]  the world we falsely believe that everything is
[3:05:44.260 --> 3:05:46.980]  simply black and white one extreme against the other
[3:05:46.980 --> 3:05:50.340]  conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize
[3:05:50.340 --> 3:05:53.460]  this truth as thomas jefferson also said enlighten the people
[3:05:53.460 --> 3:05:56.980]  generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil

[3:07:02.500 --> 3:07:06.180]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry
[3:07:06.180 --> 3:07:10.900]  our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:14.020]  chance to organize and prepare a defense
[3:07:14.020 --> 3:07:19.700]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they
[3:07:19.700 --> 3:07:24.420]  had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[3:07:24.420 --> 3:07:29.460]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[3:07:29.460 --> 3:07:34.340]  to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[3:07:34.340 --> 3:07:38.340]  accelerate our journey towards death i personally counter this
[3:07:38.340 --> 3:07:43.140]  onslaught with anthroplex anthroplex is designed with known
[3:07:43.140 --> 3:07:49.620]  organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic
[3:07:49.620 --> 3:07:53.700]  activity inside the human body discover why anthroplex has turned so many heads
[3:07:53.700 --> 3:07:57.620]  today it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it
[3:07:57.620 --> 3:08:02.500]  starts at infowarslife.com with anthroplex
[3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:22.180]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[3:08:22.180 --> 3:08:26.180]  lines of the info war
[3:08:34.180 --> 3:08:39.060]  all right it's the fourth hour of overdrive i'm your host rob do sitting in
[3:08:39.060 --> 3:08:43.060]  i guess anthony gucciardi and we got wane madson on the line we're gonna go
[3:08:43.060 --> 3:08:45.300]  back to him in one second i want to tell you a little bit about what i have
[3:08:45.300 --> 3:08:48.900]  coming up we just had the article on infowars.com how
[3:08:48.900 --> 3:08:53.300]  sinko de mayo i guess revelers were smashing trump pinatas in the name of
[3:08:53.300 --> 3:08:57.060]  you know ending racism or something like that we're gonna go we got a really
[3:08:57.060 --> 3:09:00.180]  interesting story out of oakland california i'm gonna have uh
[3:09:00.180 --> 3:09:03.300]  joe biggs into pop he sent this to me but he's also going to be in because
[3:09:03.300 --> 3:09:06.340]  we're sending him and darin mcgreen out to eugene origan
[3:09:06.340 --> 3:09:09.540]  there's going to be a trump rally there and already
[3:09:09.540 --> 3:09:13.780]  there are over 500 nearly 600 people that are going to go
[3:09:13.780 --> 3:09:18.340]  to that protest the anti-trump protest movement it's still
[3:09:18.340 --> 3:09:22.020]  just because trump won the nomination or is the presumptive anon
[3:09:22.020 --> 3:09:25.060]  nominee at this point doesn't mean people are going to stop protesting
[3:09:25.060 --> 3:09:29.060]  and it really is where you get the true agenda of these people
[3:09:29.060 --> 3:09:33.780]  that are afraid of free speech and afraid of any idea that counters their
[3:09:33.780 --> 3:09:38.420]  idea of a socialist collective so let's go back to
[3:09:38.420 --> 3:09:42.340]  wane wane madson right now we have this article from kit daniel's in may
[3:09:42.340 --> 3:09:46.660]  third indiana voting fraud activists behind rubio's sex party leaks
[3:09:46.660 --> 3:09:51.540]  found dead and his name is gary welsh he was found at the bottom of a stairwell
[3:09:51.540 --> 3:09:56.020]  um in his apartment complex wane um has there have there been any new
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:09:58.900]  developments on this since the may third article
[3:09:58.900 --> 3:10:02.420]  well there was supposed to have been an autopsy done on monday i don't believe
[3:10:02.420 --> 3:10:07.700]  that we've seen any uh report on uh the outcome of that um
[3:10:07.700 --> 3:10:14.180]  i am uh gary welsh's services uh the safton noon and tear
[3:10:14.180 --> 3:10:19.780]  out indiana uh and uh but this one uh defies logic
[3:10:19.780 --> 3:10:25.460]  why uh because the police determined based on a final blog entry he may
[3:10:25.460 --> 3:10:30.020]  say i may not be around tuesday when trump wins indiana
[3:10:30.020 --> 3:10:35.460]  uh but i think he's going to come in uh just under 50 percent in fact he came
[3:10:35.460 --> 3:10:41.140]  in at 53 percent uh the police figured out that was a
[3:10:41.140 --> 3:10:44.340]  some sort of indication that he planned to commit suicide
[3:10:44.340 --> 3:10:48.180]  well if if fear being fearful of your
[3:10:48.180 --> 3:10:53.380]  life because you may be getting uh death threats if that if that's any
[3:10:53.380 --> 3:10:57.380]  indication of suicide then you know martin luther king
[3:10:57.380 --> 3:11:02.100]  made that prophetic speech too i i may not get there with you i've been to the
[3:11:02.100 --> 3:11:05.300]  mountaintop well you know shortly after that he
[3:11:05.300 --> 3:11:09.060]  was assassinated so you know it's just basic
[3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:13.860]  simple police work that just because somebody says i might not be around
[3:11:13.860 --> 3:11:17.540]  much longer you you you should also take into consideration
[3:11:17.540 --> 3:11:20.820]  that his life was being threatened the other thing is gary
[3:11:20.820 --> 3:11:27.460]  was also advancing the ted cruz story uh with his dad in new orleans and oswald
[3:11:27.460 --> 3:11:32.500]  and uh he was also an attorney who specialized in election law
[3:11:32.500 --> 3:11:36.100]  he had been before the indiana electoral commission
[3:11:36.100 --> 3:11:41.380]  on more than one occasion uh to argue about uh you know election
[3:11:41.380 --> 3:11:44.900]  irregularities and the mere fact that he dies right
[3:11:44.900 --> 3:11:50.020]  before the indiana primary uh i think is very very suspicious
[3:11:50.020 --> 3:11:53.940]  yeah i would agree and you know other people you've talked to wane the dc
[3:11:53.940 --> 3:11:57.860]  madame uh she's she had she had the names and
[3:11:57.860 --> 3:12:02.180]  numbers of people who went to her uh her sex service
[3:12:02.180 --> 3:12:06.420]  and she comes on the alex joneshow says she has some great information she wants
[3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:09.460]  to give alex but she didn't want to give it over the air he didn't take it
[3:12:09.460 --> 3:12:12.900]  and uh then a few days later she winds up uh you know
[3:12:12.900 --> 3:12:16.020]  hung in her mom's woodshed out in the back
[3:12:16.020 --> 3:12:19.860]  i mean yeah and i was in email communication with gary web
[3:12:19.860 --> 3:12:23.860]  uh for a few months before they said he shot himself twice in a head
[3:12:23.860 --> 3:12:27.300]  and ironically we were both looking at a company
[3:12:27.300 --> 3:12:30.820]  uh called affiliated computer systems myself because they
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:37.540]  had approved the visas for those arab uh the legend hijackers on 9 11
[3:12:37.540 --> 3:12:41.540]  and he was looking at him for some fraud in sacramento but the
[3:12:41.540 --> 3:12:44.740]  affiliated computer systems that is their vice president
[3:12:44.740 --> 3:12:49.300]  steven goldsmith a former mayor aware indianapolis indiana
[3:12:49.300 --> 3:12:54.340]  i think it's very ironic that here again we have a suspicious suicide
[3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:58.420]  in india in india indianapolis let alone indiana
[3:12:58.420 --> 3:13:01.860]  and uh i would also add that the news just broke that
[3:13:01.860 --> 3:13:06.340]  an attorney for wiki leaks uh is said to have just jumped in front of a
[3:13:06.340 --> 3:13:11.140]  commuter train in england and of course he was he was killed
[3:13:11.140 --> 3:13:14.980]  wow they jumped or pushed i mean depending on i'm sure he was
[3:13:14.980 --> 3:13:17.780]  yeah in cases like that you're usually you're pushed
[3:13:17.780 --> 3:13:22.740]  yeah and uh and and and well not to get graphic but autopsies don't real
[3:13:22.740 --> 3:13:26.660]  work real well after something like that that's true that is one way of covering
[3:13:26.660 --> 3:13:30.260]  up any evidence and especially if you got knocked on the head or something and
[3:13:30.260 --> 3:13:33.460]  they found uh i think two young boys down in
[3:13:33.460 --> 3:13:38.340]  where you guys were at down in uh and near mexico and the texas border
[3:13:38.340 --> 3:13:41.460]  they were uh there was a husband and wife that were found
[3:13:41.460 --> 3:13:44.660]  dead and they saw uh they think they saw a drug deal or something and then they
[3:13:44.660 --> 3:13:48.980]  were placed on the tracks and uh so there's a lot of weird goings on
[3:13:48.980 --> 3:13:52.740]  and anytime you want to put out information that is against the
[3:13:52.740 --> 3:13:57.940]  the globalist cabal barry jennings another fine example here's a guy who
[3:13:57.940 --> 3:14:01.620]  breaks the silence talks about explosions that were happening
[3:14:01.620 --> 3:14:04.820]  in the base or the ground level in the lobby
[3:14:04.820 --> 3:14:08.580]  of world trade center seven before it collapsed before the towers had even
[3:14:08.580 --> 3:14:12.260]  collapsed there was uh people in their dead he was
[3:14:12.260 --> 3:14:15.780]  walking over dead bodies and then shortly after that he he gets fast
[3:14:15.780 --> 3:14:19.860]  acting leukemia and meets his demise as well so anytime
[3:14:19.860 --> 3:14:24.740]  people are bringing out information and uh you know it's hot if they end up
[3:14:24.740 --> 3:14:29.540]  dead shortly thereafter now the first two uh stories i ever
[3:14:29.540 --> 3:14:32.580]  investigate it were uh investigative journalist
[3:14:32.580 --> 3:14:37.300]  danie castellaro was on to old man bush and mena and all that stuff clinton
[3:14:37.300 --> 3:14:39.860]  too it was on to clinton and they said he
[3:14:39.860 --> 3:14:43.380]  slashed his wrists uh 12 times each wrist
[3:14:43.380 --> 3:14:47.700]  in the bathtub of a of a hotel in martinsburg uh west virginia
[3:14:47.700 --> 3:14:52.580]  they called that suicide and uh also vince foster was the second one
[3:14:52.580 --> 3:14:56.740]  uh i investigated and they called that suicide of course it was well known he
[3:14:56.740 --> 3:15:01.700]  had been carrying on an affair with hillary clinton before that
[3:15:01.700 --> 3:15:04.980]  please don't say that you're putting bad thoughts in my head
[3:15:04.980 --> 3:15:09.700]  um well she goes both ways although i think she goes only one way
[3:15:09.700 --> 3:15:14.100]  now in the last uh two probably decade and a half can you
[3:15:14.100 --> 3:15:17.860]  about how big is the clinton body count going to grow if she gets back into office
[3:15:17.860 --> 3:15:20.580]  i mean right you know and right it's come out that
[3:15:20.580 --> 3:15:24.100]  uh they've got to find the article that they've known about
[3:15:24.100 --> 3:15:28.900]  the goose for email hacks for years there mbc why did mbc sit on explosive
[3:15:28.900 --> 3:15:31.780]  news story about clinton's alleged hacked email server
[3:15:31.780 --> 3:15:35.860]  for weeks well that's to protect her and they don't want that information out too
[3:15:35.860 --> 3:15:37.940]  early right unless they're thinking of deep
[3:15:37.940 --> 3:15:41.620]  fixing her at some point in the nomination process and bringing in
[3:15:41.620 --> 3:15:44.820]  somebody else uh you know because they don't want
[3:15:44.820 --> 3:15:48.020]  bernie so maybe they bring in joe biden at the end and he would
[3:15:48.020 --> 3:15:51.460]  sort of ride in on a white horse and rescue the democratic party
[3:15:51.460 --> 3:15:55.700]  right one bc take and like all the networks take their orders from uh
[3:15:55.700 --> 3:16:00.500]  either the cia or the pentagon that's part of the continuing operation
[3:16:00.500 --> 3:16:04.180]  mockingbird that never went away yeah and gucifers now here they've extra
[3:16:04.180 --> 3:16:08.100]  died in him here to the united states he was in a romanian prison for a while
[3:16:08.100 --> 3:16:12.180]  and now he's here so who knows what he is saying hopefully he stays safe
[3:16:12.180 --> 3:16:16.180]  yeah we hope so but if he's a you know being a guest of the
[3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:19.780]  uh justice department and bureau of prisons anything is possible
[3:16:19.780 --> 3:16:22.740]  sure yeah after he spills spills his guts or
[3:16:22.740 --> 3:16:27.140]  sings and then then they uh you know do whatever they do in prison
[3:16:27.140 --> 3:16:30.900]  but let's hope that doesn't happen to him anything else way before you go
[3:16:30.900 --> 3:16:35.220]  uh well i you know i think this uh cruise
[3:16:35.220 --> 3:16:39.780]  story is uh still uh generating a lot of interest a lot of
[3:16:39.780 --> 3:16:44.580]  jfk assassination experts are weighing in on both sides saying it's
[3:16:44.580 --> 3:16:48.900]  it's a nonsense story i'm being attacked by a few of them
[3:16:48.900 --> 3:16:52.660]  but i'm also hearing from those jfk researchers and say
[3:16:52.660 --> 3:16:57.060]  yeah we never could identify who that guy was and it looks like it could be in
[3:16:57.060 --> 3:17:01.540]  fact uh uh rafael cruz do you think that's why he punched his wife in el
[3:17:01.540 --> 3:17:05.380]  boater as he was hugging his dad maybe it was just some sort of way he was you
[3:17:05.380 --> 3:17:07.940]  know he was so mad that he dropped out of the race
[3:17:07.940 --> 3:17:11.620]  and maybe dad asked him to drop out yeah carly for your rena
[3:17:11.620 --> 3:17:14.820]  you know she fell off the stage and he didn't even try to
[3:17:14.820 --> 3:17:18.500]  help her and then he and then he hits his wife hidey
[3:17:18.500 --> 3:17:23.620]  with his elbow three times so yeah maybe uh he's reacting very negatively to
[3:17:23.620 --> 3:17:27.940]  being told to pick up your uh building blocks and your tinker toy set and you
[3:17:27.940 --> 3:17:31.940]  know just go on yeah we got to protect daddy and his and his cia cover
[3:17:31.940 --> 3:17:34.660]  and if that's what really happened we don't know and
[3:17:34.660 --> 3:17:38.580]  but uh if anyone's gonna get to the bottom of it it'll be wane madson
[3:17:38.580 --> 3:17:42.020]  so thanks for working with us wane and uh we'll see you soon we're gonna be
[3:17:42.020 --> 3:17:46.020]  joining us at the rnc oh there it is ow well it looks like it hurts
[3:17:46.020 --> 3:17:50.500]  we just showed that on on tv of the uh of cruz elbowing his wife in the face
[3:17:50.500 --> 3:17:54.420]  after he succumbed to defeat from the mighty trump
[3:17:54.420 --> 3:17:58.580]  so thanks for joining us wane you bet and uh you can read more about that
[3:17:58.580 --> 3:18:02.580]  indiana voting fraud activist behind rubio sex party leaks found dead
[3:18:02.580 --> 3:18:06.580]  um right there on info wars dot com it's a kit daniel's article from may
[3:18:06.580 --> 3:18:10.340]  third and then you could go back and walk the links back and um read the other
[3:18:10.340 --> 3:18:13.220]  stories wane madson put out a story about it as well
[3:18:13.220 --> 3:18:16.580]  a while back and that's the thing about info wars we're breaking these stories
[3:18:16.580 --> 3:18:20.180]  and it takes a while for them to enter the mainstream media but
[3:18:20.180 --> 3:18:23.780]  sometimes it takes a month sometimes it takes a week sometimes it takes two years
[3:18:23.780 --> 3:18:28.340]  but eventually they do make it out there so what's going on at the border right
[3:18:28.340 --> 3:18:32.580]  now was this synco to mayo so i guess it is appropriate to talk about the border
[3:18:32.580 --> 3:18:35.940]  here's uh from north carolina news nc man among
[3:18:35.940 --> 3:18:40.660]  some joining groups to in us to patrol border with mexico
[3:18:40.660 --> 3:18:45.780]  and uh talk about this 2000 mile border spanning and people are coming from all
[3:18:45.780 --> 3:18:50.020]  over the world this is a man named doc who decided to take his vacation time
[3:18:50.020 --> 3:18:53.940]  and be uh part of the solution i guess watching the border
[3:18:53.940 --> 3:18:57.620]  he says they come through and they cut the bar bar literally takes seconds to
[3:18:57.620 --> 3:19:00.900]  get on our side of the border with packs and mules and things like that
[3:19:00.900 --> 3:19:03.940]  it's basically not even a deterrent it only holds them up for a few seconds
[3:19:03.940 --> 3:19:08.180]  and they're talking about the fence and in some places it doesn't even exist
[3:19:08.180 --> 3:19:13.460]  as uh joe biggs has shown others how he just walks over into mexico and can walk
[3:19:13.460 --> 3:19:17.780]  back and nobody stops him um he crossed the border dressed as an isis
[3:19:17.780 --> 3:19:22.740]  a terrorist at one point and nothing's being done we've seen
[3:19:22.740 --> 3:19:25.300]  we've shot video of the gates just being left open
[3:19:25.300 --> 3:19:28.180]  right there at the border where they do have a fence
[3:19:28.180 --> 3:19:32.660]  and somewhat of a of a deterrent along el paso but then that quickly dies off
[3:19:32.660 --> 3:19:36.260]  as soon as you move so we're going to have more news coming up david night's
[3:19:36.260 --> 3:19:38.100]  going to come in next and we're going to talk about

[3:24:22.180 --> 3:24:27.780]  david night and he's got some news on ttip and also some hillary news and i
[3:24:27.780 --> 3:24:31.780]  just want to cover this real quick uh going back to this mbc story why it
[3:24:31.780 --> 3:24:34.740]  said on explosive story about clinton's alleged
[3:24:34.740 --> 3:24:38.740]  hacked email server for weeks so they have a transcript here
[3:24:38.740 --> 3:24:43.060]  uh was synthia mcfadden talking to gucifer and she's talking about the
[3:24:43.060 --> 3:24:46.180]  hillary server being absolutely safe and he starts laughing he says that's a lie
[3:24:46.180 --> 3:24:50.660]  that's a lie and uh and as a guy who's not a computer
[3:24:50.660 --> 3:24:54.100]  programmer exactly right well azar is openly
[3:24:54.100 --> 3:24:56.980]  admitting to hacking her private email account the same private email account
[3:24:56.980 --> 3:24:59.940]  where federal officials found over 2 000 emails that were
[3:24:59.940 --> 3:25:03.700]  that contain classified information and at least 22 deem top secret
[3:25:03.700 --> 3:25:07.780]  hey you know 22 that's not too bad huh so if it's a lie rob why is he in prison
[3:25:07.780 --> 3:25:11.380]  exactly you know the clinton campaign noted that they
[3:25:11.380 --> 3:25:14.420]  they said there's absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this
[3:25:14.420 --> 3:25:18.500]  criminal from his prison so free gucifer that needs to be the new t-shirt
[3:25:18.500 --> 3:25:22.180]  that's where she's that's where she's gonna be soon if uh if the fbi actually
[3:25:22.180 --> 3:25:26.020]  gets to do a real investigation so but you didn't even come in here to talk
[3:25:26.020 --> 3:25:29.700]  about that although that's you know kind of hot in the news yeah ttip is in the
[3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:32.980]  news as well i guess france has said they they don't want to go along with it
[3:25:32.980 --> 3:25:35.860]  they're pissed off because people are finally getting to read the plan that's
[3:25:35.860 --> 3:25:38.340]  right and to get everybody up to speed if you haven't
[3:25:38.340 --> 3:25:41.860]  heard this of course there's two big treaties have been negotiated in secret
[3:25:41.860 --> 3:25:45.140]  by multinational corporations our lawmakers not allowed to see them
[3:25:45.140 --> 3:25:47.620]  eventually when they were nobody cared except for just
[3:25:47.620 --> 3:25:51.620]  jeff sessions uh who has uh who's been the only senator
[3:25:51.620 --> 3:25:54.820]  to read this to talk about it and of course the only person he's ever
[3:25:54.820 --> 3:25:59.700]  endorsed is donald trump as we're looking at this now this was uh leaked
[3:25:59.700 --> 3:26:03.060]  by greenpeace netherlands they published this on tuesday
[3:26:03.060 --> 3:26:06.580]  and it has really set the people in europe on fire
[3:26:06.580 --> 3:26:10.100]  about this they say that besides the secrecy on it says it's going to affect
[3:26:10.100 --> 3:26:13.780]  human health labor rights internet privacy rights a very social fabric of
[3:26:13.780 --> 3:26:18.420]  europe itself of course it's a massive deal this is about sovereignty it's about
[3:26:18.420 --> 3:26:21.780]  managing your economy and it's about the internet it's about
[3:26:21.780 --> 3:26:26.180]  privacy it's about everything okay this is the whole ball of wax and we've got
[3:26:26.180 --> 3:26:30.260]  two of these creatures we got the t pp which is the trans-specific
[3:26:30.260 --> 3:26:33.780]  partnership these are treaties folks are not partnerships but the also the
[3:26:33.780 --> 3:26:38.180]  transatlantic this is the transatlantic uh partnership and of course in france
[3:26:38.180 --> 3:26:41.940]  the socialist there hollanda says absolutely not it questions the
[3:26:41.940 --> 3:26:45.620]  essential principles for our agriculture our culture our reciprocity of
[3:26:45.620 --> 3:26:50.180]  access to public markets he says it's unacceptable and he says it would make no
[3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:53.540]  sense to have this climate deal in december because this is going to
[3:26:53.540 --> 3:26:57.300]  unravel some of it and hillary clinton is saying the same things too so
[3:26:57.300 --> 3:27:00.660]  now they're saying oh we can't do this because the climate deal and that
[3:27:00.660 --> 3:27:03.300]  points up the fact that there are two ways for them to do
[3:27:03.300 --> 3:27:07.700]  global consolidation destruction of our economy and setting up their own
[3:27:07.700 --> 3:27:11.140]  crony capitalist uh is one of the conditions to allow
[3:27:11.140 --> 3:27:14.580]  monsanto to grow gem crops in europe or is that
[3:27:14.580 --> 3:27:17.780]  off the table i don't know that specificity of it
[3:27:17.780 --> 3:27:21.060]  but that has been part of it is that the americans have been pushing to make
[3:27:21.060 --> 3:27:24.500]  sure that there's no regulations that are going to stop gmo production
[3:27:24.500 --> 3:27:27.300]  right so i imagine that is in the very last thing
[3:27:27.300 --> 3:27:30.100]  we look at what's happening in america i think it's also interesting hillary
[3:27:30.100 --> 3:27:32.420]  clinton's been campaigning in west virginia because they're going to have a
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:36.340]  primary on tuesday it looks like bernie sanders is going to
[3:27:36.340 --> 3:27:39.940]  really slaughter her there oh i think so yeah her comments on coal that
[3:27:39.940 --> 3:27:43.700]  absolutely and her ties into the obama administration right because obama said
[3:27:43.700 --> 3:27:46.660]  coming in he's going to make sure there weren't he had a war on coal we've
[3:27:46.660 --> 3:27:50.660]  talked about that about that many times uh if you build a coal factory uh
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:54.580]  coal mine is going to uh are a power plant yeah power plant yeah he actually
[3:27:54.580 --> 3:27:57.460]  came out so we're going to go bankrupt but he went after the power plants but
[3:27:57.460 --> 3:28:00.500]  of course he's also going after the coal mines because if nobody's going to
[3:28:00.500 --> 3:28:03.140]  burn it in the power plants it's going to shut them down
[3:28:03.140 --> 3:28:07.220]  there have been there were 300 coal mines in west virginia five years ago
[3:28:07.220 --> 3:28:10.580]  today there's less than 70 that's 80 of them gone
[3:28:10.580 --> 3:28:14.500]  in five years it's 10 000 jobs that have been lost and there was an article from
[3:28:14.500 --> 3:28:18.660]  the daily caller today saying that the epa's shut down of coal
[3:28:18.660 --> 3:28:23.300]  is the equivalent to all of the electrical power generation in all the
[3:28:23.300 --> 3:28:26.340]  united kingdom so that's how much they're taking offline
[3:28:26.340 --> 3:28:29.220]  we have the to jack up power prices that's right
[3:28:29.220 --> 3:28:32.500]  yeah to jack that up and also come in they're going to offer
[3:28:32.500 --> 3:28:35.780]  them some green i some green plans we've seen how
[3:28:35.780 --> 3:28:39.780]  salindra uh works and all these crony capitalist this is
[3:28:39.780 --> 3:28:43.620]  a massive transfer of power and wealth to their friends okay
[3:28:43.620 --> 3:28:47.060]  and we don't really succeed that's right even when they get these handouts
[3:28:47.060 --> 3:28:50.580]  they still can't succeed and we've had a gut-wrenching
[3:28:50.580 --> 3:28:54.260]  piece that came out this week in exchange with a guy who was a coal miner
[3:28:54.260 --> 3:28:58.020]  i want to play you a little clip of this let's roll that clip
[3:29:01.860 --> 3:29:06.020]  we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business
[3:29:06.020 --> 3:29:09.380]  when you make comments like we're going to put a lot of coal miners out of
[3:29:09.380 --> 3:29:13.380]  jobs we were all these people that you're
[3:29:13.380 --> 3:29:17.700]  affecting this is this is my family
[3:29:17.700 --> 3:29:22.580]  now my hope is in god that's my future
[3:29:22.580 --> 3:29:26.820]  i want my family to know that they have a future here in this state
[3:29:26.820 --> 3:29:29.780]  she said and she did not make it a secret that she is going to continue with
[3:29:29.780 --> 3:29:32.660]  the policies of the past seven and a half years and expand upon them
[3:29:32.660 --> 3:29:35.860]  there's no other way to perceive that pure and simple
[3:29:35.860 --> 3:29:40.100]  we are tuned it's an attack on a way of life exactly
[3:29:40.100 --> 3:29:43.540]  and we'll be back with the girl at david night finish up after this and
[3:29:43.540 --> 3:29:46.740]  just it really tells you what kind of creature she is yep
[3:29:46.740 --> 3:29:49.940]  she wants to live in her little castle and have everybody else underneath her
[3:29:49.940 --> 3:29:54.500]  underlings so we'll be right back here on the march the empire's on the run
[3:29:54.500 --> 3:29:59.460]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:01.380 --> 3:30:05.860]  joe vicks here with info wars dot com today i want to talk to you about guns
[3:30:05.860 --> 3:30:10.580]  why we have them why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why
[3:30:10.580 --> 3:30:15.140]  my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in
[3:30:15.140 --> 3:30:17.860]  the press i believe every good journalist needs
[3:30:17.860 --> 3:30:21.620]  to know why the second amendment must be considered more essential
[3:30:21.620 --> 3:30:25.220]  than the first amendment this may be a bitter pill to swallow
[3:30:25.220 --> 3:30:30.580]  but the right to keep in bare arms is not an outdated dusty idea some old dead
[3:30:30.580 --> 3:30:33.540]  white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats
[3:30:33.540 --> 3:30:39.060]  no it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776
[3:30:39.060 --> 3:30:42.660]  the original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contain 10 of what
[3:30:42.660 --> 3:30:47.060]  the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of rights
[3:30:47.060 --> 3:30:51.860]  came to us with blinders on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it
[3:30:51.860 --> 3:30:56.660]  protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters but extends
[3:30:56.660 --> 3:31:01.460]  even to those we love to hate this is a small excerpt from trawlin heston

[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:42.260]  that we're hard workers
[3:33:42.260 --> 3:33:45.780]  when you really look at her record and what she's laid out in this campaign
[3:33:45.780 --> 3:33:49.300]  she's the one that's really with coal miners and trying to help them
[3:33:49.300 --> 3:33:52.740]  not only get the benefits that they've earned but the respect that they deserve
[3:33:52.740 --> 3:33:56.340]  where were they for the last seven years to step up and say no wait a minute
[3:33:56.340 --> 3:33:59.780]  let's let's take a more reasonable approach to this
[3:33:59.780 --> 3:34:03.220]  she's been part of the cabinet I mean this administration this Obama
[3:34:03.220 --> 3:34:06.740]  administration has done everything they could as he had
[3:34:06.740 --> 3:34:09.620]  promised to put the coal business out of business
[3:34:09.620 --> 3:34:13.860]  and it's really had a tremendous economic impact here in West Virginia
[3:34:13.860 --> 3:34:18.420]  and now that witch Hillary Clinton is trying to walk that back saying oh no I
[3:34:18.420 --> 3:34:21.300]  love coal miners I want to give you guys some benefits
[3:34:21.300 --> 3:34:25.220]  yeah yeah and that's the amazing thing Rob she goes to West Virginia to campaign
[3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:28.580]  and she brags about how we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies
[3:34:28.580 --> 3:34:32.740]  out of business and so there was this guy who asked her that very touch is a
[3:34:32.740 --> 3:34:36.180]  very touching exchange going back and it really got her she didn't know how to
[3:34:36.180 --> 3:34:39.940]  respond to that this is a guy who's 39 years old he's worked in
[3:34:39.940 --> 3:34:44.100]  mines for 11 years he's got three children and he was laid off
[3:34:44.100 --> 3:34:47.540]  by a company that declared bankruptcy earlier this year he says I can't
[3:34:47.540 --> 3:34:51.220]  explain to my children why I can't support and get up and okay and that's
[3:34:51.220 --> 3:34:54.020]  what you hear in that story from the red land she said we were poor but our
[3:34:54.020 --> 3:34:57.060]  family our daddy worked hard he supported us
[3:34:57.060 --> 3:35:00.740]  you know it's and here's and here's the bottom line to you may think this
[3:35:00.740 --> 3:35:03.220]  doesn't affect you living in a big city somewhere
[3:35:03.220 --> 3:35:06.020]  well it's going to raise your power prices and it's going to raise everybody's
[3:35:06.020 --> 3:35:09.220]  power prices and what you get when you're paying more money
[3:35:09.220 --> 3:35:13.380]  for power basic power when it was cheap it used to be pretty cheap
[3:35:13.380 --> 3:35:16.340]  you're not going to have as much innovation you want a country that's
[3:35:16.340 --> 3:35:19.060]  innovating and doing things you have cheap power
[3:35:19.060 --> 3:35:22.580]  whether you like it or not hey we have nuclear power too i'm not for that but
[3:35:22.580 --> 3:35:26.980]  it also produces electricity and we have electricity to make
[3:35:26.980 --> 3:35:29.620]  things work that has nothing but wars in the
[3:35:29.620 --> 3:35:32.100]  middle east because we are so dependent upon oil
[3:35:32.100 --> 3:35:36.020]  if we were more had more coal we have more coal than Saudis have
[3:35:36.020 --> 3:35:39.860]  oil okay far more and the bottom line is there's nothing
[3:35:39.860 --> 3:35:43.620]  other than nothing affects your standard of living even your life expectancy
[3:35:43.620 --> 3:35:47.300]  more than cheap energy okay you want to have a prosperous
[3:35:47.300 --> 3:35:51.540]  country you want to have a long life expectancy a high standard of living
[3:35:51.540 --> 3:35:55.060]  you need cheap energy we've got cheap energy they're artificially making it
[3:35:55.060 --> 3:35:58.740]  expensive so you got obama coming in with his coal regulations
[3:35:58.740 --> 3:36:02.660]  and you got two dozen states who file suit against it it goes to the supreme
[3:36:02.660 --> 3:36:06.260]  court in february we got the new york times headline supreme court deals
[3:36:06.260 --> 3:36:09.940]  blow to obama's efforts to regulate coal emissions they put a stay
[3:36:09.940 --> 3:36:12.980]  on these emissions they were going to go to a court in
[3:36:12.980 --> 3:36:17.700]  washington dc where maryc garland who has now been tapped to be the supreme
[3:36:17.700 --> 3:36:20.900]  court nominee for obama it's going to go to that court with the three judges
[3:36:20.900 --> 3:36:23.700]  we're going to decide whether or not we're going to be allowed to burn coal in
[3:36:23.700 --> 3:36:28.020]  this country i mean that's a major problem that he's on right there so then
[3:36:28.020 --> 3:36:31.060]  glia dies it was going to they were going to they expected they were going
[3:36:31.060 --> 3:36:34.420]  to say yeah okay green light the epa because that's what maryc garland has
[3:36:34.420 --> 3:36:37.620]  done his entire career is green light everything the bureaucracy
[3:36:37.620 --> 3:36:40.980]  want to do they said it was going to lose five to four at the supreme court
[3:36:40.980 --> 3:36:43.780]  until scalia died now the lower court decision
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:47.620]  will stand the regulations from the epa will stand and when she's talking
[3:36:47.620 --> 3:36:50.180]  about the fact we're going to make sure they get their benefits we're going to
[3:36:50.180 --> 3:36:53.540]  give you some green jobs to do or whatever it isn't going to happen you're
[3:36:53.540 --> 3:36:57.700]  going to recycle cans in the you know in the local supermarket or something
[3:36:57.700 --> 3:37:00.500]  well the lady who tried to walk this back said look we're going to make sure
[3:37:00.500 --> 3:37:03.220]  they get their benefits yeah how has that worked out in
[3:37:03.220 --> 3:37:06.500]  oregon right okay we went out then we talked to people we talked to the miners
[3:37:06.500 --> 3:37:09.860]  we talked to the loggers we talked to the ranchers out there when they go in
[3:37:09.860 --> 3:37:13.460]  and shut down the miners when they shut down the loggers they say all right
[3:37:13.460 --> 3:37:16.660]  we're not going to let you earn a living anymore taking out dead wood and of
[3:37:16.660 --> 3:37:20.020]  course that makes the forest all burned down whenever they have a far forest
[3:37:20.020 --> 3:37:23.060]  fire because they leave the fuel in there so it's good for the environment
[3:37:23.060 --> 3:37:26.900]  it's good for the economy it's good for everyone because we get cheaper wood
[3:37:26.900 --> 3:37:29.700]  okay they take take out the dead wood but they say we're not going to allow you
[3:37:29.700 --> 3:37:33.700]  to do that and as but to ease the transition
[3:37:33.700 --> 3:37:36.340]  we're going to give you welfare benefits for 10 years well you know what
[3:37:36.340 --> 3:37:40.500]  those welfare benefits are finished yeah and there's nothing left they
[3:37:40.500 --> 3:37:44.180]  can't even fund the police department in these areas and what are they going to
[3:37:44.180 --> 3:37:46.660]  do yeah you know they're just going to move on or
[3:37:46.660 --> 3:37:49.940]  that area will collapse well it's the reservation and then the feds will come
[3:37:49.940 --> 3:37:52.980]  in and say well now we own this too because nobody's living here so we're
[3:37:52.980 --> 3:37:55.540]  just going to take this and keep adding on it's the reservation
[3:37:55.540 --> 3:37:59.700]  Hillary Clinton's other comment where she said I know how to deal with men who
[3:37:59.700 --> 3:38:01.860]  get off the reservation well the Indians got
[3:38:01.860 --> 3:38:05.220]  rightfully upset about that because the reservation as Russell Means has pointed
[3:38:05.220 --> 3:38:08.740]  out has been a horrific instrument to oppress
[3:38:08.740 --> 3:38:12.980]  Indians since it was done 100 years ago 150 years ago okay
[3:38:12.980 --> 3:38:17.860]  and what they did was they created a gulag a a socialist gulag for these
[3:38:17.860 --> 3:38:20.580]  people and constrained them where they could not earn a living
[3:38:20.580 --> 3:38:23.380]  where they were completely dependent upon the government
[3:38:23.380 --> 3:38:26.500]  and now that's what they're doing to everybody okay they they talk about she
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:30.100]  said well i was talking about Rudy Giuliani not my husband okay they can
[3:38:30.100 --> 3:38:33.460]  go back and forth about that but look they want to put everybody on a
[3:38:33.460 --> 3:38:36.020]  reservation they want all of us they want a hunger game
[3:38:36.020 --> 3:38:40.260]  down and strained into a a confined area where we can't earn a living and
[3:38:40.260 --> 3:38:43.300]  we're dependent on their benefits exactly
[3:38:43.300 --> 3:38:46.260]  exactly and then you've got these people running around
[3:38:46.260 --> 3:38:49.460]  trying to kill what's left of America and people
[3:38:49.460 --> 3:38:52.260]  this lady should be in jail she should be investigator right now she shouldn't
[3:38:52.260 --> 3:38:55.140]  be running for president but all this goes back to you have to be
[3:38:55.140 --> 3:38:58.020]  prepared what if you lose your job what if
[3:38:58.020 --> 3:39:01.220]  something strikes like they're saying now the San Andreas Fault is locked and
[3:39:01.220 --> 3:39:04.020]  loaded and ready to go we were interviewing people
[3:39:04.020 --> 3:39:08.100]  out in south uh in San Francisco and this one
[3:39:08.100 --> 3:39:13.380]  you know Trigley Puff wannabe was sitting there yelling at a Trump supporter
[3:39:13.380 --> 3:39:18.260]  oh you one of those preppers like like it was bad to be prepared
[3:39:18.260 --> 3:39:21.700]  when they live in a freaking earthquake zone yeah okay i don't know she probably
[3:39:21.700 --> 3:39:24.580]  wasn't born when there when it happened during the world series and destroyed
[3:39:24.580 --> 3:39:27.940]  bridges and people died and you know it was mass
[3:39:27.940 --> 3:39:31.860]  chaos for a few days no you have to stay prepared now
[3:39:31.860 --> 3:39:34.740]  on one way you could do that right now is with we have a mega sale going 30 to
[3:39:34.740 --> 3:39:39.380]  40 off of info wars select storeable food so it's uh it's
[3:39:39.380 --> 3:39:42.980]  got a 25 year shelf life food prices are going up you think energy prices are
[3:39:42.980 --> 3:39:46.660]  going up food prices are going up too oh yeah you know they're hitting everybody
[3:39:46.660 --> 3:39:49.620]  where it hurts this is all and these all the people that say the government's
[3:39:49.620 --> 3:39:52.660]  going to help you government's going to help you hey the government killed the
[3:39:52.660 --> 3:39:55.860]  Indians and put them on reservations that wasn't citizens going out and
[3:39:55.860 --> 3:39:59.380]  rounding up Indians that was your big government that you like so much
[3:39:59.380 --> 3:40:03.620]  okay your big government that destroys giant businesses
[3:40:03.620 --> 3:40:07.940]  that provide cheap power so you live like a surf you can't have a job
[3:40:07.940 --> 3:40:10.580]  and then you can't pay for the power either because it's gone up so much
[3:40:10.580 --> 3:40:14.580]  because oh we're going to do these giant solar farms that aren't very efficient
[3:40:14.580 --> 3:40:17.380]  that are stuck out in somewhere and it's all collectivized instead of you know
[3:40:17.380 --> 3:40:19.860]  encouraging people to put solar on your home that's one way
[3:40:19.860 --> 3:40:22.500]  yeah to to get out of the system a little bit because they have to
[3:40:22.500 --> 3:40:25.300]  centralize everything that's why they want the big projects they don't want
[3:40:25.300 --> 3:40:28.900]  you decentralized like that exactly so go to info wars store.com and

[3:42:09.300 --> 3:42:13.780]  cancel synco to myo dui checkpoints after outcry
[3:42:13.780 --> 3:42:17.380]  so hey guess what that means go out and get drunk in oakland it's okay there
[3:42:17.380 --> 3:42:20.660]  nobody's going to be checking you there's no and i'm against dui checkpoints
[3:42:20.660 --> 3:42:23.860]  especially the blood draws where they do this but then saying
[3:42:23.860 --> 3:42:26.820]  we're not going to even put them up now because this is a
[3:42:26.820 --> 3:42:30.180]  hispanic holiday even though they don't even really celebrate it in mexico this
[3:42:30.180 --> 3:42:33.300]  is sort of like an american corona holiday
[3:42:33.300 --> 3:42:38.740]  well because i said fiesta time and gel or was it fiesta time or gel times and
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:42.740]  that was so offensive to all these people out there in oakland where they
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:46.900]  they got on their facebook pages and they they band together to make sure that
[3:42:46.900 --> 3:42:52.500]  this didn't happen because it's horrible to to stop these guys from getting
[3:42:52.500 --> 3:42:56.260]  smashed onto keel all day and going out and then driving and
[3:42:56.260 --> 3:43:00.020]  running over some innocent bystanding family walking down the street
[3:43:00.020 --> 3:43:03.060]  but they're not stopping the nsa they're not stopping the tsa they're not
[3:43:03.060 --> 3:43:06.420]  they're not stopping they're not stopping the white folks from drinking
[3:43:06.420 --> 3:43:09.700]  on st patrick's day or the fourth of july yeah
[3:43:09.700 --> 3:43:13.540]  you know that's okay but we can't offend you know you know everyone out there
[3:43:13.540 --> 3:43:16.180]  with piñatas and sombreros on you know we're gonna
[3:43:16.180 --> 3:43:19.940]  that's the decision to cancel the checkpoints came after a backlash
[3:43:19.940 --> 3:43:25.540]  on social media so there it is right there if you get mad and you can perceive
[3:43:25.540 --> 3:43:29.380]  oh this is if you could just say it's racist like rob reiner i got a clip
[3:43:29.380 --> 3:43:31.940]  from rob reiner we're going to play this one real quick
[3:43:31.940 --> 3:43:35.300]  um you know they're saying hey what do you what they're asking what do you think
[3:43:35.300 --> 3:43:37.700]  about all the trump supporters he goes well they're all racist we didn't say
[3:43:37.700 --> 3:43:41.300]  they're all races he's like there's a lot of racists out there and so apparently
[3:43:41.300 --> 3:43:45.940]  anybody who is and there's no race party sander supporters exactly no support
[3:43:45.940 --> 3:43:49.940]  no when they hang when they hang trump's head on a pole and beat it
[3:43:49.940 --> 3:43:54.180]  with with giant sticks that's an act of love when someone screams f and white
[3:43:54.180 --> 3:43:57.940]  and spits at you i'm pretty sure that's pretty much racist there you go let's
[3:43:57.940 --> 3:44:01.460]  say let's play that rob reiner clip that is true but how do you explain the
[3:44:01.460 --> 3:44:04.740]  millions and millions of people who do not watch the show who actually like
[3:44:04.740 --> 3:44:08.020]  what they hear from donald trump and aren't taking messages and orders from
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:11.540]  us in the media but they listen to what he says for themselves in both form how
[3:44:11.540 --> 3:44:17.140]  do you explain that well there there are a lot of people who are racist oh my
[3:44:17.140 --> 3:44:22.260]  god did you just say that i'm not saying no you just said that well that's true
[3:44:22.260 --> 3:44:26.580]  so you think that's true i'm not saying no for donald trump are all races you
[3:44:26.580 --> 3:44:30.900]  led with that no i said they're not all there's like two or three that aren't
[3:44:30.900 --> 3:44:34.660]  racist you know but all the rest of them are you know i've gone and talked to
[3:44:34.660 --> 3:44:39.780]  these people these are just normal hard work and americans of all races colors
[3:44:39.780 --> 3:44:43.780]  and creeds and they just want to have the ability to provide for their families
[3:44:43.780 --> 3:44:47.380]  and not be taxed to death and uh and not be forced to buy obama care and they
[3:44:47.380 --> 3:44:51.460]  want the ability to go and listen to a presidential candidate speak yeah and
[3:44:51.460 --> 3:44:54.340]  maybe a lot of these people are undecided maybe maybe some of them are on
[3:44:54.340 --> 3:44:57.780]  the fence about maybe bernie sanders or something maybe they want this chance
[3:44:57.780 --> 3:45:01.620]  to finally go listen to trump and hear what he has to say and instead what
[3:45:01.620 --> 3:45:04.980]  happens is they're spit on they're called racist their children have to go
[3:45:04.980 --> 3:45:08.340]  through that as they're walking in and out of these events it's completely
[3:45:08.340 --> 3:45:12.580]  ridiculous yeah so that's why we are going to u g and organ tomorrow that's

[3:46:29.780 --> 3:46:33.620]  Donald Trump and uh you know they put the the talking points he's a racist
[3:46:33.620 --> 3:46:37.060]  misogynist yes so tomorrow's event's going to be at the elaine events convention

[3:46:40.420 --> 3:46:44.500]  actual rally starts at seven the counter protests which will be
[3:46:44.500 --> 3:46:49.460]  held the same area will be at uh five p.m is what they're saying but so i'm
[3:46:49.460 --> 3:46:52.340]  sure though it'll be around four and what they're going to do what you're
[3:46:52.340 --> 3:46:55.620]  going to see is um and this is exactly how it happened in southern california
[3:46:55.620 --> 3:46:58.580]  it'll be nothing for a while you get there and go wow there's no protesters
[3:46:58.580 --> 3:47:01.540]  and then all that there may be a couple in there walking around talking to
[3:47:01.540 --> 3:47:04.500]  people and then they're all going to march in all at once
[3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:08.100]  and they're going to have their signs ready to go and if the cops are there
[3:47:08.100 --> 3:47:10.980]  they might get in between them they might not if they don't who knows what
[3:47:10.980 --> 3:47:13.380]  could happen because they did it and they got in between them in southern
[3:47:13.380 --> 3:47:16.260]  california with the with the war horses that they were riding
[3:47:16.260 --> 3:47:20.900]  and that kept things peaceful um at least to a physical degree they weren't
[3:47:20.900 --> 3:47:22.820]  getting but they were getting verbal with each other
[3:47:22.820 --> 3:47:26.340]  then they all went out and blocked the road for people exiting so you got
[3:47:26.340 --> 3:47:29.300]  thousands of people that couldn't get in they're not going to hang out there
[3:47:29.300 --> 3:47:32.900]  all night so they all start start to leave and that's when you're going to see
[3:47:32.900 --> 3:47:36.020]  i think the fireworks go off and and these people aren't peaceful and they
[3:47:36.020 --> 3:47:40.260]  don't have love in their hearts they hate anything that is uh not so
[3:47:40.260 --> 3:47:42.900]  socialist and collective and the funniest thing is one of their biggest
[3:47:42.900 --> 3:47:46.100]  chances stop the hate in our state and yet they're the ones that are most
[3:47:46.100 --> 3:47:50.900]  hateful vile nasty discussing ridiculous excuses of human beings i mean
[3:47:50.900 --> 3:47:53.460]  they're they're just using it as an excuse to go crazy
[3:47:53.460 --> 3:47:57.460]  they really are so we'll see how it happens in uh in Eugene we're gonna
[3:47:57.460 --> 3:47:59.780]  we're gonna be out there watching you we've got Darren McBreen going with
[3:47:59.780 --> 3:48:02.980]  special guest McBreen yeah so McBreen doesn't go on a lot of these
[3:48:02.980 --> 3:48:06.500]  missions last time he went out with us was uh what the Spokane Washington trip
[3:48:06.500 --> 3:48:11.140]  that was where the the uh sheriff they had that video of that uh
[3:48:11.140 --> 3:48:14.100]  sheriff sitting there saying that these m-wraps were going to be used for
[3:48:14.100 --> 3:48:17.300]  constitutionalists and all that and it really pissed off a lot of people around
[3:48:17.300 --> 3:48:20.900]  the country and within Spokane and we all went out there and uh you know
[3:48:20.900 --> 3:48:24.420]  rallied with these people and we have another cop on video saying there's
[3:48:24.420 --> 3:48:28.260]  IEDs being made and and here we have
[3:48:28.260 --> 3:48:32.820]  he might be right look here's extremely dangerous IED found under Texas bridge
[3:48:32.820 --> 3:48:36.420]  so the mclanan county sheriff's office in bobsquad used a water cannon to breach
[3:48:36.420 --> 3:48:40.660]  a suspicious device found under a bridge Tuesday night yeah that was a rosebud
[3:48:40.660 --> 3:48:44.100]  up near temple exactly so how is how is this getting
[3:48:44.100 --> 3:48:48.580]  made you think this was made by uh by domestic hands or could it be our
[3:48:48.580 --> 3:48:52.180]  intrusive little al-qaeda isis operatives that we know or have made it all
[3:48:52.180 --> 3:48:54.820]  the way up to Dallas because they tried to shoot people up there
[3:48:54.820 --> 3:48:58.900]  at a draw Muhammad cartoon rally man we already have these reports from judicial
[3:48:58.900 --> 3:49:03.700]  watch these guys are already in uh in an opera I went down there a year ago uh a
[3:49:03.700 --> 3:49:08.340]  year ago from the 15th of April I believe so yeah I went down
[3:49:08.340 --> 3:49:12.260]  there and actually went into an opera looked around FBI talked to me
[3:49:12.260 --> 3:49:15.780]  afterwards and now we have confirmed reports of these ISIS guys down there
[3:49:15.780 --> 3:49:19.060]  training ready to come in and now we had these IEDs found I mean
[3:49:19.060 --> 3:49:22.500]  that's why Trump says we need to secure the border that's why we need it and
[3:49:22.500 --> 3:49:25.940]  here it is today out of the Daily Mail illegal immigrant numbers spike at the
[3:49:25.940 --> 3:49:30.580]  Mexican border as surge and new arrivals grows after Trump's vow to seal off
[3:49:30.580 --> 3:49:34.500]  the southern border and a border guards have seen a 78 jump in
[3:49:34.500 --> 3:49:37.620]  unaccompanied children so people are just sending their children up there to
[3:49:37.620 --> 3:49:41.220]  fend for themselves for the best they're working with these uh drug drug cartels
[3:49:41.220 --> 3:49:43.780]  in the coyote networks well the funniest thing was out of the
[3:49:43.780 --> 3:49:49.220]  Sente Fox and he's apologizing yeah he apologizes yesterday and the Trump comes
[3:49:49.220 --> 3:49:54.500]  back and answers with you're going to be spending all this money to build this
[3:49:54.500 --> 3:49:57.060]  all right that's why I mean you gotta love that guy I mean that that's just
[3:49:57.060 --> 3:50:00.020]  hilarious what he's telling it like it is let's go to a couple collars now we
[3:50:00.020 --> 3:50:03.300]  got Hector in Texas uh wants to know audit the fed did it
[3:50:03.300 --> 3:50:07.780]  secretly happen Hector what kind of news do you have on audit the fed

[3:50:25.540 --> 3:50:29.940]  secretly and that they may have found up to 800 trillion dollars worth of hidden
[3:50:29.940 --> 3:50:34.420]  gold and that general dunford has even used
[3:50:34.420 --> 3:50:38.900]  the special forces to close the fed on the east coast and reset up shop in salt
[3:50:38.900 --> 3:50:42.660]  lake city and that they're secretly creating federal greenbacks that are
[3:50:42.660 --> 3:50:45.780]  non-interest bearing to the american people and
[3:50:45.780 --> 3:50:49.700]  that will actually be backed by gold well maybe that's why the secret meeting
[3:50:49.700 --> 3:50:53.140]  happened between obama and yellen uh we know we don't know what happened
[3:50:53.140 --> 3:50:55.620]  because they're keeping it secret because that's the way this

[3:54:15.540 --> 3:54:18.420]  missus theam we took a look we took a little
[3:54:18.420 --> 3:54:22.740]  for audit the fed did it really happen and i didn't find anything on that on
[3:54:22.740 --> 3:54:25.460]  google but i'm gonna do some more searches after this show and see what i
[3:54:25.460 --> 3:54:27.940]  could find but i did run across this from politico
[3:54:27.940 --> 3:54:32.180]  trump doubles down on deportation says that yes absolutely they're going to
[3:54:32.180 --> 3:54:34.900]  be deported look we either have a country or we don't
[3:54:34.900 --> 3:54:38.580]  we have many illegals in this country we have to get them out and go through the
[3:54:38.580 --> 3:54:41.460]  process go through a system and the ones who have done well and really achieve
[3:54:41.460 --> 3:54:44.740]  we want to bring them back and now some economists believe doing this
[3:54:44.740 --> 3:54:47.620]  especially in a single year would dramatically reduce the gdp and send
[3:54:47.620 --> 3:54:49.940]  the us into recession possibly depression
[3:54:49.940 --> 3:54:53.060]  this could be because many of the jobs done by immigrants in restaurants
[3:54:53.060 --> 3:54:57.220]  hotels would go unfilled i don't know if i believe that i worked as a cook
[3:54:57.220 --> 3:55:00.660]  and a dish dog in a restaurant for a couple years while i was in college
[3:55:00.660 --> 3:55:04.420]  and i delivered pizzas i mean i've done pretty much every low level job you
[3:55:04.420 --> 3:55:07.700]  could could do to make a little money while i was
[3:55:07.700 --> 3:55:11.540]  bettering myself and learning skills i mean i watched dishes at a hooters and
[3:55:11.540 --> 3:55:15.300]  worked my way up to the to the fry guy i think there's plenty of people that are
[3:55:15.300 --> 3:55:18.260]  going to fill jobs but here's the thing to look the port illegals
[3:55:18.260 --> 3:55:21.300]  employ veterans we've got a lot of homeless veterans right now
[3:55:21.300 --> 3:55:25.300]  and awesome alone laying under bridges sleeping outside they have nothing
[3:55:25.300 --> 3:55:28.180]  they're trying to make some kind of money on the side standing on corners
[3:55:28.180 --> 3:55:31.380]  these guys need jobs and they're sitting there saying they hold up signs hey
[3:55:31.380 --> 3:55:34.340]  looking for work i need something get rid of these guys that don't need to be
[3:55:34.340 --> 3:55:37.380]  here that want to sneak in the back door don't want to come through the proper
[3:55:37.380 --> 3:55:41.460]  process give these veterans who've already served their country a job
[3:55:41.460 --> 3:55:44.900]  and a chance to make something and let their country see them
[3:55:44.900 --> 3:55:47.780]  try to work for them as they did for their country we need to help these
[3:55:47.780 --> 3:55:50.900]  veterans out before we go and sit here and go well no these are
[3:55:50.900 --> 3:55:54.020]  only for these guys no we still got enough jobs here to help these guys out
[3:55:54.020 --> 3:55:57.860]  let's take care of our own people first i agree and then you have
[3:55:57.860 --> 3:56:03.620]  what's going on with uh well here here's an article here from usa today
[3:56:03.620 --> 3:56:07.860]  51 of immigrant-led households receive at least one kind of welfare i believe
[3:56:07.860 --> 3:56:10.260]  you're going to come here illegally you shouldn't get welfare you shouldn't be
[3:56:10.260 --> 3:56:13.140]  able to get it you shouldn't even remotely qualify for it i don't think
[3:56:13.140 --> 3:56:16.900]  you should be able to get a license if i go to mexico and say i have a gun
[3:56:16.900 --> 3:56:20.500]  and in my trunk of my car well they're gonna put me in jail for what 14 months
[3:56:20.500 --> 3:56:24.180]  how long was the marine in jail for andrew tamors he wasn't there for about
[3:56:24.180 --> 3:56:27.540]  a year and a half almost it seemed like i mean he was there for a long time
[3:56:27.540 --> 3:56:31.780]  went through depression starvation for just taking a wrong turn
[3:56:31.780 --> 3:56:36.100]  okay he wasn't even trying to immigrate into illegally into mexico
[3:56:36.100 --> 3:56:40.500]  he just took a wrong turn and here we're like hey let's open it up give
[3:56:40.500 --> 3:56:43.700]  give everybody welfare and you know and i i know if people are gonna come back
[3:56:43.700 --> 3:56:47.380]  more whites are on welfare i know i i think welfare should be set up as a way
[3:56:47.380 --> 3:56:50.660]  to get you to into a better place not as a place where you're
[3:56:50.660 --> 3:56:53.300]  going to sit and be on welfare it's just like it's just like with those big
[3:56:53.300 --> 3:56:57.380]  donald jobs yeah they're eight dollars an hour or whatever right it's not a job
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:56:59.700]  for you to stay and take care of your family yeah there's going to be some
[3:56:59.700 --> 3:57:03.300]  instances where some people just don't have anything else but that but that's
[3:57:03.300 --> 3:57:07.460]  a small percentage like the 0.03 percent of transgendered americans
[3:57:07.460 --> 3:57:11.140]  who want to be able to go use the men's bathroom or the women's bathroom
[3:57:11.140 --> 3:57:15.220]  that aren't that sick sorry we have more people we need to focus on the masses
[3:57:15.220 --> 3:57:18.260]  the people are here we need to worry about the two or three freaking
[3:57:18.260 --> 3:57:21.700]  you know thousand people who are all of a sudden offended by this because they
[3:57:21.700 --> 3:57:24.260]  can't do that get a job move on from mcdonald's
[3:57:24.260 --> 3:57:27.620]  go on to something else strive for better that's what all that's what america is
[3:57:27.620 --> 3:57:31.140]  all about the pursuit of happiness not the promise or the guarantee but the
[3:57:31.140 --> 3:57:34.980]  pursuit the try to do better and continue to move forward and you could go and
