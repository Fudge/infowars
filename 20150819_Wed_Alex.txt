[00:00.000 --> 00:12.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.960 --> 00:23.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones back
[00:23.120 --> 00:29.920]  in the saddle again here we are on this Wednesday the 19th day of August 2015 worldwide broadcast
[00:29.920 --> 00:36.240]  I am your host Alex Jones over Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is gonna talk election 2016 what

[00:41.120 --> 00:47.920]  of Dr. Martin Luther King will be joining us to talk baby part gate with Planned Parenthood and
[00:47.920 --> 00:54.400]  her criticism of the Soros Democratic Party controlled Black Lives Matters organization
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.400]  she'll be joining us for about 20 minutes in the third hour we will endeavor to have open phones
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.560]  quite a bit today on all of the incredibly important news that we're gonna be breaking down
[01:04.560 --> 01:07.920]  also I've got some comments at the start of the next segment briefly because I don't want to get
[01:07.920 --> 01:13.120]  too distracted with it in hindsight of the extended interview slash debate with David Duke
[01:13.120 --> 01:21.280]  yesterday that just left me with a weird taste in my mouth it was just it was surreal and I'll
[01:21.280 --> 01:26.240]  tell you why I have that take on it and where I was coming from trying to have a serious discussion
[01:26.240 --> 01:34.080]  and I overall just am not pleased with the outcome because well I'll break it down at
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.040]  the start of the next segment first off though one of the big issues we face is the establishment's
[01:39.040 --> 01:45.040]  decision to go past automation and bring in robots to replace humans even when humans do a better
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.480]  job this gives the globalist total control over society these are soldiers these are minions
[01:50.480 --> 01:56.640]  that will follow all their orders but also carry those out with an autonomous program leon macadoo
[01:56.640 --> 02:12.960]  reports the campaign for $15 minimum wage is gaining in strength with several u.s cities
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.440]  moving to double the pay rate for low-income workers unfortunately the very people fighting for 15
[02:19.440 --> 02:25.120]  are at the most risk of losing their jobs to automation the washington post made a startling
[02:25.120 --> 02:31.680]  front page admission raising the minimum wage to $15 could speed the arrival of robot powered
[02:31.680 --> 02:38.320]  restaurants killing millions of jobs in the industry that includes 5.4 million servers and
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.280]  cooks and many of the nation's 3.3 million cashiers especially at fast food restaurants
[02:45.280 --> 02:51.840]  about 30 percent of the restaurant industry's costs come from salaries so burger flipping robots
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.920]  become that much more cost competitive if the current federal minimum wage of 725 an hour is
[02:57.920 --> 03:04.000]  doubled and many chains are already at work looking for ingenious ways to take humans out of the
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.480]  picture today's robotic workforce is much smaller much cheaper and capable of doing a variety of
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.480]  jobs compared to the cost of an average annual salary for just about any worker including
[03:16.480 --> 03:22.160]  minimum wage employees the robotic workers one-time cost and near perfection in their job
[03:22.160 --> 03:29.360]  execution is a very appealing option to many employers a 2014 robotics business review article
[03:29.360 --> 03:36.000]  how robots will shape future employment and law estimates that by 2025 half of the jobs in the
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  united states will be performed by brilliant machines and intelligence systems here are just
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.400]  some of the jobs that'll be lost to automation pharmacists lawyers and paralegals astronauts
[03:48.400 --> 03:56.960]  store clerks cashiers drivers soldiers babysitters rescuers sports writers and other reporters
[03:56.960 --> 04:03.440]  marketers customer service and factory workers so the question is if these jobs are taken over
[04:03.440 --> 04:10.400]  by robots what will we do it's a difficult problem and i i was at a meeting where there were five
[04:10.400 --> 04:16.880]  noble prize-winning economists and all they wanted to talk about was this question what's the future
[04:16.880 --> 04:23.920]  of employment and the structure of the economy when most of what we call work now is being done by
[04:23.920 --> 04:31.200]  robots and unfortunately even though that was what they really cared about they had no suggestions
[04:31.200 --> 04:34.560]  you know you go to japan and there's no one taking your order you go to a vending machine
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.840]  and you order it and obviously the japanese economy has dealt with that automation poses a
[04:39.840 --> 04:45.840]  threat to millions of workers but it could create opportunities for a few and if the future looks
[04:45.840 --> 04:51.440]  more star trek than blade runner robots taking over our jobs and producing more than enough of
[04:51.440 --> 04:56.800]  everything that everyone needs might mean the whole paradigm of exchanging labor for pay
[04:56.800 --> 05:02.960]  starts to break down what if the need for work a danish politician has been convicted of racism
[05:02.960 --> 05:08.480]  for offending muslims former european parliament member mogans camry who currently serves as a
[05:08.480 --> 05:15.200]  danish people's party counselor was hit with a fine of what would equate about 1186 dollars here
[05:15.200 --> 05:21.440]  in the us for a tweet in which he compared radical islam to nazism muslims continue where hitler
[05:21.440 --> 05:26.560]  stopped only the same treatment that hitler got will change the situation the counselor tweeted
[05:26.560 --> 05:32.720]  this past july after the tweet was reported camry was charged under the criminal code racism clause
[05:32.720 --> 05:39.040]  two six six b paragraph one which makes it a crime to offend a group of people who were threatened
[05:39.040 --> 05:45.280]  insulted or degraded on account of race color national or ethnic origin religion or sexual
[05:45.280 --> 05:51.360]  orientation the law is based on the united nations directive maybe we should charge isis under the
[05:51.360 --> 05:57.680]  same clause and see if that stops them from killing people you can find more reports on info wars

[11:05.600 --> 11:09.200]  this is the heart of 1776
[11:12.160 --> 11:17.520]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this wednesday the 19th day of august 2015
[11:18.960 --> 11:26.240]  jesse ventura will join us in the second hour to give us his take on election 2016 he has been
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.120]  saying that donald trump's actually shaking the political system to its core i agree with that
[11:31.120 --> 11:38.240]  statement but is he a shill or is he for real hillary clinton continues to unravel and melt down
[11:38.240 --> 11:44.400]  in front of us uh with newt genridge coming out he's a big insider a globalist saying he doesn't
[11:44.400 --> 11:51.760]  think hillary will be the nominee you've got of course uh one of the main reporters from watergate
[11:51.760 --> 11:56.080]  bob woodward coming out two days ago and saying this looks like it's going to get a lot nastier
[11:56.080 --> 12:04.400]  and is nixonian and just monitoring this morning cnn fox msnbc all of them it was nixonian
[12:04.400 --> 12:11.680]  nixonian nixonian watergate watergate so it appears that large elements of the media establishment
[12:11.680 --> 12:17.120]  are turning against hillary clinton what does that really signify and she's got nine lives
[12:17.120 --> 12:23.600]  politically but you know she's used up a lot of those and the clintons are particularly nasty
[12:23.600 --> 12:28.480]  people are tired of being bullied around by them even inside the power structure and it would be good
[12:28.480 --> 12:34.800]  for america they were so arrogant to try to run hillary and jeb for both of these dynasties to just
[12:34.800 --> 12:42.480]  go away i mean this is not north korea where you hand down power to your kids and to their kids
[12:43.280 --> 12:49.440]  this is not england and you turn on the tabloid tv shows or the news you think we were the monarchy
[12:49.440 --> 12:55.680]  here i mean it's the prince's child was photographed by the media at the park it's so terrible the

[14:29.040 --> 14:35.280]  plus million email addresses and other personal info dumped by the hacker group they told actually
[14:35.280 --> 14:41.200]  madison to stop claiming that none of your personal data is held madison wooden so they've
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.800]  now released it and of course they're holding your personal data to authenticate the credit cards
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.640]  and then when you're going on and off the sites google's tracking that just understand everything
[14:54.640 --> 15:00.400]  on the internet is being recorded in fact and they can also plant stuff in there and that's what
[15:00.400 --> 15:04.080]  ashley madison is saying they're saying they're going over this database it looks like some
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.920]  stuff that may have been added well once it gets thrown out on the internet who knows i mean who
[15:09.920 --> 15:17.840]  knows who's really behind all of this i just know i'm not on it so unless somebody sticks my name in
[15:17.840 --> 15:25.600]  there oh boy truly amazing and then i was sent a link to this out of the oshkosh northwest

[16:00.720 --> 16:07.440]  and thank you now that's some of the news coming up i want to dive into hillary clinton first
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.400]  but getting back to david duke who was on the show for two hours or a little more than two hours
[16:12.400 --> 16:19.280]  well we don't count the breaks less than two hours yesterday and i wanted to have a debate
[16:19.280 --> 16:26.640]  slash serious discussion and duke said he would come on if i was civil and polite nice and he goes
[16:26.640 --> 16:32.480]  on all the other mainstream shows alternative shows and i thought you know i want to get him on
[16:33.040 --> 16:38.800]  to illustrate that what he's saying is less incendiary than what mecha la raza and racist
[16:38.800 --> 16:43.440]  black groups are saying but that doesn't mean i endorse what he's saying either and of course
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.680]  the leftist publications are now saying i'm buddies with david duke today we knew that would be said
[16:47.680 --> 16:55.360]  we expect him to lie like that what i what i came away was this and i wouldn't do it because it's
[16:55.360 --> 17:03.360]  disingenuous but i almost did it during the breaks out there when he wasn't on air he looked
[17:03.360 --> 17:10.400]  like a different person and it really was creeping me out that he puts this little angel eyes sweetie
[17:10.400 --> 17:16.800]  face hi i'm david duke alex i just want to help everybody and be nice and why are you cutting
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.640]  me short i want to be friendly you're courageous to have me on alex but don't cut me short and
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.400]  i'm not going to answer any of your questions or i'm going to spin them and then during the break
[17:26.400 --> 17:32.160]  he looked very wolfish i mean he's a pretty scary guy actually i mean i'll hand that to him uh he's
[17:32.160 --> 17:37.920]  an intimidating looking fellow especially when he wasn't playing mr kutzi and then i was talking to
[17:37.920 --> 17:42.240]  some business people that are pretty high power here in austin i'm not going to get into it last
[17:42.240 --> 17:47.120]  night and they were like oh yeah david duke's in business in austin texas and blah blah blah i had
[17:47.120 --> 17:55.680]  no idea how successful this guy is um i mean there's a lot more than meets the eye with david duke
[17:55.680 --> 17:59.600]  i could tell you that and and you know i was kind of like some caller called in about david duke
[17:59.600 --> 18:04.800]  like last friday i just kind of shot my mouth off and said yeah i want to get him on and uh we'll
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.720]  have a debate and then duke wanted to talk to me before he'd come on i guess it was monday so
[18:10.720 --> 18:16.160]  talk to him about 25 minutes i had to get off the phone he's being so friendly and so nice and
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.240]  saying nice things about donald trump and all this other stuff and then once he got on air
[18:21.920 --> 18:27.680]  polished politician is what i think i'd say and i wanted to have a real discussion with him because
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.080]  i want to get if i could get lucifer con on i would i've invited him on i've tried to get other
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.320]  leaders the nation of islam on because i agree with a lot of what they say you should keep your
[18:36.320 --> 18:41.520]  business in your local community i want to empower communities there's nothing wrong with people
[18:41.520 --> 18:45.200]  wanting to have their own culture and entity if they want to go outside their culture that's fine
[18:45.200 --> 18:50.480]  too as well i'm a libertarian but i don't agree with a lot of stuff that the nation of islam says as
[18:50.480 --> 18:59.200]  well i think i had the texas had the nation islam on like 16 17 years ago for a two-hour interview
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.720]  and they were pretty much nice on air but put out their talking points but once
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.680]  they had a couple big luxury catalogs the folks were piling into once i took them downstairs
[19:13.680 --> 19:20.880]  and said thanks bye it was kind of like a thing like listen you're white and you know you may talk
[19:20.880 --> 19:25.360]  about some of the stuff fair con doesn't want to empower black people but we're not on friendly terms
[19:27.440 --> 19:33.280]  and they were like big strong tough you know you dressed up black guys and i and it just clicked
[19:33.280 --> 19:36.800]  they're in their group they're into that that's what they're gonna do the same thing would do
[19:36.800 --> 19:43.440]  i mean it's just his his cult his deal that's it promote what he's doing and put talking points
[19:43.440 --> 19:49.920]  out and never really respond and address that the left is covertly pushing the real racist agenda

[24:26.240 --> 24:31.920]  die-off found in u.s stream samples second yosemite turris diagnosed with a plague
[24:34.560 --> 24:37.440]  this is the type of news and information
[24:40.560 --> 24:47.680]  that basically illustrates how much trouble human society and the environments in first
[24:47.680 --> 24:53.040]  almost fully formed human brain grown in lab i mentioned this earlier doctors discover 40 year
[24:53.040 --> 25:04.720]  old twin growing inside woman's body animal magic meet the five-year-old girl who can hypnotize
[25:04.720 --> 25:11.840]  creatures with the stroke of her hand little asian girl there are so many positive things
[25:11.840 --> 25:17.200]  there are so many negative things there are so many fantastic things in this universe in this
[25:17.200 --> 25:24.240]  world and there's so many incredible challenges that we as a species face
[25:27.040 --> 25:31.440]  and with genetic engineering and nanotech and all the things that have already happened
[25:32.400 --> 25:38.880]  and the fact that robotics are being brought into place to make humans obsolete and the globalist
[25:38.880 --> 25:45.760]  openly write books saying this is the plan we don't have time to fight with each other over what
[25:45.760 --> 25:51.760]  color we are or what culture or background we're from and yes there are differences on average
[25:51.760 --> 25:58.560]  in groups of people and yes the it's classical for people to be tribal and fight with each other
[25:59.200 --> 26:02.960]  i mean german tribes all fought with each other african tribes all fought with each other
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.720]  mesoamerican tribes all fought with each other it's actually natural and normal
[26:09.920 --> 26:13.440]  and the globalist put out the idea that we're all on one spaceship together we've got to come
[26:13.440 --> 26:19.600]  together then they double cross that idea that christians and real liberals and people that
[26:19.600 --> 26:27.120]  believe in humanity buy into we stand down and then aren't racist and then the establishment
[26:27.120 --> 26:33.120]  uses divide and conquer to make it even worse than it was before and that's the great betrayal and i
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.000]  wanted to try to have david duke on because he's moderated a lot over the last few decades
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.240]  to try to say do you see the eugenics angle do you see the secret eugenics do you understand
[26:44.240 --> 26:50.160]  the larger points that everyone's being targeted with florida and that margaret sanger wanted to
[26:50.160 --> 26:56.560]  kill all the black people and was funded by the rockefellers who are heavily tied in with what
[26:56.560 --> 27:04.240]  you call the jewish agenda there's something else going on here and what about hitler
[27:04.240 --> 27:11.680]  trying to overthrow the u.s with the bushes and the haramans and others in the 30s that came out
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.080]  in the kormick dickstein committee spandley butler blew the whistle on they tried to hire him
[27:16.960 --> 27:23.600]  that was admitted and he said there is never been any of that that's never happened that's not true
[27:23.600 --> 27:38.880]  so it's just frustrating and then duke would sit there and say you're not giving me enough time
[27:38.880 --> 27:45.520]  you said you give me equal time we went back and looked yesterday he got like i said about 60 of the
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.200]  time if you don't count the bumper music coming in and so fine that's what i mean it's always this
[27:51.200 --> 27:58.800]  victimology where so the poor the poor jews run it all crowd is being censored when that's not what
[27:58.800 --> 28:06.400]  i did having him on the show it's inherent this whole act that oh i'm sweet and i'm nice and
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.360]  i'm loving and i'm good and you're cutting me off and let me talk let me talk let me talk
[28:11.360 --> 28:21.840]  as an act of domination as a debate tactic where perception dominates reality and now i've censored
[28:21.840 --> 28:29.520]  david duke by having him on the broadcast and giving him more than half the time that's an inverted
[28:29.520 --> 28:37.040]  reality and i realized that i'm not going to wake up the nation of islam i'm not going to wake up
[28:37.040 --> 28:45.040]  david duke i've just got to reach out to people that aren't invested in the particular sliver of
[28:45.040 --> 28:49.760]  the paradigm they're in of course from the black perspective you can say people are trying to genocide
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.720]  you and put drugs in your community and enslave you and ruin you and play you off and and have
[28:54.720 --> 29:00.480]  racist that work under the system uses a tool against you of course it's whites you can see the
[29:00.480 --> 29:06.880]  demonization the attacks all things that are going on and say the same thing all i'm saying
[29:06.880 --> 29:12.640]  is pull back from it and look at the larger issue i don't care if you're a white baby
[29:14.560 --> 29:19.200]  or a black baby or a whatever baby you're a human baby i don't want to see you shot up
[29:19.200 --> 29:24.320]  with a bunch of deadly vaccines i just inherently don't want that i'm not saying duke wants that
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.360]  either i wanted to try to have a real discussion but it's like having a discussion with hillary
[29:29.360 --> 29:35.040]  clinton or rick perry or something they're politicians they got talking points that are
[29:35.040 --> 29:41.920]  going to be put out and that's fine but i wasn't there trying to have a talking point discussion
[29:42.880 --> 29:47.360]  i wanted to get outside the box and talk about the technocracy now we'll look at the fall of hillary
[29:47.360 --> 29:53.680]  clinton that's accelerating when we come back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[29:53.680 --> 30:03.680]  the gcn radio network china has just begun a campaign they call cleansing the internet the
[30:03.680 --> 30:08.400]  long cyber war against free speech by the chinese government using their great firewall to block
[30:08.400 --> 30:14.640]  content and their great canon to attack websites has now gone physical 15 000 people have been
[30:14.640 --> 30:20.880]  arrested so far in their new campaign of monitoring and censorship but is the west much different
[30:21.440 --> 30:27.520]  spain just began finding people up to 30 000 euros for criticizing or photographing the government
[30:27.520 --> 30:33.440]  and it was just 10 months ago the federal elections commission nearly shut down free youtube videos
[30:33.440 --> 30:40.000]  that don't file campaign reports it didn't pass but the vote was three to three along party lines
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.280]  republican chairman goodman said quote government censors on the internet daily calling youtube
[30:45.280 --> 30:50.880]  video posts for violations of law is nothing short of a chinese censorship board but that's
[30:50.880 --> 30:56.480]  what the obama appointees supported and that's how dangerously close we are to chinese censorship

[33:09.600 --> 33:17.040]  but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply an extension of what began in the
[33:17.040 --> 33:22.640]  old one it has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint
[33:22.640 --> 33:29.280]  of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological
[33:29.280 --> 33:35.600]  advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every
[33:35.600 --> 33:48.160]  one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[33:48.160 --> 33:55.440]  this is mr romney wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth he's a citizen of the state but will
[33:55.440 --> 34:03.040]  soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of flesh and because he has a mind mr romney
[34:03.040 --> 34:15.280]  wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone we are live ladies and gentlemen
[34:15.280 --> 34:24.640]  broadcasting worldwide we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of
[34:24.640 --> 34:34.480]  the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show buckley who's one of the founders of info wars
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.960]  really 23 years ago when i was trying to get into media he was there from the very beginning helping
[34:38.960 --> 34:46.000]  me get on air you'll see his name on the credits of my first four films buckley hamon when i finally
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.840]  got to move down here a year ago to work at info wars back home in texas from chicago illinois
[34:51.840 --> 34:57.360]  i ran in here right before the show and he said you really want this article you sent the kit this
[34:57.360 --> 35:05.360]  morning you emailed posted obama shares mount rushmore was stalling an ad along highway 41
[35:07.360 --> 35:14.320]  this out of oscosh and i said yeah and he said all right well we've highlighted it it says all
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.240]  these horrible things about you and it was in that moment that i realized subconsciously and
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.880]  also consciously i just really don't care what matters is is that whoever put up this billboard
[35:26.880 --> 35:33.200]  promoting info wars dot com and that obama's real father is frank marshall davis took action
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.360]  and i'm not bashing buckley telling the story i'm just i'm just telling it as it happened
[35:41.040 --> 35:48.240]  but it just shows how second nature it's become for me to not care when they say i'm behind the
[35:48.240 --> 35:54.080]  boston bombing or i influenced that or i want to kill cops or i'm a racist or whatever it's just
[35:54.080 --> 36:00.560]  not true and so this is a sign of our success and our victory this sniveling evil article
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.440]  i sent the kit to be posted knowing everyone will see through it
[36:08.320 --> 36:10.480]  and because i wanted to be reminded today
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.080]  to read the article on air not because it's about info wars dot com but because it's about
[36:18.080 --> 36:25.520]  the tactics of mainstream media dinosaurs to just basically say i'm behind every violent action
[36:25.520 --> 36:39.120]  since jesus was crucified and basically saying jones billboard company should not have taken
[36:39.120 --> 36:45.520]  the money to put this up and they're trying to find out who did it i bet money whoever did it
[36:45.520 --> 36:50.880]  doesn't even care if they're found out but it's all part of an intimidation campaign
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.080]  that we're going to say you're linked to murder if you criticize
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.280]  jamie fox's lord and savior barack obama
[37:04.160 --> 37:07.520]  and so that's why we posted the article and maybe i'm wrong
[37:07.520 --> 37:16.160]  to post people attacking us when they do it all the time most of the time when cnn or msmc
[37:16.160 --> 37:21.840]  attacks me weekly we don't even play it or cover it rush limbaugh does when he gets attacked
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.720]  ought to copy him and do it because it is popular it is interesting it makes a sound bag but i only
[37:26.720 --> 37:35.440]  play or read a fraction of the attacks here and i only do it to illustrate the tactics that they
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.320]  use but i salute whoever put this up we should probably write a blurb at the bottom though
[37:40.320 --> 37:48.240]  that says uh the point at the top about search who obama's real father is the top link of course
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.960]  is that it's frank marshall davis which is hands down true hiding in plain view i can't believe
[37:52.960 --> 37:57.920]  we missed it that's why obama again said when he was the editor of the harvard law review
[37:57.920 --> 38:05.840]  you in 12 issues i was born in kenya that's why his wife in two speeches the year he first
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.280]  ran said he was born in kenya they're returning to his homeland so that we would then when they
[38:11.280 --> 38:16.160]  said he wasn't go yes you were then they put out a fake birth certificate that's obviously fake
[38:16.160 --> 38:22.640]  so we'd take the bait like idiots i got fooled i just knew it was a fake birth certificate
[38:22.640 --> 38:32.800]  and then insiders leaked the info and the porno mags from the 50s and 60s with his mama with
[38:32.800 --> 38:37.520]  frank marshall davis posing on the house in the house on the couch with the same paintings
[38:37.520 --> 38:42.080]  that obama's photographed with frank marshall davis sitting on with his grandfather and in
[38:42.080 --> 38:49.440]  his own book dreams of my father he admits he would live with him in the summer and was his
[38:49.440 --> 38:54.960]  father's best friend a famous communist we sell the dvd at info wars store.com
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.920]  dreams from my real father it's just so crazy and i know i talk about this all the time i just
[39:01.920 --> 39:09.520]  cannot believe how truth is so much stranger than fiction so we're like you say you were born there
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.880]  you say it the forward to to books you forwarded you say at the harvard law review you were the
[39:14.880 --> 39:21.360]  editor of uh in the front blurb about you know the young editor your wife says it you your family
[39:21.360 --> 39:30.560]  says it but your dad looks nothing like you his father the communist the the the economist his
[39:30.560 --> 39:38.480]  fake father was incredibly black african you know handsome black african man but just super black
[39:38.480 --> 39:44.880]  black obama looks nothing like him not the bone structure not the eyes frank marshall davis
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.480]  that's your daddy it's like if you saw my dad you'd go ben that's alex jones's dad
[39:56.480 --> 40:06.080]  it's ridiculous it's absolutely obvious and then he lived with him for over a decade he spent every
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.440]  summer when he lived in hawaii with daddy who do you stay with on the summer when you're out of school
[40:11.440 --> 40:20.560]  do you stay with daddy and i've got stacks of news i don't know why i just digressed off into that
[40:20.560 --> 40:28.400]  it's it's just this billboard promotes info wars dot com and dreams of my real father great job
[40:28.400 --> 40:37.920]  that's why i said make whatever billboard you want you're going to stuff better than i am
[40:37.920 --> 40:44.800]  so later i'm going to read this in fact make me read this because i said i would and go over
[40:44.800 --> 40:50.160]  first off let's get into hillary clinton here this is kind of a mashup of her yesterday uh
[40:50.160 --> 40:56.720]  defending the emails clinton fires back over email gate here it is there's nothing to do with me
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.680]  and it has nothing to do with the fact that my account was personal it's the process by which
[41:01.680 --> 41:07.680]  the government and sometimes in disagreement between various agencies of the government
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.320]  make decisions about what can and cannot be disclosed in retrospect this didn't turn out
[41:12.320 --> 41:18.000]  to be convenient at all and i regret that this has become such a a cause celebra but that does
[41:18.000 --> 41:25.680]  not change the facts and no matter what anybody tries to say the facts are stubborn what i did
[41:25.680 --> 41:35.120]  was legally permitted number one first and foremost okay number two i turned over out of an abundance
[41:35.120 --> 41:42.560]  of uh an attempt to be helpful over anything that i thought was even vaguely related in fact
[41:42.560 --> 41:47.680]  they've already concluded 12 more than 1200 of the emails i gave them have nothing to do with
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.760]  the work whether it was a personal account or a government account i did not send classified
[41:53.760 --> 42:00.160]  material and i did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified which is the
[42:00.160 --> 42:07.680]  way you know whether something is what you're seeing now is a disagreement between agencies saying
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.240]  you know what they should have and the other saying no they shouldn't that has nothing to do
[42:12.240 --> 42:18.880]  with me in order to be as cooperative as possible we have turned over the server they can do whatever
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.240]  they want to with the server to figure out what's there what's not there that's for the you know
[42:24.240 --> 42:30.160]  people investigating it to try to figure out but we turned over everything that was work related
[42:30.160 --> 42:39.200]  every single thing personal stuff we did not i had no obligation to do so and did not lisa
[42:39.200 --> 42:46.800]  jackson the head of the epa had to step down for a secret email account not classified material a
[42:46.800 --> 42:54.240]  secret email account to get around the four-year loss freedom of information act in 1947 the cia
[42:54.240 --> 42:58.960]  wanted to be totally secret and operate people said that's dangerous that'll breed corruption and
[42:58.960 --> 43:04.640]  stealing and a takeover of government they said don't worry every five 10 15 or 20 years depending
[43:04.640 --> 43:10.960]  on how we designate it it will be declassified no matter what it's now how many years after
[43:10.960 --> 43:26.080]  kennedy got his head blown off 42 almost 42 years 1963 2015 it's all classified national security
[43:27.520 --> 43:35.680]  40 plus years later now they don't release basically anything and she's up there saying
[43:35.680 --> 43:40.880]  oh i didn't do anything wrong it wasn't marked secret whenever they've caught people in the
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.760]  congressional archives or in classified areas remember the clinton official got caught doing it
[43:45.760 --> 43:53.360]  sticking the papers sandy burger in his socks he would take this the secret sheet and leave it
[43:53.360 --> 43:58.240]  because you couldn't copy it in there and pull them out and stick them in his his clothes and when
[43:58.240 --> 44:05.680]  he got caught later he said he didn't get in trouble he said oh but it didn't have the top secret
[44:05.680 --> 44:12.640]  sheet on it these games they play that's more premeditation that they're sending classified
[44:12.640 --> 44:18.560]  stuff around and not having the cover sheet on it that's a felony right there i mean these laws
[44:18.560 --> 44:24.560]  are in stone she's obstructing wiping the hard drives she is i mean it just goes on and on
[44:24.560 --> 44:32.160]  obstructing removing the documents altering the documents having a secret email using code names
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.080]  remember what happened to the head of the epa just just type in a search engine
[44:38.080 --> 44:44.560]  head of epa has to step down over secret email there it is newly released email show epa
[44:44.560 --> 44:52.400]  director's extensive use of fictional alter ego lisa jackson hillary has done this in spades
[44:52.400 --> 44:57.520]  she is a criminal if she gets away with this she can get away with anything
[44:58.480 --> 45:07.760]  epa chief lisa jackson steps down after four fiery years not one not two not three but four years
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.680]  where she was running off shot shutting down power plants harassing our last mines shut down under
[45:13.680 --> 45:19.680]  her our last lead smelting plant shut down under her i mean you wonder why i can't get a job in this
[45:19.680 --> 45:28.080]  country companies can't come here to get raw material finished you see we ship raw material out
[45:28.080 --> 45:34.720]  but there's no finishing allowed for industrial use has begun in china that's a strategic move
[45:36.240 --> 45:40.160]  so we have a lot of the rare earth minerals we have a lot of the actual metals we have a
[45:40.160 --> 45:46.240]  lot of the raw material but you can't value added here you cannot value added here and compete in
[45:46.240 --> 45:52.800]  the marketplace because you can build a lead plant you can build a steel plant you can build
[45:52.800 --> 46:01.040]  a coal plant but we will bankrupt you you mean to play the obama quote we will bankrupt you i mean
[46:01.040 --> 46:08.640]  that's the arrogance of these people we will bankrupt you and then when the economy goes
[46:08.640 --> 46:15.120]  under we'll give ourselves trillions of dollars and give it to offshore banks and then sit around
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.040]  and tell you how we're saving the world and saving saving the economy and unless you forget
[46:19.040 --> 46:22.720]  here's the clip from last friday those clips were from yesterday evening here's the clip
[46:22.720 --> 46:27.920]  from last friday where she said hey you know what's fantastic you know what's wonderful that's all i
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.120]  could say she said it's wonderful you know i started using snapchat it's great it disappears
[46:33.120 --> 46:40.880]  on its own making a joke about her crimes here it is so i am delighted delighted to be here with you
[46:40.880 --> 46:47.040]  and with my fellow candidates and i know that people across the country are following us on
[46:47.040 --> 46:56.480]  social media as well by the way you may have seen that i recently launched a snapchat account
[46:56.480 --> 47:06.560]  i love it i love it those messages disappear all by themselves
[47:13.680 --> 47:18.720]  if they're not punished it sends the messages to criminals throughout the system you can get away
[47:18.720 --> 47:27.760]  with whatever you want you can do whatever you want it's truly frustrating
[47:29.600 --> 47:36.160]  but that's the arrogance that's the hutzpah that's the bravada that's the hubris
[47:39.200 --> 47:43.600]  that these people have and they think we're stupid and i think we're done and i think
[47:43.600 --> 47:50.720]  that there's basically anything they can get away with and why not from Missouri to California from
[47:50.720 --> 47:58.880]  texas to michigan to california they're coming in with zoning saying no family single family homes
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.160]  and if you try to build one they won't give you the zoning and you can sue them and even if you do
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.920]  they're going to raise taxes on you so you live in a 500 square foot home if you got three kids a
[48:09.920 --> 48:17.920]  250 square foot coffin if you're a single person and then they can charge you almost your entire
[48:17.920 --> 48:23.040]  paycheck in regulations rent and property taxes to manage and run your life and they
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.160]  admitted all this 30 years ago in club of rome publications and now we're living it
[48:29.840 --> 48:35.840]  where the city of austin won't let you put a fence around your house of any type basically now
[48:35.840 --> 48:39.840]  you have to sue them there's there's not even a law they just say it's their policy
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.040]  and they've got our kids in the public schools that's why they're so arrogant they can get away
[48:49.040 --> 48:56.800]  with anything until we just stop complying and start saying no it's selling fast it sold out for
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.120]  about a week and a half but i brought it back as soon as the shipment came in and that's silver
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.080]  bullet the highest quality colloidal silver you're going to find out there anywhere normally 1995
[49:06.080 --> 49:15.120]  you can get it for 30% off when you buy a single bottle or buy two bottles and get two free you
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.120]  will not find high quality colloidal silver 30 parts per million anywhere for anywhere near this
[49:21.120 --> 49:33.120]  cost that comes out to 995 a bottle when you buy to get to free it is an unprecedented sale
[49:33.120 --> 49:39.120]  and i'm going to run it until silver bullet sells out because we're getting better about our supply
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.920]  pipeline more is coming in in about three four weeks and i think it'll probably sell out in a week

[54:16.800 --> 54:25.440]  higher and it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of fire so we have massive global
[54:25.440 --> 54:33.280]  developments we have secret high altitude weather engineering going on geoengineering on a mass scale
[54:33.280 --> 54:39.280]  that's classified we've got the water and food being manipulated uh we've got al qaeda being put
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.880]  in charge with isis of large areas of the middle east the the former defense intelligence chief
[54:44.880 --> 54:51.840]  who just quit a few months ago goes on tv and says we were ordered to fund isis no one gets in
[54:51.840 --> 54:58.640]  trouble another general goes public warning the public no one gets in trouble they're shutting
[54:58.640 --> 55:05.520]  off our energy grid they're opening our borders it'd be like if an asteroid was coming to destroy
[55:05.520 --> 55:13.040]  the earth would humanity come together to put the technology we need together and the resources
[55:13.040 --> 55:18.320]  to go up there and remove the asteroid either put rockets on it and get it out of the way or blow it
[55:18.320 --> 55:28.240]  up destroy it because basically metaphorically that's what we're facing and that's why i don't
[55:28.240 --> 55:34.480]  want to fight with the mecheloraza people i don't want to fight with the uh white nationalist
[55:34.480 --> 55:39.040]  david duke i don't want to fight with the nation of islam i don't want to fight with the catholics
[55:39.040 --> 55:46.560]  and the jews and it's just stupid and i get in resource wars tribalism is a great way to get
[55:46.560 --> 55:52.800]  people to go your way but it's going to destroy us in the end and the globalists have totally
[55:52.800 --> 55:57.520]  betrayed the people that followed them the globalists sold the idea of working together and not being
[55:57.520 --> 56:04.320]  racist to try to build this system and it was always there to just to make it even worse and
[56:04.320 --> 56:17.600]  that's why it's evil that's why it's out of control that's why i have such a big problem
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.400]  with people that i try to talk to about this and they just go oh you're a conspiracy theorist about
[56:24.400 --> 56:32.080]  all this and i'm like no there's a whole program a hundred times bigger than the manhattan project
[56:32.080 --> 56:40.000]  real wide and just what we know about it is thousands of trillions have been committed to it
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.480]  in the future over a hundred trillions clearly been spent or more that's a conservative estimate
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.440]  it looks like a breakaway civilization with an attempt to get ai in control
[56:51.440 --> 56:58.080]  and just end humanity as we know it and i know i've said that five hundred times but i'll say it
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.760]  again that's what the globalists are telling us is coming it's fantastical it's amazing
[57:03.760 --> 57:09.920]  they've got cern that can open up different dimensions and create black holes and interdimensional
[57:09.920 --> 57:19.600]  vortexes they admit that we're we're reaching the atlantic end moment and everyone can feel
[57:19.600 --> 57:27.120]  it in their gut everyone can see what's going on can understand what's happening they've proven
[57:27.120 --> 57:32.240]  humans have connections telepathically to each other and animals daily males reporting on that
[57:32.240 --> 57:41.280]  today there's just a lot of stuff going on that the establishment doesn't want us to think about
[57:41.280 --> 57:47.840]  because if we do we'll transcend them by seeing how pathetic they are and i just don't want to fight
[57:47.840 --> 57:52.320]  with everybody anymore i don't want to fight with the cops people noticed the last four or five years
[57:52.320 --> 57:56.800]  i've backed off the police because they're in the same brainwash manipulated position everybody
[57:56.800 --> 58:03.760]  else is there's good ones there's bad ones and but they're humans and we're all in this together
[58:04.560 --> 58:12.880]  i'm tired of it i'm sick of gaming the system i want to stop the system i'm sick of people that
[58:12.880 --> 58:20.080]  want to play within the paradigm i'm sick of it i'm sick of people that think because they can
[58:20.080 --> 58:24.480]  manipulate the system they're getting ahead it's like cancer if it had a consciousness would think
[58:24.480 --> 58:29.520]  it was dominating would think it was taking over would think it was in control but it's not you're
[58:29.520 --> 58:34.480]  going to kill the host even if you're a parasite you shouldn't be for this system but it's the

[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:15.600]  China rocked the world's financial markets this week by devaluing its currency for three days
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:22.080]  in a row the biggest evaluation they've had in two decades but 41 years ago nixon announced
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:27.280]  executive orders that rocked the world with not only currency devaluation but created a new
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:34.560]  currency world order in august 1971 nixon announced a series of policies created by executive order
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.120]  and remembered by historians as the nixon shock it's still felt by average americans along with
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.320]  the repercussions of nixon and kissinger secretly laying the groundwork in china a month earlier
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.320]  that would decimate american manufacturing and leave us a debtor to china i have directed secretary
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.240]  connelly to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar in the gold nixon enacted wage and
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:04.240]  price controls he imposed a 10 import tax and he devalued us currency by breaking the breton
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.320]  woods agreement that had tied 44 nations currency to a us dollar that was redeemable in gold well
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.440]  when the president does it that means that it is not illegal nixon portrayed the move as protecting
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.120]  americans from speculators in recent weeks the speculators have been waging an all-out war
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.360]  on the american dollar nixon lied it wasn't foreign speculators manipulating and destroying the
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.400]  dollar it was a private federal reserve that was destroying the dollar's value and the fed
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.280]  did so with the full agreement and cooperation of the government ignoring the breton woods agreement
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.560]  to tie the dollar to gold before world war two ended western nations had agreed at breton woods
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.680]  new hampshire to tie their currencies to the u.s dollar which would in turn be tied to gold at the
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.640]  time the u.s was economically dominant and had over 50 percent of the world's gold but the federal
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.200]  reserve ignored the link to gold and had been printing more currency than the u.s had gold to
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.880]  back for years the fiat dollars are being used to finance the warfare welfare state of vietnam
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.840]  and great society socialism five years before nixon declared breton woods dead the disparity of
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.720]  paper to gold had grown to the point of foreign banks holding 14 billion dollars in paper money
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.520]  from the federal reserve while the u.s only had three billion dollars worth of gold to cover it
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.520]  your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today one month before the nixon's shock
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.120]  henry kissinger secretly went to china 41 years later we see the fruit of that opening multinational
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.360]  corporations joining with communist lords to use the chinese people as slave labor slave wages are
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.960]  just one of many components of china's low cost of production known as the china price the china
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.080]  price also includes copyright violations disregard for the health of workers or the environment
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:57.760]  and an undervalued currency let me rate arrest the bugaboo of what is called defaluation if you
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:04.880]  want to buy a foreign car or take a trip abroad market conditions may cause your dollar to buy
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:13.200]  slightly less but if you are among the overwhelming majority of americans who buy american made
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.400]  products in america well the overwhelming majority of americans don't buy american made
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.600]  products do they most of our products are now made in china thanks to kissinger and his bill
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.640]  de burg buddies so for too long the united states has entered into trade deals on the promise of
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:36.640]  economic bounty only to see workers impoverished industries disappear and the dollar of 2015
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:43.280]  isn't worth what the dollar of 1971 was in fact it takes six 2015 dollars to buy what one dollar
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.280]  could buy in 1971 in other words the dollar has lost 83 percent of its value since nixon quote
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.120]  unquote protected it from speculators your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is the
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.160]  day now these same globalist politicians and multinational corporations who've robbed us with
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.200]  the china price for the last 41 years are ready to unleash something else they've been working on
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:13.120]  in secret the trans specific transatlantic partnerships here's a breathtaking event uh it
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:20.960]  says it's designed to promote the international movement of people services and products basically
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:27.600]  the same language used to start the european union these trade treaties will not only accelerate the
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.880]  concentration of global wealth but will give us global governance and the china trade and balance
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:40.240]  they began creating 41 years ago is being used to justify tpp and ttip just as nixon lied when he
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.440]  said he was protecting americans from speculators these trade treaties are just a head fake they
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.240]  won't help us to compete with the china price and as senator sessions has pointed out after the treaty
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.840]  passes china can be added to the transnational governance committee without approval from
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.800]  member nations they'll be back great job david night there's a new report on info wars dot com blood

[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.000]  into trump uh well i'm just waiting for the eighth circuit court of appeals you know with
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.920]  my court case they're due to here at some time in september we've had three extensions so we
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.600]  should be at the top of the list i'm hoping and hopefully we'll get resolved to the court issue
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:41.440]  of uh of whether uh these 33 media conglomerates will prevail and take away unjust enrichment
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.440]  which will allow them to defame people and do it for profit business and money or whether the courts
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.600]  will stand up and say that the first amendment does not protect wrongdoing just as it does not
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:59.600]  protect running into a crowded theater and yelling fire you know there are limits to the first
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:05.680]  amendment and i and i believe strongly that it's not there to protect wrongdoing and make wrongdoing
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:11.200]  profitable which is what the mainstream media people want but other than that alex i'm just uh
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:17.520]  biden my time doing my off the grid show and staying up on the issues as best i can and uh
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.720]  getting ready to uh head back south of the border that is if i don't have to cross a wall to get
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:30.400]  there but governor i know balha is great you're retired you've been a i'm not retired well i mean
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.680]  retired from politics but we'd like you to get back into it the big question people want to ask
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.280]  is don't go to mexico stay here get involved in the election even if you don't run get out there and
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:48.240]  get involved politically no alex no because it's too early that's the one big thing they're missing
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.640]  the point that i'm stating i'm stating we need to pass a law that doesn't allow elections to
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.400]  happen until the year that they happen you can't form a committee you can't raise money you can't
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:09.120]  do nothing to get elected until 2016 i mean this is so absurd by the time the president
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:19.120]  takes office in january of 2017 does that mean the run for 2020 will begin well i get your point
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.560]  that it becomes a continuous political process i understand that if i get in the race now i'm
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:31.120]  wasting money i'm wasting time i'm wasting effort if i'm gonna get in i'll wait until june i'll wait
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:37.200]  till the pikers are gone you wait till they're down to two people then you come in i agree with
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.320]  that statement you were just talking about going back to mexico i am going back to mexico i always
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.320]  do in the winter what do you think i'm gonna sit up here in the snow and what go ice fishing all
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:58.640]  winter maybe we can just i'll be keeping alex if i win the presidency i'm liable to move the
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.560]  lighthouse down there for the winter i was about to say why don't we just annex uh bahaha it might
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:10.480]  not be a bad that well because then the taxes would go way up you know right right now the
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.160]  taxes down there are wonderful and uh the whole taxing system believe it or not is better than ours
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.960]  uh down in mexico when you pay your property taxes they're due in march if you pay them in
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.000]  january they knock off 20 percent if you do them in february they knock off 10 percent
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.120]  i talked to three people three people today at age 65 your property taxes are automatically
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.120]  cut in half if you're a mexican citizen well that's that makes sense our taxes are obviously way too
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.440]  high right here in austin i talked to systems wrong alex i know i talked with three people here i
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.000]  talked to three different people today all of which had their property tax go up more than 16
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.440]  percent last year and the housing market is not growing any more than it was before it's a total
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:05.520]  scam oh yeah and property taxes technically they're only to pay for your services your roads your police
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:13.040]  and your fire protection that's what property taxes were designed to pay for and our system is so
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:19.520]  wrong here if you buy a home here and fix it up and make it better they penalize you for good behavior
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:28.080]  you pay more now let's get into trump i threw that question out your breakdown and i want you to
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.280]  really speak to donald trump this campaign the hillary clinton email scandal where you think
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:39.760]  election 2016 is headed right now well first of all i i don't agree with donald trump in a lot of
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:46.960]  his positions and that's fine but what i do agree on is what he's doing he is shaking the republican
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.640]  party to its core they don't know what to do with him he can't be bought these worth billions of
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.880]  dollars so they can't you know if you put trump in like i like to say if you put donald in the
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.800]  nascar suit the only thing on the front it'll say is trump that's right if you put any other of these
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.160]  characters in a nascar suit of who their donors are they'll be covered with stickers up and down
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:16.000]  their arms and legs of who owns them what would you be covered with nothing because i never i never
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.200]  took any pack money i didn't take any special interest money and i only took 50 and hundred
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:27.040]  dollar donations from regular people that's all i only raised 300 thousand dollars when i became
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.440]  governor of minnesota your nascar would say we the people probably everybody
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.640]  everybody that gave 50 bucks and that ain't gonna get you in the door let's keep talking about
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.520]  trump go ahead that aside i love that donald is shaking up the system and it takes someone like
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.360]  him with the financial wherewithal to be able to do that trump can't get bought they don't know what
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:59.360]  to do with him he's leading by double digits right now in the republican race and he's doing to the
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.840]  republicans what bernie sanders the independent is doing to the democrats they're dividing up and
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.000]  they're it's a an amazing thing it's what they did to the reform party what the dems and republics
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.560]  did to the report for form party a couple decades ago when Buchanan infiltrated with all of his people
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:24.560]  and became the nomination for president then destroyed the party well it's reversed now the
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:31.520]  two outsiders have come into the two major parties they've turned it into turmoil i love it and trump's
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:38.000]  leading and bernie's gaining and it's phenomenal i i'd love it if it ended up trump against bernie
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.440]  you know it really does stump me to wonder how this will all end up in your gut do you think
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:54.640]  trump is sincere uh yeah because he's he's this far into it now i cannot i i didn't think he'd do
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:00.880]  it in the first place but he's been into it now he's made every mistake you could possibly make
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:07.840]  and it hasn't hurt him and why well donald's not dumb donald and i have been friends now for
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:16.240]  20 25 years he came to minnesota to for a fundraiser for me and all this and and donald learned from
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:22.880]  what i did and when you watch him out there granted we don't agree i i'm totally opposite him on the
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:30.400]  immigration policy but we don't agree on everything but he learned he's he's speaking from the heart
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:38.880]  he's using nothing scripted and the people love that and they're tired of these hand-picked puppets
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:44.880]  that the democrats and republicans put forward every election for the last 40 to 50 years it
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:51.120]  doesn't matter if the dem wins or the republicans they're both paid off by the same people donald
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:58.080]  trump is not and and donald trump may have his flaws but in the big picture this is the best
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:04.160]  thing that could have happened to america we need a revolution and a revolution in our government
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:10.000]  and it doesn't have to be violent it can be done at the ballot box and trump and bernie sanders are
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:19.120]  doing that right now well it definitely shows the ultramassive anger and the political realignment
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.720]  the break the people are having with the system look at the last election the last national election
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:35.840]  only 36 voted 64 chose not to that's a huge majority and if trump and sanders tap into that
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:44.720]  64 percent they win to 64 is higher than 36 well you are a lot better than bernie sanders and i trust
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:50.960]  you more than trump the reason trump is having such success is he is exposing that a lot of the
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.440]  illegals that are coming in just like americans flee justice to mexico folks from latin america
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:03.200]  are fleeing justice here even cnn admits thousands of chinese women sometimes 10 000 a week come in
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:10.000]  come in on a visa for tourism have their baby and have it all paid for and then their kids a
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.760]  u.s citizen and chinese newspapers advertise come to america get everything for free now i
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.720]  agree the immigrants aren't the bad people overall and there are a lot of good ones but the people
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:26.320]  coming here to do that are being leeches and the politicians that allow those laws to be in place are
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:32.000]  and so are you ever going to see the perspective a little more like trump and i do about the fairness
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.520]  issue of these borders well then the first thing that you should do then alex you and donald should
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:43.840]  get together and lead the charge to take down the statue of liberty take it down
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.480]  jesse that's kind of a stop statement that's what welcomes these people to the country it says
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.960]  give us your poor give us your downtrod but they didn't get welfare before and they had to wait at
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:02.640]  ellis island for three months to make sure wait a minute alex every immigrant immigrant group in
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:10.320]  america has gone through the same thing be it the italians be it the irish whenever it happened
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:16.560]  they all went through the same thing nobody wanted them here everybody wanted them kicked out oh
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.120]  they're coming here they're taking a lot of that hollywood exaggerating it a lot of that hollywood
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:27.280]  exaggerating and well okay but take down the statue of liberty take it down well i mean
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:32.000]  it is an occult symbol from france maybe they should take it back well then then we should
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.120]  take that symbol down and and as i think we should melt it down and sell the scrap metal
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.320]  and import more illegals remember this remember this and all your listeners should people wear
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:50.640]  you this when you build a wall first of all it'll keep you in yes and and and if it's 20 feet i'll
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.520]  find someone with a 21-foot ladder and are you going to make it the death penalty of somebody
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.880]  let's debate this when we come back kill them governor stay there we'll be back with jesse

[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.400]  Jesse Ventura is our guest I agree with about 90% of his political views but the reason I like him
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.280]  is I know he's not controlled by special interest I know he's had the government come after him
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.720]  and censor his television program I know he really cares about this country and I know that they
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:45.200]  lied about him with the Chris Kyle book and then he stood up against it and was victorious and
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.920]  they're still coming after him and if people come after me with lies I'm going to expect
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:56.160]  my friends to stand up for me because I'm not a fair weather friend that said clearly there's a
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.880]  globalist industrial plan by the republican leadership mainly and the democrats to get cheap
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.640]  labor and to create political balkanization clearly immigrants to this nation german immigrants
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.880]  were treated bad by the english immigrants because the english immigrants treated those beneath them
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:16.400]  bad that's just classism and the italians and the irish and all the rest of it and and other
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.000]  immigrant groups that's chinese were treated terribly probably a million chinese dot building
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  the west so I welcome all these hardworking good people here the problem is the socialist the
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.400]  ford foundation admits it as a plan to bring in 50 60 million illegals from latin america predominantly
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.000]  have them basically all vote socialist vote to take the guns and it's game over and you
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.440]  incentivize with paying for the babies making the kids citizens and all this it's not fair
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.520]  i can't go to mexico have a baby with my wife and then we get to stay there and get welfare
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.640]  now that's what i'm saying i get ventura likes everybody i like everybody too
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.720]  so this is short segment governor i've had my two minutes you've got about three four minutes to
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.680]  lay out your position on this but i really think it's a cheap shot to say get rid of the statue of
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:14.000]  liberty well to me to me get rid of the statue of liberty put up the walls and we shouldn't let
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.880]  canada be immune if you're gonna roll off mexico roll off canada too because actually uh because
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:28.160]  the uh the 9 11 hijackers allegedly came down from canada and harmed us so let's be fair let's
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:36.160]  put walls on both sides keep out and uh and uh we'll end immigration and all that stuff and and
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:43.120]  i hope people are prepared to watch their food quadruple because uh it's those people that harvest
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:50.560]  our agriculture there are slave labor that we have in the country and it's going to end again i i'm
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:59.120]  not uh i'm not for illegal entry into the country but the point is it's the people who have been
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:06.000]  in charge that have created this problem by the laws that they pass the programs that are out there
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.040]  how should a sitter somebody who's not a citizen qualify for a government program
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:18.400]  that shouldn't happen but by the same token uh you put up all these walls and stuff well then
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:25.280]  that can keep you in too and do we really want to be the united states of east berlin and have
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.240]  tanks at the border and what what'll happen if you climb over the walls that you get shot
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:36.320]  is that the death penalty or what'll happen if i climb over it to go to mexico no i'm not saying
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:42.160]  we become checkpoint charlie what i'm saying is when these businesses hire illegals they get
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:48.960]  away to alex you said i could talk alex we are behaving right now if you read history we're just
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:58.000]  like 1930s germany we're looking to put blame on anyone but ourselves so the mexicans are the easy
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.840]  people to blame we blame them for oh they're causing all our welfare yet what's his name
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:10.880]  scott walker just gave the mill walkie bucks 250 million dollars of welfare to build a new arena
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:17.120]  while he took it from the university of wisconsin madison education to do it so it's perfectly
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:24.560]  fine for corporate welfare but getting back to it again if we're going to be that type of a country
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.560]  where we're going to put walls up and all that stuff and then we have to be like east berlin
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.680]  because you're going to have to enforce it and you're going to have to behave as such and and
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:41.440]  we'll tolerate nobody sneaking into the country and nobody sneaking out sure and and jessie i
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.880]  am giving you fair time here in fact more time than i'm getting to debate this i just wanted to
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.080]  interject the facts that there's six and a half billion people africa's population is going to
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.800]  1.2 billion the next decade latin america's is going close to a billion these countries are
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:01.520]  collapsing there are hundreds who are grounding a day trying to come in out of africa into europe
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.920]  and the argument is well we bombed kadafi so we deserve it i get that i was against that war
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.040]  the whole world's collapsing should the united states take a billion people and put them on
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:19.520]  welfare no absolutely not i mean i'm not for these walls and stuff what do we do we can't afford
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.320]  to even have our own people we can't even afford the corporate welfare to build the bucks a new
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:30.080]  stadium i agree don't build the new stadiums don't have banker bailouts and don't incentivize the
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.960]  giant third world population coming here but let's remember something the majority of the immigrants
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:42.560]  coming from are not from mexico now they're from central and south america i know i know
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:48.000]  where our wars have turned them into refugees and i was against those wars as are you let's
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.200]  talk about it more stay there stay there the empire's on the run jessie ventura giant alex
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:30:03.440]  jones and the gcn radio network china has just begun a campaign they call cleansing the internet
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.920]  the long cyber war against free speech by the chinese government using their great firewall
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:13.520]  to block content and their great canon to attack websites has now gone physical 15
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:19.520]  000 people have been arrested so far in their new campaign of monitoring and censorship but
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.840]  is the west much different spain just began finding people up to 30 000 euros for criticizing or
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.880]  photographing the government and it was just 10 months ago the federal elections commission
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:37.040]  nearly shut down free youtube videos that don't file campaign reports it didn't pass but the vote
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:43.040]  was three to three along party lines republican chairman goodman said quote government censors
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:48.960]  on the internet daily calling youtube video posts for violations of law is nothing short of a chinese
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.320]  censorship board but that's what the obama appointees supported and that's how dangerously close

[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.520]  you know are resistant to or completely immune to antibiotics i know personally last winter not
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.080]  this winter but last winter i couldn't get rid of a chest cold even took antibiotics didn't even
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.520]  listen to my own you know rhetoric about a coil silver since i've never been a supplement taker and
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.480]  i guzzled two bottles over a week and just it knocked it out i mean within a day of me drinking a
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.480]  whole bottle and i'm not saying you should do that talk to your physician because it is toxic at
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:59.280]  those levels but so are antibiotics at 30 parts per million not that toxic from the experts but
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.320]  just check into it for yourself talk to your healthcare provider folks we have the same type
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:11.680]  that whole food sells same major manufacturer ours is less it's just relabeled by us from the factory
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:18.400]  well we go even down further 30 off a single bottle buy two get two free bottles until the supplies
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:22.640]  sell out and i'm doing this because we got another shipment coming in in two and a half three weeks
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.400]  i believe it'll sell out before then but i like to discount stuff i like to be aggressive in the

[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:41.920]  than old-fashioned iodine but i put our iodine in there as well so get 30 off a single bottle
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:47.840]  or buy two get two free that obviously is an even bigger deal we're not like walmart or folks that'll
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.680]  or target that are known to raise prices one week and then lower them and call it a sale

[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:43.600]  he's a big guy he can take it 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 jesse you've heard my point the world's
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:51.360]  collapsing in the third world serious problems i get the west has helped do that but still the
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:58.320]  very same west that's helped do that is opening up to this incentivizing it i mean there's a
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.680]  headline out today where third world leaders say new york is more third world than their countries
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:09.840]  don't you see a problem with unlimited immigration yeah well here's my trade off for you alex here's
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:17.120]  what i'll do i'll i'll state this put walls at both of our borders take down the Statue of Liberty
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:24.240]  and say keep out we're full but the trade off is we have to bring our entire us military home
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:31.760]  and let them protect our borders no more bases throughout the world and no more wars throughout
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:38.320]  the world because over a hundred years now we've been fighting wars all over the world and so if
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:44.080]  you'll bring the military home i'll i'll agree with you we'll put up two walls we'll let the
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:50.560]  military protect the united states of america but we close all of our bases worldwide and we use the
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:56.720]  military like general smidley butler said to protect the united states and only the united
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:02.880]  states fair trade jesse ventura for president that is an excellent idea you know i'm a libertarian
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:08.560]  and all these wars have been criminal uh 15 years after supposed al-qaeda attacks isis is worse than
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:14.320]  ever i want to talk to you about that briefly but absolutely we have no business being an empire and
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.840]  it sounds like you want us to be switzerland or it's very hard to get in you've got to be skilled
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.000]  you got to bring something to the table uh and they've got one of the highest standard of living
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.360]  i don't necessarily want that but that's my trade off if you're going to guard the country and we're
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.280]  going to put walls up then let's do it the right way bring our military home we don't need to be
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.640]  having military throughout the world our military should be to protect the united states of america
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:47.040]  and us alone i have another plan how about we get rid of anchor baby status and welfare
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:52.720]  and corporate welfare and slash it all so there's an incentive for hardworking people to come a lot
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:58.400]  of these immigrants are we could do all that by doing the military budget if you bring them all home
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.200]  the defense budget will get locked in half if the only thing we got to protect is the united
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.800]  states we're going to have more money than we'll ever know what to do with because right now we've
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:17.680]  lost over 1.7 trillion dollars over there in the middle east lost gone 1.7 trillion absolutely
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.240]  listen you're preaching the choir here but on the toilet but it makes perfect sense what i'm saying is
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:29.520]  you can't have all this welfare to incentivize lazy people whether it's from europe or latin america
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.800]  or whatever to just come here and have their babies for free and be able to stay that's not fair
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:41.520]  certainly it's not fair just as corporate welfare is not fair either i want to get rid of it and so
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.400]  no and that's fine we'll get rid of all that you could get rid of all that you wouldn't even have
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:52.720]  to get rid of it if you cut the defense budget in half i want to get rid of the welfare i want to
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.360]  get rid of the welfare because it ruins people jessie let me guess i bet you've never been on
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:05.600]  welfare uh i have not but but my wife has well welfare is supposed to be there for six months
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:12.080]  or something when you're in an emergency my wife came from a broken family a mother and four children
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.080]  and they're embarrassed about it but they were forced to uh to take welfare at one point in
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:22.880]  their lives well that's different you know what it's like and i know that it's a safety net that's
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:29.200]  out there and uh you know we certainly can remove it but then again if we're going to remove that
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:35.120]  safety net then we have to have stronger abortion policies because if you're going to bring all these
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:40.400]  unwanted kids into the world you better have something for them you know the thing i love
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.240]  about the republics they care more about people who aren't even here yet than they do the people who
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:54.080]  are well look i mean i get the point that you can't have this welfare state and then especially
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.960]  aborting these people anyways they're just dumbed down well that's the point if we're going to bring
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:05.120]  all these babies into the world and many of them are unwanted many of them are poor many of them
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.600]  are this and that and then you abandon them and say hey you're on your own now you got born but
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.920]  you're on your own no but that's a government policy of putting women on welfare and saying a man
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.000]  can't be in the house to create giant broken systems to be democratic voters that created that well
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.520]  whatever it is if you're gonna if you're gonna be tough on abortion then you also have to be
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.280]  have a decent look look i get people that that don't want to have another kid and so i don't
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:37.360]  judge them but the abortion system itself was run by margaret sanger they're selling body parts
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.760]  they're lying about it that's my concern is the people running it are very evil
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:49.760]  well you know then maybe you better get in there and straighten it out well i'm trying
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:56.720]  hillary do you think we the point is like i said i think it's very evil to take away the system
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:03.760]  that the safety net and then force you know like scott walker he want he doesn't even want you can't
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:12.000]  get an abortion through incest or rape either can't we at least ban partial birth of incest or rape
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.760]  according to scott walker that that woman has to take that child and bear it yeah well i think
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:23.760]  arguments like that helps keep it legal uh because it's it does sound extreme from the
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.160]  perspective of those that are for it but what about partial birth an eight-month-old baby
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:35.200]  could be a cesarean and live why sell its body parts well i don't i'm not an expert on that
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.560]  alex i don't know nothing about that i i don't either asking somebody that's never looked into
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:46.160]  it i'm not going to comment on no i hear you i don't know anything about that i hear you all i know
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.000]  is that it ain't the government's job to to in my opinion to tell a woman what to do with
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.800]  well i think this is good radio i didn't mean to get in arguments all day with you but it's
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.440]  important to flesh this out and i understand you believe in your stance that i don't want
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:05.760]  you talk about independence you want government and your sexual activities i don't hey you're for
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.560]  decriminalization of prostitution i agree with you and now amnesty international agrees
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:17.760]  studies show it lowers the crime rate and the abuse of women absolutely i say take pimps and
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.960]  government pimps completely out of it well the only reason it's illegal is because there's an
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:29.520]  exchange of money and government wants its cut actual acts between two consenting adults are
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:35.600]  all legal the only thing that makes prostitution illegal is you have an exchange of money that's
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.360]  the only thing about it that makes it illegal well i appreciate the fact you're not a hypocrite
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.640]  because i don't know the details but i would imagine being in the navy you're not a spring
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:47.680]  chicken when it comes to a little bit of fun anyway let's go to callers alex you promised
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:52.480]  that i'd have callers i want to do it but you promised you talk about hillary i mean i want to
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.760]  know do you think we're about to see the fall of hillary uh i i think there's a backlash against
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.360]  hillary i get a laugh though about her emails and all that stuff how everyone's up in arms over her
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.600]  emails i would much rather have an investigation of the trumped up iraq war i agree and how we
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.480]  relied to and all the millions of people hundreds of thousands who were killed because of it
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:21.440]  and the mess we're in today you notice nobody or i would prefer them to investigate us torturing people
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.840]  see to me those are investigations that should happen hillary's emails i could give a damn
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:33.920]  less about them uh yeah well what about what about the fact that we see jeb bush coming
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:40.640]  out endorsing torture last week did you see that yeah i can't believe it you know to me here you've
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:48.080]  got a presidential candidate that wants to be a war criminal i mean that's what he's saying
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:55.040]  because if you endorse torture that is a war crime his brother and dick cheney are war criminals
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:59.440]  well i love how he blames the democrats who've been accomplices after the fact
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:04.640]  like they know about the crime and have helped go along with it but they didn't execute the crime
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:10.880]  and then jeb bush last week blamed the democrats for iraq when it's saudi arabia and isis that's
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:17.920]  running havoc right now that the bushes are completely allied with exactly it's it's amazing
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:24.160]  it's truly amazing and i hope the people of this country wake up and see the facts you've just
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.880]  talked about alex it's it's for jeb bush to say torturing's okay we want a president who's a war
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:37.120]  criminal and and you know but it doesn't surprise me because 90 percent of these elected bozos were
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:44.080]  never in the military and the thing is if we're gonna torture then we shouldn't complain if other
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:50.320]  countries torture us oh they get jeb bush or hillary i might actually join you in bahaha
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.880]  that's who you're gonna get baby oh man i tell you that's who you're gonna get because on the
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:03.200]  democratic side even no matter what bernie sanders does they've got these super delegates
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:10.000]  and super delegates carry the field so no matter hillary's gonna get it because she's got the
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.520]  super delegates no matter what sanders does and on the other side they're gonna get rid of trump
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:21.440]  because they're gonna say he can't beat hillary we've got to have someone who can and so it probably
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:27.840]  will end up i think jeb bush and hillary i don't know who's worse of those two maybe hillary because
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.160]  he does that joker face she's just i'd detest her and it's not because she's a woman like
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.760]  bernie sanders says it's just i'm sick of her i mean i'm sick you know maybe maybe jeb bush
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:43.840]  because then then we could cancel the revolutionary war and we could say that we too have attained
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.960]  king bush absolutely it'll be king bush with her bushers are we gonna get that are we gonna get
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:55.360]  jenna and the daughters do they come after jeb when do we start calling them queens and kings
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:02.960]  exactly i and see that's we're getting back to trump and sanders that's why i'm so happy to see
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:10.320]  both of them on the scene because it's disrupting they've had it cushy now for 50 years the only
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.280]  person that caused them some trouble was ross perot and they got rid of ross real quick when
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:21.520]  they wouldn't let him debate 96 they did that that ended perot but anyway do you worry about them
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.240]  going after trump because perot said he was threatened by the bushes and i believe it said
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:31.760]  his daughters were threatened i mean they're not up they're not above doing that well you know
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:37.040]  that was one of the reasons i came out and said that trump needs to take me as a running mate
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.160]  for his own insurance because then if they kill him they're left with me and i'm worse that's a good
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.080]  idea so you would run as donald trump's running mate well i'd consider i'd absolutely consider it
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:56.400]  if he asked me and he got the nomination i would give it donald's been a friend for 25 i owe him
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.440]  that much respect to at least consider it so you think he's for real running for president
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:08.720]  i don't think yeah i think he is i think i i don't think he would have did and take it all
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.160]  the grief he's taken if he wasn't serious about it if he if he if he's not serious about it well
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:21.360]  then he's got the most wild sense of humor i've ever seen jesse ventura t info here wow he would
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:27.040]  run with donald trump that's a newsmaking statement all right and donald may not want me the republican
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:32.560]  certainly wouldn't want me i'm pro-choice you know but if donald's gonna tear things up and get
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.160]  everyone ticked who would be a better choice than me he'd be a great choice and you certainly
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:41.680]  have integrity even if folks disagree with some of your policies they know where you stand and
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.440]  that's a valuable commodity and that's what a vp's for a vp is there to give the president
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.120]  advice whether the president takes it or not is up to the president and to be a dozen back up
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.080]  thinking you've got to be an honest vp well and just go along and get along you would definitely
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.560]  get a lot of independence and and and democrats to vote for trump and moderate his ticket it's
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:07.120]  it's a very very interesting idea let's go to some phone calls we're going to skip this network
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:12.320]  break because i'm going to him late shawn tom peter kenney and brandon i'll be able to get to you
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  others will have to get to in the next hour dr alvita king is going to be joining us to talk
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:22.480]  about black lives matter shawn in florida you're on the air with jesse ventura go ahead yes sir
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:28.160]  alex you're a patriot as well as mr or i should say governor ventura wanted to ask both of you
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:33.680]  what your uh current opinion is on the email scandal now i know jesse touched upon it briefly
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:37.920]  just a few minutes ago but i've got a good feeling that his point of view is going to change
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:44.320]  if the topic of Benghazi comes up on those emails which is uh should be really the
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.800]  the ordered stand-down so the navy seals got killed we know she's been caught lying
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:54.560]  that's the whole issue is you know al capone got it for for income tax evasion not for his big crimes
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:58.960]  what do you think's going to happen to hillary i i don't know what'll happen to hillary but like
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:05.360]  i've said before if they truly want to investigate some stuff investigate the trump up to the iraq war
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:12.080]  and investigate the torture and to me those are both higher than anything in Benghazi yes Benghazi
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:17.840]  was a tragedy a handful of people died how many people have died as a result of our invasion of
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:23.920]  iraq who had nothing to do with 9 11 thank you shawn a good question but but jesse i mean i agree
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:30.400]  with you but anything we can burn these criminal uh politicians with it'll scare the other ones
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.440]  for some of them to start getting in trouble or stepping down like nixon so i don't care who they
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.520]  are if it's john bainer hillary clinton or any of them i want to see them get in trouble and she
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:45.120]  is obstructing justice wiping the emails she has been caught covering up in ghazi she's up there
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:50.640]  making jokes about it i mean i would like to see her fall and then there wouldn't be this teflon
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.840]  image for all these crooks in government well that's true alex but i would like to see a few
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:02.240]  others fall first who did much much more heinous things yeah we know 9 11's an inside job and
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:07.360]  we're trying to get the 28 pages out but in and as soon as we can prove who actually did it how
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:14.000]  about that i think that's way more important to learn about the redacted pages of the 9 11 report
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  i agree i had the congressman on last week trying to get them out yeah i mean to me
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.600]  there should be an outcry for that you notice there's no outcry for that is there no you don't
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:29.440]  hear any outcry all you hear is we want hillary's emails i want to see the 28 but whatever it is
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:35.520]  redacted page 29 11 report i've talked to the congressman and the senator that have seen it
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:41.280]  and it says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks nor had was ordered to stand down it would send
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:47.120]  shaney clearly was in control it would send him to prison uh let's talk to tom and maryland tom
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:55.680]  you're on the air go ahead good afternoon gentlemen mr. jones i'll tell you the past two days have been
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:05.120]  quite a show i'll tell you uh you have come across as quite the calm cool collected levelheaded
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:13.360]  and professional worker and moderator and that's unusual well i'm getting old i've got three kids
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:22.720]  and i'm burned out governor i wanted to ask you to destroy your image the truth is i'm just so
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:30.400]  tired now at least i'll let folks talk a little sorry go ahead governor i wanted to ask you
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:39.040]  or at least point out as a former uh investigator for the government uh a lot of times our biggest
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:48.640]  cases become from small leads and i agree with alex i think that these emails could be nothing
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:55.360]  they could turn up something they could turn up a lot they could turn up just enough
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:02.080]  to roll somebody so we could move on to someone else that's where we make the big cases so i just
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:08.080]  wanted to point that out my question for you though was about the economy as a former investigator i
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:16.480]  can't believe the incompetence in higher office uh for example uh when i worked for government uh
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:23.120]  general uh david walker was a comptroller and i thought he was a real hero he put out a film
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:31.680]  about the economy until not too long ago i saw him deny uh the uh after the comprehensive annual
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:39.840]  financial report that the government puts out uh he eventually had to uh retract and say yeah
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.120]  there is that but it's separate from the budget it's not it's and what is your question is ventura
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:51.040]  aware of the separate slush funds in corporate investments that governments keep that's off budget
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.320]  oh wow you're right on target alex well we gotta jump tom you're a great caller but i got a bunch
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.320]  of them for ventura uh if you want to stay on hold i'll come back to you after ventura leaves
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:07.520]  jet effect he's gone uh jesse what's your take on slush funds well i i've never you know i actually
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:14.800]  ran into slush funds when i was mayor of brooklyn park minnesota that's how low how how deep slush
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:22.160]  funds can go in government brooklyn park minnesota had slush funds that were worth more than five
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:30.320]  annual budgets wow i mean you know and this is just a uh of the sixth largest city in minnesota
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:36.000]  and they had slush funds that they could have ran the city for five years and the people wouldn't
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.280]  have to pay any city taxes for those whole five years yeah we get technical and use the term
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:45.760]  like comprehensive annual financial report but they're just slush funds yeah that's all that's
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:51.440]  them the problem is this the people that get elected in the office somehow they think that
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:57.600]  their job is to have the city have more money when they leave than what they got there oh austin's
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.000]  got like five billion dollars in slush funds they admit and they just keep raising the property
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.440]  taxes and yet they'll cry poor mouth and they'll raise everybody's taxes oh there's plenty of potholes
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:14.560]  yep well of course well aware it goes all the way down to city levels these slush funds and what it
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.080]  takes is electing honest people which means if you elect democrats and republicans who already
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:26.480]  participate in a barbaric library system to begin with you're not getting honest people
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.560]  let's go ahead and talk to adrian in missouri he's bringing up an exciting topic we're gonna have
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:37.680]  these folks on monday uh the oath keepers are are actually doing arm marches with the black folks in
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:42.320]  ferguson to bring law and order the media claim they were racist but i'm not found oath keepers
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:46.560]  to be racist i found to be great people what do you make a black folks now arming themselves in
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.160]  missouri to stop looting jesse well it's going to be interesting i laughed when i saw the oath
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:57.040]  keepers and i thought gee can you imagine the response if they were all black carrying automatic
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:02.080]  assault weapons holy crap the national guard would have been out there and they'd have put
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:10.720]  so you know i i'm not ready for armed rebellion yet alec i'm not going for that ready for the
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.720]  people to pick up arms we have an alternative called voting you can get these people out of
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:20.800]  office and you can cause a revolution without having to shoot each other let's get adrian's
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.880]  take ready to go to that point yet well i mean to be specific though we're not saying armed
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.240]  rebellion we're saying openly exercise our second amendment so folks know we have a right to open carry
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:38.080]  well yeah but they they also could lead to some type of interference during a problem too and then
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.800]  what'll happen well they're going to march with 50 armed black folks next week well let's see what
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.840]  happened and their point is don't be racist black folks have a right to march armed as well i'm almost
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:53.280]  scared we all we all do because of the second amendment i agree but but but the point is that
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:58.880]  the black people are scared saying if we march the cops might do something uh so we'll see they
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:04.000]  have reason to feel that way don't you think i think so that's why this is so that's why i would
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.120]  i would think they have decent reason to feel that way i hear you governor adrian real quick
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:14.800]  what's your point on that yes um i'm down here on the ground with jacar jackson and bill beings
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:21.760]  while they were here and um i'm i'm here i'm part of an organization here i'm trying to educate

[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.320]  there you're saying you you you hooked up with my reporters joe begs and jacari jackson what is your
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:18.160]  take on this whole situation and last time i talked to the oathkeeper guys have they set a date yet
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:23.920]  for when this arm march is going to take place in ferguson well they haven't they haven't actually
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:30.960]  set a date yet um it was scheduled maybe a couple weeks from now and everything and yes i do live
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:37.200]  here in ferguson and i'm all for armed black people marching with oath people because when
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:42.480]  they first came through the first night that they touched down on west florida um a lot of people
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.760]  thought they was like with law enforcement and i saw joe begs and i ran up to her like what's up man
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:53.600]  and i had to educate people around saying that hey these guys aren't racist they're they're not
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:59.920]  white supremacist militia or anything they're actually on the side of protesters um and when we
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:05.440]  was out there i told everybody all the protestors i'm saying hey haven't you noticed that the police
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.320]  did not try any of their their their brutality tactics on the protesters while the oathkeeper
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.720]  was out there nobody seemed to pay attention to that until i brought it up and it was like yeah
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:19.040]  you're right i'm like that's because the oathkeepers they're not racist they they have 10 mission
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:24.800]  statements that uphold the laws of the constitution and they will not stand for the police impeding on
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:29.280]  our right to protest yeah oathkeepers do arm marches in cities where they say it's illegal i've
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:34.880]  done it with them that's true civil rights civil disobedience where we could have all been arrested
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:40.000]  at these events in in multiple cities exactly this is the equivalent of coming in and sitting
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:47.200]  uh at the lunch counter where they won't serve black people and i'm actually here trying to
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:54.720]  get a group of you know african-americans um to join up join oathkeepers and to educate them about
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.600]  the second amendment because the problem that we as black people have in the urban community
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:05.040]  we play the what if game a lot and when oathkeepers came through we were like well what if it was
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.920]  black people that was walking around with with assault rifles we would have been shot well you
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:17.600]  don't necessarily know that until you know express your second amendment lawfully you know if you
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.960]  read up on the law then you would know that it's legal because Missouri passed an open carry law
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:31.280]  last year state that you can have an um sure have um open carry sure and what scares the system is
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.320]  that's why the feds on record in the 80s and 90s infiltrated hundreds of militia groups with white
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.360]  supremacist leaders tried to get them to join it tried to get them to bomb things were unsuccessful
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.760]  so they pulled off the government bombing of itself in 95 at the alfred permura building
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:51.440]  what they don't want is good old boys hooking up with good old boys that are black hispanic you
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:56.480]  name it in a culture of liberty if that happens and people start protecting their own neighborhoods
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.200]  it's game over and black folks in south side chicago will demand the right to guns
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.960]  and those criminals will will run and so this is a very exciting thing it's also dangerous
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.280]  they could try to put infiltrators in whatever but we've got folks in there that know what's
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.440]  going on and our reporters if they want to be up there next week for this i don't know if i'm

[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:08.320]  the national security specialist saying many people in government believe that journalists who
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:13.360]  receive snowden's material are not capable of protecting it from a competent and committed
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:18.560]  state level adversary even if snowden did not give the material to others they argue it would have
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.680]  been ripe for the picking well isn't that true of hillary's handling of emails didn't her violation
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:30.240]  of protocol expose above top secret data to state level adversaries snowden exposed criminal
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:36.240]  actions of our government done in the name of national security hillary compromised national
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:42.640]  security for her own convenience or to cover up her misdeeds if national security is more
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:48.160]  important than the constitution if national security is more important than our rights why
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:54.480]  isn't hillary being prosecuted why is snowden called a traitor and hillary clinton is called

[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:09.840]  up on air i know that's part of the stick but it's not a stick i lose control i get angry i get
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:16.160]  exhausted afterwards and i can't make the films i can't launch the tv networks i can't get all the
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:22.160]  other work done i need to do when i have anger issues and it's like flying back to the united
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:31.760]  states a week and a half ago i probably had maybe maybe a thousand dollars worth of stuff
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:40.240]  i bought my mom some plates and some jewelry and my girls some bobbles and cheap jewelry and a
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:46.160]  bunch of knickknacks in rome and i bought my son a bunch of stuff and i bought my dad some stuff and
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:53.200]  i bought cousins some things and from friends and family and i bought myself four or five shirts
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:00.080]  probably wasn't even a thousand and i'm on the airplane i've forgotten to keep all the receipts
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:06.480]  to remember so i fill out the customs form and i just say 1500 just to be completely safe
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:11.360]  and say it's a higher number if they want to try to tax me or do some type of import thing
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:17.600]  though it's not an import it's my personal stuff the lady goes 1500 that's 800s all this allowed
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:22.560]  i read the thing it didn't say that it was like 10 000 in money you had to announce it i said well
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.960]  look it's not even really 1500 i just don't know how it's just well you put false info down
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:33.520]  and i said no i just didn't don't have the receipts and had been asleep on the airplane
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:39.440]  i was landing and i just hear the bags you know if you want to look and see what the stuff is
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.280]  she goes well what is it and i go it's like
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:51.120]  you know it's knickknacks it's it's it's like you know stuff from Stonehenge stuff from Rome
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:59.920]  what's Stonehenge and i'm just like look Hillary Clinton runs Benghazi is lying about everything
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.800]  takes money from dictators and you're here interrogating me she was fine we're gonna
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:10.080]  search you go to the back and i said fine but don't be smiling on a power trip i'm not scared of you
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.000]  sending me to the back whenever i said do whatever you want to me you live in this country too it's
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  going to hell all these illegals i see you just let me straight through and ask him a question
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.880]  but because you know who i am i go you know who i am don't you she goes yeah i know who you are
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:29.600]  and then the next guy comes over he looks at my passport he goes oh alex jones of course
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:35.680]  and i said of course listen i'm being interrogated and implying i'm doing something wrong i'm sick of
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:40.560]  it you know i don't have a criminal record you know i haven't done anything leave me alone
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:46.560]  and see there i'm actually getting mad again i don't like the fact that i did that
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.560]  so i pray about it you name it and i'm just trying to get to the point where i don't have this temper
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:12:02.880]  it's just the injustice drives me crazy and i don't like being discriminated against man i was
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:09.040]  watching people that clearly weren't citizens and were just coming in they were just rubber
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:15.920]  stamping on the end of the country but not me and then the head manager comes back goes
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:19.120]  fine and they had me back in this back room fine i'm not going to search you i don't think you have
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:24.240]  any contraband i go i don't because i don't think you're importing things i go i'm not
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:30.880]  he goes you can go you know blah blah blah because i've i've come into the country before a bunch
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:36.000]  of them are listeners and that's why i don't want to act like a jerk i want to be charming
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:41.920]  and not get angry and just joke with them and make them feel stupid the ones that are bad
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.400]  because the woman was on a power trip
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:53.680]  so that i can actually change their minds not just be their enemy because it's not going to do
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:13:01.040]  anything for me or you if i'm just here angry i mean it's like the cops there are some bad cops
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:05.120]  there's some good cops it's the direction they're getting the programming they're getting that is
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:11.200]  bad from the globalist we're not going to win them over by fighting with them the globalist
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.960]  want us to have a civil war with them i just don't want to get angry so when a cop pulls me over now
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:22.400]  and wants to search my car i go hey listen i know there's a lot of criminals that use drugs and stuff
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:26.960]  i'm not one of them and you know the government ships the drugs in i'm just doing my job well
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:32.080]  do you want your kids growing up in a country where there's basically checkpoints and i mean just
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:36.240]  you can see i don't have a criminal record you've had me sitting here for 15 minutes
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:40.000]  if you want to go get a dog do it i'm not going to submit to you searching my vehicle
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.800]  because quite frankly so many police are corrupt i don't know if you're going to plant drugs in here
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.240]  i've done that about three four times the last six seven years and you know what the cops do
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:54.720]  every time they just go all right here's a ticket for speeding or here's a warning you can go
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:59.920]  and it's not personal it's just i'm not waving my rights we have these rights for a reason
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.560]  because there's bad people in government historically and i have these protections
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:10.560]  that george washington fought for so it's not personal with you but i think you're trampling
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:15.840]  on the bill of rights under orders and i think you ought to change that well i'm just doing my job
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.960]  and you know you do need to change that either you want to i am involved i want to get things done
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.960]  and it's entertaining when i blow up and run around crazy and and i'm sure i'll still do that
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.840]  but i don't want to have a heart attack when i'm 50 years old because i mean i really get
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:40.160]  pissed off behind the scenes i mean this is not an act i can hear and i read hundreds of articles
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:46.960]  about horrible stuff that's going on and it gets to me so i want to be polite i want to be genteel
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:50.880]  i want to do a good job i want to cover the news i want to reach people
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:58.800]  and i want to try to stop a civil war happening in this country and i don't want my anger that's
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.920]  been effective at getting people galvanized and listening to at this now critical juncture where
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:10.560]  stuff's so dangerous to hype things into any type of position where things blow up
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:17.360]  because undoubtedly they're going to try to say i'm doing that and are doing that regardless of
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:24.400]  what i do so i'm trying to up my game doesn't mean i'll be perfect but i'm trying to really be a
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:31.200]  statesman really reach out to people and really try to make a change in the world and let me tell
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:36.800]  you i've reached out to the police it's worked like a charm other than this spokane sheriff that
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:41.040]  keeps lying about what we say and what we do then i want to get cops killed and i'm horrible and
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:45.680]  i almost don't want to go there now i think it might be a setup or something how this guy lies
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:51.200]  and does all this bad stuff and worships the southern primary law center like that uh but i
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:56.880]  said i'm going so i will go it'll have to be in the winter spring because i gotta launch this tv
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:01.840]  network and stuff first but just the way he tries to start fights with patriots i think
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:05.440]  the feds may have told him to do this and they may be getting ready to pull something off to
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.160]  blame us and spokane i've down been researching this sheriff and looking into him and i think we've
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:16.320]  got an operative on our hands here a really bad guy so we're investigating him right now any intel
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:21.200]  folks have got on him it's legal and lawful send it to us at show tips at info wars dot com but
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:26.800]  i think he's an obama operative i mean i don't think there's any doubt about it but also i don't
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:30.800]  want to walk in any trap because i started really looking at it and it looks like he's trying to
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:36.880]  bait people he says we're liars that his deputy said they got armored vehicles for constitutionalists
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:43.440]  it's on stinking video and then he said that i was death-threading them and we and we called the
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.240]  newspaper last earlier this year they had to say okay you didn't i mean you know the guy's a liar
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:53.200]  see i'm starting to get mad and it's just like what is he doing
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:01.760]  my instincts i had something happen this morning i'm not going to get into his private
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:07.280]  where where i it was like a record like a needle coming off a record that i knew something was going
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:14.880]  on and i went and checked and it was going on you know it's like with my kids i have a feeling
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:19.920]  just randomly once a month or something that something's going on and i'll just go and check
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:26.320]  and sure enough it's going on i'll like go right to where it's going on instinct gut whatever you
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:32.160]  call it something's going on with his sheriff and we're investigating him i'm just gonna leave it at
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:40.640]  that something's going on and we all need to be on the lookout for the globalist pulling off another

[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:41.280]  and it goes they won't say you put it up we're trying to find out it's so evil and bad to compare
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:46.160]  obama stallard and hitler but they claim its first amendment but boy you know alex jones
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:51.680]  is linked to violence and getting people killed and all these people are connected to him and

[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:10.960]  pickpocketing 10 years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after
[02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:14.800]  government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:19.440]  radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:25.040]  privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:30.320]  room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID

[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:32.960]  crease for life dot o r g the niece of um dr martin looser king just to get her take on this
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.960]  planned parenthood situation which we all ought to be really happy i mean it's really coming out
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:44.240]  and so many globalists are in trouble and i don't mean people that buy into it's a right of a woman
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:49.120]  and they've got their arguments the people that support abortion that are low level their hearts
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.680]  are right they don't think they're hurting anything they think it's a blob of flesh it's the people on
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:25:00.640]  top know exactly what they're doing that's the difference notice jesse ventura wants to sort of
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:04.960]  get into partial birth abortion i don't think about that i don't want to talk about that because
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:11.920]  he's never been involved in any of that he doesn't get it he buys the propaganda that sold abortion
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:18.320]  in the 70s and i disagree with him on it but he's not involved in the racket
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:23.840]  and that's what the bible says well you believe it's philosophy or real about king david he did
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:29.200]  lots of bad stuff but he did it when he was out of control and he repented to god afterwards
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:38.160]  and really repented and was a man after god's heart he wanted to do good he wanted to be a good
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:43.600]  person he gravitated towards the good but his good side was so big you're gonna have the other side
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:52.800]  that was bad and i'm sick of hypocrites that sit around acting like they're perfect it's a new
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:57.200]  like Pharisee religion this political correctness where they're all politically correct and they
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:03.760]  use the proper language and now mom and dad husband and wife boy and girl can't be used imagine if
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:08.400]  you heard about a the cult in colorado got rid of the names man and woman husband and wife boy
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:15.760]  and girl they called them purple penguins you'd be like what a fruitcake group controlling language
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:23.280]  cult 101 but our government does it it's like michelle obama says what i eat and how i talk
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.360]  i'm in a cult well i'm not in a cult i'm in a cult of freedom cult of choice
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:36.640]  cult of protecting life because i want to be treated like that because my soul is big
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.600]  and when i even think about something bad i shake i don't need anybody to tell me
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:50.320]  what's moral and what's not it's all written on my heart and i just don't know how these people
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:56.480]  can do all this bad stuff and not feel it i've tried to get in the mind of people that want
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:01.360]  to abort minorities and i get their wine the minorities up to hate me and you know and and
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.880]  there's arguments there but i start thinking about going along with killing the black people i mean
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.880]  man my soul goes well you know where you're going i mean and again that's not even entertaining it
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:20.320]  that's getting in the mindset of the globalist that's what i do that's what you do in warfare
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:24.400]  is you think like they do to understand what they're going to do and man i get in their mindset
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:33.760]  it's like i mean i just get scared of god i mean i get chills the minute i even think like they do

[02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:07.440]  closing bloomberg reports a national security specialist saying many people in government
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:11.920]  believe the journalists who receive snowden's material are not capable of protecting it from
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:17.680]  a competent and committed state-level adversary even if snowden did not give the material to others
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:22.000]  they argue it would have been ripe for the picking well isn't that true of hillary's handling of
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:28.160]  emails didn't her violation of protocol expose above top secret data to state-level adversaries
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:34.400]  snowden exposed criminal actions of our government done in the name of national security

[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:19.280]  obviously abortion that predominantly targets blacks uh 50 plus percent being aborted before
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:25.360]  they're born what does she think about this planned parenthood news coming out i mean we got four
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:30.160]  states cutting their funding congress looking at it we've known this is going on for a while but it
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:35.520]  really is good to see this evil being exposed so uh dr king thank you so much for coming on with us
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.200]  i am so glad to join you and those are some wonderful questions the things that you pointed
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:46.160]  out i the first thing i thought and you know i come from a family of preachers martin Luther king
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:51.360]  jill used to preach in my daddy's brother ab my granddaddy daddy king uh i'm in the band that was
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:59.360]  but uh there was a time in the bible when there was a man named joseph and he became very well known
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:07.040]  to the pharaoh after he went through perfecution and all that and then when he died a new pharaoh came
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:11.680]  and then they said they didn't remember joseph i'm thinking that some people don't even remember
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:18.400]  martin king jr what he said for and of course he said for god he was a man of god he loved god
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:24.240]  and a lot of people seem to have forgotten that and that's why you can see young people running up
[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:30.400]  interrupting a meeting yelling black lives lives matter and of course black lives matter all lives
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:38.160]  matter martin the king jr often taught my daddy ab's brother to at 1726 the blood died made all
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:42.240]  people so we're brothers and sisters and martin the king says we have to learn to live together as
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:48.720]  brothers and all that his sisters will perish at school so they don't remember that and so
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.800]  they don't even know that it's disrespectful to go to a meeting and jump into people's faces
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:36:00.400]  saying black lives matter that's just disrespectful but no one has taught them how to articulate a
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:08.480]  need and because they don't know how they're doing it inappropriately well we know the democrats
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:13.760]  are directing them and ancy polosi and others so it looks like they're trying to make the movement
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:20.800]  balkanize people and look pretty silly as well they even go the most liberal uh bernie sanders you
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:25.520]  name it and get in their face what do you think is really going on behind the scenes here dr king
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:31.840]  well what does envy a confused envy and strife that's confusion and every evil work if you
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:35.920]  can keep things keep things confused and people can't think they don't even notice well they're
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:40.640]  yelling at the democrats and the republicans and then you wonder who's kind of behind the movement
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:46.080]  who's paying them because i can remember you know i was elected to office myself i was a state
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:51.040]  legislator two terms in georgia i've been a presidential appointee and those kinds of things and
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:55.520]  so when you're in a campaign you pay people to stand on the corner with your signs to walk up
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:37:01.360]  and down and pass out your flyer well people don't only do that when someone's running for office
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:07.120]  they do it to to disturb a community and so you can give somebody a little money if they go out
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:10.560]  into the community and scream and jump up and down and we'll give you some money we give you
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:17.520]  lunch we give you whatever so a lot of that has happened and then uh sometimes young people especially
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:23.280]  they'll see something and they'll join in and with all this zeal without even examining
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.560]  put the messages and and and honestly a lot of that's going on and you're right there are people
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:33.840]  who want anarchy and confusion so that they can continue to do things that they're doing and nobody
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:41.040]  will ask them any questions and they want to study each other's drugs yeah okay okay no no and they
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:46.320]  want to study each other's throats we know hillary has met uh with the folks and tried to start things
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.880]  that we know george soros is doing it and there are some real issues with the police in areas but
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:55.920]  they're really trying to exacerbate it and i think that's the desperation of the democratic party
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.480]  not the republicans are much better uh that all they've got now is divide and conquer i mean do
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:05.440]  you agree that that's a sign of desperation or do you think it's confidence well i talk about
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:10.720]  frequencies and so the political frequency is real and you're there but it's not so much whether
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:16.400]  you're a republican or democrat or an independent but can are you a free thinking person can you
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:23.040]  think can you hear can you reason can you look at the issue and to you know if if you keep the
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:28.480]  battle going between the republicans and the democrats uh that's one level in one place but
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:34.320]  what i demand is that everybody regardless of their political party do what's right by people
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:38.880]  and that's why i wrote to the congressional black caucus example and i say are you paralyzed
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.920]  all in the book of fadassin says that justice is paralyzed people are paralyzed and they can't even
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:50.320]  do what's right and justice is perverted and so what's your problem why can't you speak out and
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:55.600]  say that these things that are happening are wrong a lot of time money does it like you say
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:00.400]  people throw money at it people who are wealthy enough to want to manipulate the agendas they
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.600]  put enough money out there that people won't even hear what's right and what's wrong and have you
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:10.240]  ever seen those movies or things like that and somebody wants to go into a community and the
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:14.480]  crowd is too thick so they just take a handful of coins or a handful of dollars and throw them up
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:19.440]  in the air and the people just first chasing them yes and then they can go wherever they want to go
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:25.840]  well then this is exactly that that's the analogy that's what's happening they've got us fighting
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:31.680]  over crumbs while they social engineer the planet uh how positive an event even though it's painful
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:36.320]  is it what do you think of all these abortion videos coming out and the fact that they're
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:41.760]  shelling baby parts uh what looks like on the illegal market well i hope your listeners are
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:46.720]  really listening because it's very painful for me because i'm post-aborted i had abortions
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:53.600]  and when i had those abortions i was one who sat there and was rushed in and she had papers shoved
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:40:00.560]  into my hands and as they shoved the papers into my hand signed this week and and i'm already uh
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:06.080]  not sure i'm trying to do it in secret all of that and then they said you've got to sign this you
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:12.160]  got to do that so it is painful but you know and and there's another video out today i don't know
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:17.840]  if you see it it's called call him Emmett e-m-m-e-t-t talking about Emmett Till who in the 20th century
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:25.120]  and asked an american young teen was killed for supposedly looking at a Caucasian girl and his
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:29.280]  mother said leave the coffin open because our people need to see what happened to my child
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.800]  and so martin the king junior said america will not reject racism till america sees racism well
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:40.960]  father thanks for bone and i'm director of african-american outreach for priests for life for
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:46.400]  father frank is a national director father frank says america will not reject abortion till america
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:52.640]  sees abortion so even though i sit there and i think oh my god if i sign that for my own baby
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:59.440]  and you think about it but i still say people need to see it i mean you know i'm looking at it as
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:05.360]  hard sometimes i have to look away for a second and look back uh david had five smooth songs
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:13.680]  this time the center for medical medical progress had five piercing videos the first five videos
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:19.760]  ripped the top off of this and from there on the videos are still coming now so we do have to
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:27.200]  see them they are hard to look at but if we don't see the truth our hearts won't be pricked and so
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:33.360]  i believe that the videos have to be seen dr elvita king is our guest priest for life dot or
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:39.360]  org the good news is they tried to get the courts to block the release these videos that's failed
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:46.160]  we now know even more horrific videos are coming out and it just shows plant parenthood and others
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:51.600]  are not invincible i think we're very close to seeing the fall of hillary plant parenthood you
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:58.080]  name it if we just continue to push i believe so there's a book about the sing abortions by father
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:04.720]  thank favon just dropped yesterday uh he's given a backdrop and 20 points of things that we can all
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:09.920]  do now that we've seen all this so sometimes if you see something if you feel hopeless if you
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:15.680]  don't have anything you can do about it so he's given some how-tos and some lasting things that
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:23.360]  we all can't expect i've got a book too king rules r u l e s k i n d r u l e s and i talk about my own
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:29.280]  abortion experience in that father thanks god you know after what's for me and so we need to read
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:36.480]  study get involved participate in this alone i agree dr king dr king we're simulcasting interrupt
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:42.880]  i apologize video uh you know we're part tv not just radio and the guys roll footage in the background
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:47.520]  the new video out today is them harvesting the babies getting their organs their different parts
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:53.920]  and their little eyes and their little bodies could god excuse me i tell you it's hard to see
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:58.320]  it's hard to see yeah i hadn't seen this new one yet i knew it was up and i didn't want to look at it
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:04.080]  they're poor little heads of little eyes i think that's the lady who had to go and cut the brain
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:09.280]  yeah i mean put them in the mice that's that's hard that's hard that's hard
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:15.600]  i know it's hard i'm sorry well no you were talking about it i hadn't seen it yet and then
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:22.080]  boom and hit what do you make of these mainly women what do you make of these weird liberal type
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:27.360]  fake women all gulping wine at fine restaurants bragging about all the body parts i mean how
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:32.560]  sickening is how callous they are they desensitize they that's why they have to drink the wine so
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:37.520]  they desensitize and the only way they can go to sleep problem is to get a good drink i mean
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:44.000]  how are you going to keep your heart anesthetized unless you continue to do it you know that's
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:50.880]  really far i feel for them i feel pain i'm sorry i pray that they can get to a place
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.760]  where they can live with themselves again don't people at a fundamental level get
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:05.520]  just use this term how bad a luck it is and i use that term is even if you're not a christian you
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:10.240]  get it at a fundamental level yeah it just feels like bad luck for everybody to be doing this to
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:15.440]  babies it just don't people know it's going to come back on us no people don't know because
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:23.200]  i i remember when i was young i'm about uh 65th birthday coming up and i remember my mind was oh
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:28.320]  yeah i understand i hear that happens to people but it won't happen to me you know you can always
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:33.360]  tell yourself that so it happens but then you sit there and say how did this happen don't you
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:36.720]  remember maybe that did happen to you because you were sure it's like people i know that smoke
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:39.360]  cigarettes and then they don't believe they're going to get lung cancer when they get it they
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:45.680]  just can't believe it and it's how did this happen you know and so that is part of the human
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:51.360]  nature as well and that's why we have to do a lot of praying i am a christian obviously but uh what i
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:57.920]  say to anybody was your christian not a christian is there anybody well no obviously there are people
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:03.120]  because there's swelling wine and talking about it i was gonna say is anybody is anybody who can't
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:10.160]  see how bad that is but obviously there are some who are still absolutely well the good news is as
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:14.000]  you know the bible says there's nothing hidden that won't be brought out even from the deepest
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:19.520]  depths of the sea it's coming out i know you've got a new uh a song out too exposing a lot of this
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:24.480]  pre-shrill life pray for america pray for america that's the song you can see that at
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.840]  africanamericanoutreach.com right at the top there's a music video you click on that and then you
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:35.840]  can order it online the whole song i think somewhere well i hope you'll come back with us and take
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:42.320]  calls for a longer interview in the future priestforlife.org keep up the great work dr alvita c king
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:51.200]  god bless you god bless you thank you for this opportunity thank you oh man that really just
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:57.440]  freaked me out because i wasn't ready for it and i'll be honest i don't watch a lot of the war videos
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:05.600]  of kids bombed and dead there was one i saw just the other day by accident in syria where the roof
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:11.520]  had fallen in on a father and his daughters in his arms she's about six or seven i got a seven-year-old
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.800]  daughter and she's crushed you can see i'm holding her you can tell they died together suffocating
[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:24.640]  under the rock and it just gets to me and i just can't imagine people that don't have that empathy
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:30.320]  it's like my nerve endings what happens to somebody else happens to me and i think about
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:37.920]  that bowl of little kids and they're pretty good size these look like about four five month old babies
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:43.600]  and their little heads and little eyes and little faces and they're chopping they're taking the brains
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:52.160]  out and i tell people 20 years ago they were putting baby brains in pigs cows rats dogs you name it
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:58.800]  people didn't believe me now it's all in the nose it's just so crazy that's what i mean and we're
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:05.040]  got lewis fair con running around and david duke running around all
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:11.280]  and yes whites are racist some of them blacks are racist and hispanics are in groups and the
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:16.560]  media is hyping it and so it's real the real perspective of of lewis fair con or david duke
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:23.200]  i mean i get their perspective from their perspective but you pull back from it it's so fantastical
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:32.240]  what's really going on the evil transcends what they can even cover and it's happening to everybody
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:37.040]  i think that's the biggest lie is everybody thinks they're getting screwed over or they're
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.920]  screwing somebody over they're exempt you're not exempt you don't get away with anything you do in
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:49.600]  this world and i just don't know how people don't see that or know that or why you'd even need to
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:59.040]  know that metaphysical rule i'm gonna go to your phone calls i apologize kenny and then brandon and
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:04.800]  then others uh kenny thanks for holding in florida ventura is gone now but go ahead your point uh
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:09.040]  yeah great show today alex and i wanted to plug this propure water fuel precious this
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:13.200]  for good it makes the best sweet tea and i even make my ice cubes out of it well god bless you thanks
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:21.040]  for the support yeah man um i just according to world net daily since 9 11 2001 an average of 26
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:25.840]  american citizens are killed every day in this country and if you do the math by illegal aliens
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:31.920]  that's a well over 130 000 dead over a million sexual assaults mostly against children and i
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:37.120]  just wanted to ask him how many is too many and if he puts illegals before american citizens
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:43.120]  i'm done would you ask the ventura well ventura's got a real liberal streak in him that he just
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:50.960]  wants to like everybody and he gets that the welfare is wrong and it's a draw but he i'm trying
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:55.520]  to get him to he's moved a little bit and i think it's next time he's on i'm gonna go over statistics
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:01.600]  with him and i'm actually gonna go over those numbers with him uh and just say look we're not

[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:39.440]  liars and when we're done exposing what they're doing see the more hardcore the globalists get
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:44.800]  the more we're gonna play hardball evil people always make the mistake of thinking good people
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:53.920]  are weak and are cowards and the truth is once good people know that they're cornered they will
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:55:03.440]  tear evil people to pieces and we're not going to anything violent to these abortuaries we're
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:13.120]  going to expose what you're doing and politically destroy you and i could feel as the evil intensifies

[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:43.920]  how anybody could be bored right now brandon and fema region three thanks for holding
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:55.840]  hey alec how you doing good brother uh i wanted to touch um on the growing police state by the way
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:02.480]  i'm a marine corps reservist and i had to be shot video on my phone about a month ago i was driving
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:09.280]  down 95 and i could see what was clearly about 11 or 12 black hops in the air and they actually had
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:15.440]  a few streets blocked off and i walked up and just wanted to know what's going on and one of the
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:20.880]  army guys he had a ranger tab on the shoulder basically told me to shut up and get back and
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:27.280]  i mean more and more i see this it makes me sick to my stomach because it's not what i signed up for
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:32.320]  sure and some of the military itself's bad they're being given these missions to condition the public
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:38.320]  i never even covered watson's article in california where they had thousands of troops total but
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:44.880]  hundreds in trucks practicing in plain clothes infiltrating taking over the town and then
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:52.480]  leaving they're practicing attacking american cities for america and alex it's not even notice
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.840]  and i can even attest to myself when we when these drills occur it's never about that jihadi with
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:02.160]  50 pounds of c4 strapped to his chest it's about that good old boy and a john deer had it doesn't
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:06.960]  want to turn his hands in so so you've been in the marines i videotaped this with the marines but
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:10.800]  in the marines you have trained to take on i mean i've been to the drills they always wear
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:15.760]  john deer hats and go hello america don't take my guns and the marines practice taking them out
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:21.680]  you're saying you've been part of that i've been part of it i've seen it's firsthand and i mean
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:27.680]  to a lot of the guys in the corn in all branches it's like just even america anymore we're
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:35.600]  training to kill our own people if they don't do do whatever the government says and you know and
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:41.440]  you've touched on it millions of times same the fb on the ci its compartmentalized the
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:47.840]  the mid and highest level especially at the pentagon i mean i'm the son of a us army general
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:53.760]  and he's even told me you know you either play ball or they can say giving resignation and have
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:57.760]  a good life you know briefly where were you specifically with these drills were they in
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:03.120]  real cities or or practice cities where you were practicing taking on veterans or patriots
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:09.200]  who were you practicing to take on and where was it uh this was a few years ago this was uh i'm in
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:16.000]  the it was in virginia just a little i guess it's about 10 minutes outside of richmond
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:22.800]  was it in a drill facility or or in a town uh it was in plain sight yeah i was in a town

[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:29.840]  and it's because a brain force there's always hidden additives in your food even organic food
[02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:33.680]  has hidden additives staring at the computer all day working doing good you're still damaging your
[02:59:33.680 --> 02:59:37.360]  brain ultimately we've all been dumbed down to some degree it doesn't have stimulus it doesn't
[02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:42.560]  have garbage in it it has natural things that do it clean you will find a brain force and other game
[02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:54.000]  changing products at info wars life dot com or call 888-253-3139 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:08.640]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:16.640]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network brandon is in the marine corps reserves he was talking
[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:20.880]  about in small towns doing urban warfare drills a little bit more brand than i'm going to go to
[03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:25.600]  a few other callers like anthony has been holding and tim but any other tidbits you'd like to add
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:30.880]  i mean the good news is the reason the military is so awake is that they are being given treasonous
[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:36.960]  missions but the question is when will it become institutionalized and when when will people think
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:43.440]  it's normal or will that ever happen i think that in the case of the army in the marine corps who i
[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:48.480]  think are given more of these missions more so than the coast art air force or navy i think it may
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:53.920]  come down to where there may just be a mutiny like dempsey warned obama over the whole serious thing
[03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:58.560]  it may just come with time which is where people say you know what i'm not doing this arrest me
[03:00:58.560 --> 03:01:03.440]  kill me do whatever you're going to do to me i'm not going to kill any good people to further your
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:13.600]  agenda i mean and on the when it comes to stuff like drills you know it'll be in inside it won't
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:19.040]  even be on government property and people will be showing and you'll have guys you know pointing
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:24.160]  guns saying you better get out of here i'm going to kill you and you know it's like it's there right
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:29.920]  you know they have first amendment for urban well i've i've had a cover with machine guns and our
[03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:35.040]  camera people have in hebron maryland say turn your cameras off that's in police day 2000 you're
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:40.800]  saying that the army was rude to you but but just to be clear are you saying you've seen marines or
[03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:47.440]  army actually threaten the citizens yeah i was all walking up because i was with my husband because
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:54.000]  she had she had just gotten out of finished summer school and graduated high school and all that and
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:59.680]  and we were going to uh a mcdonald's to celebrate because he wanted to get something to eat and i
[03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:04.720]  see army rangers out and i'm like hey what's going on and i even told him i was on the rink
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:09.120]  on he's like look do you know especially you better shut up and go back to where you come from
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:14.160]  and i i mean i stood my ground i'm not scared of him i mean if you're gonna shoot if you're
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:19.520]  gonna move me down an in plain sight i mean oh i know i had delta force take our cameras and our
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:24.960]  footage in san antonio and mike wouldn't give up his camera so the guy just pulled a gun out and
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:30.480]  stuck it to mike's chest please and then mike still wouldn't give it up so they grabbed it away from
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:35.520]  him and they hated us and it wasn't the actual delta force operators they were there we'd gotten
[03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:40.560]  footage of them it was the people with them it's whatever it's all narcotics trafficking god bless

[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:14.640]  last caller we got to start it down go ahead anthony yes hi elix go ahead thanks for thanks for
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:21.360]  giving out all the info that you've given i just want to talk to you about jimmy carter i know
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:26.960]  you're probably on overdrive right now he's got cancer all right yes i know he's he's dying of
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:35.040]  cancer and uh he came out he made a statement that uh that uh the usa is an oligarchy no longer
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:42.800]  democracy and uh i just wanted to uh ask you what your kid i think jimmy carter is a useful
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:48.560]  idiot i think he means well his answer would be socialism to stop an oligarchy uh but no he's
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:54.560]  absolutely on target saying we're an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery but now the
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:58.240]  globalists have conquered the country they want to shut off political giving because they know we
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:04.160]  might be able to give money and counter them uh so it's a complex issue but um i don't think
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:10.320]  jimmy carter is a bad man i think he's very very misguided uh that's why they set him up but i
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:18.160]  appreciate your call what do you think well what i think uh uh alex is that um you know he
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:28.320]  he's the only president besides jfk that's tried to do something and uh besides eisenhower and
[03:04:28.320 --> 03:04:33.760]  jfk no i agree and now that he's got cancer all over supposedly all over his body and i think he's
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:41.760]  a goner probably he ought to spill his guts yeah he ought to do that you know to to expose to
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:47.600]  expose what's going on listen alex i really appreciate what you've done and uh what you're
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:53.840]  doing um if it wasn't for you i just want to say thanks uh that i would have been dumbed down even
