[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  And it mentioned that it would help me with angina, so I decided to order.
[00:03.680 --> 00:05.680]  I figure I had nothing to lose.
[00:05.680 --> 00:09.840]  Heart and body extract supplies your body with everything it needs to balance itself
[00:09.840 --> 00:14.840]  and maintain optimal heart and circulatory health with no negative side effects.
[00:14.840 --> 00:19.840]  I took the formula three times a day as directed and I kid you not, within four days my angina
[00:19.840 --> 00:21.800]  pain was completely gone.
[00:21.800 --> 00:35.800]  Order HBXTRACT by calling 866-295-5305 or online at HBXTRACT.com that's 866-295-5305 or HBXTRACT.com
[00:35.800 --> 00:40.320]  I could not believe it actually stopped the pain, heart and body extract actually works.
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.240]  This is just an amazing product, even the numbness in my hands is completely gone.
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.880]  Heart and body extract for a long and healthy life.
[00:51.880 --> 01:03.520]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08.320 --> 01:09.320]  You want answers?
[01:09.320 --> 01:17.760]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin,
[01:17.760 --> 01:36.560]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:36.560 --> 01:39.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.320]  We are live here today.
[01:42.320 --> 01:50.160]  It is Tuesday, the 16th day of October 2012, election 2012 is heating up in a big way.
[01:50.160 --> 01:54.840]  Obviously, we've got a big dog and pony show coming up tonight where the two establishment
[01:54.840 --> 02:00.200]  globalists try to act like there's a big difference between the two of them.
[02:00.200 --> 02:02.680]  When it comes to who finances them, there really isn't a difference.
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.200]  In the rhetoric there is, I like Romney saying small businesses are the backbone of this
[02:06.200 --> 02:11.080]  country and cutting taxes increases revenue and the family's good.
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.840]  I mean, at least he's got to pay lip service to it and again, I'm not saying go out and
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.840]  vote for Romney.
[02:17.840 --> 02:23.040]  I see different fallouts from either one of these men being re-elected.
[02:23.040 --> 02:30.440]  I'm going to talk some about that here today, but the most convincing argument that I've
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.240]  heard, if you even believe there's real elections at the presidential level, we know there's
[02:34.240 --> 02:37.760]  been proven fraud in many areas of the country.
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.040]  Many experts agree like Bev Harris, we've interviewed many times as a preeminent expert
[02:42.040 --> 02:50.160]  on election fraud that if there's a landslide, it's really hard to steal an election because
[02:50.160 --> 02:56.200]  there are so many different municipalities and systems within the 50 states that there's
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.280]  undoubtedly fraud out there all over the place.
[02:58.280 --> 03:03.440]  We know that there's election fraud by the people controlling the elections.
[03:03.440 --> 03:08.800]  There is all sorts of voter fraud, people voting multiple times.
[03:08.800 --> 03:11.600]  That's kind of the Democratic Party specialty.
[03:11.600 --> 03:16.080]  The Republicans are more on the electronic fraud end, but so are the Democrats.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.080]  So it's a spectrum of that.
[03:18.080 --> 03:22.720]  You know about LBJ cheating in Texas famously with box 13, you know about Chicago helping
[03:22.720 --> 03:24.960]  JFK go over the edge.
[03:24.960 --> 03:29.960]  And even though both men work basically for the same globalist, there are different management
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.920]  teams that are battling for the CEO job of slavery incorporated.
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.760]  As I said, now 12 years ago in the film Waking Life, and it's still the same thing today.
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.240]  There are two different management teams battling for the CEO job of slavery incorporated.
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.200]  What I do see as most convincing to vote for Romney, and I'm not saying that, I'm gonna
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.640]  throw out reasons to vote for Obama as well coming up, is that Obama won't be facing
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.960]  re-election, and he'll be able to do whatever he wants.
[03:59.960 --> 04:02.120]  And that is a scary prospect.
[04:02.120 --> 04:07.680]  With Mitt Romney getting in there, at least he would want to win re-election.
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.680]  Presidents famously go for broke once they are a lame duck.
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.480]  Once their political career is basically over, they can sign pardons, they can basically
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.920]  get away with murder.
[04:20.920 --> 04:26.760]  Now the other argument is, if Obama does win though, you can bet the Republicans are probably
[04:26.760 --> 04:29.640]  gonna get the Senate and the House.
[04:29.640 --> 04:33.640]  And you might get some more constitutional Ron Paul types in there, and that started
[04:33.640 --> 04:35.160]  to happen.
[04:35.160 --> 04:40.720]  And then you could have a stalemate in government.
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.840]  That's an argument for hey, don't worry if Obama gets in.
[04:43.840 --> 04:47.920]  My issue is he's been doing everything with executive orders at a level no president ever
[04:47.920 --> 04:48.920]  did.
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.560]  But he signed double what Bush has already, and it's just amazing numbers.
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.720]  I was reading just over the weekend, I printed off an article showing all the executive orders
[04:56.720 --> 05:02.240]  and I meant to, it showed him going back to George Washington and then right through Eisenhower
[05:02.240 --> 05:07.000]  and then right through to Obama, and it's just exponentially getting worse.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.600]  Obama signed almost a thousand, it was just amazing numbers.
[05:11.600 --> 05:16.360]  So look, then there's the argument of if things get really bad with another four years
[05:16.360 --> 05:22.000]  of Obama, people will finally get politically sick and vomit out communism and socialism
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.920]  and corporatism that sits on top of it, feeding off a centralized nanny system.
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.280]  So that's all coming up today.
[05:29.280 --> 05:37.320]  Our story out at infowars.com, Obama supporters threaten to kill Romney if he wins the election.
[05:37.320 --> 05:42.360]  And that dove tells with the big reports we've put out, literally finding thousands of tweets
[05:42.360 --> 05:49.080]  saying that people plan to riot if Obama isn't reelected, that story has gone nationwide
[05:49.080 --> 05:53.200]  thanks to our listeners in drudgerport.com, we're gonna be getting into that and a lot
[05:53.200 --> 05:58.840]  more and eyes wide shut, is now admitted to be real, we'll be right back.
[05:58.840 --> 06:02.760]  Sick of the globalist, you genesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing

[10:53.720 --> 11:01.160]  We are reaching 15 million people a week conservatively, that's 15 million different people.
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.560]  Absolutely incredible that the show is exploding this fast.
[11:04.560 --> 11:08.600]  It shows there is a hunger for liberty and freedom out there and we are very, very thankful
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.920]  to all of our AM and FM affiliates.

[11:24.200 --> 11:27.200]  and video streams at prisonplanet.tv.
[11:27.200 --> 11:35.680]  Whoa, I mean, wow, I'm almost always excited and chomping at the bit to get on air but
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.760]  it's just a quickening, it's just every day for the last few years, things get crazier.
[11:40.760 --> 11:45.680]  There's never a slow news day, in fact, it's always overwhelming the amount of news and
[11:45.680 --> 11:50.280]  information there is to cover and we're going to get into it all.
[11:50.280 --> 11:56.480]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn, ladies and gentlemen, you remember him, the head of the IMF.
[11:56.480 --> 12:01.520]  He was in the polls showing he was going to trounce Sarkozy, who's also under criminal
[12:01.520 --> 12:07.560]  investigation now and it did come out that Sarkozy set him up, that was proven.
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.160]  They jumped the gun and put tweets out even before they called the police on him.
[12:12.160 --> 12:21.960]  It's known that he basically goes through hookers like you go through popcorn at a movie and
[12:21.960 --> 12:26.880]  now he has been charged in French hooker ring and he's basically threatening to bring everybody
[12:26.880 --> 12:34.360]  down and it's admitted underground grottoes at castles dressed up in outfits, having sex
[12:34.360 --> 12:39.560]  with a bunch of women and men and the quote is in the New York Times that it's eyes wide
[12:39.560 --> 12:41.680]  shut like.
[12:41.680 --> 12:45.560]  The main story, there's several of the New York Times, his sex life was out of step,
[12:45.560 --> 12:51.600]  Strauss-Kahn says but not illegal and they go on to describe it as eyes wide shut.
[12:51.600 --> 12:58.160]  That's quoted in one of these New York Times articles, yes, eyes wide shut, former IMF head
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.120]  lived the life of quote eyes wide shut and there's also a Liberty Blitzkrieg article
[13:02.120 --> 13:06.040]  we're linking to that boils that down at infowars.com.
[13:06.040 --> 13:08.360]  Why do I lead the show with that?
[13:08.360 --> 13:14.200]  Because truth is stranger than fiction and I have studied the globalist, I have studied
[13:14.200 --> 13:22.840]  what they're into, I have also been in and around as basically an investigator that fell
[13:22.840 --> 13:30.680]  into the middle of it, the highest levels of Hollywood and I have infiltrated Bohemian
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.160]  Grove, I have interviewed the journalist that have infiltrated Scum and Bones, I have studied
[13:34.160 --> 13:43.040]  the writings of the globalist and to boil it down, the western world is led by the Illuminati.
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.200]  Of course it's in your encyclopedia that they had German investigations when a courier got
[13:48.200 --> 13:55.760]  struck by lightning carrying directives for the rest of Europe by the Ingolstadt University
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.720]  priest, Adam Weishaupt, and how they would take over the Masonic lodges, how they would
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.760]  use men of good will to actually carry out their evil, not knowing how to compartmentalize,
[14:06.760 --> 14:10.600]  how to brainwash, how to dumb down and how to overthrow society, their goal, the end
[14:10.600 --> 14:18.680]  of family, the end of God, the end of civilization, just murder death killing through the first
[14:18.680 --> 14:24.600]  phase and then a new mega enlightenment where they would become gods and that's why today
[14:24.600 --> 14:27.640]  they're all into eugenics and life extension because now they believe they're really going
[14:27.640 --> 14:28.640]  to be given that.
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.640]  I don't believe in this, let's get that straight.
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.160]  I've quoted Ray Kurzweil saying they're going to merge with machines, the world government
[14:34.160 --> 14:38.000]  will get rid of the majority of us and the elites will fly off to outer space to found
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  new planets.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.600]  I quote it in end game and major newspapers say over and over again Alex Jones believes
[14:48.600 --> 14:52.080]  that the elite are going to merge with machines and fly off in spaceships, well they actually
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.040]  say they will be the spaceships.
[14:55.040 --> 15:00.800]  I'm not the ones saying that, they're the ones, I've told you that by the way Strauss
[15:00.800 --> 15:08.560]  Kahn it's high dollar hookers in little satanic style orgies, that's bad enough.
[15:08.560 --> 15:12.360]  The real deal here is it's come out in major mainstream investigations all over Europe,
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.120]  they find dungeons full of dead little kids, you name it, it always goes to the highest
[15:16.120 --> 15:19.680]  people in the government and the investigations get shut down, you can look up those reports,
[15:19.680 --> 15:23.120]  I'm going to get one of our writers the next few days we'll do a big boil down, they just
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.400]  had that, I didn't even cover it there so much about this weekend, the former top children's
[15:27.400 --> 15:32.440]  show in England for decades, after the guy died it's all coming out now about how he
[15:32.440 --> 15:36.680]  would visit the orphanages and everywhere else and reportedly rape the children, it's
[15:36.680 --> 15:42.240]  all Jerry Sandusky, again they do it through these children's groups, this is who these
[15:42.240 --> 15:48.640]  people are, okay and this is what we're facing and that's what the TSA is all about is training
[15:48.640 --> 15:54.720]  you, now were they the Breitbart editor, an attractive woman on video says I don't want
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.480]  to go, they drag her behind the closed door, the door closes her husband shot the video
[15:58.480 --> 16:06.160]  of it and then they, she said anywhere else it would be a sexual assault, you don't miss
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.120]  USA crying about it and you're like why do they do this, it sounds crazy, the TSA themselves
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.240]  most of them aren't perverts or criminals, they're just mindless idiots that follow
[16:14.240 --> 16:21.120]  orders, but this is a social conditioning experiment, okay that's what we're facing
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.880]  and if you don't understand that, if you don't know that, you know when I was at Bohemian
[16:24.880 --> 16:27.760]  Grove you can watch the footage where they do a mock human sacrifice of a child that
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.520]  begs for its life and all this and it's about getting rid of their cares and putting all
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.880]  the bad mojo, all the bad karma, the bad reput you so onto this effigy, it's a very
[16:36.880 --> 16:44.280]  fousty and they even quote some stuff out of Faust, mix it into Babylonian druidic rituals,
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.480]  it's an amalgamation, the occult's always a regurgitation of the same ancient thing
[16:48.480 --> 16:53.920]  over and over again and they're there and you can say oh that's a play, well that's
[16:53.920 --> 16:59.320]  where plays come from was the pre-step on the stage, you know doing it all in a religious
[16:59.320 --> 17:06.080]  ceremony, that's where art came from, that's where those ideas of the stage, the first
[17:06.080 --> 17:13.760]  stages were always religious and it is that old time religion, we mean pre-Judaic, pre-Christian,
[17:13.760 --> 17:19.240]  pre-Islamic, this is what's always been there, it never went away and I was there at Bohemian
[17:19.240 --> 17:24.280]  Grove for five and a half hours and I was there during the ritual for an hour and a
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.160]  half, I snuck in on the day they said they had it, boom got it on video, CBS News got
[17:29.160 --> 17:34.000]  arrested, Vanity Fair has been arrested, literally more than, I don't know, 15 different news
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.240]  agencies have been arrested, by the grace of God I got in and got out because you know
[17:38.240 --> 17:41.880]  what, I was praying the entire time, I was like I'm going to be confident when the Secret
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.440]  Service talks to me, when the sheriff's deputies talk to me, they would come up to my cancer
[17:46.440 --> 17:51.960]  to myself, it was incredible and they would talk to us and I had a little hidden camera
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.080]  on my side, I wouldn't think I'd be able to change the tape so I had an hour or had
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.560]  a control that would turn it on and off on a little strap on the bag, so again I didn't
[18:00.560 --> 18:04.160]  get a lot of it on tape because I would only hit it during certain points but I caught
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.160]  some of them coming up and talking to me on tape and I would just say God, I'm confident
[18:08.160 --> 18:11.920]  and if you want this video out then we'll get me out of this and I would just sit there
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.720]  and calmly smile and talk to them and my cancer did it as well, I mean we got questioned
[18:16.720 --> 18:20.360]  I don't know two or three times, well three times total, once by Secret Service, once
[18:20.360 --> 18:27.920]  by the, once by the, I believe it was the sheriff, he had sheriff's deputies with him,
[18:27.920 --> 18:34.880]  he was an older guy and he was wearing a sheriff's department windbreaker slash raincoat, I later
[18:34.880 --> 18:38.160]  looked it up online, it looked like the sheriff but the point is it was an older sheriff's
[18:38.160 --> 18:42.760]  deputy and they were there and they were looking at me and looking at Mike and what are you
[18:42.760 --> 18:46.560]  doing, who are you with, I work with the hillbillies, you know knowing one of the names of the clubs
[18:46.560 --> 18:52.960]  where the bushes go, having some of the internal documents and I was there during that ritual
[18:52.960 --> 19:01.240]  and they were absolutely in rapture, I've been in holy rotor churches, I've been in Methodist
[19:01.240 --> 19:07.600]  churches, I've been in Baptist churches, gone to all three in my life growing up and
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.640]  I've seen people in religious ecstasy and you know the vibe is I love God and I want
[19:12.640 --> 19:18.000]  to be good and I want to be serene and I, you know I have a connection to the Holy Spirit
[19:18.000 --> 19:27.520]  okay, this was the opposite, this was focused hard steel cold power lust and those old men,
[19:27.520 --> 19:32.960]  those thousand plus old men watching the ritual were just, they were taking it very very very
[19:32.960 --> 19:41.480]  serious until the end when they had some voodoo style New Orleans band come out and play when
[19:41.480 --> 19:47.280]  the saints come marching home and then it was all, you know the incredible backdrop
[19:47.280 --> 19:52.160]  of ominous darkness dropped right at that point it's all about bringing it to the edge
[19:52.160 --> 19:58.280]  putting all of your evil things you've done and cremating your care on to the child that
[19:58.280 --> 20:03.000]  they sacrificed the mock child and again they may have actually sacrificed something when
[20:03.000 --> 20:08.560]  they brought in on a with big black Clydesdale horses, a horse-drawn hearse with a little
[20:08.560 --> 20:12.680]  coffin in the back, a child-sized coffin and then went behind black drapes, the old men
[20:12.680 --> 20:18.600]  were just grinding their teeth and my kansans like what's going on they like, you know and
[20:18.600 --> 20:22.760]  that was the real ritual then they bring it out the boatman brings the child across they
[20:22.760 --> 20:29.560]  burn it but the height of the ritual happened right up front pretty much and I'm telling
[20:29.560 --> 20:34.480]  you it was religious they were serious and and now here it is in the news Dominique Strauss
[20:34.480 --> 20:40.680]  Conn giant satanic sex orgies eyes wide shut okay no big deal though everything's fine
[20:40.680 --> 20:46.840]  now when we come back new threats to riot if Obama loses the election and Obama supporters

[25:20.160 --> 25:29.320]  want to welcome a new affiliate kpnw 50,000 watt am 11 20 am eugene oregon we're getting
[25:29.320 --> 25:35.120]  five six affiliates every week right now the show is just absolutely exploding and we're
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.440]  very thankful all those stations picking up the broadcast and understanding that yes i
[25:39.440 --> 25:45.320]  know it's crazy to say most of the elite running things are sex addict devil worshipping maniacs
[25:45.320 --> 25:52.000]  but you know it's in the new york times today about dominate strouse con look at jerry sandusky
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.200]  i told you that went higher than him and now that's coming out look i didn't know all this
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.960]  stuff 20 years ago when i got politically involved 17 years ago got mad enough to get
[26:01.960 --> 26:08.440]  on air i didn't know any of this in the deeper i dig i just always run into this and it's
[26:08.440 --> 26:14.480]  it's it's super creepy so we're gonna be breaking all that down as i mentioned look big debate
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.480]  coming up tonight i want to break down my views on romney versus obama obviously they're
[26:20.480 --> 26:24.240]  run by the same people to a great extent but they do have two different management teams
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.840]  behind them and so there's different styles and romney couldn't get away with as much
[26:28.840 --> 26:33.380]  when it comes to restricting guns he says he won't open the borders he says he's against
[26:33.380 --> 26:38.640]  abortion now sure in the past he was for all that but he'll have trouble getting that through
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.760]  obama has doubled the amount of people on food stamps the last three and a half years
[26:43.760 --> 26:51.440]  that's official he has said the un order commands our military he signed double the executive
[26:51.440 --> 26:56.720]  order so far of what bush did in eight years and he's launched all these new wars which
[26:56.720 --> 27:02.000]  just make the peace prize a joke i'm not saying vote for romney i'm gonna be honest i i just
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.800]  i know there's so much election fraud in travis county anyways has been proven where i live
[27:05.800 --> 27:10.520]  and i'm just not gonna endorse either one of these guys because either way it's going
[27:10.520 --> 27:21.720]  to be bad but obama if he is reelected will not be facing election again and he'll have
[27:21.720 --> 27:26.400]  executive orders he'll have pardons katie bar the door this is a guy that did fashion
[27:26.400 --> 27:32.560]  furious a false flag to blame the second amendment so i understand people that are voting for
[27:32.560 --> 27:37.680]  meant romney and saying well it's the lesser two evils i support gary johnson i think
[27:37.680 --> 27:43.440]  he should be in the debates to inject real ideas from a libertarian conservative constitutional
[27:43.440 --> 27:52.480]  perspective of why he's anti-war why people like ron paul are because it shouldn't be
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.800]  the purview of democrats who are actually a bunch of warmongers but they always then
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.680]  then pay lip service to being anti-war i mean it's these idiots that support obama i'm not
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.400]  mad at you because you're not supporting meant romney i'm mad at you with you know the red
[28:07.400 --> 28:13.320]  hot chili peppers we're here in austin wearing obama shirts this weekend because it's idiotic
[28:13.320 --> 28:18.480]  obama is the opposite of everything he claimed he stood for when it comes to be against torture
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.640]  lobbyists and government secret arrest corporate welfare he expanded it all and he showed duplicitous
[28:24.640 --> 28:30.880]  in his deception of saying oh i don't want the the ndaa to secretly arrest americans
[28:30.880 --> 28:35.080]  to pass don't worry it's not going to pass i won't sign it so there wouldn't be opposition
[28:35.080 --> 28:40.720]  to it then saying well it's not for u.s. citizens turns out his lawyers wrote it he wanted it
[28:40.720 --> 28:44.840]  he demanded it all that got released the letters and then he said don't worry i won't sign
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.360]  it and then signed it you know i mean he makes bill clinton look truthful he makes george
[28:50.360 --> 28:56.000]  bush look truthful but it's because it's a sign of the times things are becoming more
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.280]  and more out of control because the public's been dumbed down there was that big study
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.000]  yesterday guys we repulled that big national study forming it was in the associated press
[29:03.000 --> 29:11.000]  Reuters you name it big national poll slash study 25 percent of people read newspapers
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.120]  on a regular basis the vast majority never read them but they sure got an opinion though
[29:17.120 --> 29:22.200]  they go off somebody's hair or somebody's color or somebody's speech or somebody's accent
[29:22.200 --> 29:27.720]  or where they're from i mean it's just i am freaked out by the fact that most adults i
[29:27.720 --> 29:34.280]  talk to even executives business people are mental midgets and more and more i realize
[29:34.280 --> 29:38.880]  my gosh we are just we are at the mercy of criminals at every level who actually know
[29:38.880 --> 29:42.800]  how things work see most people that wake up to how things work they just join the dark
[29:42.800 --> 29:50.040]  side because the general public are like in slow motion and people that are awake we're
[29:50.040 --> 29:59.560]  like the flash so it's like cheetahs versus sloths who's going to win the race i mean
[29:59.560 --> 30:05.160]  it's not like the tortoise and the hare this is like turtles without legs and i just it's
[30:05.160 --> 30:09.160]  freaking me out because i'm worried about society i'm worried about our species i'm
[30:09.160 --> 30:14.920]  worried about where we're going and my children's future because let me tell you when you get
[30:14.920 --> 30:19.080]  this type of corrupt people in they're delusional and lazy too more and more they don't know
[30:19.080 --> 30:23.400]  what they're doing either the elite are dumb i mean they they know more than general public
[30:23.400 --> 30:28.320]  but they're dumb too that is such a freaky understanding to come to the realization it's
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.040]  on an arrogant statement because i don't think of myself as that smart to be light years
[30:32.040 --> 30:38.120]  ahead of almost everybody is absolutely a horrible understanding okay i'm going to come
[30:38.120 --> 30:42.600]  back i promise and just get into all the news it's all off the chart but there are just
[30:42.600 --> 30:45.760]  thousands of people saying they're going to ride of obama in reelect we're going to break
[30:45.760 --> 30:53.080]  that down straight ahead we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the

[34:46.480 --> 34:52.320]  and think it would be great to rule the world or people who truly do crave power because
[34:52.320 --> 34:57.480]  they like to hurt people they want to rule the world and it's because throughout history
[34:57.480 --> 35:07.080]  we've let bad people that crave power for all the wrong reasons into positions of authority
[35:07.080 --> 35:14.240]  and because we've worshipped the altar of out of control authority it is because good
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.640]  men and women have stood down that we've had so many nightmares historically take place
[35:18.640 --> 35:24.160]  because once you get corruption in it's then replaced by the leaner and meaner corruption
[35:24.160 --> 35:29.960]  and then that's replaced by the even more charismatic evil corruption and then the charismatic
[35:29.960 --> 35:36.840]  sadistic manipulative corruption and then the most wicked gangs and corrupt combines
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.480]  get into control and then things get worse from there and that's why the globalists
[35:41.480 --> 35:49.640]  have codified a global system of post industrial neo feudalistic agenda 21 that actually codifies
[35:49.640 --> 35:59.200]  a system of predatory cultural cannibalism that actually codified it into a plan and
[35:59.200 --> 36:05.960]  all actuaried out computerized and broken down but they can't even stop from cheating
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.000]  each other and that's one of the good things that holds them back is the separation of
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.480]  powers so it's a mess and we're all in it it's a you know what sandwich and they want
[36:16.480 --> 36:22.640]  us all to take a bite and I'm here you know simply pointing out that when I say I have
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.320]  come to the realization that when it comes to researching reality and knowing what's
[36:26.320 --> 36:33.640]  really going on we are about the best there is and that's a scary thing because I don't
[36:33.640 --> 36:39.560]  have some arrogant high view of myself I've just come to the realization of the facts
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.120]  but when I say that you know the guest I have on and people are are are are much smarter
[36:45.120 --> 36:52.760]  than the general public that's an oversimplification it's not that it's that we have found reality
[36:52.760 --> 37:00.920]  and tried to focus on it and become experts on geopolitical cultural propaganda systems
[37:00.920 --> 37:05.600]  and what real life's really all about versus people that have just been set in front of
[37:05.600 --> 37:12.680]  a television from birth pump GMO pumped additives pumped chemicals put on drugs to be kept in
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.680]  a physical trance state most the public is in a suspended disbelief learned lower brain
[37:18.680 --> 37:25.840]  wave near sleep daydream I mean our next issue the magazine is basically almost entirely
[37:25.840 --> 37:30.760]  about this issue and the globalist it's all public all the big universities they admit
[37:30.760 --> 37:38.440]  it they they brag about it it's not that the public is stupid by and large they are in
[37:38.440 --> 37:45.720]  a trance and they are experts on their favorite sitcom their favorite drama movies entertainment
[37:45.720 --> 37:57.400]  music being trendy they are experts in their little thing their little niche their little
[37:57.400 --> 38:04.800]  club their little hobby most people's hobbies is watching television playing video games
[38:04.800 --> 38:10.680]  my son complains because you know he's reading not bragging it's true how kids are supposed
[38:10.680 --> 38:16.040]  to be at 10 he's reading college textbooks and obsessed on biology and history and everything
[38:16.040 --> 38:21.480]  else because he's discovered that and he goes dad I you know I even go you know these play
[38:21.480 --> 38:24.800]  groups and stuff with the homeschool other homeschool kids and a lot of them are nice
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.800]  and stuff but all they want to talk about is video games and all they want to talk about
[38:29.800 --> 38:36.080]  is call of duty to or whatever and you know dad I know how terrible war really is and
[38:36.080 --> 38:40.760]  and and that these people have been conditioned you know just you know to not be able to differentiate
[38:40.760 --> 38:54.080]  between mass killing and fiction my son he was sitting there with literally a NASA rocket
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.800]  scientist and a bunch of other big business people I took him to a party a couple months
[38:58.800 --> 39:06.080]  about a month ago and I was sitting there with with with you know people in the very
[39:06.080 --> 39:14.320]  top of the 1% you know the 99.8 and they're going we've never seen a kid like this we're
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.720]  not just saying this how does he know all this I mean he's not just saying these things
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.200]  he really knows all this and it was adults sitting there blown away by a 10 year old
[39:24.200 --> 39:28.640]  well that's what our founding fathers were all like when they were 10 obsessed with knowledge
[39:28.640 --> 39:33.240]  and reading and how the world really works once you get those basic building blocks then
[39:33.240 --> 39:40.280]  you just launch forward into the world and you just learn more and more and that's what
[39:40.280 --> 39:54.920]  scary is my 10 year old son is more informed than CEOs of banks chairman of banks had technology
[39:54.920 --> 40:03.080]  officers for Fortune 500 companies and it's not because those people aren't super smart
[40:03.080 --> 40:11.040]  it's that they're compartmentalized themselves and it's just extremely frustrating very very
[40:11.040 --> 40:17.720]  frustrating you know one reason my son is so smart and blooming is his he is he admires
[40:17.720 --> 40:22.120]  me and and if I'm not getting into subjects too hardcore my wife lets him listen to the
[40:22.120 --> 40:25.240]  show and he'll sit there for hours when he has time listening to it reading books at
[40:25.240 --> 40:32.800]  the same time and and see if there were role models like explorers and scientists and researchers
[40:32.800 --> 40:39.320]  for our children we would then have the new Renaissance for 400 years the rock stars of
[40:39.320 --> 40:46.760]  the western world were scientists and explorers and trailblazers and soldiers people that you
[40:46.760 --> 40:52.680]  know 180 something people at the Alamo fighting 5000 and fighting to the death and killing
[40:52.680 --> 40:57.000]  2000 soldiers you know it wasn't a people were into death back then they knew what death
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.280]  was they knew what fighting was if they saw blood and guts it was always real and if
[41:02.280 --> 41:07.120]  you insulted somebody at church or wherever they'd say all right let's get your sword
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.360]  let's go outside so people didn't sit there and insult when colonel Travis knew the help
[41:12.360 --> 41:15.400]  was it probably gonna get there and he wrote a letter saying victory or death I'm gonna
[41:15.400 --> 41:21.040]  fight to the death because it wasn't a death wish it was about being real that guy didn't
[41:21.040 --> 41:26.440]  play video games all day that guy didn't watch television and fantasize about killing that
[41:26.440 --> 41:34.000]  guy had seen the real thing they'd all seen it Davey Crockett all of them and they knew
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.520]  they were gonna die and they stepped up you know what we're here to fight we believe in
[41:39.520 --> 41:47.000]  this we're not running and that's history it's not some love of violence to just sit
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.720]  there and romanticize what they did it's romantic because it's real it's not a matrix simulation
[41:52.720 --> 42:00.640]  of a movie or a video game I want reality all of it I want it smells like heaven it
[42:00.640 --> 42:07.200]  smells like hell it looks great it looks terrible the the the valleys the hills the
[42:07.200 --> 42:12.560]  mountains the sky all of it I want it all I want the lows I want the highs I want reality
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.120]  and I want to make preparation for it those of you that want to sit there and live in
[42:17.120 --> 42:23.120]  denial and call real awakening conspiracy theory let your chains sit lightly upon you
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.560]  forget you are countrymen crouched down and lick the hand that feeds you Patrick Henry
[42:28.560 --> 42:36.320]  paraphrased go go from us in peace I'm sad for you you're a victim you care what some
[42:36.320 --> 42:41.160]  mindless empty trendy thinks when they laugh at you because you warm about the new world
[42:41.160 --> 42:46.440]  order that's a victim it isn't about them laughing it's not about feeling good or feeling
[42:46.440 --> 42:53.440]  bad when they laugh at you you're looking at a biological android programmed zombie you're
[42:53.440 --> 42:59.120]  looking at a medical issue what they think doesn't even matter they're not even in the
[42:59.120 --> 43:04.440]  same realm of those of us that know what's going on and doesn't mean we have all the
[43:04.440 --> 43:08.840]  answers we just know we're outside the box and then outside the next box and that we
[43:08.840 --> 43:13.680]  know we don't know and we know we're in an age of wonderment and we've always been in
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.960]  an age of wonderment and the wonderment is increasing every moment there's so much good
[43:17.960 --> 43:26.000]  in the universe so much beauty so much transcendent energy all of it is there for us it's unlimited
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.760]  but we don't embrace the true power instead we let a bunch of sickos that crave control
[43:32.760 --> 43:37.280]  and who want to keep you shuttered so they can be the boss oh don't let humans wake up
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.800]  keep them dumb keep them distracted also we can be in charge no no you will not control
[43:42.800 --> 43:48.560]  our destiny you are a joke you're not fit to lead anything you globalist you're a sick
[43:48.560 --> 43:59.080]  you're cancer you are absolute absolute cancer and any look I've said it a thousand times
[43:59.080 --> 44:05.200]  I'll say it again because it's so true cancer if it had a consciousness would think it was
[44:05.200 --> 44:13.240]  winning if cancer going to your bones your lungs your brain your body racing through reprogramming
[44:13.240 --> 44:17.440]  taking over shutting down the systems the different tissue groups that work together
[44:17.440 --> 44:25.120]  symbiotically to carry your brain inside its hardened electrochemical computer case this
[44:25.120 --> 44:31.680]  earth suit if cancer had a consciousness and was racing through you it would say I'm winning
[44:31.680 --> 44:36.320]  I'm winning I'm winning you're not winning anything fools you are missing out on the
[44:36.320 --> 44:45.240]  complete opportunity of human destiny that is to be good and to be a builder and to construct
[44:45.240 --> 44:55.120]  and to edify that is the true goal of humans we are made in the image of the galactic and
[44:55.120 --> 45:06.080]  universal engineer and you're going to let a bunch of people that want to go to underground
[45:06.080 --> 45:14.000]  grottoes a bunch of weird stinking old men to hump on prostitutes and dress up in devil
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.040]  worship outfits that's what's exciting red robes and having sex with prostitutes or worse
[45:21.040 --> 45:29.520]  like sandusky little kids that's what these people are into I'm into walking outside when
[45:29.520 --> 45:34.920]  it's a clarionite and seeing the Milky Way hundreds of millions of stars and the moon
[45:34.920 --> 45:40.640]  and hearing bugs and insects and frogs and coyotes and just just like it's the greatest
[45:40.640 --> 45:45.840]  symphony orchestra I've ever heard just connecting to the universe and the creator it's absolutely
[45:45.840 --> 45:52.080]  empowering and transcendent and imagine people that want to go in caves and have sex with
[45:52.080 --> 45:56.880]  women with a bunch of other gross old globalist around them it's all about how they got the
[45:56.880 --> 46:03.280]  will to do it all about they got the strength to go in there and they're all repressed and
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.880]  get all geared up and sit there and little creepy face mask and have sex with people
[46:08.880 --> 46:15.520]  because they're so powerful that's not powerful that's pathetically weak you think it's powerful
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.240]  Satanist to grab some crying baby and torture it and chop it up you people are weak you're
[46:20.240 --> 46:26.800]  pathetically weak and I want the true power that is the good to rise up and smash these
[46:26.800 --> 46:31.760]  people they are incredibly weak and let me tell you good knows how to smash evil and
[46:31.760 --> 46:36.720]  doesn't take enjoyment out of it anymore than you take enjoyment when you've got to you
[46:36.720 --> 46:41.200]  know kill a snake that's in your backyard it's just got to be done you got to smash
[46:41.200 --> 46:48.800]  them we'll show them they like the corner of the week and have their way with it and toy
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.360]  with humanity because they're scared of it they like to toy with innocence and attack it because
[46:53.360 --> 46:57.760]  they hate it and they fear it and they know they'll never conquer it no matter how many drugs
[46:57.760 --> 47:06.160]  how much programming how much mind-eating vaccines and nanotech re-engineer recombinant viral plaque
[47:06.160 --> 47:14.560]  neuron selective attack lobotomy systems they launch you will never succeed and the pit you dig
[47:14.560 --> 47:20.320]  for us is the pit you're going to fall into I know from the foundations of the earth your
[47:20.320 --> 47:29.200]  destiny is to fail our destiny is to rise I didn't mean to preach here today excuse me
[47:29.200 --> 47:39.840]  I'm a fan of humanity and again Hollywood with Al Pacino tells you the devil's a fan of man the
[47:39.840 --> 47:46.560]  devil is not a fan of man the devil comes to kill steal and destroy and hates God's creation
[47:47.280 --> 47:54.000]  you know why there's a devil seen God folks and when the devil looks at humanity you know what
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.600]  the devil sees you know what we're made in the image of you got it you got it God's like oh well
[48:01.600 --> 48:07.040]  there's no way you'd ever beat me see see if you can beat just a minor fraction of what I am
[48:08.000 --> 48:15.040]  a shadow of a shadow here see if you can beat them and that's what all of this is ladies and
[48:15.040 --> 48:22.000]  gentlemen is a great test and I know it in my heart my intellect my mind all of it and I watch
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.920]  the activities of the rulers they know it they're not atheist they're devil worshipers
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.760]  that's why it's all about their power that's why they kill every brags about bombing and killing
[48:33.760 --> 48:40.240]  people and and and and uh you know uh the prince of darkness Richard pearl brags about it at parties
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.600]  imagine it parties bragging to women that I launch sorties that kill people I have power
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.080]  looking at a big sack of weakness that couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs telling a bunch of
[48:50.080 --> 48:57.680]  women it's powerful because it kills people power is building power is regeneration power is life
[48:58.400 --> 49:05.440]  power is honor power is being true to yourself and true to others and not betraying people
[49:07.120 --> 49:14.160]  truth and courage and duty and strength all of it all of it that's what I want that's what I want
[49:14.160 --> 49:20.320]  to be I know I'm weak and pathetic but I turn my heart towards what's good you tuned in to hear
[49:20.320 --> 49:28.480]  the news and I'm gonna stop right now I'm gonna stop right now I just think about these people
[49:28.480 --> 49:33.040]  and they must be defeated they will be defeated the question is how bad will it get before we have
[49:33.040 --> 49:41.120]  the awakening and become unshackled by these individuals the ultimate insinical inbred
[49:41.120 --> 49:49.760]  jealous conniving envious hate of good the ultimate in selfishness trying to shutter
[49:49.760 --> 49:57.680]  humanity's destiny the ultimate the ultimate evil the ultimate weakness the ultimate malfunction
[49:57.680 --> 50:04.800]  the ultimate cancer the ultimate failure the ultimate ultimate ultimate ultimate enemy of our
[50:04.800 --> 50:12.160]  species all right let me now get into this here 49 minutes 12 seconds in a transmission
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.920]  emanating from Austin Texas if you're just joining us I'm Alex Jones
[50:19.280 --> 50:25.520]  let me just read you the headlines here Clinton I'm not responsible for diplomat security
[50:27.680 --> 50:34.400]  that's what she said weeks ago but now she says I am responsible for diplomat security and it's
[50:34.400 --> 50:39.680]  her fault and now we're told Navy SEALs were down the street running a different mission and came
[50:39.680 --> 50:44.800]  to save them and fought off all the al-qaeda yeah the al-qaeda if you even believe that story of the
[50:44.800 --> 50:50.080]  last 20 who knows what any of it's true we're dealing with liars just other liars
[50:53.760 --> 50:57.760]  meanwhile the New York Times admits yeah the government's arming al-qaeda in Libya and Syria I
[50:57.760 --> 51:03.280]  mean it just they can only do that with a population where I'm sorry I apologize the big study it's not
[51:03.280 --> 51:14.240]  25% read newspapers it was 23% so I was incorrect I was saying 25 it's worse than I said 23%
[51:14.240 --> 51:19.120]  reading a print newspaper only 29 reading any type of newspaper online or not Pew Research Center
[51:20.320 --> 51:24.800]  and that's why they get away with this I mean wow you got a bunch of people that think the world
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.440]  is about watching a television and that's the universe staring into what other people have

[59:17.600 --> 59:23.360]  guy worked there for years a manager uh and a family and and he was fired the secret service

[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:23.440]  separate quote quoting a song and they came and grabbed him and said we're going to drug you and
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:29.360]  all this and and i've said we shouldn't call for violence these guys are puppets but i just love
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:34.480]  how you've got the general public you know 23 percent that read newspapers and that and that
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:40.560]  percent most that's propaganda and you're like hey 50 plus percent of blacks are aborted since rovey
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:45.040]  wade hey uh you know what they've done to the black community they plan to do to all communities

[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:13.200]  america i i thought ferrican to cover this when come back and go your calls i thought
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:19.040]  what you said obama was horrible and was trying to kill africa and and and by destroying libya
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.360]  the only thing building up africa which it was i mean i was against that i was against the black
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:27.600]  genocide over there but not because i'm some bleeding heart i don't have any guilt i haven't
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:33.200]  done anything i actually want everybody to be empowered i don't like the fact that i know some
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:37.680]  people don't like me because of my race but i'm not going to judge everybody out there you know
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:41.280]  knowing that some hispanics don't like white people period well i'm not going to judge hispanics
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:45.280]  according to some people some whites don't like uh black people or whatever i'm not going to judge
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:52.400]  all whites according to that and vice versa uh but when this thing gets hyped up to such a point
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:58.080]  i mean you've got to respond to it and of course there's been riots and racial attacks increasing
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:02.320]  the last three years all over america against whites they're in local newspapers whites getting
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.960]  beat up at state fairs whites getting beat up on the streets by mobs of black people
[1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:13.200]  and i i'm against it when we've seen cases a few cases of whites killing blacks racially i mean
[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:18.240]  it's horrible just to be driving along others a black guy let's kill him he's black you know and
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:23.280]  drag some old black men to death i mean it's it's horrible the point is that's not sanctioned and it
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:28.720]  shouldn't be why is it covered up in sanction when black people do it because they want to keep this
[1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:33.920]  victimization narrative going not to empower black people but to beat whites over the heads
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:38.480]  except socialism except gun control except big government you're a racist that's what they said
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:43.520]  they go you're not for obama care you're a racist i mean i'm just sick of it i'm sick of it of course

[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:18.560]  promises but of course he didn't uh and i saw that right away so i made the obama deception
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:25.040]  because i knew who his advisers were but i'm scared of obama now i mean how much he's gotten away
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:31.600]  with the executive order saying nato and the un command our military some new executive orders he
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:40.080]  signed and i saw economist and professor and author and syndicate of columnist thomas soul last
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:46.160]  week said hey he was for seeing news articles and quotes and tweets about race rioting and
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:52.160]  things if obama didn't get elected and he said he's concerned he's a black man and i'm concerned about
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:56.720]  if there are riots what that will do to those communities and what it'll do to you know race
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:02.240]  relations all of it i mean i i know that this is terrible and it's such a politically correct world
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:07.760]  that i get up here with black preachers on exposing that 50 plus percent of blacks never get born
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:13.200]  since roe v wade that margaret singer was a nazi in fact she was a proto nazi hitler you know
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:17.280]  praised her and got his ideas from her and the rockefeller foundation and they said we'll pose
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:22.880]  as liberals this is like 80 years ago we'll take over and we'll hire blacks to go lead them into
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:28.800]  welfare and abortion and we'll end their families and then we'll export that breakdown of society
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:35.120]  into all the communities and as tony brown of tony brown's journalist said on this show you know
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:40.480]  what you see in the black community is beta tested for your community it's wrong i want to see people
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:47.760]  empowered but i'm also not guilty i'm not here pleading and begging and you know oh i promise
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:52.800]  i'm not racist against you and all this i'm so sick of it msnbc and all of it it's divide and
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:12:02.640]  conquer and then you know i see an economic collapse blog dot com article i see an examiner
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:09.120]  article i see a chicago tribune article i see a chicago now article i see a whole bunch of articles
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:17.120]  i mean there's tons of them i mean so many it makes my head spin with economists and others
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:23.440]  not just thomas soul coming out and saying they're concerned and we run an article at info wars.com
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:28.480]  saturday picking you know this up and we checked the tweets i went and looked at them that these
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:35.920]  are real accounts folks some of them have like 8 000 10 000 12 000 tweets we uh click on them
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:41.040]  um you can go tell a dummy account because it won't have just constant photos of the family and
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:45.600]  links and i'm going here i'm going there it'll be a few dummy tweets and you know some images
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:50.880]  said i've had people do that to me i've had them attack you know me and make up fake accounts
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:57.440]  and stuff so i've learned how these things work and so we post the article drudge report picks it up
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:03.760]  drudge report dot com and then i start seeing a minority of people in the comments thousands
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:08.480]  of comments saying this is made up these aren't real accounts or alex wants a race war he's this
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:13.600]  and that when this is newsworthy i mean we cover it when someone doesn't threaten the president
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:18.320]  and gets grabbed and thrown in a psychiatric ward for criticizing the government the fellow reserve
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:25.040]  brandon rob the marine and i have talk show host on her being thrown in jail and i've i've played
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:31.280]  the newscast of police in in missouri saying we'll arrest you if you lie about obama and then
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:36.320]  they're going to decide not a court not a civil matter not adjudicated there they said if you say
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:41.360]  he's not a christian we're going to arrest you i can play those newscast this is authoritarianism
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:45.440]  so then i talked to what's in and i go literally what's in there's hundreds and hundreds of these
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:51.360]  i can see thousands more i said i want you to another article on this monday morning
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:58.080]  he said okay he did it drudge link to it again and i was like hey i sent you a bunch of tweets
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:04.240]  where they're saying they're going to kill romney and we've all heard you know alex bald one say
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.880]  kill this senator kill that person we know the democrats constantly talk about killing people
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:15.520]  and always get away with it and so my issue was hey i'm not one of these mainline republican
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:19.760]  types i'm a constitutionalist but i agree with more of their platform you know at least they
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:26.240]  say they're pro family pro sport business pro gun things like that and i'm like hey obama is going
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.840]  to be a lame duck he's not going to be facing reelection he can do whatever he wants with
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:35.760]  executive orders and pardons and all the rest of it so i'm like well this is scary but i still
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:40.320]  am not going to endorse romney because it'll be bad with him as well it's just it's two different
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:47.520]  versions of poison we're in trouble either way and so people know i'm nonpartisan they know i
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:52.800]  went after bush 110 percent he was horrible total tiring the republicans are a bunch of patriot act
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.760]  police state loving false flag creating globalists the democrats are part of it with them they're part
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:04.320]  of the same club but they battle they're in the same league like the nfl but they fight each other
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:09.600]  for who you know who gets to run the show they're fighting over those big levers they all want levers
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:15.040]  of police state levers of control they're raising property taxes all over the country poor people
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:22.560]  are losing their houses to give it to you know globalist and corporate welfare and i'm known for
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:26.720]  being nonpartisan and really telling people what i really think and not being a political act and i
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:31.040]  read these people you know saying i've been a listener for years and i'm done because it's
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.880]  clear you're just a racist or you know it's clear you just don't like black people you know and again
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:43.680]  it's a small group but but still it's the same mindlessness when all of this is being pushed and
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:53.200]  all of this is being said i mean i've seen talk show host like michael reagan say that 9 11 truthers
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:58.560]  should be killed remember when they said that about mark dice and i came to march defense and and
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:03.040]  and said it's wrong to say i'll pay you the bullets line him up firing squad let's kill him
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:09.760]  let's shove hanger nades up the rear ends of babies and very perverted sick stuff uh and and the
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:14.400]  government said he's allowed to say kill people i was against that i mean this is dangerous folks
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:22.640]  this is dangerous and these are real tweets and there is a whole stack of articles did you guys
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:29.280]  get me that stack i was printing in there uh dan uh fantastic and i get yeah just let me have the
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:35.600]  new stack here uh thank you so much appreciate it because i meant to print these this morning uh
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:41.760]  here's one right wing french dweller stoking race riot fears of obama loses this is out of death
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:46.400]  and taxes uh examiner threats of election violence ignored by government mainstream media that's a
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:51.200]  good article by terry webster here's another one drudge promotes conspiracy site warning that black
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:57.440]  people will riot if romney wins think progress on record is funded by george soros along with media
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:04.000]  matters that has the former transition head of obama's campaign running it i mean this is run by
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:11.200]  the white house and george soros and folks in some of these articles they say i am a liar and this is
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:19.520]  not even true and you read this and they say i am a fraud it is a proven that i'm a fraud and i could
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:25.360]  definitely win a defamation uh deal on this but i mean these people have discredited themselves
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:31.280]  as someone who enjoys the occasional conspiracy theory entertainment though i do not deny corporate
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:35.920]  government conspiracy exists i can say that such fringe dwelling minds will believe it's almost
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:40.800]  anything and so it is the fringe dwelling conservative fears of a race riot of obama should
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:47.040]  lose in november if one is going to stoke fears one must do so in grand absurd fashion info wars
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:53.040]  paul joes of watson is right in the thick of it this should be expected from the warped imagination
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:18:00.080]  of alex jones a man who is a bottom at bottom a conspiracy theory profiteer don't believe for
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:06.400]  a second that jones actually believes the bleep he and his contributors publish i 110 percent believe
[1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:14.240]  it now dare you say i'm a fraud i 110 percent believe what i cover here they are shrewd cynical
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:20.160]  and out for cash oh it's okay for you to get you know all your global sponsors and george soros
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:24.560]  is funding think progress and all the rest of it but i'm not supposed to sell products i believe in
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:29.120]  who could be truly independent find myself see that's dirty when i do it's cool when government
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:34.720]  takes money from people and gives it to msnbc and in bailouts and it continues just just on and on
[1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:39.680]  and on saying that you know just just and i'm a total fraud okay here's another one now this is
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:45.040]  the drug the uh the uh fully funded george soros group think progress drudge promotes conspiracy
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:51.920]  site warning that black people will riot if romney wins and it just goes on to say you know that oh we
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:56.800]  claim we have more tweets but we didn't show them because you know 11 was enough well yeah i mean
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:00.560]  watson's like there's hundreds and i said i want them all linked and he said i don't have time and i
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:05.680]  said look i sent you hundreds and i sent you links i love watson but i'd say this on air i i said hey
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:11.440]  i want the death threats in there too those are real add that see it's you know what that's it
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:18.640]  we're gonna post one we got to stop it what 200 because i mean it does take a time to go check and
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:24.240]  make sure each account is a real account but we could put thousands if we didn't go vet each one
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:28.400]  that's the problem as we go look make sure there's hundreds or thousands of tweets make sure you know
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:36.720]  we can tell real profiles the point is just wait if obama loses i bet there'll be some civil unrest
[1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:41.520]  you know i said there'd be some civil unrest when machete came out heard there were there were
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:46.640]  machete attacks all over the country it was in local la papers but never connected that people
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:52.320]  were being hacked up in parking lots hispanic on white with machetes in la in places that that
[1:19:52.320 --> 1:20:01.440]  was what that was i mean it's just amazing you know this stuff is so off the chart so i'm gonna
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.280]  read these articles and i'm gonna read these quotes and i'm gonna read these death threats here on
[1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:13.680]  air ladies and gentlemen i've had the secret service here twice i've had the fbi here repeatedly
[1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:22.080]  i've had the atf here over people making threats on info wars dot com and prison party dot com more
[1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:29.280]  on commoners they show up with subpoenas with guns on their hips and they say we're here to get this
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:34.320]  record and they stand there while we go give them the ip addresses and the people go get arrested
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:38.800]  you know that's been in the news and they hand me the subpoena and say you can't say why we were here
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.080]  look at the judge's order and i'm like uh the fbi was here i can't say why oh yeah jones i bet that's
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:48.000]  yeah nicking that up and then months later it comes out in court the whole case in the associated
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.560]  press so i'm used to it okay you talk bad about obama the secret service shows up but you say
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:21:01.440]  you want to kill mint romney nothing happens to you erin fullen here as the food police shut down

[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:19.440]  million visitors to conspiracy websites in the last year and i think that's about accurate they're
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:25.280]  able to track it with computer systems um and chief among them the evil one alex jones they
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:30.640]  break down and again george soros it's the attitude of these authoritarians that poses liberals
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:36.560]  is they lecture and say you don't link to that well since you've been telling drugs not to link
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:40.960]  to us i notice he's been linking more probably not just to do it in your face we've been doing

[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:50.400]  in the army center getting ready for civil unrest do you think this is an issue and it turns into
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:58.160]  you racist scum you know how dare you lie and claim blacks are gonna riot oh no we just wrote
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:03.120]  articles linking to dozens and dozens of people we just go into twitter and type in i'm gonna

[1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:12.720]  it and they don't even know we're reporting on it and the media just says we're making it up
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:18.480]  we're the scum of the earth you read these articles we just made it all up did i make the
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:24.720]  secret service showing up here up i mean the hatari militia that i told you if there was any fairness
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:32.160]  in courts left in this country would be let off they literally spent a year with a 14 man group
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:36.800]  one of them an fbi agent the other informant at the highest levels trying to get a group of just
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:41.200]  you know hard work in local machine shop folks who who are worried about they collapse who were
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:46.960]  training for it going to the knob creek knob creek machine gun shoot they said you know the fbi guy
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:51.360]  was like what if things collapse and they come and take our guns and put us in camps we'll just
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:59.120]  have to fight it's too bad we gotta they arrested them said terrorism they and of course it all came
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:07.280]  out it was lies and the court said release them i was so in tune on this i had a thousands of
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:11.520]  militia groups i saw videos they were doing and i said that's a setup six months before it happened
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:16.240]  to them i was able to call it because i could see how they were setting them up with their youtube
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:20.560]  channel i mean i know how this stuff works folks i know what i'm talking about and they just boil
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:25.040]  it down because they know for even those that read the 23 percent that actually read online news
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:31.600]  it's all about rhetoric and and everything's dumbed down so it's so frustrating to have them
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:36.800]  just come out and say alex jones says black soul riot that racist that dog
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:44.640]  and they know their readers don't know that i you know have historians and scientists and black
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:48.880]  activists on and real black panther party you know founders who actually tried to help their
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:54.000]  communities on the show they don't know all that they just think oh well he must he's a white guy
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:03.280]  he's a racist i mean it's so mindless so again there's no doubt that the justice department the
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:08.400]  same ones that ship guns in a mexico to blend the second amendment is ordering this has been going
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:14.160]  on for weeks i've now discovered uh people on twitter and facebook calling for mit romney's death
[1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:19.920]  to not be visited and calling for criminal rioting not not not being visited and then
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:26.240]  i know lots of people who have friends and family who make a mild comment about obama
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:33.280]  to go back to kenya or that communist trader you know i i'm sick and tired and i wish he was gone
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:39.440]  boom secret service secret services fire that man i don't want him working here yes sir he's
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:50.160]  fired get out of here bob it is so frustrating to sit here and watch all of this unfold what is your
[1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:59.920]  take on all this 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 i mean are we not supposed to cover i mean i and again
[1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:03.920]  it's it's it's maybe 10 percent of the comments saying we're wrong to be covering this i don't go
[1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:09.040]  off what commenters say that's a tiny minority people saying that but my issue is it shows the
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:14.880]  mind control that george soros's groups come out and scream bloody murder and say you shouldn't be
[1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:20.480]  linking to this well that's why the judge reports a trailblazer you know it links to a guy jumping
[1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:25.520]  out of a capsule to earth hot air balloon it it links to a lady throwing herself to alligators
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:30.400]  to commit suicide it links to jobless this numbers it links to important but also interesting stuff
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:35.120]  i mean you guys no one watches you look at your ratings look at your numbers i mean small town
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:39.920]  newspapers have more visits than george soros's websites think progress and media matters your

[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:35.600]  the army admitted and responded publicly to poll joseph watson's article
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:44.000]  where they openly put on an army website but claim that shouldn't have been released that way they
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:48.240]  do that a lot somebody makes a mistake and puts out a manual that's been given to tens of thousands
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:55.120]  of mps they said yeah that's restricted but yeah we've set up reeducation camps they use the word
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:35:00.640]  reeducation camp anybody can type in army manual reeducation camp you'll see our article you'll see
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:06.240]  some foreign newspapers that picked it up with links to army dot mill websites and i've been on
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:14.560]  national radio shows and i appreciated it when the producer came on and got my help and said
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:20.800]  where is that manual i was on uh friday night on coast to coast a m john b wells was filling in for
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:25.440]  george norry both great guys by the way are coming on the show during the 48 hour broadcast
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:30.960]  this thursday and friday that kicks off at 11 a.m find out the tales at info wars dot com or
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:37.440]  enforce money bomb dot com and the producer came on or you know one of the nighttime producers
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:42.320]  people they're running things not the official producer i guess that's lisa lyon uh and said
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:46.160]  where is that and then i helped him and they went wow it's there and then went and found it and
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:52.080]  where's the army dot mill because paul's first article was actually linked to a national guard
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:55.440]  and then we were able to add the army dot mill once they came out and admitted it we had the
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:00.320]  official letterhead response but i understand why none of the national media or even alternative
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:05.520]  media really picked that up foreign newspaper did because they use the term reeducation camps
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:12.320]  i mean that's an authoritarian soviet term so they have the emergency centers establishment
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:17.280]  act which admits massive centers they admit they're preparing for all this civil unrest
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:23.040]  and i'm like hey uh people are calling for riots and stuff i don't think that's a good idea i don't
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:28.800]  burn down your neighborhood uh and you know don't worry the republicans aren't going to turn off all
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:35.440]  the entitlements this is a bad idea could this be provocateur to bring in martial law by the globalist
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:42.640]  and the response is by commenters is either these aren't real tweets when they're admittedly real
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:47.920]  people are now on they're responding or i'm a racist to talk about it or the george soros people
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:55.440]  just saying it isn't real so i mean there you go i mean this this is what we've come to uh in this
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:37:05.760]  country and paul watson links to it in his articles you know he's got mainstream news examples but
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:12.320]  it's always on local news where reporters are being attacked by angry black mobs and young people at
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:17.280]  it at state fairs all over the country i mean it's getting bad it's now becoming a kind of a
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:23.120]  gangsterish hip-hop culture thing that you know thomas sol writes about it like how bad is a white
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:30.160]  girl bleed that's become a little refrain let's i mean it's it's really horrible and and and and and
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:34.800]  the globalists want racial division they want to let this finally build up they don't want it to be
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:41.360]  culturally you know criticized they want people to feel good about beating up white people because
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:49.520]  white people are evil and deserve it in fact uh here in my stack i've got my uh lewis farrakhan
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:56.160]  article mclatchy news farrakhan chides obama rips gop and romney in debate
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:05.280]  and he goes on to say uh that there's the quote in here he goes on to say white people are afraid
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:11.280]  that the end of white america is coming no i'm afraid of total authoritarian takeover by obama
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:16.080]  mit romney the whole new world order those guys are just puppets but you see the different moves
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:23.920]  in the agenda and you've got the people that support obama who openly say if you've heard the
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:30.400]  teachers say you can't criticize obama or you'll be arrested uh you i've played newscast guys well
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:33.840]  you find it we haven't played in a few months but it's uh i forget the exact name of it it's uh
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:39.920]  get arrested if you criticize obama if you can't find it paul watson can it's on youtube uh was
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:46.400]  covered in the newspapers four years ago i want to play that the issue here is that
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:57.760]  they're pushing a move where culturally it's okay to call for violence and it's okay to do this
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:03.760]  so people do it so that then the system can crack down and take all our liberties that's the basis
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:12.720]  in the basics of what's happening here and it's just crazy i mean lewis furkan comes out and
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:17.680]  tells the truth of six months ago that what obama's done in libya is terrible it was terrible to put
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:22.160]  al-qaeda in charge there it was terrible to destabilize africa it was terrible to do all that
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:27.440]  but then because it is racially based he's got to come out and defend obama and say white people are
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:32.880]  scared of obama i mean i guess there are some ignorant white people out there that really think
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:38.240]  obama's bad because he's black but most people i know who are white would vote for a black person
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:50.240]  in a new york second if they thought for a minute that the person would be pro gun pro liberty pro
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:56.640]  freedom low taxes all of that and that's what's going on here the globalist piggyback socialism
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:40:03.040]  centralized big nanny state under that's liberal and and you're racist if you don't support obama
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:07.920]  care and you're racist i mean you've heard these these these statements where everything's racist
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:13.360]  now and it's nothing but a political weapon and i'm sick of it and by the way people don't listen
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:20.720]  to it anymore it doesn't work on people anymore people are tired of it especially most black
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:26.640]  people i personally know and and white people i know everybody's just sick and tired of it you
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:34.000]  watch msnbc it's all about racial division and you read these articles i mean again obama
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.760]  supporters threaten to kill romney if he wins election violent remarks continue to permeate
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.600]  twitter and then paul watson at the end gives all these examples of where people say mild
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:51.600]  things on twitter about obama and they get secret service visits i mean it's got people in here
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:59.360]  saying they'll put a newsy in the back of romney's throat uh and people are retweeting it if romney
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:04.400]  becomes president hell a lot of people going to try to assassinate him if romney gets elected
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:11.200]  somebody ought to assassinate him f romney i'm going to assassinate him i swear of romney
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:15.760]  most president i'm going to be the one to assassinate his bleep i'm telling you if romney
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:22.720]  gets elected somebody going to have to take an l and an a assassinate romney and ryan and and here's
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:26.560]  the deal these look like real twitter accounts some of them again with tens of thousands you know
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:31.520]  eight thousand five thousand tweets i'd love to see the secret service go and find out these
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:36.880]  are fake accounts and and track it back to the rnc but folks there's no way the rnc do something
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:43.120]  this stupid because they know it could be tracked these are real i mean there's thousands of them
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:46.800]  hundreds that i've looked at them just thousands more and i've looked at them they all look real
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:51.200]  you think trolls are dumb enough to create fake accounts and do this they know their ip
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:56.400]  address is going to get found they're going to get swat teamed only morons do this i've told
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:00.560]  people don't make threats against anybody on my website man they're going to come arrest you
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.640]  we've talked a lot about this so i'm like hey this is bad let's not have riots let's you know
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:12.400]  you know let's not go this direction i said when bush got reelected let's not have riots the
[1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:16.880]  government will use that as an excuse to crack down and you know i've been consistent about this
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:23.440]  being against rioting and civil unrest uh for political outcomes because it's the the power
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:27.840]  structure will use it to take liberties and it's just a shame the democratic party operatives
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:33.600]  are slandering and libeling and they're trying to defame us but i mean it's kind of like an

[1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:36.240]  our country and our world going in the attacks on basic freedoms like the second amendment
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:43.360]  the move towards collectivism in the nanny state and over the last decade and a half info wars dot
[1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:50.400]  com and my radio show and the films have become really part of the core resistance to tyranny
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:56.240]  worldwide it seems like yesterday but it was more than five years ago that i was sitting in my small
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:01.280]  office of about 3000 square feet and realized that we were already reaching millions of people a week
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:07.280]  and that we had a responsibility to expand our operations in the face of the globalist
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.480]  it was listeners five years ago that demanded we have a money bomb and expand our operations

[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:50.080]  we're going to be talking to uh dr glidden coming up always informative a lot of people
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:55.440]  requested him on the show uh let me just say this again think progress the soros group admits the
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:48:01.200]  tweets are there but implies that we're only you know that that's as many as we've got uh and that
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:07.040]  it's racist to link to the tweets because a black person can do no wrong uh don't tell idiomine that
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:14.880]  other people he killed uh i mean uh and it's uh another article out of oh where is that stupid
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:18.880]  website there's another one here where they say it just isn't true well i read it earlier you
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:26.320]  heard me read it where they just said it's absolutely uh not true uh that uh that any of this is
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:32.960]  going on i mean i'm just absolutely making the entire thing up it just doesn't exist you heard
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:37.040]  the one where it said that i'm just a complete fraud and i know i'm a fraud and all this garbage
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.640]  and there's people online will probably take me quoting them and then have me say it's my admission
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:46.800]  i mean that's what goes on out there but people know it's edited and fake these people discredit
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:52.240]  themselves so that's just some of the news uh that we have right there paul watson is fired back at

[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:25.680]  an interview this is so you can act like you talk to me like you're a journalist this is like going
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.720]  to the halloween costume store to buy a reindeer outfit you're not a reindeer and you're not a
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:36.560]  journalist that's what i told the guy he's that exact analogy of memory serves i mean you know
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:40.960]  you're not porky pig pal just as you dress up in the outfit you're not a journalist either
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:45.760]  just as you were a straw hat let's go ahead and go to a phone call here erin in colorado
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:52.720]  listing on 13 60 a.m k h n c erin thanks for holding her on the air yeah hey alex i just wanted
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:58.400]  to tell everyone that it's so obvious that it's race baiting it's religion baiting it's sexual
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:03.440]  preference baiting it's classic divide and conquer and it's so obvious what's going on
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:12.880]  obvious from whose perspective from those of us that are awake but i mean who is race baiting
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:20.240]  the obama people well the entire media just culture in general from the education system
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:26.080]  you know the colleges which as you've described are basically uh culture centers you know they
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:30.400]  teach you how to go out and get drunk they teach you how to go out and be promiscuous they teach
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:35.520]  you that you should be ashamed of your race or proud of your race or or it's just at this point
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:42.640]  in history it's so obvious that the people that are in charge of the media um and culture culture
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:49.040]  you know movies books media they are engaged in total divide and conquer with 23 percent of the
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:53.760]  public that even reads newspapers and that's propaganda as well to some extent depending
[1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:58.320]  on which article we're going to skip this network break because i need to take your calls we do this
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:02.160]  occasionally uh uh so we're going to continue here skipping the break right here because we're
[1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:06.640]  doing election coverage we'll be covering of course post uh dog and pony show debate tomorrow
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:10.960]  as well but but yeah i mean you've got all the documents where they said the democratic party
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:15.680]  said we want to kill black people uh they're strong they have their own communities they didn't
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:20.720]  integrate which i was you know would be for real integration they didn't integrate to empower these
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:24.720]  people they did it to wreck them and they did and now they're wrecking everybody they're taking down
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:30.400]  all societies all institutions that they don't control and i've got all the Margaret Sanger
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:34.880]  quotes they're known i mean they said we're going to destroy black people than everybody else and
[1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:40.160]  then i have to be lectured by the very democratic party operatives that are a bunch of sickening
[1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:45.440]  racist scum because i don't want black people to riot and get discredited and burn down their
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:51.520]  neighborhoods and you've got all this being encouraged on channels you know quote liberal
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:56.080]  media channels you can see it where they're hyping all this and you see more and more racial attacks
[1:52:56.080 --> 1:53:03.520]  on whites it's disgusting and uh it's horrible and it's encouraging white racism and i don't like it
[1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:07.600]  i don't like it i know divide and conquerors what the globalists want we've got to come together for
[1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:12.000]  liberty but instead you're right they want to dumb it down to coke versus pepsi ford chevy
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:17.760]  redskins cowboys black white on and on and on and on and on and on and then our nationalism is bad
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:22.960]  but mexico's nationalism is good it's all about destroying this country uh do you think of obama
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:27.200]  doesn't win there could be some civil unrest i mean there's civil unrest there's riots every

[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:52.400]  situation about three years ago where i was on a website it's kind of a hobby website and we were
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:59.840]  discussing some of the political views and i made mention of george sorris and obama being tied
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:07.840]  together and somebody made an offhand comment referring to what happened to jay k and next thing
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:14.560]  i know you know the secret service on my house asking to be an interview no i mean that's my
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:19.760]  thing i've been visited and and called it's actually more than three times i forget all the
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:25.360]  times and i'm like wow these people get to do it and if one of my listeners makes a mild comment
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:29.840]  about somebody ought to do something about obama close quote boom i mean they're here
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:35.040]  they're here bugging their eyes out at me and i'm just like come on man and and either like oh
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:39.680]  it's no big deal to have thousands of people threatening to kill romney on twitter alex you
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:47.760]  racist uh i mean i'm just sick of it i'm sick of their double standards man well what does the thing
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:52.400]  of it was when i went to the interview i was just you know wasn't scared or anything and i just went
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:57.600]  in there and just sat down calmly tried to tell them look this is just a group of people who are
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:04:04.000]  frustrated by what we see is going on and we're just sitting around like guys after work having
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:10.480]  to fear just you know being in frustration you know nobody's going out and acting on anything
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:16.240]  we're just you know shooting breeze i would advise you now i've never to go in i mean you know if
[2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:20.800]  they want to show up that's one issue because they won't leave you alone if you don't tell them but
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:24.640]  you know you're not playing anything but if it's some mild statement go it's politically protected
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:29.040]  i don't have a criminal record no i don't plan anything we're done talking but the problem is
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:33.200]  now they'll go have a psychological commitment and say well we're going to grab you and make
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:38.240]  sure you're not crazy but again they do this to people that don't even call for violence and we
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:45.440]  cover it and and say that's wrong but then when people actually call for violence we're supposed
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:52.960]  to support that well i mean i'm not every time nightline msnbc rollingstone new york magazine

[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:15.280]  we were in the last second we had to go to break uh you were saying mild stuff on a hobby website

[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:24.160]  guy bad cop screaming at you but see that's because somebody said something about obama
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:29.200]  see your problem was you should have said it about the election process or romney and then
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:33.360]  you would have been okay bud see because they can't ever admit this is going on you understand
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:38.800]  it's all political intimidation they're arresting talk showhouse we've done shows we listen to them
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:44.400]  for saying obama is a criminal and going to bring the country down they come and grab them
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:50.320]  with for psychiatric reasons and drag them away so so this is their truth squads did you hear me play
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:55.200]  prosecutors saying we'll arrest you if you talk bad about the president from mainstream television
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:13:00.880]  did you hear that last hour yeah i did i mean these are authoritarians here i'm not even supposed
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:04.240]  to point out that they're saying they want to burn stuff down if we don't go along with it
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.880]  they did a threaten to arrest me at the time when i came in beaten before we started the interview
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:15.920]  the whole thing was as they kept going in out of the room and i think they were trying to
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:20.800]  sweat me out and and they you know the one guy kept jumping up in my face and going
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:25.760]  every time i said something was here's the only question people ask was what does this mean
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:30.560]  what does this mean and i'm sitting here looking at the other guy going is this guy stupid a lot
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:35.840]  you know i'm i'm plainly explaining in several terms what was the statement
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:44.400]  oh i the statement okay i'm putting quotations um i basically said when uh george sorris and
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:55.040]  obama were together at the uh european uh thing uh a couple years back i said if someone were to
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:03.040]  if something were to happen to them uh half about half the world's problems would be solved
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:08.960]  yeah i mean that's purely politically protected a flippant sarcastic comment about the world be a
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:15.680]  better place sure yeah totally protected versus people saying quote i'm going to stick a newsy
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:21.040]  in mit romney's mouth and blow his head off i'm gonna i they're saying i'm going to assassinate them
[2:14:21.040 --> 2:14:25.760]  close quote and you watch the secret service will probably come and said i said i'm going after
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:29.360]  romney they they know the public's dumbed down they'll probably say i said it i mean you know
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:34.400]  this is how they operate i mean they just count on the public not paying attention it's a drive-by
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:38.800]  media or it's just splashed up there hoping you don't pay attention real fast we've got to go to
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:44.800]  their callers how did this end well it ended basically with them just taking pictures of me and
[2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:50.400]  and and that was yet you know i was released but they didn't you know they just interviewed asked
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:54.320]  much questions how many guns did i own and all this other stuff well you're lucky they didn't
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:59.120]  grab you and say reminally ill i appreciate your call again that's what i'm saying they've got
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:05.280]  newscasts going i just played it was that an mbc affiliate saying you'll be arrested if you talk
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:11.760]  about obama i just played that and i know talk shows we've had them on who've been grabbed under
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:17.200]  psychiatric evaluation for saying the president's criminal they want to intimidate free speech period
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:24.480]  and i'm not going to put up with it uh let's go to uh matt in arkansas listening on 8 80 a m k l r g
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:29.200]  uh the john and then a 50 000 want blow torch i know i get calls from states all over the place
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:36.240]  from that one uh matt welcome the airwaves thanks guys i appreciate you taking my call i uh i told
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:42.240]  that you know i'm just now woke up probably within the last six months and there's a show on the same
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:47.920]  station that you're on on k l r g that's that's basically just like you and those guys they follow
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:54.320]  you the name of their shows we the people radio and and that they they woke me up to you and it
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:58.560]  appointed me basically to you to to figure out what's going on i want to thank you for waking me up
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:03.360]  and i want to thank them too but i want to tell you you're hitting the nail right on the head with
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:09.680]  this and it's sad that it has to be brought into a divide and conquer type uh instant to show us that
[2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:15.120]  how how difficult this thing is why come we can't just have fair elections and let the people take
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:19.680]  care of things but instead we want to get the media wants to get involved and throw their
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:23.680]  weight around because we know that the the corporations in the media are the ones controlling
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:32.080]  everything when you watch msnbc they race monger that's all they do it's like 90 of it is to create
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:38.160]  racial division in the name of stopping racial division and i'm just sick of it i mean i i did
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:44.480]  not grow up and have not lived my life obsessed with race and i'm just tired of it and they are
[2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:48.880]  pushing it but but what about the double standard though that if you say something mild about obama
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:56.720]  they come arrest you now uh but you can say kill mit romney these guys i'll tell you about there's
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:17:01.840]  another guy on the radio station with him that's a big hardcore rush limbaugh type republican and
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:06.800]  these guys have went after him about his stance is about saying that mit romney's not going to be
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:12.080]  different than barack obama and he's totally shut them off he he he tacked him with straw men
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:18.160]  arguments and that's what's wrong with america's we can't have legitimate sit down and debate with
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:24.640]  people because it's all about our team has to win well exactly exactly exactly great points i
[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:29.760]  appreciate your call uh yeah but again i don't even want to get into a rush limbaugh bashing fest
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:34.240]  you know here's the deal with rush limbaugh he's the biggest talk show host in the world he has
[2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:39.520]  the biggest audience not just in the u.s if you're able to shut him down which they're trying everybody
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:44.080]  else will fall in line that's the issue why the white house is always going after him and yeah
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:51.520]  what do you expect in the team mindset everybody knows mit romney's anti-gun pro-abortion globalist
[2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:57.600]  you know all this stuff but they think he's better than obama so it's like all right let's just shut
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:03.520]  up about that and i think it's wrong that mainline republicans attack constitutionalist and libertarians
[2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:10.480]  when we don't like mit romney uh i mean i even one of ron paul's you know campaign heads i wrote an
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:15.120]  article saying you know don't criticize the belterberg group when i was at belterberg and
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:21.600]  they're just mad not ron paul he's good they're just mad the little political guys that they're
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:25.920]  not getting all the attention a lot of this is just political jealousy you've kind of got like the
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:33.360]  old guard rush limbaugh and shan hannity and all them over there and and and you know people are just
[2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:38.800]  you know they want to really get america back not have republicans talk about it all day so
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:43.040]  there's a major shift and people are waking up those that actually know how to get informed
[2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:47.840]  the problem is a vast group of people are totally dumbed down uh let's talk to william in vegas
[2:18:47.840 --> 2:18:54.800]  he's watching on prisonplanet.tv william you're on the air go ahead hello alex jim can you hear me
[2:18:54.800 --> 2:18:59.440]  yes sir what do you think about all this uh well what i wanted to tell you is extremely
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:06.400]  important i'm actively duty military in virginia um and the fix is in if you can look up army
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:15.840]  regulation 525-27 chapter 2 section 3 this is the army um emergency response program
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:21.600]  and in chapter 2 section 3 it talks about incident management's response okay this
[2:19:21.600 --> 2:19:27.680]  regulation reorganizes everything from the joint chief staff down and place them under the control
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.960]  of fema which falls under dhs no no i knew that and and actually it's in that group of regulations
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:38.160]  that it gets into the have you seen the army manual for military police on reeducation camps
[2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:46.400]  roger and i shouldn't have said vegas i saw you you're in virginia uh so are you a military police
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:50.880]  negative well i mean what are the other guys you're around think of this
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:55.840]  there's there's a lot of people that are awake and are afraid to talk
[2:19:55.840 --> 2:20:01.200]  but what this regulation really does is that it fixes and it completely merges
[2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:07.760]  any resource that the army can bring to bear with local resources of the cities around it
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:14.320]  and i'm talking about everything mr jones everything personnel reconnaissance assets
[2:20:14.320 --> 2:20:21.040]  military police everything no it's a federal they are they are ready it's a total it's a total

[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:16.000]  of the calls that are holding uh on the whole health crisis issue but you've probably just
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.400]  heard that gentleman call in who was spot on but i'd like to get him on incognito
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:27.120]  for his analysis of it it was issued in 2008 we have it on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:37.840]  army regulation 525-27 uh and if you go there just type in army reg 525-27 it's got all the
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:43.200]  forced inoculation roundup news and then it ties into other regs that if you look up well then you
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:50.720]  learn about stuff like reeducation camps this is the 1.6 billion bullets uh as it's the roundup
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:54.880]  plan and the total federalization is already in place this has already been in place secretly
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:26:00.640]  and illegally for a while but now they're saying it's legal uh and it's got the uh emergency powers
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:06.480]  act in there it's it's i got it all right there the just the and it puts the military under uh
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:13.280]  homeland security and actually in this they always hire a group of thugs to command the older
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:19.520]  military and police because that always goes back to some spree decor and a code hitler did it the
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:25.840]  brown shirts the soviets did it and the tsa will command these people because that's why you can
[2:26:25.840 --> 2:26:29.920]  go get a tsa course now and then it says you're allowed to stick your hands down people's pants
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:36.240]  anywhere uh you know in in a security situation so it's like they're the magic wand you wave and
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:40.240]  there's no bill of rights or constitution anymore okay i'm going to shut up about that but uh we'll
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:46.480]  be covering uh covering that uh army document more now this is a short segment long segment
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:52.400]  coming up i want to move fast with him because flu season's here uh and he sent me a whole bunch
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:58.000]  of documents he wants to go over uh here on the show today dr peter glidden a gcn radio host
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:03.760]  in his own right he also advises and works with us at info wars health uh dot com all the videos
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:09.040]  and information that's at info wars health dot com uh i want to get into drugging all kids now they
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:13.040]  say is good you're not living in the twilight zone this is really happening but i've mentioned this
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:16.880]  three times and i mentioned it one more time and then get glidden's take on this and then move on
[2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:21.680]  to other issues i've seen every day a whole bunch two or three four five articles saying
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:25.840]  there are no side effects from the flu it's a conspiracy theory to say that there are from
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.800]  from flu vaccines or any other vaccine and here is the news journal one i like to use the way the
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:35.520]  last week uh take your medicine getting a flu shot as part of being a good neighbor i thought if
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:40.720]  you've taken it you're protected why do i have to take it and it says there is absolutely no harm
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:44.880]  from getting a flu vaccine in fact we can show people a document cam shot i'll actually uh
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:53.280]  show them this article right here uh there is absolutely no harm uh from getting a vaccination
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:28:00.480]  don't let yourself be fooled hold it up don't let yourself be fooled with wild rumors and once
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:08.000]  he's talking we can show it then uh here is the cdc reaction sheet 20 pages and then it links to
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:13.120]  things in some cases that are hundreds of pages long this is just a summary right here again i'll
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:18.400]  put it right here absolutely that's great i think show people out there uh and if you're
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:22.960]  watching on prismplanet.tv if not just go to the cdc site and type in possible side effects from
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:28.320]  vaccines it's got everything from headaches, abdominal pain, bleeding, diarrhea, death,
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:38.560]  allergic reactions, autoimmune disorders, comas, non-stop fever, seizures, coma, lowered consciousness
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:44.960]  and there it is seizures, coma i mean i just go on and on and i'm it just just goes on and on i mean
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:53.440]  go read it Gardasil uh you know fainting uh convulsions people been dying from it i mean go read it
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:29:01.200]  but they just said dr glidden that that this doesn't exist that that were conspiracy monitors
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:05.680]  what do you say to that i say that they're liars and that they should be thrown in jail for
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:11.920]  endangering public health because the facts of the matter are clear there have been over five
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:19.520]  billion dollars in money paid out in legal sediments for negative reactions to the flu vaccine just the
[2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:26.480]  flu vaccine i'm not talking about hepatitis or any other type of vaccine just the flu vaccine
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:32.160]  because it caused something called guian var a syndrome which is paralysis and they proved that
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:38.400]  it was related to the influenza vaccine and awarded over five billion dollars in damages
[2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:47.760]  furthermore check this out this is a direct quote from dr j anthony morris who formerly the chief
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:54.560]  vaccine control officer at the fda this was the guy that was in charge of the vaccination department
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:30:02.320]  at the fda and here is a direct quote i quote there is no evidence that any influenza vaccine
[2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:09.440]  thus far developed is effective in preventing or negating any attack of influenza the producers of
[2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:17.520]  these vaccines know that they are worthless but they go on selling them anyway end quote it is a
[2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:24.400]  gigantic scam of biblical proportions big pharma is in bed with the vaccine makers and you shouldn't
[2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:30.640]  trust them well said when come back i'm going to give you the floor because you sent me a lot of
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:34.320]  documents i'm going to be showing document cam shots of this but also quoting where people can get
[2:30:34.320 --> 2:30:38.880]  of their radio listener but folks this is a life and death situation you know you've heard the news
[2:30:38.880 --> 2:30:44.400]  say there's no side effects period work conspiracy theorist go read the cdc website it says it'll

[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:33.200]  dr glidden holding while i've been ranting get into the flu shot the history of it and where
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:37.680]  this is going because as you know the reason i said yes i said we proud to get dr glidden on
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:43.760]  tomorrow and thanks for coming on short notice they're lying in colorada and in rhoda island
[2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:50.000]  saying it's the law first responders anybody at a hospital that works there or comes there cops has
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:56.560]  to take a uh flu shot and they're lying saying it's the law to take it to go to school so the fraud
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:01.040]  is intensifying even as all the news came out as you know well let me just go over what's going on
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:05.360]  you've got the floor for the balance of the transmission dr glidden thanks so much alex well
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:10.400]  look here's the deal you know drugs are like guns there's nothing wrong with drugs per se those like
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:15.280]  guns is another wrong with a gun it's how it's used well it's the same with prescription medication
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:22.640]  it's the same with vaccinations if they worked no problem but guess what they don't work numerous
[2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:28.560]  studies have shown that with the influenza vaccine at best there is a nine percent effectiveness
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:35.760]  nine percent that's a very small number the only reason that the flu shot is advocated because the
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:42.160]  pharmaceutical companies are in bed with the government the government gives them sweetheart
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:48.560]  deals gives them millions of dollars a year to manufacture the influenza vaccine it's a sweetheart
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:53.840]  deal they get all of your money all of your tax money the government gives it to them they make
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:39:00.160]  the influenza vaccine now they got to sell it they've got it they've got to move it so they give you
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:06.080]  misinformation misinformation misdirection smoke and mirrors oh it's really good oh it does all of
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:12.960]  this well guess what it does not and just a little bit of investigation on your part will show you
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:18.400]  this is you know i sent alex a bunch of stuff you should have them posted up even just do a google
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:26.000]  search for influenza ineffectiveness the flu shot doesn't work it's a bad idea and you know if it
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:31.760]  didn't cause neurological damage if it didn't cause severe respiratory distress if it didn't
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:37.440]  cause stevens johnson's syndrome if it didn't cause a whole host of net negative reactions
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:47.120]  you know no harm no foul but it does it is a juvenile old-fashioned outdated ineffective
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:54.000]  method for helping you protect yourself against the influenza virus and really it is a fool's
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:02.560]  errand to get yourself vaccinated for the flu what do you make of the lie of 36 000 dying a year
[2:40:02.560 --> 2:40:08.400]  when every doctor i talked to says it's about 1100 and those are infirm people well this is the
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:13.360]  whole thing i mean you can cook the books if you're a good statistician you can cook the books in
[2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:19.200]  any way that you want if you're smart enough in order to make what you're presenting look like
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:25.280]  it's positive and effective but when you drill down the data when you take a hard and fast
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:31.360]  objective look at the research and you actually read it line by line page by page and you have
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:41.600]  a scientific uh uh uh a method of looking at it the facts are a stubborn thing the flu shot
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:48.640]  does not work and you know now it's all about okay but i mean about everybody i know but
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:52.160]  and to make your point i was just thinking my uncle got a tetanus shot and he was little in
[2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:56.080]  her almost killed him everyone i know says i don't think the flu shot i took it and almost
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:41:00.080]  killed me i think that's what's hurting vaccines more than anything people know they take them
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:04.400]  they get real sick that i mean people know in the trials a guard is still it killed a bunch of people
[2:41:05.280 --> 2:41:09.440]  well but this is this is why they do direct to consumer advertising because in the general
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:14.880]  population there's only a small percentage of info wars listeners there's only a small percentage
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:20.320]  of people that go to prismplanet.com there's only a small number of us who have woken up and who
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:26.880]  understand this the vast majority of americans have been dumbed down by decades of malnutrition
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:32.560]  decades of crapping the food crapping the air crapping the water and fluoride in order to make
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:39.200]  our IQs lower so the average american citizen is going to believe whatever they read and the media
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:46.160]  and the pharmaceutical companies are all in bed together so look folks wake up facts are a stubborn
[2:41:46.160 --> 2:41:51.520]  thing knowledge is power you don't know what you don't know and when it comes to health and healing
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:58.800]  the stuff you don't know you don't know will kill you or heal you do not but but just recently
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:04.560]  they admitted that the number three cause of death in the country was just infections in hospitals
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:09.360]  but if you had drug interactions doctor mistakes and infections we had john rapaport investigative
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:15.040]  journalist on it is the number one cause of death hands down i know you've broken those numbers down
[2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:22.400]  conservatively how many people does the medical system kill each year 780 000 780 000 people a
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:27.360]  year are killed from the medical system the second leading cause of death heart disease 680 000
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:33.120]  third leading cause of death cancer 550 000 which means the medical profession is more dangerous
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:38.400]  than cancer for goodness sake snap out of it that's why young jeffrey is going to change the world
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:43.680]  that's why young jeffrey is going to change the world and we'll break that down there's ways to
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:47.680]  fight this with the proper vitamins minerals and trace elements we break it down at info wars health
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:52.640]  dot com and you break it down on your radio show doc let's expand on this though and move through
[2:42:52.640 --> 2:42:56.400]  some of the other things i wanted to get you on about the meningitis outbreak they're actually
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:02.000]  saying because of fungal meningitis in a big pharma company they now want us all to take more
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:07.760]  meningitis shots to go to college or have a job when meningitis shots from my research
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:14.080]  whether it's viral bacterial or fungal vaccines are some of the most dangerous on record vaccines
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:19.920]  yeah that's correct and this latest outbreak of meningitis that's happening now right was caused
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:27.200]  by bad drugs tainted drugs people were getting steroid shots steroid for joint pain are you
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:32.000]  kidding me you know how old-fashioned that is you know how many my patients have needed a steroid
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:39.200]  shot for joint pain zero zero so you give a steroid you inject an anti-inflammatory into
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:44.400]  a bad joint and if it's made from a compounding pharmacy or a pharmaceutical plant that has you
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:51.440]  know improper quality control standards now the drug itself gives you meningitis 14 people have
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:58.880]  died 14 people have died 214 people have become infected i think it's 16 now it's crazy and you
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:03.920]  know that nobody's asking the question number one why did they even need that shot in the first place
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:08.960]  well if they were my patient they wouldn't have needed that shot because you don't get
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:15.280]  joint inflammation and musculoskeletal pain because you have a steroid deficiency but this
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:19.920]  is how far down the rabbit hole we've gone in our i'm sure to be clear and i've worked for large
[2:44:19.920 --> 2:44:24.880]  animal vets they'll tell you you give something steroids long enough it rots everything and then
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:29.680]  and then degenerates the whole body but again they're trying to mask a problem that's already there
[2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:33.840]  instead of go after the problem just like they're always saying let's find the cure to breast cancer
[2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:38.560]  not find out why it's exploded several thousand percent and the u.s leads the world in it what's
[2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:43.040]  happening with breast cancer what's happening with all with the facts that everything's exploding
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:49.120]  well the reason let's check this out all right we have given 600 billion dollars of research money
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:55.200]  600 billion that's almost a trillion dollars of research money to the medical profession that

[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:36.480]  occurrence of breast cancer by 82 percent 82 percent and by the way you said that on here a few
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:40.880]  months ago and i didn't even know that i went and looked it up and there was mainline medical journals
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:46.560]  they know all this it's incredible yeah and how many women got that phone call from their mds

[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.880]  i live out in the country and that's all that's out there so if i'm not going all the way into
[2:46:14.880 --> 2:46:19.360]  town the grocery store i've got to go to the local cvs and i'm in there while they're shooting up
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:23.680]  little kids and stuff and i i i've gotten the point where i have to say something and then the
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:27.920]  manager gets real mad and i'm like hey guys those vaccines don't protect you you know look at the
[2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:32.960]  studies look at the connections the neurological disorders yon beret and and but they think it's
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:38.400]  like a sacrament in that and they smile and they give them the shot it's like you're good you trust
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:42.880]  the system you're doing something good for your kid and and we know they're hurting them we know
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:48.640]  it's all a fraud but it just came out that one of the big medical uh companies in california
[2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:53.280]  knew the mmr shot was giving people mmr on purpose and that was their business plan i mean
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:57.680]  these people are just sickeningly evil and there's all these useful idiots that think it's cute to
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:02.480]  trust a government and corporations that have been caught doing all the secret testing on us
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:08.640]  and check this out right that's the stuff that we already know about what they put in the vaccines
[2:47:08.640 --> 2:47:13.520]  and we already know that by and large they're ineffective and by and large they're dangerous
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:19.200]  and by and large they hurt us but what about all the stuff that we have no idea at all about what
[2:47:19.200 --> 2:47:24.720]  they're putting in the vaccines what about that stuff if you trust the pharmaceutical companies
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:30.080]  to protect your health you you got your head in the sand ladies and gentlemen it's time you snapped
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:38.480]  out of it woke up and got a clue now let's break down because yes uh it's the big solution uh they
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:43.920]  know that our bodies need the building blocks i'm sure you heard about now not just one case there's
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:49.360]  more children bringing in the new kombucha up until a few years ago it tasted great uh from
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:54.800]  india my kids drank it and it was something like a quarter percent alcohol you know quarter of one
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:48:00.160]  percent which i mean wouldn't get a you know a fish drunk if you put it in it uh and uh you know
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:05.040]  so many foods have more but you know more alcohol than that fermentation now they've made them change
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.920]  it so it doesn't taste as good there's almost no alcohol it's something like i forget i mean it's
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:14.080]  it's so incontestable it's it's microscopic i was reading on some last night my kids bring
[2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:18.560]  it in it didn't even say any percent of alcohol now that they've swat deemed them and stuff at
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:23.840]  the grocery stores but they're now arresting uh you know and threatening to arrest people with
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:30.400]  kombucha uh you know so a fermented tea drink or whatever that's you know probiotic and so good
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:35.600]  but then meanwhile uh there the i'm sure you saw in the new york times they're saying let's just put
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:41.120]  all kids on drugs not just kids with ADHD what do you say to that well you know this is how far down
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:47.600]  the rabbit hole we have gone in this country in our abject genuflection at the altar of the myth
[2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:55.840]  of big pharma right we are we have been completely brainwashed and now listen i think i don't have
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:01.520]  any evidence to support this but there has to be a thought control machine somewhere because we
[2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:10.320]  this stuff doesn't work drugs the the the the people that we go to for medical care as it turns
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:15.040]  out are the leading cause of death in the united states and they have consistently failed to help
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:20.240]  us with our health while we've let the pharmaceutical companies run our health alzheimer says risen
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:25.840]  from obscurity to the sixth leading cause of death autism has jumped from one out of ten

[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:42.880]  year why is this because you can't fix a nutrient deficiency disease with a drug you can't do it and
[2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:48.240]  they know that so they've taken the real minerals trace elements out of the foods show that we're
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:52.000]  sick so we have to go to them and the average doctor is just a cult member they have one of the

[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:47.600]  this research unequivocally proved that all chronic diseases are caused by nutrient deficiencies
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:53.040]  you got a chronic disease you don't have a bad gene you haven't been cursed by god it's not because

[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:34.000]  and and ethnic lines what's going on with these doctors well the problem is that the the md's
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:40.480]  bless their hearts are only trained in the application of pharmaceuticals and surgery md's have no
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:45.040]  training in medical nutrition at all they have very few of them because they're not trained and
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:50.480]  have any respect or appreciation for it so you know the md's have thrown the baby out with the
[3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:55.600]  bathwater they're good at trauma they're good at surgery when surgery is necessary they're excellent
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:00.720]  at that but for everything that people go to the doctor for high blood pressure and arthritis and
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:08.000]  fibromyalgia and obesity and asthma etc etc they've got nothing for it because all that they're
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:14.080]  trained in is how to manage symptoms with drugs they don't know anything about medical nutrition
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:21.440]  and as it turns out the majority of chronic diseases are caused by they're caused by not
