[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's Monday, July 11, 2020, and the enemies of freedom have still not taken the Cold War off the air thanks to you.
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.000]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:38.000 --> 00:51.000]  The year and a half ago, Sri Lanka put the exact same UN global government rules on carbon over cattle, over nitrogen, over farming that we now see being put in place in Europe.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  And the giant protests erupting in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and other countries.
[00:56.000 --> 01:05.000]  The shutdown of their way of life, the literal starvation, and an open plan to force farmers to sell their property to mega ag corporations.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  This is a criminal takeover. Welcome to the great reset.
[01:10.000 --> 01:18.000]  Now, the globalists have bent off more than they can chew. They push too hard, and the whole world's waking up to them right now.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  So you'd ask, why don't they back off the shutdown and collapse of society?
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  Because they've already triggered it, and they think they're going to ride this tiger.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  But all over Latin America, all over Asia, all over the Pacific, all over Europe, all over Eastern Europe,
[01:34.000 --> 01:46.000]  there are massive riots and government building takeovers by individuals saying death to the New World Order, down with Bill Gates, down with Klaus Schwab.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  They're saying it in Sri Lanka. They're saying it in the Dutch countryside.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  They're saying it in Texas. They're saying it in Chile and Venezuela.
[01:57.000 --> 02:12.000]  They're saying it all over the world in Brazil, leading the charge with the best leader to come out at a national level and fight for freedom in the last 50 years, Bolsonaro.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  They meant to carry all this out and blame our national leaders as puppets.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  But enough leaders got in, like Orban and others, to expose it.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  We have enough talk show hosts reaching big enough audiences to get the truth out.
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.000]  Like this broadcast, the blast point, the detonation point, patient zero of liberty, the epicenter, this audience, activists, you did it.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  Once you know the important work you've done, so you'll keep fighting harder, because we're winning.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  Tucker Carlson's of the world, hammering the great reset in the New World Order.
[02:46.000 --> 02:57.000]  Joe Rogan hammering it almost every podcast. It's happening as good old Ron Paul used to like to say, it's happening.
[02:57.000 --> 03:07.000]  But if it wasn't for all the countless patriots in the last 60, 70 years, particularly in the UK and the US, exposing this coming New World Order,
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  we'd be caught completely flat footed, but we are not, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  This is quite a moment. We obviously have all of this big news here for you today.
[03:19.000 --> 03:27.000]  And then the media, for about six hours, tried to deny what they denied back in the presidential election two years ago,
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  when Hunter's laptop was left at the repair shop, and he wouldn't come pick it up.
[03:35.000 --> 03:45.000]  So the owner opened it up and saw all the child porn and illegal stuff, the sex trafficking and the drug use,
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  and all the rest of the bizarreness and illegal activity.
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  And the information went public, and the corporate media and big tech censored members of Congress.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  They censored the president. They censored everyone, including Info Wars trying to expose it.
[04:02.000 --> 04:14.000]  Well, this time, for Chan, someone was able to hack in to Hunter Biden's iCloud and was able to then release the entire phone.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  At first, the media, the controlled lap dogs, tried to deny it was real.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  But no one bought that this time, showing how their power has waned massively.
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  And I can tell you, starting last night this morning, I looked at quite a bit of it, and we're showing you the PG stuff in comparison.
[04:30.000 --> 04:40.000]  He likes to pose with his niece and others naked, sitting on the edge of a bed as the trophy of the children he has sex with.
[04:40.000 --> 04:49.000]  He also has his father in the email sending him porn, and we now know Biden, the puppet president, his handle.
[04:49.000 --> 04:56.000]  We now know his pseudonym, and then we know the nickname his son has for him as well.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  We'll tell you that when we come back.
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at
[05:36.000 --> 06:03.000]  www.InFoWarsStore.com
[06:03.000 --> 06:11.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:11.000 --> 06:34.000]  That's the nickname that is used by Hunter Biden's niece for him, and it looks like his father.
[06:34.000 --> 06:44.000]  A lot of it is illegal sex trafficking and obviously him in bed with children that look like they're 10 years old as trophies.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  We cannot show you, and we will not show you, the pedophilic material on air.
[06:50.000 --> 06:58.000]  And quite frankly, after I looked at some of it, I just stopped looking at it last night because never in my life have I looked at things like this.
[06:58.000 --> 07:07.000]  And as a journalist, I'm a pundit, an analyst, but I also am a journalist, and I just can't look at it.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  I will not look at it.
[07:09.000 --> 07:21.000]  There's things you can never get out of your head, and it's just very frightening to know that these are the fully compromised blackmailed individuals
[07:21.000 --> 07:31.000]  by a plethora of different mafia organizations and governments around the world.
[07:31.000 --> 07:45.000]  But the screen handle, Pito Peter, Hunter's iPad, Hunter's iPhone, it's unbelievable.
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  And it's also him ordering hookers and clearly underage girls that look like they're about 13 years old.
[07:51.000 --> 08:02.000]  It's him quasi naked in trophy photos with his niece and with other girls that are clearly underage.
[08:02.000 --> 08:14.000]  And there's stuff a lot worse than that, but you know, you can't help but feel really grungy when you look at dozens of videos of him masturbating.
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  I mean, you're not ever supposed to look at this stuff.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[08:21.000 --> 08:29.000]  And the things we are showing are PG in comparison to what's going on.
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  But more importantly than even the pedophilia and the sex trafficking and the incredible crack cocaine and other drug benches,
[08:38.000 --> 08:47.000]  is him and his father talking about paper play and how Hunter's going to meet with this group and get the money and then pay his dad
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  and pay Joe Biden's brother and the rest of the family using the drug addict Hunter as the bag man.
[08:56.000 --> 09:15.000]  And then there are the dozens and I mean dozens of phone numbers of prominent high level just department officials and FBI agents groveling and just kissing his pervert butt to go after his political enemies going back years.
[09:15.000 --> 09:27.000]  So if you want to get a real fly on the wall view and adjust how corrupt the Justice Department is and how they're a bunch of sex trafficking pedophile enabling garbage at the top.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  This is it.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  There's no way the system will survive any of this.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  And by the way, the great reset globalists set it up this way.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  They helped to bring down our whole government civil war while they don't get the blame.
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  No, they're going to get the blame because they're the ones that control these minions.
[09:44.000 --> 09:54.000]  Yeah, if you've got a mafia captain that's out committing crimes, I want to see them arrested, indicted, imprisoned.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  But we want to get the dons.
[09:56.000 --> 10:07.000]  We want to get the crime bosses and the crime bosses are the Bill Gates and the Prince Charles's of the world.
[10:07.000 --> 10:16.000]  The Ted Turner's and the Rothschild's and the Rockefellers and the Henry Kissinger's of the world.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  And you're not in their club unless you're a rapist or a pedophile or mass murderer or all three.
[10:22.000 --> 10:31.000]  Look at Harvey Weinstein getting women supplied to him and supplying women to Hillary and Oprah Winfrey.
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  And it's come out on both women that they've seen more tail than a toilet seat or a bicycle seat.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  But the issue is these are underage girls and women forced in to do this for their jobs in Hollywood and in D.C.
[10:46.000 --> 10:57.000]  Hillary out of college with her law degree, first job she took was working for the mafia in Little Rock and Hot Springs, Arkansas.
[10:57.000 --> 11:15.000]  Yeah, the headquarters of the major mafia organizations in the country until the 80s was not Las Vegas, was not New York City, was not Los Angeles, was not Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  It was and still to a certain extent is Little Rock and Hot Springs.
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  Anybody that lives in Arkansas knows that it's well known they have mafia museums there and that's where Al Capone lived most of the year.
[11:29.000 --> 11:38.000]  I mean, that's where the Chicago mafia headquarters was since the 30s in prohibition.
[11:38.000 --> 11:45.000]  That's where they made the majority of the liquor that wasn't shipped in from Canada.
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  And so she was sent there by her father who was number two in the daily machine in the Chicago mob.
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  She was sent down there to represent the mafia.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  And her first big cases were the rape and torture of women and little girls in the brothels and these rich mobsters.
[12:07.000 --> 12:18.000]  They also had the Hicks working for them, so there's a big Dixie mafia there, would just grab a ten-year-old girl off a bicycle, take her and rape her for two days.
[12:18.000 --> 12:31.000]  I've interviewed some of those women in studio with their shattered faces and they can never have children again because after they raped one 11-year-old for two days at a shack at a farm drunk playing poker,
[12:31.000 --> 12:39.000]  they took a broom handle and shoved it all the way up in or ripping out her uterus and had to be removed.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  These are horrible people. Hillary Clinton made jokes about that on tape and made sure the person that did that, the little girl, walked.
[12:47.000 --> 12:56.000]  Men that take broomsticks and ram them two feet inside somebody's guts is who these people are.
[12:56.000 --> 13:05.000]  They hate you and your family. They hate America. They hate free speech. They hate God. They hate our children.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  And you see the evidence of what they do once they're in charge.
[13:09.000 --> 13:18.000]  So that's who they are, a collection of devil-worshipping, drug addict pedophiles.
[13:18.000 --> 13:32.000]  And now they're cutting our resources off. They've erased our border. They've devalued our currency and they're starting World War III and they're just beginning their plan.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.000]  So now nobody's denying that it's Hunter Biden. Of course, it's Hunter Biden in all these videos.
[13:38.000 --> 13:48.000]  And now even more information is coming out. And the FBI is in scramble mode to protect this pedophile and his pedophile father.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  Because Biden's the placeholder and the fall guy for their new world order.
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  I need to keep him in there a while longer so they don't get the blame so the great reset can move forward.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  And of course, evidence of that, I told you this was coming.
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  My mom's a really smart person. And when Biden was installed a year and a half ago, she said, mark my words.
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  And I've said this many times. I told you this. And every time I see her, she says this, she goes, mark my words.
[14:16.000 --> 14:25.000]  They're planning to kill Biden as a false flag. The only way to get rid of him and then make all the crimes he committed not seem as bad in a way to change the subject.
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  And they'll claim it's some right-wing gun owner that does it.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And I agree with my mother. It's a regular lot of my smarts, you could say.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  But I think it's pretty much a common sense thing the way they're building this up that they're going to kill Biden.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  I really think they're going to kill him. I'm not predicting it's going to happen.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  I'm saying there's a very good chance they'll kill him before the midterms.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  I'm predicting the deep state will assassinate Biden in a false flag.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  I give it a 90% probability in the next 120 days.
[15:00.000 --> 15:08.000]  They might wait and do it later in the main election, but they're definitely positioning all this.
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.000]  They could have an October surprise of assassinating Trump before the election to cause a civil war, or they could arrest Trump as well.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  We know they've got that in the hopper, though that may be a little too far for even them.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  But you see the poll numbers, and we'll come out and cover it now. The New York Times has basically called for the removal of Biden.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  And so the bell has told, ladies and gentlemen, it's a big broadcast lined up for you here today.

[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  You've found it, let's enter the sphere.
[20:29.000 --> 20:43.000]  It's the M4.
[20:43.000 --> 20:54.000]  It's all tied together under global government.
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  We're going to look at Sri Lanka and the carbon regulations that were put in there a year and a half ago.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  The exact same global government system being implemented in Europe and now coming to the United States.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  We will ban beef and you will eat the bugs.
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  Let's get back to what I was just mentioning before the break.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's paradoxical.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  Yes, Biden's horrible.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  Yes, we want to get rid of him.
[21:15.000 --> 21:23.000]  Yes, he needs to impeach so that his crimes are exposed and who controls him will be exposed.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  Yes, it's good to get rid of Boris Johnson.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Yes, it's good for Merkel to step down.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Yes, all of this is true.
[21:31.000 --> 21:36.000]  It's good that the Sri Lankan government, that was totally globalist run, has been overthrown.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  They're out of the people.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  But if they don't then go after the central banks and the globalist and the New World Order and the globalist ruling class that did this,
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  then all they would have done is further destabilize their countries.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  So I said it before the break.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  One of the major moves, if I was the globalist, I would make.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  I'm not going for violence.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  It's a terrible thing.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  It will actually help them.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  I wish no harm against Biden or any of these people.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  I want them to be tried and put in prison.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  We process.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  But now national polls are showing what we already knew, but they've been skewing them.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Now they're putting out accurate polls.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  We go into the methodology of the polls.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  They always sample 15 points more for Democrat.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  And they always bake into these polls higher numbers.
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.000]  But now Biden is polling in the 20s.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  Joe Biden's approval rating sinks to historic 29%.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  Believe me, folks, it's way lower than that.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  It might be 10%.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  Knives out.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  New York Times just said what we all know is true about Joe Biden.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  Here's the New York Times.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  At 79, Biden is testing the boundaries of age and the presidency.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  Joe Biden has got to go.
[22:57.000 --> 23:05.000]  As if Joe Biden's the one bringing us into this, quote, great reset, this great transition.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  As if it's all his fault.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  So see, they have their cake.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  They eat it too.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  Oh, leaders all over the world just implemented the exact same policies by accident.
[23:14.000 --> 23:22.000]  No, if you read deeper and actually watch their speeches, they're following the great reset of the Bilderberg group and its public relations arm.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  The Debo's group.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  The World Economic Forum.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  Texas grid operator warns of blackouts.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  That was months ago.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  They're not allowed to use coal.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  They've shut down most of those plants.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  They're given massive million dollar a day fines if they do.
[23:40.000 --> 23:47.000]  And they've got to get permission to even do that and get fined if they don't present time.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  Remember a year and a half ago on Valentine's Day.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  A week before they sent a letter saying we know a big blue northerner scheduled to be here in about six days.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  We need to be able to up the capacity these coal power plants and gas power plants and Joe Biden.
[24:03.000 --> 24:11.000]  Who just gotten into office said no with three big exclamation points.
[24:11.000 --> 24:22.000]  And so the power went off for up to two weeks and hundreds of people died and the power companies were able to gouge people and made 20 plus billion dollars.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  I predicted it all because I'd seen Interon do similar things.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  We know the plays they run.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  We know their scams of their build back better system.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  And that was the power operators months ago.
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  And now they have come out with the actual announcements Reuters today.
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  Texas grid operator worms a potential rolling blackouts today.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  Reuters are caught issues called for voluntary conservation.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  That's right.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  You've got to conserve because they cut your power.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  You're learning in this great transition like Germany said no more heating in your houses.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  The government's going to put warming tents on every street where the government will give you a place to be warm.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  Here's Urcott in South Austin.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  Issues called for voluntary conservation.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Dallas news.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  Texas warned to reduce electricity use amid fear of rolling backouts.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  Well, what did we do?
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.000]  We just went and put a $50,000 generator on the building.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  And then, of course, hooking it up to everything costs another $100,000.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  But we did it.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  You funded us.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  And now when the power goes off today, we'll be able to continue to stay on.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  People say, well, let me just get some batteries.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  Oh, we had batteries.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  The cost more than $50,000 there in these studios.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  And they failed in eight hours.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  They're ready to go six.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  They went further than they were rated to.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  And then we were in the dark.
[25:53.000 --> 26:03.000]  Remember, we had gas generators in here running it with one light on me because it's all the power we had for a week and a half.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  And I told you, this is the new way of life.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  They had articles making fun of me.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  Jones is crazy.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  He says it's on purpose.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  The political facts said, oh, the feds didn't order the shutdown.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  Yeah, they did.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  We showed the documents.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  The Environmental Protection Agency.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  And what did the Supreme Court rule we can have ago?
[26:21.000 --> 26:31.000]  They said the EPA cannot just make law by pulling it out of their rear end.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  Congress has to make the laws.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  And so now all those regulations have been overturned.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  But you notice they're still in place.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  Kind of like Supreme Court rules 10 plus years ago that you can't ban guns in DC.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  They're still banned.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  Euronews, Austria to reopen closed cold power station despite climate goals because they have to get ready for it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  Power the government buildings and key infrastructure.
[27:00.000 --> 27:10.000]  You see, when the power went off in Texas or when the power goes off in Spain, it's the same all over the world or under Chalcescuse, Romania.
[27:10.000 --> 27:22.000]  When the power goes off, the grid setup were the essential areas, the rich elite areas and the hospitals and the police stations and the government buildings.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  They all keep operating, but you're in the dark.
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.000]  So I was in the dark with no water and no electricity at my house other than some solar panels.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  It was too dark to get a lot of power and a small gas generator for almost two weeks.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  And I live in a nice area, but it's not the rich, the rich area.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  The area that's called essential in Austin is called Territown.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  And it's the oldest part of Austin.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  And it's in Central West Austin and it's where all the government elites live.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  And the movie stars and all the rest of them.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  And guess what?
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  They never had any other power go off because they're special.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  They're special.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  And a lot of the people I know personally that live in Blue Collar or working class or middle class areas,
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.000]  they had their power because they live right next to a hospital or government building.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  So that's how this system works.
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  So Austria reopened, closed coal-fired plant station despite climate goals.
[28:21.000 --> 28:30.000]  Energy market terminal caused by the war in Ukraine is triggered and increased in cold-fired electricity production in the European Union.
[28:30.000 --> 28:40.000]  So now you know why they're protesting by the millions in the Netherlands and all over the world.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  We're going to cover that when we come back.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  And the same model is implemented everywhere because it is the great reset.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  Doesn't matter if you're the Sri Lankan leader or the Australian leader or the U.S. puppet leader.
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  They all use the same words and the same policies because it's a global corporate government new world order system.

[29:52.000 --> 29:59.000]  Because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy.
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative and government
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.000]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view,
[30:30.000 --> 30:38.000]  2000 Mules, is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarstore.com.
[30:38.000 --> 30:44.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarstore.com.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know.
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  They're planning to run the same scams again.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  This film can stop them if you take action.
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  infowarstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.000]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  You might not agree with everything.
[31:15.000 --> 31:18.000]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.000]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.000]  infowarstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  And we do have the best supplements.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  Folks, this is a joke.
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  I'm giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  By the way, it works for me.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.000]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  I go and see them quite often now.
[31:59.000 --> 32:00.000]  Look at that.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  That's because it's been denatured.
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  It's been worked out.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  We didn't do that.
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something.
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  This is the very best I can get.
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[32:13.000 --> 32:19.000]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product,
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  because I want that goodwill.
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  Don't you get the big secret?
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[32:30.000 --> 32:41.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.000]  Look it up.
[32:42.000 --> 32:49.000]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[32:49.000 --> 32:54.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[32:54.000 --> 33:01.000]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  And that's the Black Sheep.
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.000 --> 33:31.000]  And proud of it.
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.000]  Humanity is getting off its knees.
[33:34.000 --> 33:42.000]  Humanity is rising and I am getting chills from my entire core of my body.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  I can feel the awakening.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  I can see the awakening.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  I am so proud of the people.
[33:49.000 --> 33:58.000]  As far away as Sri Lanka, from the Netherlands, to Mexico, to Brazil, to South Africa, to Nigeria, to Kenya,
[33:58.000 --> 34:07.000]  from Eastern Europe, to Pacific Islands, humanity is taking the blinders off.
[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  And the globalists are going down.
[34:13.000 --> 34:20.000]  What we need is Nuremberg to world trials.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  We need them convicted.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  We need them marched up to the gallows.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  And we need to break their necks.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  But only once they've been given a fair trial.
[34:36.000 --> 34:47.000]  They will dangle for the world to see in full HD, kicking and shitting and pissing down their legs.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen on this live Monday broadcast.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  The New World Order is turning the power off.
[34:55.000 --> 35:02.000]  They're turning the lights off to bring you and I and all of us to our knees.
[35:02.000 --> 35:12.000]  But if we are aware of them and that they are the authors of our pain, it is they that will be the ashes of history.
[35:12.000 --> 35:19.000]  And it is our new system that we will build back better, that will be constructed on their bones.
[35:19.000 --> 35:28.000]  Their physical bones, but more importantly the bones of the political ideologies of the elite and their neo-futilistic system.
[35:28.000 --> 35:36.000]  U.S. sees Russia food blockage as factor in Sri Lanka crisis.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  Yes, and it's the gas station owners that shut off all the pipelines and everything here in the U.S. too, right?
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  That's why the gas costs so much.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  It's not the central banks printing so much money either.
[35:48.000 --> 36:03.000]  U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said growing food insecurity around the world has been significantly exacerbated by the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Yeah, 81% of it.
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  No, it was two years ago they signed on to the Paris climate accords and they cut the number of cattle in the country by half.
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.000]  First year it's 30%, just like it's happening in Europe, really happening.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  You will eat some bugs, you will own nothing and you will like it.
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.000]  They also are now trying to take the farms of most of the farmers and give it to big agribusiness.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  They are deliberately creating the food crises and here's some of the articles.
[36:36.000 --> 36:45.000]  Complete collapse, here's how the ESG, that's the big U.N. program that environmentally scores businesses and shuts them down.
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  Complete collapse, here's how the ESGs destroyed one nation's economy, Sri Lanka.
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  In Sri Lanka, organic farming went catastrophically wrong, but it's not even organic.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  A nationwide experiment is abandoned after producing only misery.
[37:03.000 --> 37:13.000]  That's from March of this year and now you see the aftermath overthrow of the government and the ransacking of the central bank.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  And the total rejection of the New World Order.
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  Ways to meet the impending food crisis in Sri Lanka.
[37:21.000 --> 37:30.000]  The food crisis caused in the last two years by the carbon initiative banning methane and nitrogen,
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  both of which make up the life cycle on this planet and are essential to all carbon-based life forms.
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  Life on the face of the earth creates the atmosphere.
[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  In fact, there was a clip yesterday we didn't play of Mr. Jones, a big national talk show host on Sky News.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Forget his first name.
[37:50.000 --> 37:58.000]  And he was on another national TV show pointing out that carbon dioxide isn't even 1% of the atmosphere
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  that's been dozens of times higher in our past.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  We had higher oxygen levels and healthier plants and animals.
[38:07.000 --> 38:16.000]  Here is a clip of them talking about shutting down everything, banning cows, banning sheep, banning goats, banning chickens,
[38:16.000 --> 38:24.000]  banning basically everything, starving everyone to death to save the earth because we're going to have rising sea levels as all the elites buy oceanfront property.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  Here's the clip.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  When I asked...
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  Alice, you've been speaking for most of the night.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  When I asked Tanya Pliversek...
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  We'll fact check that one for you.
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  When I asked Tanya Pliversek, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and the potential Deputy Prime Minister,
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  was carbon dioxide the biggest human relation to climate change?
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  And she said yes.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  And I then said, well, that being the case, what percentage of the atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide?
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  And she said, I don't know.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  And I said, hang on, you don't know what percentage of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide,
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  and yet you're prepared to stand the economy on its head to address the problem, the detail of which you don't know.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  So when I then explained that the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Alice, is how much?
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  Alice, how much of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  To answer the question, Scott Morrison has said he thinks climate change, and that he wants to do something about it.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  Alice, how much carbon dioxide is the problem? How much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere?
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  I'm not a scientist. I don't know.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  Well, hang on, if you go to argue the case, you ought to know it's 0.04 of a percent.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  And of that 0.04 of a percent, human beings around the world create 3 percent.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  And of that 3 percent, Australia creates 1.3 percent.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  So for the 1.3 percent of 3 percent of 0.04 percent, we then decide to have a national economic suicide.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, I'm happy for you to have made that point.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  But they're not deciding to commit national suicide.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  It's exact same policies as Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Germany, and now the US.
[40:00.000 --> 40:08.000]  By the way, that's Alan Jones. He's been on TV for 50 years, but they call him the Alex Jones of Australia.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.920]  Jones of Australia. He's just as popular there as I am here and probably more popular.
[40:12.920 --> 40:21.420]  And yeah, there is Alan Jones, radio broadcaster. Alan Bedford Jones, 81 years old. He just
[40:21.420 --> 40:33.960]  knocks it out of the damn part. With the facts, 0.4% and it's been 20, 30 times the
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.400]  atmosphere what it is. But in just the last two million years, it's been six, seven times
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.920]  higher. And you know what happens with plants? You triple it in the greenhouses and they
[40:42.920 --> 40:48.280]  double their growth and their yield. And when you keep going up, it becomes even more insane.
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.760]  Why do you think they dig up plants all over the world? They were three, four times bigger
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.480]  than they are now. Why do you think the animals used to be so much bigger? There was more
[40:57.480 --> 41:01.880]  carbon dioxide. There was more oxygen. This isn't my opinion by the way. This is mainline
[41:01.880 --> 41:11.480]  anthropologist and paleontologist and scientist and climatologist. It's a fact. But they've
[41:11.480 --> 41:18.920]  listed a trace gas that is essential for all life on earth as a toxic waste. All that comes
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.080]  out of US and European power plants, coal plants, is water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[41:23.080 --> 41:27.960]  That's why they are so complex. They have all those tubes and machinery and things because
[41:27.960 --> 41:31.040]  the coal goes through it and then nothing comes out on the other end. Everything else
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.000]  is then used for distillates and steel making and everything else. It's an amazing science.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.880]  Now in China and Mexico, it's just a smokestack and a water turbine because they don't cut
[41:40.880 --> 41:45.120]  any of that out. And they send toxic coal dust with mercury and everything else right
[41:45.120 --> 41:52.920]  in the atmosphere. And that's dirty coal by the way. There's big stores of coal out west
[41:52.920 --> 41:57.120]  in the US. It's only here in the US and in China. Enough to run the country for hundreds
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.200]  of years and not thousands they say just in the US alone. It's all clean. It's all clean
[42:02.200 --> 42:09.160]  coal. It's so clean. It's pure carbon. There's no lead, no mercury, no nothing. There's tons
[42:09.160 --> 42:14.840]  of really toxic coal as well. And I agree. We should use the clean coal first. We should
[42:14.840 --> 42:18.400]  not be using dirty coal and we should put scrubbers on them. That was all reasonable
[42:18.400 --> 42:25.120]  stuff like catalytic converters on cars and scrubbers on power plants. But they've gotten
[42:25.120 --> 42:28.520]  rid of all that in China and Mexico and everyone implemented it and then they've gotten rid
[42:28.520 --> 42:35.880]  of our clean systems. All the studies show, there's a bunch of them, that trees and plants
[42:35.880 --> 42:41.640]  directly downwind all around coal power plants grow much faster and are healthier because
[42:41.640 --> 42:48.760]  there's higher carbon dioxide that hasn't dissipated out yet. It's a fact. It's a fact.
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.320]  Look up hydroponics. Look up indoor growing. Look, they pump carbon dioxide in and humans
[42:53.320 --> 42:57.040]  walk around and it doesn't even make them sick because it's not bad for us. We'll be
[42:57.040 --> 42:59.640]  right back. Stay with us.

[44:59.520 --> 45:05.120]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first
[45:05.120 --> 45:10.520]  of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the
[45:10.520 --> 45:17.200]  free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by
[45:17.200 --> 45:24.000]  the government. 231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.120]  attack. GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do
[45:30.120 --> 45:36.200]  not want you to know the truth. I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up
[45:36.200 --> 45:42.120]  and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth. Would you like to join us?
[45:42.120 --> 45:53.120]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com. Savegcn.com. You may click follow, share,
[45:53.120 --> 45:59.000]  give and pray. You may select all of those choices. I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.560]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[46:10.560 --> 46:14.880]  better place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.320]  with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.320]  really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the
[46:23.320 --> 46:27.960]  way, the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to get them, folks. And we do have
[46:27.960 --> 46:32.320]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our
[46:32.320 --> 46:38.880]  information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard
[46:38.880 --> 46:44.360]  support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[46:44.360 --> 46:49.320]  By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working
[46:49.320 --> 46:56.600]  for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support
[46:56.600 --> 47:03.280]  for men. I go and see him quite often now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[47:03.280 --> 47:18.280]  New World Order, it's Alex Jones. And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info
[47:18.280 --> 47:29.840]  war, and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to
[47:29.840 --> 47:41.840]  fight, you better believe you got one. From the front lines of the information war, it's
[47:41.840 --> 47:59.480]  going to happen. This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication. So you've got
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.960]  a thing on the left, CO2 that you want to get to zero. And that's going to be based
[48:03.960 --> 48:11.400]  on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average
[48:11.400 --> 48:17.560]  for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. So let's look at each
[48:17.560 --> 48:23.640]  one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably one of these numbers is
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.000]  going to have to get pretty near to zero. That's back from a high school algebra, but
[48:29.000 --> 48:36.280]  let's take a look. First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's
[48:36.280 --> 48:42.520]  headed up to about 9 billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health
[48:42.520 --> 48:48.560]  care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. Many
[48:48.560 --> 48:55.720]  believed that Bill Gates somehow misspoke when he attributed successful depopulation
[48:55.720 --> 49:01.720]  to the vaccines, but it's now evident that he didn't. He was being very clear about the
[49:01.720 --> 49:10.640]  intentions of the globalist agenda. Kill 99.99 percent of all humans. According to these
[49:10.640 --> 49:16.520]  psychopaths, this is how we will save the planet. And they have convinced an overwhelming
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.680]  amount of the world's population into accepting their agenda and pushing for it. People who
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.160]  believe that humans need to be aborted and believe the human race needs to be culled
[49:28.160 --> 49:34.600]  into a small, compliant herd. People that are okay with billions of people starving,
[49:34.600 --> 49:41.280]  so long as the screens on their devices tell them it's the right thing to do. But not everyone
[49:41.280 --> 49:48.440]  has gone insane. Some still have a survival instinct. When the Dutch government voted
[49:48.440 --> 49:54.880]  in a scheme that will force farmers to cut their livestock down to unsustainable levels,
[49:54.880 --> 50:00.480]  thereby forcing them out of work and shutting down the second biggest food exporter in the
[50:00.480 --> 50:07.960]  world, the farmers did the right thing and said no. And protests have broken out all
[50:07.960 --> 50:14.040]  throughout the Netherlands. Shutting down the world's second biggest food exporter is
[50:14.040 --> 50:20.800]  all part of the anti-human zero emissions plan. And so the Dutch farmers aren't just
[50:20.800 --> 50:28.640]  protesting losing their jobs. They're protesting the mass murder of the world's population.
[50:28.640 --> 50:34.120]  Just like the Canadian truckers and farmers did last winter, and just like the Canadian
[50:34.120 --> 50:40.840]  police sided with the tyrants, the Dutch cops are doing the same. Police drawing their
[50:40.840 --> 50:57.000]  sidearms on peaceful protesters and opening fire on them. Using undercover agents and provoking
[50:57.000 --> 51:15.480]  violence to shut down peaceful gatherings. Because the globalists are not taking no
[51:15.480 --> 51:22.880]  for an answer. And while you may back the blue, chances are that they won't back you
[51:22.880 --> 51:29.680]  when it comes to the globalist agenda, which has now enlisted A-list celebrities to convince
[51:29.680 --> 51:37.280]  us all to eat bugs. I'm Nicole Kidman and I am going to eat a four-cost meal of bugs.
[51:37.280 --> 51:43.880]  They're trying to persuade us into dying peacefully, like good, obedient slaves. But
[51:43.880 --> 51:51.320]  soon the food will start to run out. And worse, more signs of kinetic world war on the horizon
[51:51.320 --> 51:58.320]  as Japan's longest standing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is assassinated. And former Russian
[51:58.320 --> 52:04.640]  President Dmitry Medvedev joins President Putin in threatening nuclear annihilation
[52:04.640 --> 52:11.120]  if the United States continues their provocations, which is exactly what the Extinction Rebellion
[52:11.120 --> 52:18.080]  wants. And it's what the Biden administration wants. It's what everyone in charge wants.
[52:18.080 --> 52:25.080]  The only way out of this is a worldwide people's revolution. The Dutch farmers have begun and
[52:25.080 --> 52:31.480]  they have been joined by people from other nations. The revolution will not be televised.
[52:31.480 --> 52:39.520]  And if you want to stand up against evil, then now is the time while you are still alive.
[52:39.520 --> 52:59.880]  Coming for Info Wars, this is Greg Rees.
[52:59.880 --> 53:08.000]  The last segment I explained that carbon dioxide has been 25, 30 times higher in our planets
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.320]  past from the ice core and soil samples they have. And then scientists in the last hundred
[53:13.320 --> 53:22.160]  years did studies in greenhouses and in contained bubbles where they would raise insects and
[53:22.160 --> 53:28.760]  mammals and plants as well as bacteria and other microbes inside a higher oxygen and
[53:28.760 --> 53:36.480]  higher carbon dioxide environment and found that they live longer and they grow bigger.
[53:36.480 --> 53:42.360]  And so when I mentioned that the scientists know this main line, this is settled science,
[53:42.360 --> 53:47.120]  it's known fact like plants need water and sunlight to live, that when you get more carbon
[53:47.120 --> 53:55.080]  dioxide, more oxygen, and the two feet off each other in photosynthesis, plants, bringing
[53:55.080 --> 54:03.000]  carbon dioxide and put out oxygen, symbiotic. We bring in oxygen and we put out carbon dioxide.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.760]  So by listing carbon dioxide as the big evil and then everything else like nitrogen that
[54:06.760 --> 54:11.800]  plants grow from, you've cornered the market on life and outlawed life. It's more than
[54:11.800 --> 54:15.800]  just the New York Times headline, soon you'll have to pay to breathe. That's what this is.
[54:15.800 --> 54:20.960]  So the crew, search engines, everything I say, and they pulled up a few articles. Big
[54:20.960 --> 54:29.320]  mammals evolve thanks to more oxygen. Scientific American. And it goes on to say because carbon
[54:29.320 --> 54:42.000]  dioxide was higher previously. National geographic. Why giant bugs once roamed earth? And then
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.760]  it goes in to explain there was higher carbon dioxide and higher oxygen. And so things were
[54:46.760 --> 54:53.520]  bigger and lived longer and were more healthy. It is estimated that 300 years ago, the world
[54:53.520 --> 54:58.080]  had the lowest carbon dioxide ever recorded in our history. Humans have boosted it up
[54:58.080 --> 55:06.720]  just a little bit in the industrial revolution in the last 150 years, but not much. See,
[55:06.720 --> 55:10.680]  these are the facts. That's why when you see newscast saying we've got to stop carbon
[55:10.680 --> 55:14.240]  dioxide, it's like saying we've got to cut oxygen off. But everybody knows oxygen's
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.960]  good for you. Even the dumbest, most uneducated person. So they didn't go with oxygen. They
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.240]  went with the thing just as important because if you don't have carbon dioxide, you don't
[55:23.240 --> 55:29.200]  have oxygen. We are terraforming. God made us humans, animals, plants live in symbiotic
[55:29.200 --> 55:42.720]  relationship. And we help each other. We terraform the planet. We are creating the atmosphere.
[55:42.720 --> 55:47.320]  Everything is key to thickening the atmosphere and having it come closer to the surface of
[55:47.320 --> 55:54.560]  sea level so it doesn't off gas into space. Mars once had an atmosphere, but it wasn't
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.560]  a big enough planet. It didn't have a big enough gravity. And so the water left the
[55:59.560 --> 56:06.040]  planet though it's under the surface, most of it. Same thing with the moon. That's been
[56:06.040 --> 56:17.640]  proven. With probes. So that's the reality. Separately, we've extended the July 4th mega
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.120]  cell biggest of the year because we don't have more products to sell. We don't have
[56:21.120 --> 56:25.280]  more stuff to have specials. We're completely maxed out. All these are great products. A
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.120]  bunch of our best sellers are out. Our best sellers of vaso beats, Ultra 12 and X2 are
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.600]  still in. They'll be sold out soon. They're still 40% off. Heron beard formula is really
[56:34.600 --> 56:38.600]  a great multivitamin mineral. Great for everybody. Adult children, you name it. It's organic.
[56:38.600 --> 56:42.360]  It's high end, but it's called beard and hair formula, but it really is a multivitamin.
[56:42.360 --> 56:47.960]  It's 75% off right now and selling out fast. But despite that, it's 75% off. Double Petria

[58:50.640 --> 58:55.920]  Degenitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[58:55.920 --> 59:01.520]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[59:01.520 --> 59:07.780]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com. Studies have
[59:07.780 --> 59:13.760]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[59:13.760 --> 59:19.320]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[59:19.320 --> 59:25.800]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[59:25.800 --> 59:32.880]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[59:32.880 --> 59:39.040]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[59:39.040 --> 59:45.440]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[59:45.440 --> 59:52.440]  a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:23.840]  Why do the Supreme Court do the right thing and overturn Roe v. Wade just under the Constitution
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:28.600]  to kick it back to the states? One of the reasons why this issue is so hotly contested
[1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:32.960]  in the United States is that it was decided by the people through the democratic process
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  of the legislatures and now it will be. Go to the states where those states will be able
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:42.920]  to reflect the will and the views of the people who live there. Well, a lot of reasons. But
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:52.160]  the big one is that we have 3D modeling and 3D scans in HD for now 20 plus years of babies
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:58.680]  in the womb, sucking their thumbs even two or three months, playing, dancing, and we
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:04.680]  know that's a human. And then you've got the pro abortion crowd saying it's a satanic
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:09.520]  sacrament in court, saying we're going to kill those little bastards wearing shirts celebrating
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:20.520]  yeah, I killed my baby, I'm going to kill more. And really showing us how sick and evil
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:25.840]  they are in their cult of death. Now it's not a total overturn of Roe v. Wade saying
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:32.200]  that it's illegal. Well, states can out slavery's legal again. The statement has been made that
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:38.200]  the government has a right to come in your home and tell you as a woman and as a family
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:45.200]  what you should do with your body. This is not about freedom or personal choice get vaccinated.
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:50.720]  We also know that we've had a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:56.840]  over human bodies. Exactly. States can't announce they can take your guns. States can't announce
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:01.480]  any of that in our republic system. It was the left celebration of killing babies up
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:08.800]  to their due date. And then multiple states like New York passing laws you can kill babies
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:14.400]  for weeks after birth. I'm talking about your bill how late how late in the third trimester
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:19.160]  could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.760]  of the of the woman. So I mean, through the third trimester, the third trimester goes
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:28.280]  all the way up to 40 weeks. Okay, but to the end of the third trimester, I don't think
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:32.280]  we have a limit in the bill where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth. She has
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:37.520]  physical signs of that she is about to give a birth. Would that still be a point at which
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:43.040]  she could request an abortion if she was so certified. Mr. Chairman, that would be a you
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:48.600]  know, a decision that the doctor, the physician and the woman understand that I'm asking
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:53.040]  you if your bill allows that my bill would allow that. Yes. And people were like, what
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:03:03.080]  the hell is this? And finally, started waking up out of their comas. I am Dr. Bernard N.
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:10.480]  Nacanson, formerly the director of the largest abortion clinic in the Western world. And
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:18.600]  I am the last surviving founding member of NARAL, a pro abortion organization which brought
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:29.200]  legal abortion to the entire United States. I am personally responsible for over 75,000
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:39.240]  abortions. We founded NARAL in the late 1960s with our purpose to export our pro abortion
[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:47.120]  mentality everywhere. To achieve that end, we adopted the strategy to deny what we knew
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:56.480]  to be true, that abortion kills an existing living human being. We denied that fact in
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:03.680]  an effort to mislead the American public and the courts of this land. This was the greatest
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:10.600]  mistake of my life. And legal abortion was the greatest mistake this nation has ever
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:16.240]  conceived. This shows in this sea of evil and corruption and collapsing borders and
[1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:21.240]  devalued currencies and pedophilia and world government attacks on the family and all of
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:47.240]  it, that humanity is coming back.
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:05:08.040]  The July 4th, 2022 Super Sale is live and only running for one week exclusively at infowarstore.com.

[1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:13.400]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:22.200]  There is an incredible wave of populist conservative candidates across this country and I am so
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:27.720]  excited about the victories they've been having in their primaries. Jerome Davidson is going
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:30.720]  to be our guest for the next 40 minutes or so then we're going to open the phones up
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:36.840]  and take calls to the balance of the broadcast and cover the Hunter Biden pedophilic laptop
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:41.840]  but we're very honored to have Jerome Davidson on with us here. He's a former NFL player
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:47.320]  and so much more but what's really great about him is that he is in the globalist faces and
[1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:52.640]  is absolutely creating a lot of excitement and they are scared of him. Here's a few of
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:07:20.640]  those campaign ads that are turning heads.
[1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:30.040]  One of the biggest problems that many of us are facing is internet censorship. Millions
[1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:35.480]  of people are being purged from the internet for no good reason at all. Our elected officials
[1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:40.600]  have been ignoring this major issue for a long time. They think that since the big tech
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:46.200]  titans are private corporations that they can do whatever they want and that if we don't
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:52.160]  like it we should start our own thing. That is a totally misguided approach because these
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:58.240]  tech titans are richer and more powerful than any company in the history of the world. They
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:04.760]  operate in every country. They have the power to make or break most businesses, to swing
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:12.240]  elections and even start wars. We cannot allow them to separate and divide us any longer.
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:16.200]  We need to level the playing field. It's time to call these social media companies what they
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:22.960]  are. Public utilities. Public utilities are companies that operate at a monopoly scale
[1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:27.640]  because they offer services that we cannot live without. In the same way, you cannot
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:33.840]  run a business, a non-profit or a political campaign without electricity or a telephone.
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:39.320]  You can't run any of those things without social media in 2022. Social media is the modern
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:44.520]  day public square. It is access to the market and it is a keys to power. Barack Obama got
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:48.480]  elected because of social media. Donald Trump got elected because of social media. That's
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:53.520]  why the establishment spent the last six years doing everything they can to censor those
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:59.840]  who question them. Whether it is Russiagate, COVID, Ukraine or January 6th. They will use
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:05.880]  any excuse they can to consolidate power and to shut off anyone who opposes them. That's
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:11.120]  why we need to come together as Americans and put our foot down before it's too late.
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:14.400]  Enough is enough. The power company can't cut off your power because they don't like
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:18.400]  your politics. The phone company cannot cut off your telephone because they don't like
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:23.640]  your politics. So the social media companies should not be able to cancel you because they
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:29.200]  don't like your politics. They need to be legally classified as public utilities and
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:34.960]  we need to pass an internet bill of rights. One that firmly establishes our first amendment
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:40.640]  rights into the realm of cyberspace where we now live most of our lives. This is not
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:49.160]  North Korea. This is not China. This is the United States of America and in this country
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:54.400]  our right to free speech is not optional. I'm Jerome Davidson. I'm running to be your
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:59.560]  next congressman. I promise to fight tech tyranny every day and to bring freedom back
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:05.420]  to the internet. My name is Jerome Davidson and I approve this message. Jerome Davidson
[1:10:05.420 --> 1:10:09.200]  people are really excited about this guy. He's got a great record, a great history, a
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:12.840]  great Christian. I'm going to read over his bio and go to him for the next 40 minutes
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:17.000]  or so but I got to tell you they are scared of him. He's exactly what we need. That is
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.760]  the cleanest most truthful focus to add I've seen period out there way better than these
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:26.960]  veteran politicians even some of these establishment Republicans. Jerome is a former Arizona State
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:31.080]  University student athlete and NFL player who travels the country sharing inspiration,
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:37.240]  passion and faith. His unifying speeches full of truth, faith and freedom of this country
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.520]  are memorable and moving. And we're going to go over his whole background and everything
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:49.960]  else for today. Jeromeforcongress.com, Jerome. J-E-R-O-N-E Jeromeforcongress.com on Twitter
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:56.480]  for now at Jerome For Congress and he joins us right now. Very impressed. A lot of buzz
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:00.360]  about what he's doing. I've been following it for a while and we're really pleased and
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:07.140]  blessed to be able to have him on the show. Again, he's running for Congress out of Arizona.
[1:11:07.140 --> 1:11:12.480]  We just played two of his powerful campaign ads. Jerome, congratulations on getting in
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:15.800]  the arena at this level. We really hope and pray you get into Congress as we need your
[1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:18.200]  leadership. God bless you.
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:21.880]  Alex Jones. Thank you very much for having me on, sir. And they want to bring the fight
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:26.360]  to America and God has touched my heart to join you and others in this country who are
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:31.360]  not going to allow these satanic, evil, pedophile people to take over this country. We're going
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:35.920]  to fight and if God be with us, we will stand strong. And I believe what has happened with
[1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:40.800]  the Roe v. Wade was a sign from God that his grace is still on us and he's still with us.
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:45.760]  So all we have to do is get some people who are bold enough, strong enough and brave enough
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:47.200]  to stand up and fight.
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:51.800]  I'm excited. I'm excited about you. I'm excited about all these populist Christian candidates
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:55.480]  we're seeing. The system's really scared. I could ask a lot of questions here. Got a
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:59.340]  lot of key talking points, but what's front and center for you?
[1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:02.480]  What's front and center is, uh, is making sure that the border is closed. We've got
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:07.960]  to deal with that. Number two is I want to file a lawsuit against the January six committee.
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:12.560]  Uh, I don't know why, uh, we haven't had anybody do that. I'm going to file a lawsuit again.
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:15.240]  I would have the jurisprudence to do that. And I would also have the jurisprudence to
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:21.600]  file a lawsuit against the jail that's housing the January six, uh, inmates. And so we want
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:26.240]  to get them out of here. That is un-American. It's evil and it's political.
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:30.440]  It is. And of course you're right there in Arizona. I'd say it's, it's almost as bad
[1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:35.760]  as Texas, but the UN, as you know, reported last week that the Texas and Arizona borders
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.200]  are the most dangerous land crossings in the world.
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:44.640]  Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. Our border crossing is crazy here. And we're surprised that Doug
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:50.160]  Deucey, well, I shouldn't say surprise. Doug Deucey is a blockaded punk and he's a leftist
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:55.080]  and he hasn't done anything to stop the border crisis. And, uh, and this is why I'm telling
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.200]  people that I, that I go around and have these speeches with, I say, listen, y'all been,
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:03.240]  my opponents and all these Republicans have nothing but a whole bunch of talking and barking
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.520]  dogs as long as the fence is closed. But as soon as the, the gate opens up, they tuck their
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:11.600]  tails and run to the backyard and start barking from there. It's time to fight now. So now
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:15.040]  what's up? You want to, what you're going to do now? All this talking, they go from
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.440]  place to place and from room to room talking about everything that's happening to complaining.
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:22.920]  And now it is time to do something. We need to get it done. They're bringing drugs in
[1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:27.160]  here. America is a criminal organization now. And one of the leading criminals, criminal
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:31.960]  organizations in the world with sex trafficking, human trafficking, fentanyl is coming in here
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:35.360]  and it's coming at the southern border. And Doug Deucey should have done something about
[1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:39.920]  it a long time ago. And so I got inspired enough by the spirit of God, the Holy spirit,
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:44.960]  the Holy ghost got on me and stirred me. I was doing a YouTube channel prior to this
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:48.120]  and I was hoping that God would just let, let me do the YouTube channel, but they, they
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:52.200]  kicked me off the YouTube channel. And so therefore I started coming up with some offensive
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:56.680]  weapons. Just in case I win this congressional race, I'm going in on offense. I played full
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:00.880]  back in NFL. I don't know nothing about no defense. I do know that I can go in here with
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:05.360]  some offensive weapons and get them on their heels and not have us on our heels for change.
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:07.560]  And with God with us, brother, we're going to get it done.
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:10.920]  I totally agree. Whether you win or lose, most people have to run three times where
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:13.800]  they win. You've got a good chance of winning. It doesn't matter. You'll be at the debate.
[1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:16.320]  You'll be all over TV. You'll be getting your message out. You'll be doing thousands
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:20.200]  of interviews. People say, I'm not going to run because I don't think I'll win. You're
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:25.040]  never going to win if you don't try. I mean, it's, it's, it's very, very simple.
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:28.360]  It's very simple. If you don't try and if you're not inspired enough to get out and
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:31.440]  do something, well, then you're going to lose. You've lost already.
[1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:38.040]  What is the football champ, but what's that? Vince Lombardi quote about winners never quit
[1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:39.760]  and quitters never win.
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:45.160]  Absolutely. And you know what he also, he said, when you leave it all on the field,
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:49.280]  you have nothing to feel bad about. So in other words, you just said, if people run
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:53.040]  and lose, they scared they're going to lose. Listen, if you go out there and you give it
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:56.800]  all you have and you, you give it all your energy, you give it all your faith and everything
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:01.840]  that you can and you still lose, you don't have to walk off with your head down. You
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:06.240]  can walk out saying, Hey, I gave it my best and maybe it just wasn't the will of God for
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:10.280]  me to have that position or to have that win. But at least I can lay my head on my pillow
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:14.480]  at night and say, listen, I've done what I can do and now and I can rest and I'm at
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:21.880]  peace. And so when I get in here, I'm going to wedge war against these evil, evil people,
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:24.440]  people don't understand. And this is what America needs to wake up and understand right
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:28.720]  now. You need to wake up right now because your Sisyphus churches and pastors are not
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:33.040]  going to come to the rescue. They are not involved in this spiritual battle. You need
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:38.640]  to understand that evil is evil and America does not understand how evil is because they
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:43.000]  think that this is some kind of movie. This is a real evil takeover and they come in to
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.680]  take your children from you. They come in to take your wealth, your life and everything
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:49.360]  from you right now. They're going to take your free speech and then they're going to
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:52.840]  take your life away and it's going to be over here in this country. We only have a

[1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:06.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:21.240]  Welcome back to Alex Jones show. Our guest Jerome Davison is a former star college football player star NFLer.
[1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:27.240]  I admire him is standing up for truth and freedom and travel in the country battling the globalists in the last few years.
[1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:32.240]  And now thrown his hat in the ring in a highly contested congressional district in Arizona.
[1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:37.240]  He's also a pastor and that's the most important work in my view that he's been doing.
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:43.240]  And he is those like God has enlisted him reading his campaign literature to fight for Americans.
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:48.240]  And I'm very excited. I want to talk about the First Amendment, his introduction of the Internet Bill of Rights.
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:52.240]  The Second Amendment is congressional district struggle that Arizona faces is upcoming primary.
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:58.240]  The fact that he's a pastor, author, former NFL running back, not running for Congress to protect and ensure the freedoms of American people
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:04.240]  are entitled to run the Constitution Bill of Rights. And Jerome, please, please continue with all of this.
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:09.240]  I want to run through it. But first you talk about evil. We got to respond to the Hunter Biden situation.
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:14.240]  We go back two years ago in the middle of the campaign. His laptop comes out. He left it there.
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:21.240]  It was given law enforcement. The whole media said it was fake. They censored even the president, Trump, myself, everybody that tried to show it.
[1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:28.240]  It was all him. Now his phone has been released and hacked. They admit it's his. It's pedophilic. It's a smoking crack.
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:35.240]  It's sex trafficking. I can't even say the stuff that's on there, folks, but just like the last laptop.
[1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:40.240]  Naked trophies where he's with little girls look like they're 10 years old. I mean, this is, I'm scared to click on it.
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:44.240]  I stopped this morning. I wasn't going to look anymore. I'm not even sure it's legal to look at it.
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:48.240]  So, I mean, how cut and dry is this?
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:55.240]  It's cut and dry. He's a criminal. Joe Biden has been compromised because we found out on the phone conversation
[1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:59.240]  that he did know about his son's business dealings in Ukraine and around the world.
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:04.240]  Those business dealings also included life, sex trafficking and human trafficking.
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:10.240]  They already know it. We are under the thumb of a criminal organization in the White House.
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:18.240]  And the FBI knew about it. And let me tell you something. I will work hard to defund the FBI and we got to reform it
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:24.240]  because they are an extension of the Democrat Party. They work against the American people.
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:28.240]  They're not doing anything to help us. They knew about these school shootings before they happened.
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  And yet they didn't do anything about it. But yet they set up, they tried to set up President Donald Trump
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:38.240]  and they set up a phony hoax when it came down to Gretchen Whitmer's kidnapping.
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:45.240]  This is what we pay the American tax dollars for, for an FBI agency that does nothing for the American people.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:50.240]  We have got to change this whole scenario. One thing I'm going to do and go in there with my Internet Bill of Rights,
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:55.240]  which is going to include data recovery. These people are spying on us and they're making trillions of dollars
[1:22:55.240 --> 1:23:01.240]  off of our data and off of our information. And my Internet Bill of Rights is not only going to stop censorship
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:05.240]  and stop them from listening to our stuff and stopping us from getting kicked off these platforms,
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:09.240]  like you, Mr. Alex Jones, and all of the great work that you've been doing to me.
[1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:17.240]  You have done more spiritual work in the Kingdom of God than most churches and pastors in this world, in this country.
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:21.240]  And I'm going to tell you something. When they censor us, we're not going to be able to preach the gospel.
[1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:27.240]  We're not going to be able to say anything about Jesus Christ and God and a boy being a boy and a girl being a girl.
[1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:33.240]  And I want you Christians out there to wake up and understand that God wants you to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth.
[1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:37.240]  And that means you've got to come in opposition to darkness and everything that's not of God.
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:41.240]  We're going to do data recovery. That is, you have old folks right now living on a limited budget.
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:46.240]  And while they're searching their phones and doing everything, the data is being stolen and stolen around the world.
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:52.240]  Trillions of dollars of data that feeds the algorithm that algorithm and they need that algorithm needs this information.
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:24:00.240]  And so in my internet bill of rights, I want people to be either be paid for the data that that that's being stolen from them or either opt out.
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:14.240]  The other thing is, is that emerging technologies you saw in that COVID deal that that the left slid in there that they will have a mind reading technology in these new cars that reads your emotions.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.240]  Now, and and and read your mind. And that's law now.
[1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:24.240]  Within three years, face scan, you breathalyze you and then have a computer analyze.
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:31.240]  If you're in a good frame of mind, they can set that anyway they want. That's what the Communist Party China has already put in.
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:34.240]  I am going to block that because your mind is sovereign property.
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:38.240]  And when they did the forced inoculation, Alex, they did the forced inoculation.
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:44.240]  They were basically telling Americans that your body is the property of the government.
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  And everybody should have been fighting against that.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:50.240]  Even if you wanted a violation of the Fourth Amendment, there you go.
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:52.240]  And they're doing it now with the mind.
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:54.240]  And that's my internet bill of rights.
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:02.240]  It's a three pronged bill that's going to stop censorship, recover data and also stop the emerging technologies that's going to take over the world.
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  You know, usually we get even great candidates on people that have won and they're just basically putting out conservative talking points.
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:11.240]  And that's great populist talking points.
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:17.240]  But man, you've got a better plan than even members of Congress that are good like Josh Hawley and so many others.
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  I mean, you're obviously a smart guy and they may not travel in the country and been doing your own news show for a while.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:25.240]  But how did you come up with such a great plan?
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:27.240]  Because I totally agree with it.
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:29.240]  Well, I listen to a lot of young people.
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:34.240]  I'm at ASU campus all the time and then I have some young people around me, even in my camp right now,
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:38.240]  that's helping me deal with this emerging technologies and all this talking points.
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:43.240]  But I've been watching the moves of the globalists and also I watch your show.
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:49.240]  And you've been ahead of the game, man, and really helping us with our talking points and coming up with a battle plan.
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:54.240]  Instead of just wanting to go in Congress and just, you know, just for the sake of ego, it's time out for that.
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:26:01.240]  We are at war and this war, our greatest threat is not China and it's not anything from outside.
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:05.240]  Our greatest threat is domestic on this terra firma right now in America.
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:08.240]  We have left this in a criminal organization in this country right now.
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:17.240]  And if we don't wake up right now and start funding people like myself who are running for office and get me in there
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:21.240]  so I can go to war and help stop this stuff, our country is over.
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:25.240]  Well, I'm 100% sold and I'm going to get behind what you're doing.
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:29.240]  Everybody needs to go to your website, Geron4Congress.com.
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:35.240]  I want to get into more of your platform next segment, but Geron, tell people how they can get in the fight right now.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:37.240]  Everybody's got to get behind you.
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:40.240]  Go to Geron4Congress.com. Go to Get Involved.
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:47.240]  I'm raising up an army of 2,000 to 4,000 people that are going to knock doors, make phone calls, share my content, make memes.
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.240]  Memes are very important right now and they're very powerful. Make fun of the left.
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:55.240]  Laugh at them. Make jokes at them. Take my video and share it. Make a meme of it.
[1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:57.240]  We are going to go after them and we're going to wear them out.
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:00.240]  They don't have a sense of humor and laughter really hurts their spirit.
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:03.240]  So let's laugh at them and share this content.
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:10.240]  Send $5, $10 to my campaign. Send $20. Tell people to donate because the GOP isn't funding me.
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  They're not helping me.
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  I'm maxed out, but I'm going to make the maximum donation I can make. What is that? $3,000?
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:25.240]  You're going to have to go up, Alex. I think it's like $58.
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:31.240]  I haven't checked in a while. That's good. I'm going to make a donation. 100% today to the campaign.
[1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:33.240]  We've got to be all in here. You're right.
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:41.240]  If people will just realize you've got to spend your money to save your money, Americans have to realize this is a total war.
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:48.240]  This is a complete war. The spirit that was with God, he saw God. He was created by God.
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:51.240]  He watched God make the stars and the planets and everything.
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:55.240]  And the Bible says in Job that they rejoiced when God made all of these things.
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:57.240]  And he was the sovereign Elohim.
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:03.240]  But these spirits were with God and saw him and knew him as God, but yet rebelled against him.
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:08.240]  What do you think? That evil just stayed in heaven or was just between the pages of Genesis and Exodus?
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:14.240]  That evil is prevalent today and it's in the Democrat Party and we have to stop them right now.
[1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:19.240]  You're right. I mean, they're at war with us. They admit they're at war. They are just shutting everything down.
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:26.240]  When they told the church is not to say hallelujah or sing loud, I thought for sure that the church was going to say, hey listen, don't tell me how to sing.
[1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:33.240]  Let's talk about that. In Canada, in California, in New York, all the world, they said, don't sing. You can go to church, don't sing.
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:39.240]  They want total control. They're scared of the brethren coming together. Stay right there, sir. We've got to get you into Congress.
[1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:42.240]  We've got to get you on all the shows. We've got to get you on Tucker Carl's.

[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:26.240]  This is an amazing war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:31.240]  So there are several big phenomenons here we need to cover.
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:36.240]  The worst part of my job is that I study these evil people and I'm not perfect.
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:42.240]  Like, I want to get in fights, I lust after women, I'm not perfect.
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:45.240]  But I love God and I love justice and I love everybody.
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:50.240]  And I hate having to study these evil people because I can't stand them.
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:55.240]  But the great part is I get to meet all the really wonderful people that love God and justice
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:58.240]  and how alive they are, no matter what color they are, where they came from.
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:01.240]  If they love God and justice, you just see it.
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:04.240]  The people that serve evil look like zombies or something.
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  It's scary and I don't want to be like them.
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:09.240]  And I want to protect the children, the unborn and the born from them,
[1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:11.240]  and they're coming after it all.
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:13.240]  There's another paradox here.
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:16.240]  So many people say, I don't care what's happening in the Netherlands,
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:21.240]  I don't care what's happening in Canada, I don't care what's happening in Arizona,
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  because you live in New York, you live in Texas, folks.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:30.240]  If somebody's having the rights taken in Australia or in Nigeria or in Mexico,
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:32.240]  it affects you.
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:35.240]  If Bolsonaro's fighting tyranny in Brazil, that helps you.
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:37.240]  I know our audience gets that, it has empathy.
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:41.240]  You don't need to be told that you already have been degrading your spirit to care about others.
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:46.240]  It's not even scientific to understand, but it is scientific that if others are in trouble,
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:47.240]  you're going to end up in trouble.
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:51.240]  If other people can be enslaved or dominated or abused, you can be.
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:56.240]  But I've got to tell you, it doesn't matter where you are in the world,
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:59.240]  we're fighting a global corporate satanic force of the Great Reset
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:01.240]  and the Debo script, the Bilderberg Group,
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:04.240]  and we need to get behind the fight against it.
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:07.240]  And we need people that are in office and running for office,
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:11.240]  whether it's local, state, or federal, or international, to talk about it
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:12.240]  and make it the central issue.
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:18.240]  And what I love about our guest, Jerome Davidson, at JeromeForCommerce.com,
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:21.240]  is he gets that, and you can tell.
[1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:24.240]  If you don't know about this stuff, you can't explain it to people.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  He knows what he's talking about.
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:31.240]  And I got to tell you, he's better right now than Rand Paul and Josh Hawley
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:34.240]  and people that are good people I know, but don't go all the way,
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:36.240]  because he has the courage to say it.
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  I know they know all this and they're starting to get there.
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:39.240]  So is Tucker Carlson.
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:41.240]  We got to get there last year.
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:45.240]  We don't have time to play games in a war with an enemy, with a playbook.
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:46.240]  Use a football analogy.
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:49.240]  We know their playbook is total destruction, total enslavement,
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:51.240]  cutting off the energy, brainwashing our children.
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:54.240]  There is no making a deal with that.
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:55.240]  There's no backing down.
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  Just because the enemy is so crazy, we can't sound crazy by saying what they're doing.
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:00.240]  They're doing this.
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:01.240]  Hunter Biden's doing this.
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:03.240]  Jeffrey Epstein's doing this.
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:04.240]  These people are doing this.
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.240]  So they're bad and we got to up our game and just lay it out like it is
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.240]  and not be afraid of how crazy it sounds.
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:14.240]  We're not crazy because they're fulfilling the book of Revelation and their Satanic.
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:16.240]  They're the crazy ones.
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:20.240]  But good people get hit with something so evil, so out of control,
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:22.240]  you just kind of shut down.
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:24.240]  But we can't shut down.
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:25.240]  But I understand the paradox.
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:27.240]  I had to stop looking at the Hunter Biden phone today,
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:29.240]  because I was like, this has got to be illegal.
[1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:30.240]  I've never seen child porn.
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:31.240]  I'm not about to see it.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:34.240]  And it was going in that direction, him in bed with kids, you name it.
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:38.240]  So I understand the paradox of not wanting to look at this,
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:40.240]  but as a pastor and as a really smart man,
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:44.240]  how do you thread the needle of spending our time on good people
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:46.240]  and why God's great versus exposing the evil?
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:50.240]  Because there's almost, at a certain point,
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:52.240]  you stare into the abyss, you become the abyss.
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:55.240]  But what I'm getting at here is I appreciate your courage
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:37:00.240]  in coming right out with who the enemy is.
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:03.240]  Yeah, well, we can look in the face of God,
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:05.240]  and we see God and we see his glory compared to man
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:06.240]  and compared to the evil.
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:08.240]  Well, then I can face anything,
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:11.240]  because I know that God is much greater than all of these evils.
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:12.240]  But I see their atrocities.
[1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:13.240]  I see their evil.
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:16.240]  I see the type of evil that's coming up on this country,
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:17.240]  and it's not going to be fun.
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:19.240]  It's not going to be a comic movie.
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:22.240]  It's not going to be something that you think is just going to go away.
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:25.240]  It is going to be permanent hell on earth.
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:27.240]  And we've already read about it in the book of Revelation.
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:31.240]  But the church, they preach it as if it's just going to stay
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:32.240]  in the pages of the Bible.
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:36.240]  But this evil is coming, and we've got to prepare our people for it.
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:40.240]  And so when I look at the evils and things that Hunter Biden is doing,
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:41.240]  I don't enjoy it.
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  It makes me sick.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:45.240]  It makes me very upset.
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:49.240]  And it makes me want to put people like him in jail forever.
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:50.240]  Absolutely.
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:54.240]  The paradox I was getting at is, how do we expose it
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:56.240]  when we can't even show it on TV?
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:37:58.240]  But then people don't know what's happening.
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:01.240]  That that's really where I have a paradox,
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:03.240]  because I'm normally very decisive.
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:05.240]  But I don't even, if I don't want to look at something,
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:07.240]  how am I supposed to put it on TV?
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:09.240]  But at a certain point, we're going to have to.
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:11.240]  We're going to have to bring it on TV.
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:12.240]  We're going to have to bring it for the American people.
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:14.240]  And this is why I need to get in Congress,
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:15.240]  because I want to bring these people before,
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:17.240]  all of this stuff before the American people,
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:19.240]  and I want to expose it.
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:22.240]  No longer are they going to be able to hide behind race,
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.240]  or by calling somebody who's white in Congress that you're racist
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:28.240]  when you want to expose the darkness of the dark side.
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:31.240]  I'm black, and I'm not going to let you push me around.
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:33.240]  They told me that once I win my primary,
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:35.240]  that they're going to send Washington down and teach me how to walk.
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:36.240]  No, you're not.
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:37.240]  You send anybody here.
[1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:39.240]  All of them are going to go back to Washington
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:41.240]  with my foot up there.
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:43.240]  I'm not going to Washington to be one of these people.
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:45.240]  I've got to go in here and help save the American people
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:47.240]  from the evil that I see coming upon them,
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:49.240]  and we will expose it.
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:52.240]  Now, I don't need the media, the Markenburg media.
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:54.240]  I'm going to take my own media team with me to Congress,
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:56.240]  and we're going to have our own shows,
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:38:57.240]  and we will expose it.
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:38:58.240]  Trust that.
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:38:59.240]  It's beautiful.
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:01.240]  Who is your favorite member of Congress right now?
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.240]  I mean, I think MTG is great.
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:04.240]  Jim Jordan is great.
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:06.240]  Jim Jordan is great.
[1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:08.240]  Jim Jordan is wonderful.
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:10.240]  Marjorie Taylor Green is a great fighter.
[1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:13.240]  She just needs somebody that's going to help her fight.
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:16.240]  I think she's the toughest fighter that we have in Congress.
[1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:17.240]  I agree.
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:20.240]  She's fearless and has her own pro-America agenda.
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:22.240]  Yes, she does.
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.240]  She really does, and I really appreciate that.
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:26.240]  Well, I can just tell you this.
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:27.240]  Char, go ahead.
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:30.240]  I just wish we had more people that's in there fighting with her.
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:32.240]  I just wish that we had more people.
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:34.240]  And another thing that I'm going to do in Congress,
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:36.240]  and I know you was on this for a minute,
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:38.240]  but we've got to talk about this WikiLeaks
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:40.240]  and the truth behind the WikiLeaks,
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:42.240]  because what the media did is that they went over
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:45.240]  to talk about Julian Assange and the stuff being stolen.
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:46.240]  It wasn't stolen.
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:51.240]  But this is the truth behind our CIA and FBI
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:53.240]  and this corporation called America,
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:55.240]  and we're going to have to expose it.
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:56.240]  I totally agree.
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:58.240]  But at a certain point, that's civil disobedience.
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:00.240]  I'm not for stealing from innocent people,
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:03.240]  but we stole Hitler's codes in World War II to defeat him.
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:08.240]  I mean, at a certain point, whoever stole the codes
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:12.240]  or whoever broke into Hunter's iPhone and exposed pedophilia,
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.240]  I say more power to him.
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:15.240]  Exactly.
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:16.240]  They shouldn't be arrested.
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:18.240]  They shouldn't be treated like that.
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:21.240]  I mean, whatever the justice system has to do with that, deal with that.
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.240]  But at least some truth has been extracted from it.
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:26.240]  We see that this man is harming little children.
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:29.240]  We see that this man is having illegal guns,
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:32.240]  that he's doing terrible things,
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:35.240]  and he's compromised America because of his crimes
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:39.240]  and ties to China and enemies of our nation.
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:42.240]  I want to come back and talk about big picture
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.240]  and what you think should happen in the midterms and the rest of it,
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:46.240]  but let's spend a few minutes with listeners right now
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:49.240]  as I made that point coming into the segment.
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:52.240]  Folks, it doesn't matter if you live in Delaware or Florida
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:55.240]  or Washington State or Texas or Michigan,
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:56.240]  Arizona is a key battleground.
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:57.240]  Every state is important.
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:40:59.240]  We need to get this guy in.
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.240]  If you think MTG scares them,
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:03.240]  you don't need me to tell you, folks,
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.240]  that this guy in Congress would be a wrecking ball to folks.
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:10.240]  So what do we do, again, to really energize your campaign
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.240]  and make sure you win?
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:15.240]  Tell everybody in Arizona, in my Congress,
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:17.240]  Tempe, Mesa, Awatuki and Chandler,
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:20.240]  that they need to vote for me by August 2nd.
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:21.240]  That's the end of the primary.
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.240]  I need to get in. I need people to vote.
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:25.240]  I need people to donate to my campaign.
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:27.240]  I've raised least money in this campaign,
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:28.240]  but I've done more with a dollar.
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:30.240]  I have made a dollar holler.
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:33.240]  I have stretched a dollar compared to my opponent's raising
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:35.240]  to all these hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:36.240]  but I have a message,
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:38.240]  and message is very important
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:40.240]  with motivating and inspiring people,
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:42.240]  and so that's what I have done.
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:43.240]  But I need you to go there
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:45.240]  and maybe come in town and help us knock on doors,
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:47.240]  make phone calls, share my information.
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:48.240]  I call it the passing game.
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:50.240]  Even though you may not be in the state,
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:53.240]  just pass the football, pass my information,
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:55.240]  take my video and share it everywhere.
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.240]  Tell people that I'm here.
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:58.240]  Oh, listen, George Soros on the left,
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:41:59.240]  they're involved in foreign countries.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:00.240]  They're involved in every race.
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:01.240]  But conservatives go,
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:02.240]  well, that's not my state.
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  I'm not going to get involved
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:05.240]  because conservatives don't want to get in somebody's business.
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.240]  You're not getting in Arizona's business, folks,
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:09.240]  going there and helping this guy get elected.
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:11.240]  That's right.
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.240]  So, yeah, don't think that,
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:15.240]  I mean, social media has hired us all together.
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:17.240]  It's very easy to take my information
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:18.240]  and share it and get involved,
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:20.240]  because I'm going to be a representative
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:22.240]  for the whole United States,
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:24.240]  and I'm going to help fight for our freedoms.
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:25.240]  With my Internet Bill of Rights,
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:26.240]  we're going to bring these people to justice,
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:27.240]  and we will fight.
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:29.240]  I will fight for you, America.
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:30.240]  Jerome, beautiful.
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:31.240]  I got a lot of questions,
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:32.240]  but the final segment,
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:34.240]  what else do you want to hit coming up?
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:37.240]  Well, I want to talk about getting the churches involved
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:38.240]  and waking these pastors up,
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:41.240]  and I want to talk about my Internet Bill of Rights
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:42.240]  a little further
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:46.240]  and how people can look for that and expose it.
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:47.240]  Beautiful. Absolutely.
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.240]  It was the pastors that helped start the Revolutionary War.
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:52.240]  It was the pastors throughout history
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:53.240]  that confronted evil,
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:54.240]  and where are they today?
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:56.240]  Most of them are a bunch of cowards.
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:42:59.240]  At this point,
[1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:04.240]  best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all,
[1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:06.240]  and if we don't turn it around soon,
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:08.240]  then it will only get worse.
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:10.240]  But as bad as things are,
[1:43:10.240 --> 1:43:12.240]  we still have time to prepare,
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:15.240]  and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:17.240]  A gravity water filter
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:20.240]  will provide you with clean, healthy water,
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:23.240]  even in the event of your taps getting shut off,
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:25.240]  and having your own food
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:29.240]  will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:32.240]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family,
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:35.240]  you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:39.240]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming,
[1:43:39.240 --> 1:43:42.240]  but you can help them by having an abundance
[1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:45.240]  of storable foods and water filtration.
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:50.240]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  and everyone should get.
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:19.240]  And on top of it, it funds the Info War,
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:21.240]  so that's the 360 win.

[1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:28.240]  concentrated astragalus root,
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:32.240]  angelica root, loatium root, and more.
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:34.240]  This product is incredible.
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:37.240]  Infowars immune support, exclusively available
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:40.240]  at InfowarsStore.com, is funding the tip of the spear,
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:42.240]  the Infowars operation.
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:44.240]  It is a 360 win.
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:46.240]  The only way you fail is by not taking action
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:49.240]  and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:51.240]  and keep Infowars on the air.
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:53.240]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:56.240]  Take action now, InfowarsStore.com.
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:45:00.240]  So, when I first started taking survival skills,
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.240]  basically, I was 275 pounds.
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:03.240]  I was overweight.
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:05.240]  I had brain fog, like you wouldn't believe.
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  I was barely holding onto a job,
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:09.240]  and I heard Dr. Grip on your show, and I listened to it.
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:12.240]  So, the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:14.240]  the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:16.240]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew.
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:18.240]  You had, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know,
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:20.240]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:23.240]  And, man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:26.240]  to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened.
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:28.240]  You know, I could think again.
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:30.240]  I could connect with people again.
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:32.240]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:35.240]  I got my health back, and I religiously take, basically,
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:36.240]  all of your supplements.
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:38.240]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:40.240]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:42.240]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.240]  It's amazing. It works.
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:46.240]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:49.240]  We have to break free of the globalist system,
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:51.240]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:53.240]  into our own hands.
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:54.240]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:58.240]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:01.240]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas
[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:03.240]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor,
[1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:05.240]  a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:08.240]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:09.240]  You see it every year.
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:11.240]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:14.240]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:17.240]  And almost all of them just screw you over,
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:19.240]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:21.240]  because they're part of the system
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.240]  and they don't want the general public understanding this
[1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:24.240]  and knowing this.
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:27.240]  So it's a very important situation with inflation
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:29.240]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:34.240]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:35.240]  that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:37.240]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten
[1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:40.240]  great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:44.240]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:46.240]  jonestaxrelief.com.
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:51.240]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:55.240]  833-900-4285.
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:25.240]  Jerome Davidson running for Congress in Arizona is our guest
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:27.240]  and he wants to get into the Internet Bill of Rights
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:28.240]  and more here in closing.
[1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:32.240]  But I wanted to bring up the anti-KKK at Iran
[1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:36.240]  because to me the Achilles' heel of the Democrats
[1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:39.240]  is the fact that they constantly run around calling everybody
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:42.240]  racist for no reason when they are the party of slavery.
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:44.240]  They are the party of the KKK.
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:47.240]  The NRA was founded to train black folks in Northerners
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.240]  how to shoot after the Civil War.
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:52.240]  I see black leaders going, oh, the NRA is a KKK.
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:55.240]  And I just love calling them on that.
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:56.240]  And it's so exciting.
[1:47:56.240 --> 1:47:59.240]  I don't care if you're a woman, a man, black, white,
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:01.240]  you know, Asian, Hispanic, you're running for Congress
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:04.240]  and you love freedom, I'll vote for you.
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:07.240]  But at the same time, they try to make all the politics racial.
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:13.240]  I love seeing this awesome crop of badass black people
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:16.240]  running everywhere and winning and the rhetoric is just
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:17.240]  the best that's out there.
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:19.240]  The truth is out there.
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  It scares them, double, as you know,
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:24.240]  black folks voting for Trump that voted for a Republican.
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:27.240]  It's so exciting and it scares them to death
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:30.240]  because they call MTG the clan mother with no evidence
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:34.240]  when they're the ones that are up to their eyeballs in the KKK
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:36.240]  and then all the Joe Biden's history,
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:38.240]  Judge Joe Brown exposed having a meeting with him
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:40.240]  back when he was in the federal government
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:42.240]  and he was literally calling black people inwards
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:43.240]  right in front of him.
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:46.240]  I mean, these are crazy people that use race for control
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  and it's just sick, so can you speak?
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:51.240]  I mean, they'll roll the B roll over for people
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:54.240]  that just joined us to this powerful Second Amendment ad
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:57.240]  you created exposing the KKK.
[1:48:57.240 --> 1:49:01.240]  Yes, well, they're telling us that white supremacy
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:03.240]  is the greatest threat to America
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.240]  and if it's a great threat, a greatest threat,
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:09.240]  well, then my video puts them in a terrible conundrum, right?
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:12.240]  Because you should be telling black people
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:16.240]  to arm yourselves with AR-15s because of this great threat.
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:18.240]  But when they attack my ad,
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:20.240]  we can see the hoods coming on the Democrat Party
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:22.240]  because they start attacking me
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:24.240]  because they don't want me to tell black people
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:27.240]  and remind black people the history of the Democrat Party.
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:29.240]  They're the party of the KKK.
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:31.240]  When we got the right to vote,
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:33.240]  they started to send in the KKK
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:36.240]  and to threaten us and to make sure that we didn't get rights
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:38.240]  to arm ourselves with the Second Amendment.
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:40.240]  They also taught the black community
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:42.240]  to hate Brother Malcolm X
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:45.240]  and to love and embrace Martin Luther King,
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:46.240]  which is a wonderful thing,
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:48.240]  but they didn't want Malcolm X to be embraced
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:52.240]  because Malcolm X taught us the power of the Second Amendment.
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:55.240]  And I didn't realize that to later on in my adulthood
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:59.240]  that Malcolm X was a very enlightened, well-moral man
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:02.240]  compared to the morals of Martin Luther King Jr.
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:05.240]  But America deserves the right and has the right to arm themselves,
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.240]  and I think something great and terrible is coming
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:11.240]  because the IRS is trying to buy up all the weapons
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:13.240]  to make sure that we don't have a right to arm ourselves.
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:15.240]  This is ridiculous.
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:17.240]  It is ridiculous, and it just throws it right in their face.
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:19.240]  We've got to get you in Congress.
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  You wanted to get back into your Internet Bill of Rights
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240]  because that's a big deal.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:26.240]  The Internet Bill of Rights is also going to stop
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:29.240]  the social scoring.
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:31.240]  We see it already happening in China.
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:33.240]  We see it happening in Australia,
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:35.240]  and it's already beginning to happen in Canada.
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:37.240]  I mean, it's happening all around us.
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:39.240]  And once they digitize this,
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:41.240]  they're going to digitize money.
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:43.240]  This is the whole game plan.
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:45.240]  That's why what you're doing is so important, exactly.
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:47.240]  It's the whole game plan.
[1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:49.240]  The GOP is just old school, and they just sit here
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:51.240]  and wait for somebody to score on them.
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:53.240]  They only use playing defense the whole time.
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:55.240]  You never see them playing offense.
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:50:57.240]  My Internet Bill of Rights...
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:50:59.240]  Let me interrupt you because I was about to say that earlier.
[1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.240]  Your game plan is exactly what I would come up with,
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.240]  or even better.
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:05.240]  That's why I'm literally enamored.
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:07.240]  And we, to get on offense,
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.240]  instead of just waiting to lay attack,
[1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:11.240]  is Trump should be running ads like yours.
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:13.240]  Everybody should be doing what you're doing
[1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:15.240]  is over the target.
[1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:17.240]  That's what makes me so angry.
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:19.240]  I'm going to teach the GOP how to win.
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:21.240]  I'm going to teach them how to put together a game plan
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:23.240]  and to be bold and go after these demonic, evil people.
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:25.240]  Stop trying to play nice.
[1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:27.240]  Stop pretending like this is the way to love everybody,
[1:51:27.240 --> 1:51:29.240]  is to let them turn your boys into girls
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:31.240]  with a sex change without your permission.
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:33.240]  That's not loving nobody.
[1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:35.240]  These people hate you and they hate your children.
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:37.240]  They hate humanity.
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:39.240]  They don't like you.
[1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:41.240]  They hate the way you smell. They hate the way you think.
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:43.240]  They don't want your thoughts. They want to give you your thoughts.
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:45.240]  We are not going to let these people take us,
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:47.240]  take away our rights.
[1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:49.240]  And we're going to teach you how to fight
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:51.240]  and how to win against these globalists.
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:53.240]  And when we get our country back,
[1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:55.240]  I want everybody to be prepared
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.240]  to teach your children the Constitution.
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  Teach them the power of calling on the name of God
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:01.240]  in the name of Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:03.240]  We will be able to bring our country back to the table
[1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:05.240]  and to turn these TVs and stuff off.
[1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:07.240]  Man...
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:09.240]  Well, I'm on board!
[1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:11.240]  Please come on the other shows, come back on,
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:13.240]  and whether you win this primary or not,
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:15.240]  we're going to back you for office.
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:17.240]  We need to get you in there.
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:19.240]  I've seen a lot of great people.
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:21.240]  And I'm telling you, we got to get you in there.
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:23.240]  Man, amazing.
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:25.240]  We've got about two minutes left.
[1:52:25.240 --> 1:52:27.240]  What else would you like to add, sir?
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:29.240]  Alex Jones, sir, I pray for you
[1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:34.120]  of God. I know people say they have flaws and stuff, but like I said, we're President
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:38.280]  Donald Trump. I believe the hand of God was on President Donald Trump to save this money,
[1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:43.600]  this country and to spare us from the evil, which was Hillary Clinton. She was a witch.
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:47.440]  She was demonic and the evils that and atrocities that we see come out upon us, inflation and
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:51.200]  food shortages and all, all the stuff that's happening. It would have been worse. It would
[1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:54.920]  have been 10 times worse if she had gotten in there. And President Donald Trump has got
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:58.440]  to wake up and learn how to fight with me. I haven't heard from him. I just met with
[1:52:58.440 --> 1:53:02.360]  me, a General Michael Flynn. He's excited about my ad. He couldn't stop talking about
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:06.240]  my ad. He really, he really enjoyed it. Well, hey, listen, you're general, man. We got to
[1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:10.120]  put some people together and teach people how to fight and stop all this bowing down
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:15.520]  in front of folks. We're not bowing down in front of nobody but God. Amen to that. All
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:20.040]  right. Everybody needs to mark it down and share it. And if you live in Arizona, particularly
[1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:25.360]  or nearby, you need to get there and knock on doors with your own for Congress.com. He
[1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:30.360]  is running for Congress right now. You want to take action? Folks, this is how you do
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:36.000]  it. Jerome Davidson, thank you so much, sir. And God bless you. Thank you so much, Alex
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:41.200]  Jones. Wow. The best part of my job is getting me. People like that. There's gonna be more
[1:53:41.200 --> 1:53:48.680]  and more of them and the enemy is scared because God let it on my heart many years ago that
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:55.200]  my job is to find the leaders and my job is to build a platform to boost them. And we've
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:54:00.000]  done that a lot and we have changed Joe Rogan's mind and Tucker Carlson's mind and they've
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:06.840]  told me I helped wake him up. My bragging is just true, but it's only you, the listeners
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:13.320]  boosting us and getting behind us that has allowed all this happen. So when I tell you,
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:19.080]  I want you to listen to me very carefully right now. I want this to burn into your brain.
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:24.160]  I mean, just bam, let's get it in there. Let's get it in there right now. Let's get in there
[1:54:24.160 --> 1:54:32.680]  hard. If you hadn't backed us and you hadn't supported us, despite all my problems, I'm
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:41.200]  not perfect. I don't claim I'm the golden calf here. If you hadn't backed us so hard,
[1:54:41.200 --> 1:54:46.080]  worldwide we'd be in way bigger trouble. And that's what freaks me out is I can look at
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:50.360]  what we've done together and I wanted to burn into your head. You did it. I know you're
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:56.320]  not looking for credit. You just want these evil people off our back like I do as well,
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:02.640]  but you need to get the credit because when you get the credit, you realize that you're
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:06.640]  the only thing standing between the new world order and our children. And I want you to
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:14.000]  get that in your mind right now. The listeners of this broadcast is who they hate. They hate
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:20.440]  me because of you because we came together. They hate us. They want to destroy us. Like
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:25.040]  he said, they hate how we look. They hate us having a good time. They hate our children.
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:33.600]  They hate the way we smell. That's so real what he said. They can't stand us. And I'm
[1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:38.800]  in the fight of my life. I'm in the 12th round with these people right now. And when I tell
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.960]  you that we need your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support, listen,
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:47.560]  it's God's goal that we've gone this far and I'm going to get taken off the field. That's
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:55.400]  the way it is. Just like Mr. Davidson just said, but I don't want to give up and I don't
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:56:00.040]  think my fight is done. In fact, I see us more effective and more powerful than we've
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:05.560]  ever been together. So I need you to go to infowarstore.com and get a book, get a film,
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:10.520]  get a t-shirt. I need you to go there. I mean, I'll just tell you this. We've sold in the
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:18.640]  last year 60,000 in games, a film I made in 2007 and all of it came true. And then I get
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:24.280]  Dinesh D'Souza's film, 20,000 of them, which is incredibly powerful, improves election
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:28.680]  fraud and is changing laws everywhere. And we've only sold half of them. And I'm not
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:32.560]  bitch of the audience. I just, I don't know how to explain this. Like, you know, you need
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:37.600]  to get 2000 mules and have the DVD so you have a copy. They can't censor to show people.
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:42.400]  You need to go to infowarstore.com and get it. We got discounts for in-game and Copeland
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:48.280]  part three with it. I mean, you need that regardless. And you need to go to infowarstore.com and
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:54.680]  get X2 and get Vaso beats and get ultra 12. I mean, they'll all change your life and they
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:59.400]  find their operation. They're incredible. And I'll tell you, I don't know what's special
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:02.760]  right after this because this is all the products we've got left in stock. And after
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:06.720]  that's gone, if the other products don't come in, I'll be up here at donation base soon.
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:09.680]  And I don't think we can make it at that, but it's all up to God at this point. I think
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:12.960]  people that have been big donors without you would be off the air at this point. But I'm
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:18.920]  asking you to, to, to not play games and to go to infowarstore.com, especially those that
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:21.880]  have been on the fence and have never bought anything. So many other great people have
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:25.600]  kept us on air. It's time for people that have been on the fence to go to infowarstore.com.
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:28.960]  And I don't know when we're going to end the July 4 special, a bunch of stuff's about to
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:35.920]  sell out every major product we got on stock, 40 to 75% off, double patriot points infowarstore.com
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:40.120]  and a swarable food is ready to ship right now. Prepare to day.com. Prepare to day.com.

[1:57:56.800 --> 1:58:03.760]  double patriot points and 40 to 75% off. All items are at least 40% off and some of our
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:10.360]  best sellers are 75% off. This is the biggest sale yet of the year. Some of these products
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:13.920]  were selling at below cost. You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:18.360]  to continue to stay on the air. So please take action to declare independence from the
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:22.680]  new world order by keeping the tip of the spear on air and getting great products at
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:29.400]  infowarstore.com. I want to thank you all this July 4 for your continued fight for America
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:32.800]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:41.240]  winning infowarstore.com and celebrate July 4 1776 part two against the new world order
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:50.280]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776. The globalists are making their move. They're great reset

[1:59:46.200 --> 2:00:00.000]  mules. If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance. Hello Americans I'm
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:06.040]  Paul Harvey. If I were the devil. If I were the prince of darkness I'd want to engulf the
[2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:11.040]  whole world in darkness and I'd have a third of its real estate and forfeits of its population
[2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:18.000]  but I wouldn't be happy until I have seized the ripest apple on the tree. So I set about
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:22.600]  however necessary to take over the United States. President Kennedy has been seriously
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:27.800]  wounded by the students. I'd support the churches first. I'd begin with a campaign of whispers
[2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:32.320]  with the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to you. Do as you please.
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:36.680]  To the young I would whisper that there was a myth. I would convince them that man created
[2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:41.680]  God instead of the other way around. It could find that what's bad is good and what's good
[2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:48.760]  is square. And the old I would teach ray after me. Our father which art in Washington. And
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:53.240]  then I'd get organized. I'd educate authors in how to make the lurid literature exciting
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:57.440]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting. I'd threaten TV with dirtier
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:02.480]  movies and vice versa. I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could. I'd sell alcohol to ladies
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:08.720]  and gentlemen of distinction. I'd tranquilize the rest with pills. If I were the devil I'd
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.720]  soon have families at war with themselves. Churches at war with themselves and nations
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:20.640]  at war with themselves until each in its turn was consumed. And with promises of higher ratings
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:27.520]  I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame. The president of the United States is racist.
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:31.600]  If I were the devil I would encourage schools to refine young intellects but neglect the
[2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:37.000]  discipline emotions just let those run wild. Within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:41.960]  I'd have judges promoting pornography. Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:46.560]  from the schoolhouse and then from the houses of Congress. And in his own churches I would
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:53.200]  substitute psychology for religion. I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys
[2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:58.720]  and girls and church money. If I were the devil I'd take from those who have and give
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:05.160]  to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious. I would caution
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:09.360]  against extremes. I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:15.560]  a game. In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:21.720]  is old fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be and
[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:28.080]  thus I could undress you in public and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:32.640]  there is no cure. In other words, if I were the devil I'd just keep right on doing what
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:52.600]  he's doing.
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:03:00.400]  Now you know the rest of the story. Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:04.400]  Jones. I am now completely banned. Now what about wars, of course, is that web show and
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:08.720]  website led by Rachel Hollick, Alex Jones? I want them shut down, I want them silenced,
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:12.720]  I want them muted, I think they are horrible for our society. These people aren't terrifying
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:17.440]  or anything. But there's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:21.120]  and saying can you ban this person? These are very extreme individuals and no matter
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:25.960]  what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided to get rid
[2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:30.400]  of them. Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook is saying.
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:34.520]  Those individuals include people like right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Organizations
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:41.240]  like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other info wars pages
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:46.960]  had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram.
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:51.120]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them. It's not that hard to figure
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:54.880]  out. Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:04:00.080]  No, because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives. You know, the really
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.160]  dangerous ones. The dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:08.640]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by Info Wars Millie
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:13.440]  Weaver, social media's hall monitor. Frank Stelter was not very happy about it. He is
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:17.520]  promoting the same alternative universe as Info Wars. Back to your point though about
[2:04:17.520 --> 2:04:22.160]  the Info Wars presidency. I want to know and I tweeted this on the day, what is the difference
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:28.200]  at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and infowars.com? Info Wars content is useful
[2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:33.240]  to him. Info Wars personalities align with them. I want them shut down. I want them
[2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:37.360]  silent. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society. I want them shut
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:43.280]  down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. Don't worry, these people aren't terrifying
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:58.280]  or anything. Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.

[2:06:25.320 --> 2:06:39.880]  Hi. We're going to open the phones up on the Worldwide Rebellions Against Charity and
[2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:44.200]  where you think that's going and the fact that The New York Times is calling for Joe
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:50.520]  Biden to basically step down. They're calling for Joe to step down. All these different
[2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:55.200]  globalist puppets are being removed now. The collapse is in full swing. I want to talk
[2:06:55.200 --> 2:07:00.120]  about that and I want to talk. I want to hear from you on the subject of Hunter Biden's
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:07.320]  phone hacked and released, confirmed to be his, pedophilia, crackhead behavior, illegal
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:13.800]  guns, everything else you can imagine. This is over the top. Huge subject, the Worldwide
[2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:17.280]  Rebellion Against the Great Reset and your take on that where you think it's going. That's
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:23.000]  a gigantic subject area and Hunter Biden's laptop. They said what real that was and now
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:27.240]  they don't even try to deny the phone, which shows they just lost their power to lie. They
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:32.440]  are disintegrating, but what comes out of that? Because if you don't remove the globalist,
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:35.560]  the corporate leaders that are running all this, we'll just destroy our governments,
[2:07:35.560 --> 2:07:40.240]  destroy each other as we wake up. We've got to not destroy our infrastructure. We've got
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:46.720]  to stop them that are attacking our infrastructure. That's so paramount. But we are winning. Hunter
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:51.400]  Biden leaks. Rock establishment is globalist scramble to regain control of the Great Reset
[2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:57.200]  and their design collapse. The toll free number to join us. We've been doing a really
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:01.000]  good job lately. Taking a lot of your calls. Bam, bam, bam. We'll give each caller about
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:08.800]  a minute. 877-789-2539. First time callers. First time callers only. Give them a chance
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:20.960]  to get involved. 877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex. We're taking your calls today. You know,
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:29.080]  I see Comedian Ben Stein that took the COVID Pfizer shot and almost died from it. And now
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:33.600]  I see him out talking about crime and how they let people commit crime. And he doesn't
[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:37.200]  know why they're doing it. Well, it's to destroy infrastructure and destroy confidence, but
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:40.440]  the country collapse. It's why you get rid of the border. It's why you ship in fentanyl.
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:44.400]  It's why you defund the police. And then once they're done collapsing everything, they're
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:51.080]  going to bring the police back. But it'll be like the police in Europe, total thugs.
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:56.480]  I mean, the footage that's come out. We played it last hour. Or first hour, actually. An
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:03.640]  hour and a half ago, two hours ago. And pulling up in vans, posing as protesters, attacking
[2:09:03.640 --> 2:09:08.040]  people so the police could then attack the general crowds, including children. This
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:15.840]  is evil. But we're going to go here. We got a break to a couple of these Ben Stein clips
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:19.920]  that are so incredibly important because he and others are finally waking up and finally
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:28.040]  getting it. But is it a day late? Is it a dollar short? So the last three minutes of
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:33.880]  this segment, we're going to play those. And then we're going to take your phone calls
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:39.640]  as well. Then I've got a whole list of new videos of leftist celebrating the murder of
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:46.600]  children and saying it's a satanic ritual. We've got a lot of election news and then
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:54.000]  I've got some really insane news that I'm going to hit when we start the next segment,
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:10:02.680]  how they shell us absolute oxymoronic garbage. And you ask, why do they do that when it discredits
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:09.160]  them? Well, there's a behavioral psychology plan. And if you're not aware of the plan
[2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:21.280]  and how it's affecting your cerebral cortex, they win. If you're not aware, you lose. Interjust
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:29.280]  a few of the headlines today that deal with this. Science has consistently underestimated
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:40.640]  women because scientists are sexist. And it goes on to say women are as strong as men.
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:50.640]  And men can have babies too. No, women are not as strong as men. And that ties in. All
[2:10:50.640 --> 2:11:00.520]  these other headlines that we're going to be going to here today. That's the start of
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:04.240]  the next segment. And then your phone calls for the balance of the hour, maybe a little
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:13.080]  bit in the next hour. Gerald Salente is taking over. But I want to just say this again. Listeners
[2:11:13.080 --> 2:11:18.480]  and viewers of this broadcast are in the arena and have changed the whole world. That's not
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:24.600]  happening. Pat me on the back. It's real. So you've invested in this operation and taken
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:30.200]  us through storms and attacks that are unprecedented. I'm simply asking you to protect your investment
[2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:33.520]  and to spread a word about the broadcast and to pray for the broadcast more than you've
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:40.560]  ever done before and to buy products at m4chore.com. Get 2,000 meals by the next decision. Get
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:45.120]  Vaso Beach for your heart and your body. Get ultimate fish oil and krill oil, the highest
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:50.680]  grade there is out there. It's incredible. Get X2. That is the missing link in so many
[2:11:50.680 --> 2:11:58.440]  people's lives for stamina, libido energy. I mean, I am libido. I stronger than I was
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:08.480]  when I was 15, 16, 18. That's X2. It's all available. 40 to 75% off at m4chore.com. And
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:12.760]  we're supposed to end this July 4th sale yesterday, but I'm so sold out of almost all the other
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:16.320]  sales. I don't even have another sale. So we'll probably do this a couple more days
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:25.040]  and then that's it. m4chore.com for the high quality, tooth whitening toothpaste, the activated
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:30.480]  charcoal toothpaste, the essential oil, mouthwash. It's bar none the best out there. It's
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:37.440]  all there. m4chore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. All
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:41.920]  right. We're going to come back to this absurdity of the brainwashing in your face and in your
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:49.080]  phone calls on the other side at 877-789-2539. But here are a couple clips of Ben Stein
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:53.840]  from his house in Los Angeles finally waking up to the fact that the social contract's
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:13:01.160]  been broken. We'll be right back. After World War II, the United States of America was by
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:08.320]  far the most powerful, richest country in the world. We had everything going for us.
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:13.240]  We had more money than any other country. We were more productive than any other country.
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:19.600]  We had a more powerful armed force than any other country. And we were just seemingly
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:25.120]  never going to stop. What stopped us? What slowed us down? Telling people, you don't
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:29.440]  have to work. You don't have to study. You don't have to pay attention. You don't have
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:35.320]  to respect your elders. You don't have to respect your juniors. We just let this country
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:41.280]  fall apart. We just took it and we let it fall apart. We took all the people who wanted
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:46.600]  to hate America. We should go ahead and hate. We're not going to prosecute you if you commit
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:52.480]  crimes. We're not going to make you do schoolwork. And so little by little and then faster and
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:14:00.440]  faster, we started to fall apart. This has got to stop. This country is the best thing
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:06.680]  that has ever happened to the human race. We can't let it go. We cannot let it go in
[2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:12.400]  order to please people who hate America. There is a large network of people out there who
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:20.200]  hate America. Let's not give in to them. Let's insist that people work, study, follow the
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:25.880]  law, and let's not have the criminal get out of jail before the victim gets out of the
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:34.400]  hospital. Let's pay attention to what is right and do it.
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:41.240]  I am talking to you right now on the three days after Christmas in the lobby of the Beverly
[2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:46.680]  Hills Hotel, one of the most beautiful hotels in the world as far as I'm aware. And I want
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:54.320]  to talk about crime. When I moved here in 1976, this was a very safe city. And Beverly
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:59.640]  Hills was one of the safest places in that city. In fact, I think for a large city, it
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:06.840]  was probably the safest city in the United States of America. And that's changed dramatically.
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:12.920]  And here's what's going on. For some reason, which would take a lot of explaining, but
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:19.080]  it could be explained, the government decides to basically stop punishing black people who
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:26.160]  commit crimes. And black people can commit crimes and not be prosecuted for it. Yes,
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:32.320]  they're embarrassed, at least to a small extent. And yes, their parents are mad at them, but
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:40.080]  they do not get away with anything less than murder. And this is a shocking thing. This
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:45.080]  is a very bad thing. So we have gone to a city where people are happy. They go around
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:51.520]  with their doors unlocked to fear. And we have become a city of fear. And that is an
[2:15:51.520 --> 2:15:57.160]  extremely bad place to be.
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:03.880]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all. And if we
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:10.080]  don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse. But as bad as things are, we still
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:16.680]  have time to prepare. And that alone is something to be grateful for. A gravity water filter
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:22.080]  will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:27.440]  off. And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:33.080]  camps. And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:39.240]  stocking up for your neighbors. Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:46.000]  going, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.

[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:03.040]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:08.600]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities. And why is this the case? Because
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:13.760]  we innately, by God, have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psychies, our own
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:20.760]  souls. And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:25.880]  sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things that we try to bring into
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:31.720]  our bodies to change who we are, are only lowering us. They're only making us more
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:36.120]  depressed. In the end, they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:40.400]  ourselves and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:44.400]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:49.760]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:54.160]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:18:00.520]  in at mforestore.com. A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands

[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:23.800]  with level food shortages. I told you over two years ago, the globalist were going to
[2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:28.600]  have massive inflation and food shortages and it's happened just like clockwork. And
[2:18:28.600 --> 2:18:32.600]  I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse. They have designed this. The way to
[2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:38.520]  beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued. We're ready to ship
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:44.040]  to you right now at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food, hundreds of the highest

[2:18:54.880 --> 2:19:04.480]  you there. Take action. I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force
[2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:10.640]  is amazing. It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.320]  fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:20.000]  is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. Crill oils is
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:24.080]  the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry. You want something like this,
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:28.120]  you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. It might be.
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:31.760]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five capillettes
[2:19:31.760 --> 2:19:38.040]  of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night. So your brain is
[2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:46.160]  made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit off of it, but
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:49.760]  you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:56.760]  you. I just can't do it.
[2:19:56.760 --> 2:20:21.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:21.760 --> 2:20:36.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, the Hunter laptop was totally confirmed to be real and
[2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:40.920]  showed pedophilia drug dealing. But even more importantly, that he was a Chinese slash Russian
[2:20:40.920 --> 2:20:47.440]  Ukrainian operative for his father taking payments. Now, as of yesterday, it was leaked
[2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:53.960]  on 4chan his phone, thousands of videos, text messages, emails, even worse than the first
[2:20:53.960 --> 2:20:59.800]  data drop. This is a seismic moment and the pedophilia is horrible and it's important.
[2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:03.720]  But that's how they blackmail them and control them. The issue that most people aren't focusing
[2:21:03.720 --> 2:21:11.000]  on is the fact that it confirms that he was an agent of communist China and Chinese intelligence.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:16.360]  Biden should be removed today, but they won't do that. They'll assassinate him or say he
[2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:21.120]  had a stroke and that's how they'll do it. That's my view. We'll see if it unfolds.
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:27.160]  Your phone calls are coming up in a moment. But first, let's hit this. Vice news owned
[2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:35.640]  by HBO. Science has made us mistakenly believe women are weaker than men. The same groups
[2:21:35.640 --> 2:21:41.960]  tell you that men can have babies. They might as well tell us that the Easter Bunny and
[2:21:41.960 --> 2:21:48.000]  the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus and Lucky Charms is real or the Kepler Elves. They have
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.960]  whole articles about this. So they let men compete in women's sports and dominate them.
[2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:58.320]  Then they say women are as strong as men. Yes, I need to explain to you that that's a lie.
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:03.400]  Where are the women in the NFL? Where are the women in the UFC fighting men? It is preposterous.
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:09.840]  No, there's men going down fighting women and winning, not women going up and fighting
[2:22:09.840 --> 2:22:16.440]  them in. But this is them brainwashing and putting out ridiculous fables and things
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:22.000]  you know isn't true. So you get used to just hearing preposterous lies. So the next outrageous
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:27.760]  lies don't seem as bad anymore. That's how they're conditioning us. Instead of us breaking
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:32.520]  with them, not believing a word they say and exposing them as criminals, they're trying
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:38.120]  to normalize lying to the general public. Science is consistently underestimating women
[2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:44.880]  because scientists are sexists. And in this economist headline from the Rothschild publication,
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:50.760]  low fertility is here to stay. We should embrace it. Not wire is our sperm count down 90%.
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:56.720]  Why is autism up? Why are women becoming sterilized? No, no, no, no. We should take the COVID shot,
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:02.800]  become sterile, drink the fluoride water, and then wonder why it happens. Low fertility
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:08.840]  clinics have women take iodine and men take it because it boosts fertility. That's who
[2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:19.000]  these people are monsters. All right. We got Landon, Mike, Skid, Julie, Jordan, Josh,
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:24.840]  Mark, Neil, Tom. We're taking all your calls right now in the order they were received.
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:29.800]  First up is a call from Seattle, Washington. Jordan, you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:35.040]  Hey, Alex, I was just, you know, giving a call in to give hope to people that anyone
[2:23:35.040 --> 2:23:39.680]  that lives in a blue area like myself in Seattle, you know, you, you leave your area and you
[2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:44.760]  go somewhere else. If I just travel an hour and go east of the mountains, things are different.
[2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:48.200]  People believe in freedom and they understand the truth. And I just wanted to give hope
[2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:52.760]  to everybody that don't believe everything that's around you because you leave just a
[2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:56.720]  little bit from your own. Even when I'm in Seattle, I shake 50 hands before somebody
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:00.760]  throws coffee on me, but it's still one of the most evil cities I've been to. Formerly
[2:24:00.760 --> 2:24:05.600]  a great city, beautiful coastline, one of the amazing stuff. You're absolutely right.
[2:24:05.600 --> 2:24:09.200]  Don't believe that every place is really under the enemy's control. They're in control of
[2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:12.840]  the voting machines. That's why it seems like they're impossible to beat.
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:17.720]  No, yeah, I just wanted to give hope because I know when I'm around here, it feels like
[2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:22.000]  I'm behind enemy lines and, you know, but I can see people waking up and it's a truly
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.800]  a blessing. And I just see it all happening in real time now. And it's crazy to see, you
[2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:31.960]  know, are you seeing them wake up in Seattle or obviously I've been outside Seattle and
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:35.720]  it's incredible. People are more awake than many, many of the reddest areas, but, but
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:41.360]  I mean, are they waking up inside Seattle? Well, not, not the fentanyl zombies and all
[2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:45.600]  them, but I mean, you know, people outside of Seattle are waking up. Seattle might be
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:49.880]  doomed for a while. I could probably say that. Absolutely. Jordan, thank you for the call.
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:55.880]  Let's talk to Arizona and Josh, Josh. Hey, Alex, first time caller. I appreciate you
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:25:00.160]  taking the call, man. I just wanted to make a quick plug for something that I've noticed.
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:04.960]  I've read the Beck Book of Mormon, probably 13 times cover to cover. What I've noticed
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:10.120]  is, is in the book of Healment, it's a 16 chapter book talks about an election that
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:16.080]  was overturned and how a satanic band infiltrated the government and had their signs and their
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.360]  covenants and everything like that. I just wanted to get on air and honestly invite
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:26.440]  you to read, read it. It's 16 chapters. It's a quick read and honestly completely describes
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:30.960]  where we are right now. It talks, you know, the book of Mormon was written for our day
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:35.920]  and that's what honestly turned me on to you was reading that and then hearing what you're
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:40.760]  talking about. I'm like, Oh my God, like this stuff lines up perfectly. Well, I think I'll
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:45.720]  read it. I've told me to read it and I appreciate your call. What else is on your mind on, on
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:46.720]  Hunter Biden, Josh?
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:51.720]  Honestly, I think that we've already known this stuff and it really pisses me off. You
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:56.000]  know, I've had conversations with people and they look at me like I'm a freak because
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:00.720]  I believe all the stuff that you're, you're spitting, but you see it. You read between
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:06.480]  the lines. You can see these things happening. Our government is run by satanic pedophiles.
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:10.640]  They have their signs, their covenants and they're trying to bring about, you know, honestly,
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:15.120]  the second coming of Jesus Christ. This is, you know, we think things are bad now. It's
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:18.840]  only going to get so much more, you're right. And the devil's there to actually fulfill
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:23.200]  prophecy. We're very well said, Josh. Appreciate your call. Let's go to Neil in Tennessee.
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:24.200]  Neil, welcome.
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:32.680]  Hey, Alex. This is Neil. Been listening to you since 2008 when Obama. You there? Yes,
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:33.680]  sir.
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:39.400]  Yeah. Well, I want to talk about was where the great reset is going. And, you know, from,
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:44.040]  from my perspective, the globalists are more organized than the people of the United States
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:48.880]  or any other country for that matter. I mean, I've got the Democratic party. They got Soros.
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:54.480]  They got the WF, you know, all the organizations they got control of. They got universities
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:59.480]  and they're confusing and distracting us with ridiculous arguments about gender and eating
[2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:05.280]  bugs and drag queens and all that nonsense. So we don't focus on the real issue, which
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:07.480]  is the takeover that they're trying to try.
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:11.240]  That's right. The corporate global social credit score and the carbon tax. Absolutely.
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:17.440]  Yeah. And you can't discount how powerful their grip on people is because they got their
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:24.280]  support in this country by using the government to appeal to different constituencies that
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:31.400]  were probably in the conservative camp, but they, they appeal to all their vices and they
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:35.840]  legitimize their vices. And when you legitimize somebody's sins and then you try and take
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:43.480]  away like they just did with abortion, they scream like hell, right? So it's very powerful
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:45.200]  of the grip they have on them.
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:49.840]  And what I'm really concerned with is if we start winning, like with a guy like Jerome
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:54.040]  that you had on the program before, who really has the right idea, what he did is he turned
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:58.360]  it into a flanking strategy where you come in from the side and he changed the game by
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:02.840]  saying, oh, now we're going to make them public utilities. We got to take every issue in this
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:08.560]  country and do what that guy did with every single issue to fight back. My concern is
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:12.800]  listening to Tucker Carlson show the other night, the Chinese are working on the monkey
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:18.600]  pox in their labs. And with all that release COVID, it's absolutely insane. Great point.
[2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:24.200]  And that's the next article here. Biden has declared a new health emergency and they're
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:27.240]  getting right with lockdowns. Again, we knew that was coming. We're going to hit that when
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:33.640]  we come back on the other side. But we're also going to take calls from Tom and from
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:39.080]  Mark and for everybody else in the order your calls are received more calls straight ahead

[2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:57.480]  things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[2:30:57.480 --> 2:31:04.440]  There is nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[2:31:04.440 --> 2:31:09.160]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as word said, you're not going to find a better
[2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:13.440]  place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with
[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:18.040]  all our perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else really
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:22.840]  that does it like we do here. Thank you for that word. Infowarsstore.com by the way, products
[2:31:22.840 --> 2:31:27.160]  he mentions Infowarsstore.com is where to get them folks and we do have the best supplements.
[2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:33.240]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the
[2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:38.200]  best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula
[2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:42.920]  folks. This is this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off. By the
[2:31:42.920 --> 2:31:47.800]  way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working
[2:31:47.800 --> 2:31:55.000]  for me quite well. I might add quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:00.360]  for men. I go and see him quite often now. The eugenicist over 100 years ago were very
[2:32:00.360 --> 2:32:05.320]  public about their plans. They financed major universities. They ran full page stories and
[2:32:05.320 --> 2:32:10.360]  advertisements pushing their propaganda of the New York Times, other major newspapers,
[2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:16.120]  that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended. And the first step in that
[2:32:16.120 --> 2:32:21.000]  is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:25.240]  care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing. And I was just sitting here
[2:32:25.240 --> 2:32:29.800]  tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter, my wife makes dinner a lot
[2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:34.360]  of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast. And literally it's the funnest
[2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:39.880]  thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together
[2:32:39.880 --> 2:32:45.240]  and have the communal event. And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding,
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:51.160]  is our normal biological actions are coming together. They really are sick, evil scientific
[2:32:51.160 --> 2:33:05.240]  cult of filth and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:31.240]  Joe. I'll tell you who's looking for adventure.
[2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:43.640]  Because he thinks it's about the law. Hunter Biden's phone confirmed searching for child porn,
[2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:51.080]  putting in the search that he wanted 12 year olds.
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:34:06.040]  That's Peter Pete and his dad. That's who these people are. It's a pedophile cult.
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:15.640]  Who else would carry out Satan's operations? Who else would do things like this?
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:24.920]  Biden administration to extend the COVID public health emergency using monkeypox and other
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:30.680]  reasons, national parks, Democrat city demanding mask again, they're bringing it all back, ladies
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:37.880]  and gentlemen. That's why I said keep fighting, keep exposing the fraud of COVID because they're
[2:34:37.880 --> 2:34:44.680]  coming right back. Opposition builds, the science comes out, all the experts oppose them, boom,
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.320]  they shut down. As soon as you go back to sleep, they attack again. It's basic tactics. You know
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:53.560]  that. I know that. Here we are. Tom in California, go ahead, Tom.
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:35:01.720]  Tom. Yo, Alex. Yes, sir. And listen, it says 2016. Well, they, them trails gotta go.
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:09.000]  And I saw some on band on video about a month ago of somebody talking about the Rhode Island
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  Clean Air Act. And it wasn't any of you. It was an outside source you brought in.
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:21.160]  And whoever wrote the bill in Rhode Island really knew what they were talking about.
[2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:26.120]  They got into all the technical video has hundreds and hundreds of contributors.
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:32.120]  Not just info wars. You know, it's, it's awesome. Yeah. Well, that's gotta be in every state. Every
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:39.080]  state needs a bill like that. And can somebody dig it up there and bring it out? Maybe Greg Rees.
[2:35:39.880 --> 2:35:43.960]  Yeah. What was the name of the video? Do you remember? Okay. It was the Rhode Island Clean
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:48.760]  Air Act. So we should go to band on video and type in Rhode Island Clean Air Act. Go to band
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:55.240]  on video. Rhode Island Clean Air. There it is. Crew found it so fast. 56,000 views. Rhode Island
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:01.960]  infiltrated by communism. Is that the state needs a bill like that in their legislature?
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:07.000]  Was it a John Bowne reporter? They find something else. I don't know. It was somebody,
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:12.920]  it was somebody else. I don't know who it was. I couldn't find it again. But whoever wrote the bill
[2:36:12.920 --> 2:36:19.480]  got into all the technical aspects of the planes and what I don't know if they got into what they
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:25.320]  were shooting out of the back, but they got into how they did it. And the bill is very thorough.
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:30.600]  And I just think every state, a congressman from every state needs to bring this state.
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:36.440]  That's right. It's being sprayed on us. And we all have standing to be involved in lawsuits.
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:40.200]  There it is. Build a band, Kim Trails, Rhode Island, shocking takedown
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:45.880]  of geoengineering and 5G towers. Maybe that's it. Every state needs it. It's a great blueprint,
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:50.520]  that bill. And I don't know. There should be a real environmental group out there,
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:55.480]  not the ones they hijacked that picks this act up and tries to get into every group.
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:36:58.760]  No, I hear you, Tom. We need to do it. That's why we have Band-Aid video to get stuff out
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:02.440]  that they don't want you to see. That's why it's so precious, folks. Share it to your whole email list,
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:07.000]  your whole text message. Just keep hammering Band-Aid video. All right. Up next, let's go ahead
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.080]  and talk to Mike in Indiana and then Landon. Mike, we're on the air.
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:17.240]  Hey, Alex, you are awesome, man. But listen to you since 2008, 2009. Take some of your products.
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:20.680]  And we love you. We'll keep praying for you. Thanks for having me on. I'm up in South Bend,
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:27.240]  Indiana, the home of, gosh, the irony that both Amy Coney Barrett and Pete Buttigieg came out of
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:34.680]  South Bend is crazy. It's a liberal Democrat hub, but we love Amy Barrett. And you've been having
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:38.040]  great guests. So one thing I wanted to thank you is for having some of the Catholic guests of the
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:43.720]  Catholic. I appreciate respect and including Leo Zagami and the founder of Lifesite News,
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:47.800]  awesome information. And they're right on as far as the infiltration of the Catholic Church
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:52.760]  as evidenced by how liberal Notre Dame is as a supposed Catholic university here in South Bend.
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:59.320]  But anyway, and also your guest today, Pete Buttigieg, the part Jerome Davis, and I'm going
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:05.000]  to send him some money myself even though I'm in Indiana. Everybody needs, we all need people like
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:11.880]  him. So one other point, Alex, I told your guy I wanted to mention as an idea for people is groups
[2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:18.040]  as a business guy here. I'm in Rotary. I'm in local HR groups and stuff. And what I've noticed
[2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:22.200]  over the years, these national and international organizations like Rotary International,
[2:38:22.200 --> 2:38:28.680]  even the SHIRM, the HR, national and international groups, they feed these agendas from national
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:32.600]  down to local cities and towns. Oh, yeah. Gen 21 is about taking over the local government
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:37.800]  and the local business people. Yep. And so people, if you're in a Rotary chapter or in
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:41.080]  one of these other groups, people need to be more vocal and just start challenging what they're
[2:38:41.080 --> 2:38:46.520]  being fed. Beautifully said, Mike. Thanks for the call. Landon and Arkansas, thank you for calling.
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:51.480]  Go ahead, Landon. Yes, Mr. Jones. Thank you for having me on. I just wanted to say on here that
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:56.840]  my mother and my grandmother came over to my apartment last night and they are militant,
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:39:01.800]  leftist or were. And we got into a conversation about kind of what was going on and everything.
[2:39:01.800 --> 2:39:06.360]  And we sat there for two hours and I was able to show them your videos, your reports, Gregory's
[2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:11.960]  reports. He does a fantastic job. He does. And they got red-pilled and they just said that they're
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:18.200]  going to start listening, tuning in, watching. So maybe they'll wake up. It's so easy because we
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:23.800]  have the truth. Our guests have the truth and it's right there. And once people learn to actually
[2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:28.440]  hear the alternative, almost always they wake up if you can just get them to do it. So great job
[2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:35.400]  doing that, Landon. Absolutely. And also, I'd like to say that I wear a Bill Gates for prison t-shirt
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:39.800]  and everywhere I wear it everywhere out in around town. And I haven't got one negative response yet.
[2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:45.400]  People come up to me, give me knuckles, say, Yeah, we agree. We agree. And when we get to talking
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:48.760]  about you and I told them about Band-Aid video and a lot of them are already listeners.
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:56.520]  Brother, you are an emissary. You are an ambassador. You are a, I mean, I guess you could use the
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:03.800]  Christian example of people going out as missionaries. You're changing the world. But yeah,
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:08.280]  wearing an info or shirt, wearing an arrest Bill Gates shirt, it lets you know how popular
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:14.920]  freedom is. It's an adventure, isn't it? Yes, it is. Absolutely. And I want to say on here as well
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:21.640]  that I was just recently baptized on 23 years old, served in the Marine Corps. And I tell you what,
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:25.560]  it felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. I hope the power of God.
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:29.160]  Isn't it real? It's 100% real, brother. So glad to hear that. Yes, there it is.
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:31.640]  God bless you and keep up the good fight. We're going to win this.
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:33.800]  We're going to win it, brother. I love you. Appreciate you.
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:37.320]  Mark in Alabama. Last caller of this segment, the more calls coming up. Mark, go ahead.
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:46.520]  Hello, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. New Christian here. God's plan has made a lot of
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:52.760]  changes in my life, such as my move to Alabama, which has put me in a much better place.
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:56.600]  And the last caller just had that experience. We're seeing a real revival, not of the corrupt
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:03.880]  church, but the Holy Spirit doing it. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And I really want to thank you and your
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:12.200]  show. And I have to tell you that X2, I take it religiously. And I never used to dream. Now I
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:20.040]  dream constantly. And I mean, they wake me up. They're so hard. And exactly, brother. Again,
[2:41:20.040 --> 2:41:25.000]  wearing an info or church and adventure, taking X2 is an adventure. Nothing we promote as a fraud.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.840]  I would rather be tortured to death than lie to you. It will change your life. X2.
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:39.160]  Yes, sir. And so, you know, this whole, this new world order process, it's an attack. So,
[2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:44.520]  I was just thinking about George Bush's speech where he talked about a thousand points of light.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:48.920]  I think he really meant to say, we have a thousand points of attack coming at you,
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:53.480]  because they are coming. They are hitting us in every single direction. And, you know,
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:59.240]  when you have little tiny attacks, people have a hard time looking at a big picture.
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:02.120]  And so, what you're saying is pure genius. We listen to the globalists. They say, oh,
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:06.520]  our plan is many different plans together. They hit you from hundreds of sides
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:10.200]  so that you get overwhelmed exactly. But the key is they're behind it. They're doing it.
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:18.120]  That's right. And so, as far as you, I have your stickers on my truck, on both my motorcycles,
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:25.000]  on my car. I constantly get people comments, you know, thumbs up. Almost never do I get
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:29.960]  anything other than that. I leave your stickers everywhere I go.
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:36.040]  Beautiful. God bless you, Mark. We love you. Yeah, folks. We need funds now more than ever.
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:40.200]  And our work is more important now than ever. Our work, you, the listeners, us as a family,
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:45.400]  every order gets bumper stickers. Experience it. Wear a t-shirt. Now, you might get stabbed to death
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:49.240]  in the lap hysteria, but that's very rare. But it's dangerous. It's an adventure.
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:54.040]  infowarstore.com. And Alan Jones' right shirt. We have the designer's shirt and the regular shirt
[2:42:54.040 --> 2:43:16.280]  and their fundraiser shirts, infowarstore.com.

[2:47:04.040 --> 2:47:15.560]  So Biden stole the election so Obama would have his third term
[2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:24.200]  and all blew up in their face and just two years ago they were able to suppress the laptop
[2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:29.720]  say it wasn't real but now a day later they came to die the phone their power is waning
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:35.960]  our power is rising but they are going to double down and it's going to be very dangerous
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:39.320]  this is the message I wanted to bring to you at the very start of the show and I forgot to do it
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:43.560]  I'm going to say it right now go back to your calls we don't want to be violent
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:50.360]  that we have every right to be we don't want to be terroristic we don't want to act like the left
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:55.320]  we want to get out of their way while they collapse and destroy themselves they want us
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:48:00.360]  to be weak because they're weak they want us to be ugly because they're ugly they hate us because
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:06.200]  they hate themselves we love ourselves and we love each other so I'm gonna say it again
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:14.520]  we need to be as wise as serpents and peaceful as doves or as Teddy Roosevelt said walk solid
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:20.120]  and carry a big stick we need to not be violent and I know you're not being violent they're gonna
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:23.640]  stage stuff and blame it on us they've already been doing it told you it was coming it's here
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:30.120]  you don't need me to tell you that you can see it I believe it doesn't mean it's gonna happen but
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:34.680]  we're right about 95 percent of the time I mean here's the example the media edited out out of
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:42.600]  context I said three or four days like on July 1st on that Friday I said hey I've heard from
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:49.720]  high level sources Roger Stone to talk to Trump MTG all of them Trump said I'm gonna run in July
[2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:54.520]  his plane's done repainted American flag on it I mean I didn't just talk to them I talked to four
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.640]  people that talked to Trump they said yeah he's gonna announce in July as early as Monday and I
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:04.280]  said hey he's gonna announce as early as Monday he may not but he's running that's what I was told
[2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:10.040]  these are real people that talk to him he didn't do it and I hope we can expose this whole thing
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:14.120]  doesn't happen I hope we expose their plan to assassinate Biden it doesn't happen now did I
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:20.040]  get told that by Roger Stone no I can look at their moves and what would help them get rid of
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:26.040]  this liability and blame it all on him but also make criticizing his agenda bad and that's what
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:30.040]  they'll do you don't need me to tell you that obviously you're like yeah try to kill Joe Biden
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:37.720]  but it's my mother a year and a half ago and she's never liked this grab my arm we were over
[2:49:37.720 --> 2:49:41.160]  there at a family dinner she said listen to me they're setting Biden up they're gonna kill him
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:45.560]  Adri gets the blame probably before the midterms I'm like okay man prime yeah it makes sense
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:48.280]  and I'm just telling you now
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:55.400]  that they can launch a terror attack on the Bidens when they're in you know
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:49:59.240]  off in their state or whatever in Delaware
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:06.280]  we are not behind that we don't support that we're on record saying that that's all I'm getting at
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:12.040]  let's go to Julie in California Julie thanks for calling thanks for holding go ahead hey Alex how
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:17.960]  are you um yeah on the whole Biden thing all right I've got an idea on how they're going to do this
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:23.160]  first off this has been like a drip drip drip drip drip drip with all these different things coming
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:29.800]  out about what Hunter does the corruption with his brother everything okay um they got to get rid
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:36.120]  of Kamala first she she's worse than than Biden is mentally I mean the woman can't even put a paragraph
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:40.760]  together without repeating seven different word or seven word put two total idiots in on purpose
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:46.440]  yeah so they've got to get rid of her first she'll go out with some kind of major health thing which
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:52.600]  is going to force her to resign now who do they put in for the VP well who've they've been talking
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:59.160]  about for the last three weeks Gavin Newsom that's right they're definitely getting Gavin Newsom ready
[2:50:59.160 --> 2:51:07.080]  who is Pelosi's family yep so they put him in as VP then after they get shellacked in November
[2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:14.120]  with the midterms I'd say probably after the first of the year however they get rid of Biden
[2:51:15.800 --> 2:51:19.400]  that's going to be on there I think that they'll just get him to resign
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:26.440]  because I'll say he's had a stroke or something yeah but see I agree with you that's the smart move
[2:51:26.440 --> 2:51:30.840]  I was then but they want to make him a victim so they can assassinate him and blame us that's even
[2:51:30.840 --> 2:51:37.480]  better yeah but you know what he's I think people look at it I don't think people view him very
[2:51:37.480 --> 2:51:43.560]  favorably anyway so yeah they probably carry the assassin around on their shoulders yeah I just don't
[2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:47.640]  think though I think they'll just get him out of the way one way or the other whether it failed
[2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:53.320]  they'll face the dementia or whatnot I mean I'm an ER trauma nurse so I mean I see a lot of stuff
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:59.720]  and this man has been has been addled from day one my grandmother died at 92 and she was more
[2:51:59.720 --> 2:52:03.800]  cogent than them and she was she was she had dementia God bless you incredible Julie thanks
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:09.960]  for calling amazing calls they're always amazing uh Joanne in Arizona Joanne welcome
[2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:17.960]  hi thanks for taking my call um I just want to say first of all I'm a huge fan of Jerome's I
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:23.560]  actually got to meet him at two events prior to even knowing that he was one running in my district
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:28.680]  I am from Arizona and by the way they interrupt you I don't bring this up because they're black
[2:52:28.680 --> 2:52:34.280]  because I don't care what color they are but Royce white and uh Jerome I mean they just
[2:52:34.280 --> 2:52:38.520]  don't have to be black black guys but they are badass I mean I love whether they were brown or
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:44.440]  white or whatever that is a badass crop of leaders man well spoken smart strong on target I mean that
[2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:50.920]  is leadership I'm just very excited absolutely I mean he's really going to represent us well
[2:52:51.640 --> 2:52:56.200]  and like I said I mean I met him twice before I even knew he was running in our district
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:01.240]  oh I can tell you I got a gut level also I mean all I get is good feelings off him don't you
[2:53:02.120 --> 2:53:07.960]  yeah absolutely I gave one of my friends a flyer that I couldn't go to she went to it and then
[2:53:07.960 --> 2:53:13.080]  told me about another event that he was having I went to that and I started helping out with
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:20.040]  any way that I can hanging up you know posters and banners and anything that I could do for him and
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:25.880]  and like I said I haven't regretted it one bit he he definitely speaks our language
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:30.520]  he's he's definitely speaking the truth which is why they're censoring him they don't want
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:36.600]  oh they're scared they're scared absolutely but one of the things you know I've I've been posting
[2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:41.160]  and just you know trying to get people informed I was saying why you wouldn't buy a car with that
[2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:46.120]  test driving it right you wouldn't marry somebody without dating them or at least you shouldn't
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:49.800]  but why would you vote for a candidate without getting to know them I mean there are so many
[2:53:49.800 --> 2:53:55.480]  meet and greet we should all get to know these people I totally agree with you thank you all
[2:53:55.480 --> 2:54:00.600]  right let's take another caller here let's talk to skid in Missouri skid thanks for calling
[2:54:02.200 --> 2:54:09.800]  hey Alex uh just want to respond to your Hunter Biden phone question yes sir it's nothing we
[2:54:09.800 --> 2:54:15.240]  haven't seen before so what are we going to do about it no I agree but before they said it wasn't
[2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:20.600]  real now they capitulate they don't have that power anymore they already screwed the pooch
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:26.760]  denying the last thing so what are they going to do I mean it's pedophilia folks twitter went up
[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:31.240]  this weekend I started getting all kinds of notifications and it was like yeah it's nothing
[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:36.920]  we haven't seen before it's all a year ago I agree but they're doing it full court press in big tech
[2:54:36.920 --> 2:54:41.800]  to block it and it's not working so again I just see that as an indicator of their their power is
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:51.160]  diminishing like a lead balloon that's good what do you think's coming next skid how everything that
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:56.520]  you've in line with what you've said so far I mean wouldn't be surprised if he gets taken out tomorrow
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:04.920]  Biden I mean I agree I'm ready I mean truck bomb mass shooting Biden's dead and I hope that doesn't
[2:55:04.920 --> 2:55:11.000]  happen but he got leveled don't you just see that happening combine me and you yeah absolutely
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:15.160]  all right god bless you sir appreciate your call see I'm in one more let's go ahead and talk to
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:22.760]  Kevin in Missouri the show me state go ahead Kevin hey Alex I want to talk about Article 1
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:28.280]  section 10 clause 3 of the Constitution if the federal government fails to cure the border the
[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:34.760]  states have the right and the duty to repel the invaders with force if necessary to keep
[2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:41.560]  their citizens safe this is the key to securing the border in Texas Abbott is running for re-election
[2:55:41.560 --> 2:55:49.080]  in November everybody in Texas needs to call their representatives and demand they put pressure on
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:54.120]  Abbott to close the border exactly let's explain this we don't need more troops to get the illegals
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:59.400]  and set them free to the feds we need the state to declare its own emergency and throw them back
[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:07.000]  over the border that's right and then they need to call Abbott's office and in them say I am not
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:15.720]  voting for you until you close the border and if you keep pushing this message Alex he'll
[2:56:15.720 --> 2:56:20.920]  capitulate and he'll close that border he'd be as popular as the Santas if he should grow some
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:28.120]  damn testicles I know if you keep put if you keep the pressure on him and have everybody in Texas
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:35.720]  uh uh demand and say that we are not call call his office and say we are not voting for you until
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:43.400]  you close the border he's a lawless giant war zone I mean if one person shoots up a school
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:47.880]  it's still terrible they lock them all down the borders thousands of dead every few months total
[2:56:47.880 --> 2:56:53.720]  insane death and nothing's done and then they all the feds aren't doing it well then that's your job
[2:56:53.720 --> 2:56:59.800]  Abbott I totally agree right yeah that's under our article one section ten clause three he's not
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:07.080]  doing his constitutional right and if you he took an oath to the constitution and he's breaking it
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:13.480]  you've been beautifully said all right we've got a five minute segment left before Gerald Salente

[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  caller before drill salante takes over yes alex time for talk is over we need a shrillanka 2.0 we
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:05.880]  need millions of pace patriots to peacefully lock down washington dc demand the resignation of
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:11.400]  biden kamala harris fancy policy and the prosecution of hunter because he's being protected blatantly
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:18.440]  by the fd i well we know they're an illegitimate government that took over by fraud and when they
[3:08:18.440 --> 3:08:23.320]  show shrillanka and they go oh look it's a protest what happened on january 6 was one one-hundredth
[3:08:23.320 --> 3:08:30.280]  of that my issue is is that dc doesn't run stuff the whole infrastructure in the globalist program
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:35.880]  is other parts of the country but i hear you i mean we have a pedophile government yeah we still
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:41.480]  have to try even if it's in vain these people must be removed now time for talk is over voting
[3:08:41.480 --> 3:08:47.240]  doesn't work they just steal the elections what do you make of the hunter by the phone coming out i
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:50.840]  mean it's a pretty big deal that this time they can't deny it's real that they're they're in full
[3:08:50.840 --> 3:08:56.840]  panic mode well they're just the powers that prosecute are going to continue to ignore it
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:03.240]  but what does that do politically to them i mean they are politically convicted
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:09.880]  they don't care they don't care about uh they know they're on a massively unpopular they don't care
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:19.400]  they're just implementing their sick agenda and their murder upon us well i know this the whole
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:24.920]  world is escalating into a shrillanka type crisis and i support the dutch farmers i support others
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:32.440]  protesting its policies but can't you see how that we just march on dc the politicians will
[3:09:32.440 --> 3:09:38.840]  fly on their helicopters what does capturing those buildings do well i don't know i guess we'll find
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:42.520]  out when we get there well i know when they do it in other countries than the military and the police
[3:09:42.520 --> 3:09:46.680]  join them and i think we're very close to that i i just i don't feel like i'm the guy to tell
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:51.320]  people to go do that i don't feel like i'm the guy to try to lead that because i know how haphazard
[3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:56.040]  all this is but i i mean we have an illegitimate government the just departments run by chinese
[3:09:56.040 --> 3:10:03.720]  agents uh hunter biden's a pedophile shows the the fake president and it's a crazy moment i'm sure
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:08.760]  gerald salenta will be able to speak to all of this he's about to take over the next 50 minutes and
[3:10:08.760 --> 3:10:15.240]  gerald salenta is an american trend forecaster publisher of the trends journal business consultant
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:19.000]  author who makes predictions about the global markets financial markets and other events of
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:23.400]  historical importance salenta has described himself as political atheists and a citizen of the world
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:28.440]  he has appeared on everything you can imagine trends at research dot com on twitter gerald salenta he
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:35.000]  takes over now my good friend gerald salenta what do you make of all this i'm gonna be listening well
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:40.840]  first of all thank you for all that you do and and the and the info wars staff and everybody
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:45.480]  listening do everything you can to get these products particularly the ones that you have to
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:53.080]  prepare in times of uh food shortages and and more big problems coming ahead because this
[3:10:53.080 --> 3:10:59.080]  thing is going down like we've never seen in the history of the world part one or part two
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:05.480]  we are going into the worst geopolitical and economic crisis that ever couldn't have been
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:13.640]  imagined you go back to 2020 i know that's ancient history for a lot of people but what they did with
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:19.480]  this covid war and locking down businesses they've destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions
[3:11:19.480 --> 3:11:25.480]  of people around the planet and that guy that was just one of the callers talking about the immigration
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:32.520]  problem it's not only the united states that go go to france take a trip to italy yeah you think
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:39.240]  you're in africa oh by the way let's go back because tracking trends is an understanding of how where
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:47.240]  we are how we got here and where we're going it was a little slimy guy that everybody loved
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:53.080]  in racist america where they elected a black president i mentioned that because to call this
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:12:02.120]  country a racist nation and to elect a lying piece of phony garbage folks he always used to focus
[3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:10.680]  by the name of barack obama who sold himself as a peace candidate and turned out to be a piece of
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:16.760]  crap candidate going back to where things are going how they're going and about refugees
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:22.920]  once upon a time there was a place called libya the richest country in africa and by the way people
[3:12:22.920 --> 3:12:32.360]  having more rights benefits than most citizens of the world i want that guy kadafi added oh no
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:39.320]  salent you don't say it like that no you have to be proper kadafi has to go we're going to bring
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:46.280]  freedom and democracy there oh we're going to get there oil yeah you think we evaded because
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:56.600]  their major export is broccoli like the bushes invaded iraq so going back kadafi warned europe
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:08.680]  you overthrow me you are going to see an immigrant and refugee crisis that you won't be able to handle
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:17.080]  because many of them were coming up out of africa through libya and into europe but not under kadafi
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:25.640]  they got rid of kadafi they killed them and now you got these problems and we got to take the
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:32.440]  big picture here i started with how they destroyed the economies of the world with these made up
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:39.160]  stupid lockdown crap you got to stand one meter away no you got to stand two meters away uh you
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:45.800]  got to wash down everything wash down everything oh yeah your chances of getting it from a touch
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:51.320]  state it's only one in ten thousand outsides about one percent but we'll put circles outside too
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:59.320]  these maniacs have destroyed life on earth you are going to see a refugee crisis like we've never
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:05.400]  seen before business have been destroyed all over the world things were bad before this happened
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:13.160]  you go back to 2019 the biggest richest country in europe germany was a fraction away from an
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:20.520]  official recession in 2019 now you're going to see a refugee crisis homeless crisis

[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:47.960]  city you got it this is how they sold the covid war stuff little time and time time to look at
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:52.680]  bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and then it became real they're doing the same exact thing
[3:49:52.680 --> 3:49:59.560]  world war one has started so you want to prepare you prepare for the worst if the worst doesn't
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:06.520]  happen and you're not prepared you don't lose anything if the worst happens and you're not

[3:50:15.080 --> 3:50:21.640]  want to be prepared and speaking of which we have the equity markets going on at a dows down as i'm
[3:50:21.640 --> 3:50:27.960]  speaking about 200 points goal has been taken a hit one of the reasons why is that the dollar is
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:35.560]  getting so strong and a dollar now against the euro which is as big as competitor 10 euros down
[3:50:35.560 --> 3:50:42.280]  like a 20 year low and again the only reason they got in that euro by the way is they people like
[3:50:42.280 --> 3:50:51.800]  my older than me who grew up you know kids during world war two they saw the destruction they saw
[3:50:51.800 --> 3:50:57.160]  the line that if everybody had a currency one currency in europe there wouldn't be wars like
[3:50:57.160 --> 3:51:02.760]  world war one that just happened 20 years before world war two so the people swallowed the crap
[3:51:02.760 --> 3:51:12.360]  like they always do and speaking of crap and swallowing it uh there's this guy another arrogant boy
[3:51:12.360 --> 3:51:18.200]  another daddy's boy went to riverdale school i went to harvard and i got a slew of uh drafter
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:25.480]  thubbins but i pretend to be a tough guy and i lie about it as well and that's this uh democrat
[3:51:25.480 --> 3:51:32.760]  cap senator richard blumenthal last week him and another little boy couldn't fight as we
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:39.480]  have a paper bag a little fat mouth warmongering little jerk lindsay graham went to ukraine
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:50.840]  yep and richard blumenthal and according to lindsay's office the ukraine leaders
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:57.320]  that insisted to americans that the military in ukraine is certainly difficult yet controlled
[3:51:58.360 --> 3:52:00.840]  you know that is that's a lot of belonging
[3:52:03.560 --> 3:52:06.360]  first they said putin's out of his mind when they started all this
[3:52:07.080 --> 3:52:12.600]  oh then they were there for two weeks and i haven't gotten much and now they're going on the fifth
[3:52:12.600 --> 3:52:19.800]  month they only own about they only got about 25 percent of the country 25 percent of the country
[3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:28.120]  you look at your cover this week's trends journal and what does it say the big lie right look at
[3:52:28.120 --> 3:52:33.000]  this little cloud how could anybody how could anybody with a brain bigger than a p listen to
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:41.480]  lindsay little graham an arrogant arrogant arrogant arrogant piece of crap a little garbage boy
[3:52:41.480 --> 3:52:51.000]  because that's all that comes out of his mouth garbage and then that blumenthal yep oh this
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:59.640]  though this is a quote from from jerk graham is there a brutish in russia is there a more
[3:52:59.640 --> 3:53:07.480]  successful colonel stoffenberg in the russian military he asked referring to the assassination
[3:53:07.480 --> 3:53:12.520]  of julius caesar and the would-be assassin of adolf hitler wanting to get putin killed
[3:53:13.480 --> 3:53:22.200]  so this guy uh blumenthal this guy when he ran for senate he said he misspoke about his
[3:53:22.200 --> 3:53:29.000]  military service during the vietnam war he goes on to say that the meeting he said at a rally
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:33.400]  we have learned something important since the days that i served in vietnam
[3:53:33.400 --> 3:53:42.920]  he didn't serve in vietnam he got deferments after he completed his studies at harvard
[3:53:44.120 --> 3:53:49.720]  pursued a graduate fellowship in england served as a special assistant to the washington post
[3:53:49.720 --> 3:53:57.560]  publisher kathryn garland and got a job in the nixon whitehouse in 1970 with his last
[3:53:57.560 --> 3:54:04.760]  deferment in jeopardy he landed a coveted spot in the marine reserves which virtually guaranteed
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:13.160]  that he would not be sent to vietnam yet this little clown boy in 2003 he said when we returned
[3:54:13.160 --> 3:54:17.160]  from vietnam we saw nothing like this and that people didn't like that everybody was against
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:29.160]  the soldiers coming back lied again 2007 in vietnam we had to endure taunson insults and no one
[3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:40.360]  said welcome home he said he misspoke he misspoke you lied you lied all these people that get
[3:54:40.360 --> 3:54:49.400]  caught lying and misspoke oh by the way i think that is sexist how can you say misspoke how about
