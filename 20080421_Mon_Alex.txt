[00:00.000 --> 00:07.940]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.940 --> 00:31.740]  GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:31.740 --> 00:38.940]  welcome, and thank you so much for joining me today. We're going to be live here for
[00:38.940 --> 00:46.940]  the next three hours. People think that I'm aware of everything that happens. We also
[00:46.940 --> 00:55.380]  tend to think that government and institutions and actors or our bosses are all omnipresent.
[00:55.380 --> 01:00.580]  That is not the case. That's why we can defeat the New World Order. And I certainly am not.
[01:00.580 --> 01:09.100]  I didn't know that six days ago there was a international incident where it was all
[01:09.100 --> 01:17.580]  over MSNBC, all over BBC, all over every major paper in Ireland, and every paper I've looked
[01:17.580 --> 01:27.580]  up in England. It's got to be in thousands of publications that evil we are change supposedly
[01:27.580 --> 01:33.220]  assaulted a member of the European Parliament in Ireland. Now, I just learned of this this
[01:33.220 --> 01:37.460]  morning. Trey got ahold of them just five minutes before airtime. I meant to tell him
[01:37.460 --> 01:45.300]  to ask him, is it true? I bet it's not. The MO sounds like it's not. But we will have
[01:45.300 --> 01:52.500]  the supposed art criminal culprits on, but notice it says the police didn't arrest anybody
[01:52.500 --> 01:58.860]  or aren't doing anything. Sounds to me like it's all made up, but we will find out coming
[01:58.860 --> 02:05.060]  up at the start of the third hour today. Also, George Butler, who's a talk show host
[02:05.060 --> 02:10.500]  on Genesis, who I've known for quite a few years, really an interesting person. He worked
[02:10.500 --> 02:18.100]  in the Cold War in Berlin against the communists. Amazing stories there. He also was in places
[02:18.100 --> 02:24.900]  like Libya up on top of NSA listening stations. So we'll talk about the Cold War. We'll talk
[02:24.900 --> 02:28.820]  about spies. We'll talk about East Germany. We'll talk about the U.S. and celebrity. We'll
[02:28.820 --> 02:35.380]  talk about the psychopathic nature of the ruling guild that is in control of the planet,
[02:35.380 --> 02:40.100]  the nature of the criminal mind, the more advanced criminal mind that tends to rotate
[02:40.100 --> 02:43.860]  towards law enforcement and government with him for an hour and a half. He'll be with
[02:43.860 --> 02:50.940]  us from 1.30 until 3 p.m. Today, the fourth hour officially will be heard here on the
[02:50.940 --> 02:56.340]  GCN radio network stations that are already carrying us. Need not sign a new affiliate
[02:56.340 --> 03:00.780]  relations agreement. You can simply, if you're listening to us on the Star Guide or the
[03:00.780 --> 03:06.140]  SEPC feed that we have, or some of you download the show each day and air it during different
[03:06.140 --> 03:14.100]  times of your choosing from the affiliate streams in 56K, you're welcome to air any
[03:14.100 --> 03:18.140]  of the hours whenever you wish. You know that you're already affiliates and we would thank
[03:18.140 --> 03:23.700]  you to carry the fourth hour. I know a lot of you are already calling about it. So fourth
[03:23.700 --> 03:33.700]  hour today. All right. I am focused like a laser beam as they say today. I want to talk
[03:33.700 --> 03:39.980]  about briefly the nature of the New World Order and their plan, which is becoming more
[03:39.980 --> 03:45.380]  and more clear and which is manifesting itself in front of everyone to the point of where
[03:45.380 --> 03:53.980]  there's really no debating about what's happening. The globalists themselves are quite public
[03:53.980 --> 04:01.580]  about what they are doing. So we will break that down in the second segment today. And
[04:01.580 --> 04:08.100]  then I will get into the massive stack of very, very important news I have. I'm going
[04:08.100 --> 04:14.780]  to cover news, a wide spectrum of news. In the first hour, I'm going to open the phones
[04:14.780 --> 04:27.180]  up for a phone blitz in the second hour today. We will be taking calls in here via my phone
[04:27.180 --> 04:33.220]  system and the network phone system. So double team me. And we'll take a lot of your calls
[04:33.220 --> 04:39.540]  coming up in the second hour. And then, of course, we will have open phones again with
[04:39.540 --> 04:48.500]  Richard George Butler, our guest coming up in the fourth hour, prisonplanet.com. Stay
[04:48.500 --> 05:01.340]  with us. It is a big idea, a New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by
[05:01.340 --> 05:07.580]  a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world
[05:07.580 --> 05:13.660]  domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth
[05:13.660 --> 05:18.900]  of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is
[05:18.900 --> 05:26.780]  at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown
[05:26.780 --> 05:31.860]  wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:31.860 --> 05:35.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[05:35.500 --> 05:38.660]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's

[06:54.740 --> 06:58.500]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[06:58.500 --> 07:03.460]  disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[07:03.460 --> 07:07.640]  what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles. It's these choices that
[07:07.640 --> 07:12.420]  cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease
[07:12.420 --> 07:17.620]  causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer

[07:59.940 --> 08:09.740]  war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Coming up we will cover this,
[08:09.740 --> 08:16.420]  U.S. jets drop bombs on Sotter City, Bush Harbor, Calderon to defend trade deal, and
[08:16.420 --> 08:24.340]  backlash in U.S. and NAFTA. Burglaries have surged 21% in the victim disarmament zone
[08:24.340 --> 08:32.380]  of Washington, D.C., the modern slave pit prototype of the rest of our lives. Oil prices
[08:32.380 --> 08:39.860]  spiked to record above $117.00. Dollars of barrel and futures are above $118.00. Dollar
[08:39.860 --> 08:46.180]  drops with G7 blessing shows no in game Bloomberg. That's right. They're going to continue to
[08:46.180 --> 08:50.020]  let it drop, ladies and gentlemen, and when the yuppies find out, they're going to riot
[08:50.020 --> 08:54.340]  in the streets, and they thought the cops were just for the minorities. They're going
[08:54.340 --> 09:02.860]  to find out it's for you. It was all for you. Continuing here, drivers paying record pump
[09:02.860 --> 09:10.820]  prices on average $3.47 cents in change, and in some areas of the country, people are paying
[09:10.820 --> 09:20.220]  $4.75 per gallon. It's because your dollar's been devalued, but don't worry, you've still
[09:20.220 --> 09:27.420]  got your stock market. It's up with devalued dollars, but illusion's what you want, isn't
[09:27.420 --> 09:33.060]  it? Like imagine you have a parachute and jump out of a plane and see if it saves you.
[09:33.060 --> 09:41.940]  Bail prices, deepens pain, produces, dodge the blame game, CNBC reports. Now, remember
[09:41.940 --> 09:48.420]  that McCain is saying that this is a delusion, that it's imaginary, that we're mentally
[09:48.420 --> 09:54.220]  ill, that we have to imagine the economy's good and spend more money, and then everything
[09:54.220 --> 10:01.940]  will be fine. Okay. Economist, even more gloomy about U.S. prospects, these are headlines.
[10:01.940 --> 10:08.900]  Gold rebounds, after and during massive institutional sell-off, institutions are dumping gold, left
[10:08.900 --> 10:14.140]  and right, and gold still maintains and spikes up and down, showing it's highly volatile
[10:14.140 --> 10:19.100]  and that they are artificially depressing. I mean, they admit they are, but they're putting
[10:19.100 --> 10:23.580]  everything they can against the dam, trying to break it, and more leaks of springing,
[10:23.580 --> 10:30.300]  more cracks are forming. I'm using this as a buying opportunity. I don't know about you.
[10:30.300 --> 10:36.660]  New anti-terrorism rules allow U.S. to spy on British motorists. We'll tell you what's
[10:36.660 --> 10:42.620]  really behind that. They always swap the spying through the NSA echelon agreement. Bank of
[10:42.620 --> 10:49.260]  England facilitates bank debt swap. Florida luxury home market shows signs of where, and
[10:49.260 --> 10:54.580]  then you read the Reuters article. It's completely, is it a standstill. Bank of England outlines
[10:54.580 --> 11:02.300]  its bailout plan. More Americans are walking away from their homes to the point of many
[11:02.300 --> 11:07.860]  lenders have put a freeze on repossessing right now because they don't want a total
[11:07.860 --> 11:14.380]  collapse yet. They don't have the police trained for proper martial law yet. They're
[11:14.380 --> 11:22.700]  literally saying stay on target, stay on target, not yet, stay on target. They've just got
[11:22.700 --> 11:26.060]  to wait until we're perfectly in their sights, and then don't worry. They're going to drop
[11:26.060 --> 11:30.500]  it hard on all of you. You're all going to get what you want, especially you government
[11:30.500 --> 11:34.940]  workers and police who love what's happening. Don't worry. Your masters are going to hurt
[11:34.940 --> 11:41.780]  you bad. Your treason will be repaid by your masters. Translink cops will continue to taser
[11:41.780 --> 11:47.660]  fare dodgers. Non-compliant passengers will be tortured until they behave properly. Ladies
[11:47.660 --> 11:52.540]  and gentlemen, this is mainstream news. They are saying in Canada, if you were caught without
[11:52.540 --> 12:01.100]  a ticket, you will be tased as punishment. I mean, it's just everything's off the charts.
[12:01.100 --> 12:05.300]  We're living in the twilight zone right now. European Parliament member assaulted outside
[12:05.300 --> 12:14.100]  debate on EU treaty referendum, AP, MSNBC, Belfast Telegraph, BBs. I mean, I've just got
[12:14.100 --> 12:23.380]  everything here. Anti-EU gang assaults Irish MEP. It's anti-terror, anti-gang. Oh my gosh.
[12:23.380 --> 12:28.740]  Guarantee this is made up. We'll talk to the guys who were supposedly did it, but notice
[12:28.740 --> 12:31.940]  they won't even say the name of the group. They never will say the name of we are changed.
[12:31.940 --> 12:39.820]  Remember, we are changed on video with retired police who work for identifying themselves
[12:39.820 --> 12:44.660]  as police officers. Coming up and saying, we're going to say you've got bombs and send
[12:44.660 --> 12:48.980]  you to jail for terrorism if you don't stop protesting. And we have a bunch of other videos
[12:48.980 --> 12:55.220]  where they try to frame we are change. Stabilize your rear deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
[12:55.220 --> 12:59.580]  We are changed. You better know they're trying to set you up because you're hurting the terrorist
[12:59.580 --> 13:08.380]  badly. Sheriffs back three jails for illegal immigrants. AP sounds good on the surface,
[13:08.380 --> 13:13.940]  but what's really behind it? Homeland security funding jails for illegals. 50% of LA workforce
[13:13.940 --> 13:17.820]  are immigrants. That is just some of what's coming up. I want to talk more about Lee
[13:17.820 --> 13:23.980]  Iacocca coming out saying we're in a police state. Corporate criminals run the government.
[13:23.980 --> 13:29.260]  That's right. Lee Iacocca now my friends coming out and a bunch of other news and the mystery
[13:29.260 --> 13:36.900]  of the Palestinian American citizen with no criminal record who'd been harassed, detained,
[13:36.900 --> 13:43.340]  pushed by the FBI. He'd gone on democracy now and spoken out. The evidence shows murder
[13:43.340 --> 13:51.380]  bound hands, bound eyes, mouth, bound legs in duct tape thrown into the river, the Colorado
[13:51.380 --> 13:57.860]  River where with double speak, they call Lake Lady Bird rivers are now lakes. It doesn't
[13:57.860 --> 14:01.380]  matter what the public. You can tell them anything under the mind control. We're now
[14:01.380 --> 14:07.220]  under, uh, and they threw him in the Colorado River known as Lady Bird Lake and after the
[14:07.220 --> 14:13.340]  wicked LBJ wife and, uh, see how just everything's double thinking lies. Just the names, everything's
[14:13.340 --> 14:19.580]  mass programming of fraud. Excuse me. I'm ranting. Um, I said I was going to be calm.
[14:19.580 --> 14:25.860]  I just, there's so much info. Okay. That's some of the news. Some of the news are going
[14:25.860 --> 14:36.660]  to be covering, uh, today. New world order. Gordon Brown has called for a new world order
[14:36.660 --> 14:42.180]  again. Meanwhile, the public says it doesn't exist because they were told so and rivers
[14:42.180 --> 14:50.060]  are lakes and people bound. Oh man. By the way, speaking of the Palestinian, uh, man
[14:50.060 --> 14:56.660]  who admittedly shipped books, textbooks to Palestinians living in a giant concentration
[14:56.660 --> 15:02.700]  camp, people are emailing me saying investigate, investigate. Hey, I, uh, called all four of
[15:02.700 --> 15:14.540]  the numbers with his last name. There's no listing for his first name. R I A D H A M
[15:14.540 --> 15:19.980]  A D Raid Hamad and I know we got a lot of listeners in Austin. I know we got a lot of Muslim
[15:19.980 --> 15:25.380]  listeners in Austin. I know cause I went to high school and college with a bunch of Muslims
[15:25.380 --> 15:28.820]  and was lifted weights and you know, went skiing with them and stuff, pretty mainstream
[15:28.820 --> 15:33.580]  people. I know they also live here in town. They own a bunch of businesses. Uh, I know
[15:33.580 --> 15:39.620]  a lot of them are Palestinian and, and, uh, Iraq, Shiites. You go find out and you call
[15:39.620 --> 15:44.060]  me and tell me how to get all of their family. Okay. I don't have a big staff. I spent time
[15:44.060 --> 15:50.180]  yesterday on this. I spent time this morning. I can't find out where this widow lives or
[15:50.180 --> 15:57.420]  I'd go over there. I mean, what about you? The listeners doing something occasionally.
[15:57.420 --> 16:01.100]  Alex do it. We demand you investigate. We wrote an article within an hour of finding
[16:01.100 --> 16:05.660]  out about it Friday. Kurt Nemo had one up linking to mainstream news where the Israeli
[16:05.660 --> 16:12.100]  said they were going to start killing U S citizens that aid even peacefully the Palestinians.
[16:12.100 --> 16:15.580]  And there have been a bunch of suspicious murders and deaths, but now people get shot
[16:15.580 --> 16:19.620]  four or five times and the police call it suicide. You get shot in the back of the head.
[16:19.620 --> 16:24.940]  They call it suicide. You're dismembered and tortured with electrical burns all over you.
[16:24.940 --> 16:33.780]  It's called torture. I mean, it's, it's called, uh, suicide. I mean, it's just they'll, they
[16:33.780 --> 16:38.260]  may start lining people up and having video firing squad shooting you and then say it's
[16:38.260 --> 16:44.740]  torture. I'm having a Freudian slips here. The guy was tortured to death. The info we're
[16:44.740 --> 16:51.980]  getting, but I'm not ready to come totally confirm the source I've got. I got too much
[16:51.980 --> 17:00.100]  information in my brain these days. Ladies and gentlemen, I just, it's just too much.
[17:00.100 --> 17:02.940]  We've gotten to the point where they'll probably start having firing squads and then calling
[17:02.940 --> 17:07.500]  it suicide and showing people being shot by 20 man firing squads and calling it that they'll
[17:07.500 --> 17:11.940]  probably start dropping us in giant blenders. You know, it's sports stadiums and going,
[17:11.940 --> 17:18.420]  look, he'll now commit suicide for his crimes. And the public will say, okay, that's, we've
[17:18.420 --> 17:24.700]  entered a new vortex of behavioral psychologist now just engaging in propaganda. That's just
[17:24.700 --> 17:33.100]  unbelievable designed to be based, designed to be mindless, designed to be completely
[17:33.100 --> 17:49.300]  and totally out of control. I tell you what, let me go ahead and just try to reach out
[17:49.300 --> 17:57.140]  to the neocons, the people that hate us, the mainline fake liberals that hate us, all of
[17:57.140 --> 18:02.780]  you that are still part of the control paradigm. Let me try to break something down for you.
[18:02.780 --> 18:09.220]  The new world order wants to abolish national sovereignty, not to create some utopian world
[18:09.220 --> 18:16.300]  government. But on paper, they say, if they try to build a utopian world government, he'd
[18:16.300 --> 18:20.540]  be taken over overnight by tyrants, any big lever like that, they would all struggle and
[18:20.540 --> 18:25.520]  fight and assassinate each other and engage in all forms of espionage and skull duggery
[18:25.520 --> 18:32.740]  and chicanery until they had control of those levers. But they're not building it from the
[18:32.740 --> 18:39.140]  start to be humanitarian. It was forged and built as an instrument of tyranny and abuse.
[18:39.140 --> 18:43.340]  And as they abolish the national sovereignty and the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights
[18:43.340 --> 18:50.380]  and all due process in the Western world, they are replacing it with classical despotism,
[18:50.380 --> 18:59.940]  classical authoritarian tyranny. Their creed is dishonor and fraud and scams and lies and
[18:59.940 --> 19:11.660]  dishonesty. And they're transferring all power to unelected IMF World Bank World Trade Organization,

[24:33.780 --> 24:46.300]  man take my earth. None will level on the mine. Nobody out there is worthy. I see the
[24:46.300 --> 24:52.300]  riders approaching. I see traders within the gates lowering the bridge as the children
[24:52.300 --> 24:59.740]  sleep by a candlelight in the village within the walls. The horsemen have blades. They come
[24:59.740 --> 25:20.460]  for blood. There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke. But you and
[25:20.460 --> 25:34.740]  I have been through that and this is not our fate. So let us stop talking falsely now.

[27:22.380 --> 27:28.980]  It is owned and run publicly by foreign corporations that are setting up their own world government
[27:28.980 --> 27:35.740]  to carry out the forced extraction of your property, your land, your money, your intellectual
[27:35.740 --> 27:42.020]  property, your mind, your forced drugging, your forced sterilization. One child policies,
[27:42.020 --> 27:49.340]  controlled bio weapons releases upon our population. It's already been going on for more than 100
[27:49.340 --> 27:53.980]  years in their bio weapon program and chemical weapon program against us. But now they're
[27:53.980 --> 28:01.140]  building a global prison so they can exterminate us and carry out their operations in an orderly
[28:01.140 --> 28:08.380]  compartmentalized fashion where 98% of those even inside the grid and operating it will
[28:08.380 --> 28:17.900]  have not even the faintest idea what they're part of and what they are working through.
[28:17.900 --> 28:23.220]  And I want people out there that serve this system to understand something. You think you're
[28:23.220 --> 28:29.020]  part of the system. You think you're part of the winning team. You think this Iraq war
[28:29.020 --> 28:34.620]  is about America kicking the butt of some brown people. A lot of good old boys go, yeah,
[28:34.620 --> 28:39.140]  it's about oil. Yeah, it's about weapons. Yeah, it's about our buddies in Israel. That's
[28:39.140 --> 28:47.860]  why we're on top because we do this. We had 15% growth rates a year before we became
[28:47.860 --> 28:54.820]  an empire in 1898. Before we began behaving like that. We were much more wealthy and much
[28:54.820 --> 29:00.460]  more powerful on average individually. But the harnessing of this great nation and a
[29:00.460 --> 29:07.980]  great people began in earnest in 1898 by 1913, the head control of our banking system. By
[29:07.980 --> 29:13.180]  1933, they had begun the domestication process and the militarization setting up the federal
[29:13.180 --> 29:18.020]  police. You know them as the state police under federal charter. Go read your state police
[29:18.020 --> 29:26.780]  charter state police. And now we come just deeper under their sway, their control. We
[29:26.780 --> 29:33.420]  are now in the final phase. As we enter the slaughterhouse, will we buck and break down
[29:33.420 --> 29:46.220]  the gate? Or will we let them get us in the squeeze shoot? We're on the march, the empires
[29:46.220 --> 29:55.900]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[33:02.900 --> 33:09.980]  Let me try to simplify it. Not for our main audience, but for those that are tuning in
[33:09.980 --> 33:17.500]  for the first time today. History is replete with emperors, kings, corrupt classes, different
[33:17.500 --> 33:24.060]  groups of merchants, getting together, overthrowing governments, overthrowing one elite to install
[33:24.060 --> 33:30.500]  another elite, or overthrowing free populations to usurp their land, their property, their
[33:30.500 --> 33:36.580]  children, to press their children into slavery, to press them into work gangs, onboard ships
[33:36.580 --> 33:44.580]  or off ships. And all the liberty and freedom you have is through rebellion, is through
[33:44.580 --> 33:53.260]  resistance. And common sense throughout the world has been, don't trust the government,
[33:53.260 --> 33:57.980]  don't trust the state, keep the government as small as you can. The western world has
[33:57.980 --> 34:03.860]  been built upon that. The renaissance was built on that. And now we're told that that's
[34:03.860 --> 34:10.700]  terrorism, that that's extremism, that that's bad. And they mix the word extremism that
[34:10.700 --> 34:16.500]  they can put on any group they wish, or radicalism, and mix it in with a word like terrorism, and
[34:16.500 --> 34:23.460]  then police are brainwashed and say, now go arrest those radicals who aren't terrorists.
[34:23.460 --> 34:27.460]  And all over the country, we catch the police and all over the world, staging riots with
[34:27.460 --> 34:32.900]  their own officers, dressed up like anarchists. We exposed the anarchist group working for
[34:32.900 --> 34:38.180]  the feds last week. They've gotten real upset and screaming and yelling and telling lies
[34:38.180 --> 34:41.620]  about us right now, but that's okay. Well, I know we're blowing your operation and that's
[34:41.620 --> 34:48.700]  very upsetting to you. We're going to go on blowing your operations to defend this republic.
[34:48.700 --> 34:53.900]  You want to, I mean, how do you, how do police stage riots and stage events and assault other
[34:53.900 --> 34:59.540]  cops so you can rubber bullet peaceful crowds to a, make protesters look bad on national
[34:59.540 --> 35:07.060]  international media and be further restrict the first amendment to the height of treason
[35:07.060 --> 35:12.660]  against the republic. And any of you that take part on this should be very ashamed of
[35:12.660 --> 35:19.460]  yourselves and don't tell me I'm making this up. It's all over British, Dutch, Italian,
[35:19.460 --> 35:25.460]  Canadian, US news, mainstream. You've been caught all over the place headlines, police
[35:25.460 --> 35:31.420]  caught staging riot, police caught attacking their own officers, police caught provocaturing.
[35:31.420 --> 35:37.940]  It's over. We've exposed you. You're caught engaging in false flag terror. And that's
[35:37.940 --> 35:46.020]  what it is. Terrorizing our first amendment, knocking other cops upside the head with bottles.
[35:46.020 --> 35:50.700]  In some cases like Seattle now nine years ago, they would throw bottles, knock cops
[35:50.700 --> 35:54.900]  teeth out, attack them. The cops would then be ordered to stand down. They that's why
[35:54.900 --> 35:59.980]  some cops, one of the news and exposed it all later just so they could attack the 60,000
[35:59.980 --> 36:05.300]  peaceful people for a day that the cops had to sit there while they were attacked by other
[36:05.300 --> 36:12.580]  cops. That's now come out. That's now admitted. Now come out. I made a film nine years ago,
[36:12.580 --> 36:16.100]  police state to the takeover with the police interviewed admitting it and the newscast
[36:16.100 --> 36:24.180]  admitting it and the newspaper articles admitting it. But I'm so sick of being at events and
[36:24.180 --> 36:29.100]  watching. It's always some giant cop. You know, I mean, a real anarchist weighs about
[36:29.100 --> 36:34.660]  150 pounds. You know, you're not six foot four with arms the size of tree trunks dressed
[36:34.660 --> 36:39.740]  up like anarchist shoving other cops. And you're not even good actors. So you can then
[36:39.740 --> 36:47.700]  fire rubber bullets at me. Criminals. You are criminals. And let me tell you the Austin
[36:47.700 --> 36:55.060]  police. The evidence is pointing towards and we've got inside sources who are too scared
[36:55.060 --> 37:02.180]  to go public. One of them at a TV station who heard the feeds that that guy looked like
[37:02.180 --> 37:09.780]  he'd been tortured and had marks all over him. He was bound hands and legs and face
[37:09.780 --> 37:15.220]  eyes covered thrown in the river. Political activists here in Austin. And you come out
[37:15.220 --> 37:21.180]  and say, Oh, it's quite clear a day after he committed suicide. This is, you know, it
[37:21.180 --> 37:27.660]  is scary to know that we're in this much trouble. I can't believe the country has turned into
[37:27.660 --> 37:37.660]  this. And one of the cops saying they're saying he pulled a false flag. They're saying, Oh,
[37:37.660 --> 37:42.620]  it takes one to know one, huh? They're saying he staged his own murder to make the FBI look
[37:42.620 --> 37:48.580]  bad. And you know what? There's actually a chance he might have done that. Maybe one
[37:48.580 --> 37:54.740]  chance out of 100. But there you are introducing your favorite trick to us. Aren't you claiming
[37:54.740 --> 38:03.980]  now that we pull your tricks? I swear on the souls of my children. Now you're not supposed
[38:03.980 --> 38:11.300]  to do that. But the point is I will never commit suicide. I will never quote stage my
[38:11.300 --> 38:17.920]  own death to blame on the police. Don't you dare try it.
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.900]  You know, growing up in Rockwall, Texas, I had the police pull me over, take me to jail
[38:22.900 --> 38:31.340]  for no reason, claiming disorderly conduct. And in the police car, the guy looks back.
[38:31.340 --> 38:36.340]  It was the second time I was warned that my dad got a local warning from the local lawyer
[38:36.340 --> 38:40.380]  because I was exposing that they were the drug dealers. And he said, Listen, we're going
[38:40.380 --> 38:45.700]  to hang you in your cell tonight. And I was so crazy, I started laughing on go ahead. Everybody's
[38:45.700 --> 38:48.980]  going to know the truth. And he was just turned around and said, Listen, you little bastard,
[38:48.980 --> 38:53.540]  we're serious. Shut the f up. Keep your little freaking mouth shut and get the hell out of
[38:53.540 --> 39:00.140]  this town or you're dead. And a month before I'd been slammed on the desk at school and
[39:00.140 --> 39:07.660]  told that by the school police officer. Don't tell me this government isn't corrupt. Don't
[39:07.660 --> 39:12.700]  you tell me for a minute, they deal the drugs, they run the whores, and that ain't enough
[39:12.700 --> 39:22.060]  for them now. They got a stage terror attacks on us and play the hero. I'm mad at you that
[39:22.060 --> 39:27.220]  you make me fight you. I know you're dangerous. I'm mad at you that you're so evil that you're
[39:27.220 --> 39:32.380]  screwing this country up and you're abusing people. And I'm mad at good police and good
[39:32.380 --> 39:37.180]  FBI and good government people that don't do anything about it. While you people breed
[39:37.180 --> 39:43.700]  like cockroaches, corruption is just exponentially growing. You guys, it's like a hundred pound
[39:43.700 --> 39:48.380]  dog with a 200 pound tick and the dogs in a coma and you're sucking out the last bit
[39:48.380 --> 39:55.500]  of blood. Don't you even care about your host living? Don't you understand what you're doing
[39:55.500 --> 40:04.460]  economically is going to ruin this country irrevocably? I said I wasn't going to rant
[40:04.460 --> 40:14.460]  today. I just start thinking about what they're doing. You are foiling and spoiling and fouling
[40:14.460 --> 40:31.860]  your own nest. And you know, I never realized how close I came to being killed when I was
[40:31.860 --> 40:39.100]  a teenager because they killed quite a few people in that jail in Rockwall. You're young,
[40:39.100 --> 40:42.780]  you think you're bulletproof. I was just mad that they did drug sweeps at the school and
[40:42.780 --> 40:47.380]  arrested my friends from marijuana when they were the drug dealers. One group of cops would
[40:47.380 --> 40:55.940]  sell you the drugs and the other group would bust you. So that's my wake up call. That's
[40:55.940 --> 41:06.540]  how I woke up to what you are and what you do. And it makes me sick. Now, let me explain
[41:06.540 --> 41:09.940]  this to all the good old boys out there that think you're part of the winning team and
[41:09.940 --> 41:16.020]  the club and the inside joke about, yeah, it's about oil and weapons and Israel and domestic
[41:16.020 --> 41:21.460]  police state, but we're going to be running things here domestically. And I've talked
[41:21.460 --> 41:29.500]  to sheriff's deputies and others. They've all been told this. The globalists are using
[41:29.500 --> 41:36.860]  our name and using up our checkbook and using up our credit to build their world government.
[41:36.860 --> 41:43.140]  And then they're going to leave us as a third world husk. This isn't like William McKinley
[41:43.140 --> 41:49.580]  or this isn't like, you know, the other president that we had that, you know, took a bunch of
[41:49.580 --> 41:53.500]  land from Mexico. This isn't where they were corrupt good old boys, but they actually wanted
[41:53.500 --> 42:02.300]  to build the country. This is hard core. I've given the analogy in matrix of evil of species
[42:02.300 --> 42:10.380]  of flies and there's species of ants and a few others, spiders that worms as a bunch
[42:10.380 --> 42:17.340]  of species that lay eggs on the belly of large beetles. And then the larva burrow in between
[42:17.340 --> 42:24.300]  the carapace exoskeleton separations and then eat the innards of the beetle starting in
[42:24.300 --> 42:32.900]  their guts. Ridley Scott in the movie alien, you know, he didn't invent any of that. That's
[42:32.900 --> 42:39.740]  just an idea from, from, from the insect kingdom. And the beetle basically goes crazy and wild.
[42:39.740 --> 42:45.100]  It's very painful as the larva grow and eat, eat their guts and then eat, eat the rest
[42:45.100 --> 42:52.420]  of them and crawl out. That's what's happening to us. Okay. And I have to watch the larva
[42:52.420 --> 42:58.740]  on TV smiling at us and telling us how good they are and lying to us and being so arrogant
[42:58.740 --> 43:05.420]  and so full of hubris. It's just, it's, it's very angering to me to look at the larva in
[43:05.420 --> 43:12.420]  their, in their fancy $5,000 suits and their $200 ties and to see the larva on local news.
[43:12.420 --> 43:22.980]  And I've just had enough of you. And when you look at how there are thousands and thousands
[43:22.980 --> 43:27.220]  and thousands of times debt created in our name that the global issues to buy up the
[43:27.220 --> 43:32.780]  world's infrastructure and to see how they're building the martial law grid and saying they're
[43:32.780 --> 43:39.860]  going to have 80 plus percent tax rates just to begin with total control. The Supreme court
[43:39.860 --> 43:44.020]  has ruled that private interests can take your private property and that they're allowed
[43:44.020 --> 43:52.460]  to pay local officials to do it. The Supreme court codified bribery, codified public payoffs
[43:52.460 --> 43:58.220]  to take your private land and then to not even give you just compensation, to not even
[43:58.220 --> 44:06.980]  pay you. Did you know that? You're given one offer, usually about 10 percent of what it's
[44:06.980 --> 44:11.660]  worth if you say no, then you have to pay court cost and then you end up owing them money
[44:11.660 --> 44:16.500]  when they take your property. You know, a guy called into the Sunday show and he said,
[44:16.500 --> 44:20.260]  yeah, here in our town, no, foreign European company just bought our water district and
[44:20.260 --> 44:24.380]  suddenly 89 percent increase. And I said, sir, that's just this year. They're going
[44:24.380 --> 44:29.660]  to cut your trash to one day a week, triple the price. And if you don't like it, try putting
[44:29.660 --> 44:36.460]  trash in your yard, they'll come swat team you. Everything's being bought. Everything's
[44:36.460 --> 44:41.820]  being handed over. That's why they're driving down the dollar by design. But then you're
[44:41.820 --> 44:46.980]  going to have to pay taxes for the inflated dollar and they're going to devalue your checking
[44:46.980 --> 44:53.140]  account. They've already done it. This, every way you calculate it, this is the end of the
[44:53.140 --> 44:59.540]  country. And I know I keep saying it's like a beacon that just flashes the same message
[44:59.540 --> 45:03.100]  because I want all of you that work for the system to know what you've been a part of
[45:03.100 --> 45:08.900]  as it unfolds. Maybe then you won't go along with taking people to FEMA camps and starving
[45:08.900 --> 45:16.620]  people in bread lines and how Hollywood's going to glorify the black ski mask and Nazi
[45:16.620 --> 45:27.460]  uniform stormtroopers. And what I see them doing is totally collapsing the economy to
[45:27.460 --> 45:32.620]  reorganize society. They could also mix a nuke in with that after they, they attack Iran
[45:32.620 --> 45:36.660]  to be this year. Next year there could be an attack. Barack Obama could then get tough.
[45:36.660 --> 45:41.580]  Oh, he's a liberal black guy. It's okay for him to nuke Muslims. I mean, I can see this
[45:41.580 --> 45:46.980]  set up some Hillary, it could be McCain, any angle you cut it, we're in trouble. Then we're
[45:46.980 --> 45:51.980]  hit by terrorist. Oh my gosh, we've got to have conscription. 10 million man army raised
[45:51.980 --> 45:58.540]  overnight. Six months later, we're in 60 plus countries. Third Reich, fourth Reich, it's
[45:58.540 --> 46:09.580]  all happening. Don't you see the psychology bankers own the US, they stage attacks to
[46:09.580 --> 46:15.180]  get us to go attack their enemies. Don't you understand how that works? Don't you understand
[46:15.180 --> 46:20.700]  you compute that good old boys out there? What is it you don't get the Jesse Ventura
[46:20.700 --> 46:27.420]  and Lee Iacocca and Ron Paul and Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and Naomi Wolf and
[46:27.420 --> 46:33.540]  thousands and thousands of other prominent people see what's happening. Professors and
[46:33.540 --> 46:42.700]  scientists and historians and psychologists and Keith Oberman and everybody else can see
[46:42.700 --> 46:47.980]  it for clearly what it is. But Keith Oberman just thinks it's George Bush. You watch when
[46:47.980 --> 46:53.340]  George Bush leaves office is if he does, he certainly got the gun loaded, cocked into
[46:53.340 --> 46:59.820]  the head. But remember, he's just a functionary. They pass the baton. He may engage it. Somebody
[46:59.820 --> 47:08.740]  else may engage it. This is world ending type stuff, your personal world, my personal world.
[47:08.740 --> 47:15.820]  And my sense of urgency has never been this strong. It has never been this intense. It
[47:15.820 --> 47:27.420]  has never been this focused. They tell you it's patriotic to get rid of all the protections
[47:27.420 --> 47:36.260]  you have. While the courts rule, you have no property rights. While the courts rule,
[47:36.260 --> 47:41.660]  the police without drugs even being found, without money, anything, just they take whatever
[47:41.660 --> 47:46.080]  they want. I mean, I've got Supreme Court and state and federal court rulings where
[47:46.080 --> 47:54.860]  they take old ladies $5,000 out of their mattress. All over the country, cops respond
[47:54.860 --> 47:59.580]  to an 85 year old woman, man, old railway worker. They come into the house because the
[47:59.580 --> 48:05.180]  guys broke his hip. They go in the closet. They get a shoebox full of cash. They just
[48:05.180 --> 48:09.980]  take it and they say, you shouldn't have this. I read this in the paper. I mean, we're
[48:09.980 --> 48:16.340]  in trouble. A lot of your police now are felons, illegal aliens that were legalized. Large
[48:16.340 --> 48:23.620]  portions of the military are. The government has basically stopped audits of big companies.
[48:23.620 --> 48:28.700]  They don't even have to pay taxes basically now. Lee Iacoke is talking about that. I mean,
[48:28.700 --> 48:32.660]  he says corporate criminals have taken over the government. That's a quote. I mean, it's
[48:32.660 --> 48:38.100]  full bore looting everything with brainwashed cops on power trips who've been told by their
[48:38.100 --> 48:54.740]  higher ups, go wild, do whatever you want. We are in a red level emergency. And even
[48:54.740 --> 48:59.100]  if they just decide to continue to implode the economy, which they're doing incrementally,
[48:59.100 --> 49:08.300]  but faster and faster, they are ramping up the police, ramping up the prisons, ramping
[49:08.300 --> 49:16.020]  up the surveillance. But if I've analyzed their whole attack pattern and it's not just economy,
[49:16.020 --> 49:23.300]  it's got terror and war involved in it. Just like Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that
[49:23.300 --> 49:28.020]  9 11 helped Israel. The neocons have said 9 11 help the government. The neocons wrote
[49:28.020 --> 49:32.380]  all these memos, public documents saying we need to be hit by terrorists and hit hard.
[49:32.380 --> 49:37.380]  And boy, another 9 11 would be great. They even they think you're so dumb. They kill
[49:37.380 --> 49:43.420]  people in and throw them in the Austin River bound and gagged and then say it's a suicide.
[49:43.420 --> 49:51.420]  They think you're so dumb. They write syndicated columns saying a new 9 11 would be wonderful.
[49:51.420 --> 50:05.300]  And then you don't understand they're behind it. Gary Hart, who has all rights, a letter
[50:05.300 --> 50:09.740]  to augment energy last year saying the US government stages terror attacks. You better
[50:09.740 --> 50:17.100]  do as we say. I mean, he wrote a letter, but he didn't say it like, Oh, I'm tattling on
[50:17.100 --> 50:21.660]  this for the US news. He says, give up all your rights. We're about to be nuked. Once
[50:21.660 --> 50:26.500]  we're hit, martial law will be here for your own good. But foreign, he just goes, Hey,
[50:26.500 --> 50:34.580]  do what we say. We stage terror. They are. They think so little of you that they have
[50:34.580 --> 50:41.500]  basically said they're the terrorist, but they know you're so afraid of them that you
[50:41.500 --> 50:46.980]  mentally won't admit it to yourself as they admit it. I'm going to cover financial news,
[50:46.980 --> 50:54.180]  more news and take your phone calls 1-800-259-9231.

[53:53.580 --> 54:20.820]  Think about how cold-blooded it is. A corporate elite who've been studying psychology and
[54:20.820 --> 54:27.540]  human behavior for 100 years at a scientific level. They instinctively did it and had handbooks
[54:27.540 --> 54:34.620]  thousands of years ago on how to dumb people down and control them. But dumbing you down
[54:34.620 --> 54:41.900]  incrementally over 100 years ago, I've got copies of it, the American Banking Association
[54:41.900 --> 54:46.780]  saying we've got to finance schools and dumb people down and make sure they don't know
[54:46.780 --> 54:52.380]  how to read. We've got to change the educational system. These people are too smart. So the
[54:52.380 --> 54:57.500]  feds later form the Department of Education to make sure that happens. And you try to
[54:57.500 --> 55:04.300]  tell the public that they'll never go look it up even if you give them the documents.
[55:04.300 --> 55:07.900]  And then to know that for the last 25 years they've been training the military secretly
[55:07.900 --> 55:15.020]  with police, building FEMA camps. They had them before but really accelerating in the
[55:15.020 --> 55:20.980]  last quarter century to know that they have been doing everything they can in banking
[55:20.980 --> 55:26.540]  and credit cards and credit to get governments, federal, state, local and as much debt as
[55:26.540 --> 55:31.180]  possible to get the citizens in as much debt, to have the universities and high schools
[55:31.180 --> 55:37.620]  teach them to get credit cards and teach you to get in debt. That's come out now mainstream
[55:37.620 --> 55:41.180]  news about how they have programs written by the credit card companies to get the young
[55:41.180 --> 55:45.660]  people in debt. All about bankrupting the country so they can cold bloodedly come in
[55:45.660 --> 55:49.900]  and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar like they did hundreds of third world countries
[55:49.900 --> 55:57.340]  over and over and over again. Third world countries are third world predominantly because
[55:57.340 --> 56:03.900]  they have ruling tiny cliques that run them who every 30 years or so devalue the currency
[56:03.900 --> 56:10.020]  as a way they say to destroy the middle class which might compete with them. They love being
[56:10.020 --> 56:18.940]  up in big armored palaces in the hills over the third world cities. Mexico with more billionaires
[56:18.940 --> 56:26.020]  than any other country per capita. India, China, the United States, Europe, it's all
[56:26.020 --> 56:34.940]  happening. It's warfare. And to see them, no one has ever spent this many decades, no
[56:34.940 --> 56:39.700]  one has ever spent this much time making sure they were going to win, making sure it was
[56:39.700 --> 56:46.980]  going to work, making sure it was all in place. The U.S. has been the target the whole time.
[56:46.980 --> 56:58.260]  Not Iraq, not Afghanistan, not Qaddafi, not Libya, not Sudan, not Somalia. We've been
[56:58.260 --> 57:02.780]  the target just like South Africa was the target, just like Serbia was the target.
[57:02.780 --> 57:09.820]  Many sovereign industrial nations, but we have been the big prize. And as they took
[57:09.820 --> 57:14.540]  over each institution, they cranked it up, they ramped it up, they leveraged its debt,
[57:14.540 --> 57:19.260]  they grabbed every commodity and every real asset. I know I just keep harping on it.
[57:19.260 --> 57:27.660]  It's just so evil. The plan is so massive. And I've analyzed and we've had hundreds
[57:27.660 --> 57:32.780]  of top experts on to analyze the finances. We've got more government, former government
[57:32.780 --> 57:41.380]  analysts coming on this week to break it down. I mean, this is total bankruptcy. And by the
[57:41.380 --> 57:44.460]  way, you think just because you're not in debt or you don't have stocks and bonds, you're
[57:44.460 --> 57:49.380]  going to be okay? Crime rate is exploding everywhere already and we haven't even gone
[57:49.380 --> 57:53.380]  down yet. We've started the curve downward. We're right there on the hump where it starts
[57:53.380 --> 57:57.980]  to go down and it just goes down and down and down and down and down and it don't come
[57:57.980 --> 58:06.340]  back up. It doesn't come back, baby. Unless we put the brakes on it right now, demonize
[58:06.340 --> 58:11.940]  the government, demonize the bankers that own them, expose the IMF World Bank documents,
[58:11.940 --> 58:17.100]  how they plan to do this here and other places. If we don't realize massively right now who
[58:17.100 --> 58:21.500]  the enemy is and have a huge awakening that spreads like wildfire right now, they're going
[58:21.500 --> 58:28.380]  to win. You can't do it once they fully got us down on the ground. You understand? This
[58:28.380 --> 58:32.220]  lion wants to get us in its jaws, get our neck in its jaws.

[58:44.580 --> 58:52.420]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[58:52.420 --> 58:59.380]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.380 --> 59:04.780]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[59:04.780 --> 59:13.620]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[59:13.620 --> 59:19.340]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[59:19.340 --> 59:23.860]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress for
[59:23.860 --> 59:26.940]  the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all
[59:26.940 --> 59:32.020]  the money they need. They're after power. That's their app. Order in game on DVD at

[59:46.820 --> 59:58.220]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.220 --> 1:00:06.940]  Cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:15.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. We are opening the phones up this hour. I
[1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:20.060]  want to move quickly through your calls. So many of each person about a minute and a half.
[1:00:20.060 --> 1:00:27.500]  How many times have I said that? Well, I've been getting better and better at it. 1-800-259-9231.
[1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:36.340]  My studio number, if you've got a limited long distance, is 512-646-5400. 512-646-5400.
[1:00:36.340 --> 1:00:41.860]  I said I was going to get to all this news first before I went to calls, but I'm behind
[1:00:41.860 --> 1:00:46.620]  as usual. That's why we've added a fourth hour. Fourth hour officially on the network
[1:00:46.620 --> 1:00:58.580]  today, on the Star Guide feed, on the Genesis Internet feed, on the SCPC satellite feed,
[1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:06.740]  and on WWCR today. In that fourth hour, you will be able to pick up the show. We're very
[1:01:06.740 --> 1:01:10.940]  thankful to all the affiliates out there. I am going to go to your calls in the next
[1:01:10.940 --> 1:01:15.620]  segment, and then I'm going to cover this news. We do have two important guests coming
[1:01:15.620 --> 1:01:23.220]  on as well in the third and fourth hour. U.S. jets dropped bombs on Saunders City. Bush
[1:01:23.220 --> 1:01:28.060]  Harper called Iran to defend trade, talk amid backlash in U.S. I mean, this is just some
[1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:37.100]  of the news I've got here. Burglaries have surged 21% in D.C. I don't need police statistics
[1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:40.820]  to tell me they've gone up. Crimes gone up in Austin last year. We don't have this year's
[1:01:40.820 --> 1:01:46.140]  numbers yet. I haven't run into crime statistics on a daily basis, and it's up everywhere,
[1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:51.060]  every form of crime, by the way, and you ain't seen nothing yet, but I don't need to have
[1:01:51.060 --> 1:01:57.500]  the police tell me it's up. I know it's up. People's houses, their cars are getting robbed,
[1:01:57.500 --> 1:02:03.060]  and that's another little fun side effect of the economy going down, and that is why
[1:02:03.060 --> 1:02:07.740]  the establishment, knowing they were going to do this, has said, I don't know, what's
[1:02:07.740 --> 1:02:14.780]  300 cops to 2 million cops? How many increases that? Is that like an eight-fold? I'm going
[1:02:14.780 --> 1:02:22.580]  off top of my head. What's 300,000 to 2 million? Is that an eight-fold increase? I'm just
[1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:27.820]  off the top of my head. Let's do it on a piece of paper. Let's see if off the top
[1:02:27.820 --> 1:02:32.060]  of my head, I'm right, because, you know, they got to protect all their banks and stuff
[1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:36.620]  while they take all our houses and suck everything dry from the rabble. Of course, they won't
[1:02:36.620 --> 1:02:40.260]  show up at your house when you get robbed, like when mine's been robbed or when your
[1:02:40.260 --> 1:02:50.500]  car's stolen, but they will if you're an elitist or the mayor, or it's a what? 64? Six-fold
[1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:55.260]  increase? Okay, see my mask. I just topped my head. 300,000 to 2 million. It's sounding
[1:02:55.260 --> 1:03:03.500]  like an eight increase. Six. Is it a six-point something? Six-point what? Six-point six,
[1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:09.860]  six times plus the number of police, and they say they're only going to get more, and then
[1:03:09.860 --> 1:03:16.300]  auxiliary tattletale citizens everywhere. I mean, I rest my case in road to tyranny with
[1:03:16.300 --> 1:03:23.420]  local Austin infomercials. It's on local Austin television. Going, turn your parents in. Here's
[1:03:23.420 --> 1:03:28.860]  the $200 to do it. You have your own police tattletale card with phone number. Get money.
[1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:36.420]  Tattle on your neighbors. Tattle on other kids. I mean, I just rest my case. I'm living in
[1:03:36.420 --> 1:03:40.140]  total La La Land. But let me just cover this first, and we're going to come back and go
[1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:45.380]  right to your calls. U.S. jets dropped bombs on Sotter City. U.S. warplanes have dropped
[1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:49.020]  bombs on East Baghdad district of Sotter City where hundreds of civilians have already been
[1:03:49.020 --> 1:03:53.780]  killed in airstrikes. Residents said low-flying jets dropped bombs in sector 2224 of Sotter
[1:03:53.780 --> 1:03:59.420]  City around midnight, 21 GMT Sunday. I was listening to Fox News yesterday during my Sunday
[1:03:59.420 --> 1:04:06.620]  show. The local station I, the show originates out of, carries it, and it said, Colombo Lisa
[1:04:06.620 --> 1:04:15.780]  Rice teased and made fun of Sotter, who says he will release all out war. If the Iraq forces
[1:04:15.780 --> 1:04:22.900]  don't stop trying to kill him and killing his militia. And then other newscasts later
[1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:28.620]  were like, he's threatening all out war for no reason. They've broken truces with him
[1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:35.380]  three times by trying to sneak attack him. I mean, it's just, it's total treachery. The
[1:04:35.380 --> 1:04:40.260]  bad guys make truces and then try to kill you, but that's not enough. Then when they
[1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:46.180]  try to, when they're treacherous, they then say he's the bad guy for defending himself.
[1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:51.100]  And then they say he's Al Qaeda, which is Wahhabi, the opposite group. Her beloved Republic
[1:04:51.100 --> 1:04:55.940]  is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:04:55.940 --> 1:05:00.060]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people
[1:05:00.060 --> 1:05:04.340]  are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow
[1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:08.380]  man's understanding of the new world order master plan. We have a short time frame to
[1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:13.660]  fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the info war, prisonplanet.tv

[1:06:50.540 --> 1:06:54.540]  Gasoline prices are out of control. Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to
[1:06:54.540 --> 1:06:58.700]  the major oil companies? Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products
[1:06:58.700 --> 1:07:02.900]  to increase mileage in their own vehicles? Very few consumers even know such products
[1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:08.060]  exist. SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies
[1:07:08.060 --> 1:07:12.300]  have run yet they don't want you to know about them. This product is made right here
[1:07:12.300 --> 1:07:17.420]  in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store. SFR
[1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:23.900]  last up to six months. SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars. SFR recently
[1:07:23.900 --> 1:07:28.060]  ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they
[1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:33.340]  are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one
[1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:38.300]  free of charge. If you are not completely delighted with the savings SFR will refund
[1:07:38.300 --> 1:07:43.300]  the purchase price and shipping. Share in the oil company secret and get SFR now. Call

[1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:12.380]  disease hits up to you. You can even wage an endless war that will cripple America's
[1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:18.980]  economy with the three trillion dollars shopping spree. Anything's possible. Bill in Los Angeles
[1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:28.260]  bought 100,000 luxury yachts, 20,000 sprawling estates and 650,000 private islands. Mary in
[1:08:28.260 --> 1:08:35.820]  Michigan gave health care to all Americans and still had $2.8 trillion left over. George
[1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:44.060]  B. in Washington started an illegal war that resulted in 151,000 dead Iraqi civilians. Gary
[1:08:44.060 --> 1:08:51.980]  in Indiana bought 1.5 billion pounds of beluga caviar. Debbie in New York bought 500 schools
[1:08:51.980 --> 1:09:00.940]  in her home state and still had $2,987 billion left for school supplies. Donald R. in Arlington
[1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:07.300]  Virginia destabilized an entire region and displaced 4 million innocent people. What
[1:09:07.300 --> 1:09:28.940]  will you do with $3 trillion? Go to www.3trillion.org and spend, spend, spend. Yeah, that's Robert
[1:09:28.940 --> 1:09:34.180]  Greenwald's new film coming out. We'll definitely carry that here. Yeah, three trillion so far
[1:09:34.180 --> 1:09:38.620]  and that's not counting all the medical care and expense later and most of that of course
[1:09:38.620 --> 1:09:44.700]  went right into private corporations pockets who have moved their operations to Dubai,
[1:09:44.700 --> 1:09:50.740]  Ecuador, Israel. Yeah, the entire neocon good old boy, the major oil companies, they're
[1:09:50.740 --> 1:09:55.180]  just all leaving the country because in the words of one person I know that's worth $6
[1:09:55.180 --> 1:10:02.380]  billion, the country quote won't be here anymore, but quote I'm not going to tell you why. For
[1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:07.020]  the last three years and this is from the great run and people I know and folks in Hollywood
[1:10:07.020 --> 1:10:12.420]  that are high up producer level, not the actors. Well, some actors have fled to Costa Rica as
[1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:19.180]  you know, because they can see the writing on the wall. To give an analogy, the elite
[1:10:19.180 --> 1:10:28.940]  are hanging off helicopter skids like it was Saigon falling in 75 or was it 74? I mean,
[1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:35.980]  they're just running with fear escaping the country. Boy, very nice elite that they are
[1:10:35.980 --> 1:10:40.580]  scrambling with their families out of the country. I don't just mean they've got private
[1:10:40.580 --> 1:10:46.340]  islands with armed guards. Oh, they got those. I mean, they're not staying here anymore.
[1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:52.180]  That's how loving the government is. That's how friendly they are. You think the Arabs
[1:10:52.180 --> 1:10:57.900]  getting the ports? You think the total handover of the infrastructure is bad? No, no, no,
[1:10:57.900 --> 1:11:08.020]  no. This is economic warhead with a asymmetrical martial law police state overlay ordered out
[1:11:08.020 --> 1:11:13.300]  of KO. Okay, I'm going to shut up now. I just want to keep, I just want to warn people.
[1:11:13.300 --> 1:11:19.300]  We're going to go to John, Robert, KC, Peggy, Scott, Gordon, Dr. Bob, Louise and others.
[1:11:19.300 --> 1:11:24.180]  Let's first take some calls from my in studio system. Gordon in Austin, Texas. You're on
[1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:29.860]  the air. Hey, Alex, how's it going? Good. Hey, I'm a first time caller in about three
[1:11:29.860 --> 1:11:38.180]  years now moved out here from the Bay Area, Oakland, about three years ago. What's that?
[1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:43.540]  Go ahead, sir. Oh, I'm sorry. And, uh, you know, some of the ponders, honestly, uh,
[1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:46.580]  I thought you were more amusing than anything at first. I'd never heard anything like it,
[1:11:46.580 --> 1:11:52.220]  but, uh, you've won me over on a lot of issues. I'm definitely, uh, trying to sell people
[1:11:52.220 --> 1:11:57.060]  on the idea that 9-11 was an inside job and, uh, converting my Irish over to gold, get
[1:11:57.060 --> 1:12:02.020]  silver coins, all that. But anyway, what I wanted to share was, uh, three different
[1:12:02.020 --> 1:12:06.700]  instances of people I know who have, uh, suffered under this kind of new charity that's going
[1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:14.980]  on. Um, one was a coworker of my wife who is a, uh, employee at the UT law school who
[1:12:14.980 --> 1:12:22.980]  was strip search at the Portland airport for no reason. Um, another is a student I have.
[1:12:22.980 --> 1:12:29.940]  I think she's probably, I think she's 13. I teach guitar and, uh, she was taken to the
[1:12:29.940 --> 1:12:34.980]  principal's office because she had a metronome in her locker that was ticking and they started
[1:12:34.980 --> 1:12:39.860]  asking her about the bomb. Her and her friend shut down the school asking these girls about
[1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:45.900]  the bomb in there because her metronome was going off. And by the way, that's part of
[1:12:45.900 --> 1:12:52.020]  the mass schizophrenia of drills and martial law drills with thousands of federalized police
[1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:56.340]  just randomly stopping everyone and freaking out. It's all part of a mass mental illness
[1:12:56.340 --> 1:13:02.700]  of just, I mean, that's what it is. Again, this is psychological warfare. Go ahead and
[1:13:02.700 --> 1:13:07.100]  tell me about the third terrorist. Uh, the third is a friend of mine who lives in Kyle
[1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:14.300]  and, uh, he's had two separate visits now from CPS. Uh, he's a stay at home dad and,
[1:13:14.300 --> 1:13:19.340]  uh, the latest one, Sam, just from, uh, one of his three year old girls was in front of
[1:13:19.340 --> 1:13:25.380]  his house playing, um, in the grass on the sidewalk there and a cop decided that he
[1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:32.060]  was being negligent and turned him into CPS to then without notifying him, uh, interviewed
[1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:36.740]  his daughter, his older daughter at school later on, asking her questions about the whole
[1:13:36.740 --> 1:13:37.740]  country.
[1:13:37.740 --> 1:13:41.300]  Well, sir, the whole country is gone. It's, it's, and they're hiring more and more bureaucrats,
[1:13:41.300 --> 1:13:47.220]  more and more cops, one 10th of high, uh, of college graduates now to serve the Homeland
[1:13:47.220 --> 1:13:53.700]  Security grid, which is child snatching, snatching your parents and euthanizing them. Folks,
[1:13:53.700 --> 1:13:59.620]  I'm not kidding. It is a hell grid of control and it hasn't even begun yet. Wait till they
[1:13:59.620 --> 1:14:04.380]  implode the economy. They are just going to turn them loose to shoot whoever they want,
[1:14:04.380 --> 1:14:09.380]  kill whoever they want. I'm not joking folks. It is going to be hell released.
[1:14:09.380 --> 1:14:10.380]  Right.
[1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:11.380]  Anything else?
[1:14:11.380 --> 1:14:16.500]  Oh, well, no, I just want to share those stories. I'm just a normal middle-class guy with normal
[1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:20.740]  non-criminal friends, you know, who, uh, you know, I mean, the one that really blew me
[1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:24.660]  away was this woman that got strip search, you know, mother of two, just doing a business
[1:14:24.660 --> 1:14:27.020]  trip and she ended up getting strip search by TSA.
[1:14:27.020 --> 1:14:28.740]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.420]  That level of violation is unbelievable. Thanks, Alex.
[1:14:31.420 --> 1:14:35.260]  Thank you. And I'd love to have that call around longer. We got to move quick here.
[1:14:35.260 --> 1:14:44.140]  I want to be clear with everybody. They know that the TSA stuff quote seems crazy, stupid.
[1:14:44.140 --> 1:14:50.140]  It isn't, it's meant to train you. Homeland Security said this to accept checkpoints on
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:56.820]  the roads, the malls, the schools. It's all about acclimating you. What do you think two
[1:14:56.820 --> 1:15:02.580]  million cops and tens of millions of social workers and bureaucrats are going to do? They're
[1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:08.100]  going to eat your lunch. What does the Declaration of Independence say? He has erected a multitude
[1:15:08.100 --> 1:15:15.460]  of offices and sent officers out to eat out our substance. They're going to eat out your
[1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:24.180]  substance. They're going to roll you. They're going to take what you got. This is how it
[1:15:24.180 --> 1:15:30.700]  always happens. Do you understand? And if you ever raise a fist, they're going to attack
[1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:40.700]  you. Or like last week with the former, you know, top running back, pulled over in Georgia
[1:15:40.700 --> 1:15:44.260]  for quote speeding. He gets out. He says, everything's fine. The officer's screaming
[1:15:44.260 --> 1:15:51.020]  at him. He crosses his arm. The officer says, don't make fist at me, boy. Then the guy starts
[1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:54.540]  begging with his hands politely. He puts his hands together and says, sir, everything's
[1:15:54.540 --> 1:16:00.940]  okay. The cop pushes him and then tasers him. And then the news says he was bad. The guy
[1:16:00.940 --> 1:16:10.300]  that was assaulted was bad. Do you understand? This is all psychological warfare, not letting
[1:16:10.300 --> 1:16:15.460]  you bring water out through, making you take your shoes off, strip searching women and
[1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:24.140]  world war two vets. And I've seen it. It's about training you to be a slave. Now, does
[1:16:24.140 --> 1:16:30.540]  the idiot cop know that? No. Does the fool at TSA know that? No. It's behavioral psychology.
[1:16:30.540 --> 1:16:34.700]  Let's take a phone call off my phone, not my phone system, but the network phone system.
[1:16:34.700 --> 1:16:40.140]  Robert and Indiana, you're on the air. Alex. Yes, sir. How are you doing? It's a pleasure
[1:16:40.140 --> 1:16:44.220]  to talk to you. A buddy of mine serving in Iraq introduced me to you. I've been listening
[1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:49.660]  for about six years and man, you got me going. But I'm still kind of young and I've been
[1:16:49.660 --> 1:16:55.020]  going to a lot of concerts and stuff, having a good time. And the man, I'm just seeing
[1:16:55.020 --> 1:17:00.100]  it all over in that stuff because Al Gore's got his live eight and everything. And I've
[1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:05.540]  been telling my buddies now, global problems will lead to the global government and global
[1:17:05.540 --> 1:17:11.620]  solutions. And they're using this global warming and now they got this festival coming up and
[1:17:11.620 --> 1:17:19.540]  I wish you had more time to go. They got real quick. Go ahead. Go to rockberryfestival.com.
[1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:24.260]  It's being started by this think tank group that's headed off by Steven Schneider and
[1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:30.540]  Evan Goodstein, part of the IPCC. They're buddies of Gary Hart. We got Grateful Dead.
[1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:36.660]  And again, for those that don't know, that's the United Nations, the IPCC. Grateful Dead
[1:17:36.660 --> 1:17:43.140]  had a reunion concert to fundraise Obama. It was called Barack from the dead. It's a big
[1:17:43.140 --> 1:17:46.820]  joke and everything. Everyone's all high on drugs, having a good old time. And what's
[1:17:46.820 --> 1:17:52.740]  Obama trying to do? He's trying to push that global tax on us for the carbon tax. And man,
[1:17:52.740 --> 1:17:53.740]  it's just...
[1:17:53.740 --> 1:17:54.740]  And so is Boston, so is Hillary.
[1:17:54.740 --> 1:17:59.700]  I went to the Bonnaroo before. There's another festival, Bonnaroo. Man, they got a pyramid
[1:17:59.700 --> 1:18:05.660]  in the middle of the concert field, made out of recycling bottles with the peak stone missing.
[1:18:05.660 --> 1:18:10.500]  And it says, you know, save the world, recycle, all over. You know, tools have been there,
[1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:14.300]  say Tana Group, Metallica's going to play there this year, Pearl Jam's going to play
[1:18:14.300 --> 1:18:19.780]  there this year, Grateful Dead's been there before, and Led Zeppelin. They are horrible.
[1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:25.340]  They are totally feeding us with drugs, making us all loopy. And then we go to these damn
[1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:30.100]  festivals, and everyone is just like, oh, we're saving the world. And these hippies,
[1:18:30.100 --> 1:18:34.500]  they drive their cars and spend all the money on the food, the gas, the garbage. And then
[1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:37.780]  they got to clean it up, and they think that they're saving the world, and they're just
[1:18:37.780 --> 1:18:38.780]  feeding the system.
[1:18:38.780 --> 1:18:39.780]  I hear you and I...
[1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:41.900]  And then they got to go back home.
[1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:46.620]  I'm glad you're mad. You should be. Thanks for the call. Yes, I don't want to say everybody
[1:18:46.620 --> 1:18:52.900]  that goes to Bonnaroo is evil. They mean well, but yes, that's in Tennessee, isn't it? They
[1:18:52.900 --> 1:19:01.180]  go to that... Look, Al Gore says he wants to recruit 10 million people. They know how
[1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:06.340]  to make it fun. It's the youth. So they recruit them at parties, at concerts, at all of these
[1:19:06.340 --> 1:19:12.620]  events. They make it fun, cool, go green. If you went green, you'd ban these cross-species
[1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:17.540]  GMO crops. If you went green, you would stop the legalization of dumping toxic waste in
[1:19:17.540 --> 1:19:24.660]  the ocean. You see, it's a cover for all the real environmental destruction that's happening.
[1:19:24.660 --> 1:19:31.380]  And so they're recruiting an army of literal cult members, kind of like Mao's Cultural
[1:19:31.380 --> 1:19:35.540]  Revolution, to go out and carry all of this out, and most of them mean well. So you're
[1:19:35.540 --> 1:19:41.140]  absolutely right. By the way, a huge global warming conference in Canada got shut down
[1:19:41.140 --> 1:19:46.540]  by a huge blizzard. The worst on record, coldest winter in modern history. Absolute bull. Got
[1:19:46.540 --> 1:19:50.940]  some news on that. More of your calls. Stay there. We'll be right back.
[1:19:50.940 --> 1:19:58.780]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:19:58.780 --> 1:20:05.740]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:11.140]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:19.980]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[1:20:19.980 --> 1:20:25.660]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[1:20:25.660 --> 1:20:30.180]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress toward
[1:20:30.180 --> 1:20:33.380]  a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the
[1:20:33.380 --> 1:20:38.300]  money they need. They're after power. That's their after easy. Order in game on DVD at

[1:22:49.300 --> 1:22:54.100]  Fact. Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:59.420]  world health is staggering. We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals
[1:22:59.420 --> 1:23:04.540]  each day. The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[1:23:04.540 --> 1:23:10.100]  in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins. The solution. Detoxification integrated

[1:24:17.780 --> 1:24:22.260]  Alright, let's blast into your calls. Let's take another network call. Casey in Oklahoma,
[1:24:22.260 --> 1:24:23.260]  you're on the air.
[1:24:23.260 --> 1:24:24.260]  Yeah, hi, Alexis. Casey.
[1:24:24.260 --> 1:24:25.260]  Good to talk to you.
[1:24:25.260 --> 1:24:31.540]  Good to talk to you. Hey, I just wanted to tell you, I just ordered the blowout special
[1:24:31.540 --> 1:24:38.540]  on the InfoWare Store and I got the VHS tapes. I had a great idea that I don't have a DVD
[1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:47.460]  burner in my computer, but I've got a DVD slash VHS burner and I'm going to go ahead
[1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:54.660]  and start burning the copy over the VHS to DVDs and start handing it out to people that
[1:24:54.660 --> 1:24:59.740]  way because I think, you know, get the word out to as many people as I can. I mean, I
[1:24:59.740 --> 1:25:06.740]  was just, I've been watching a few of them. I rode a tyranny, a tear storm, and I just
[1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:13.700]  came onto you a few months ago after listening to Coast to Coast one night and, you know,
[1:25:13.700 --> 1:25:17.180]  my eyes have been open and now they're open even more. I mean, I watched Endgame a couple
[1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:22.220]  months ago and now I'm watching these and it's just like, wow. But I also wanted to
[1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:27.660]  tell you something. I got pulled over last week here in Oklahoma and I haven't been pulled
[1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:33.140]  over in probably three years and I got pulled over by a cop car. They were working tag team.
[1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:38.140]  There was an on my car and I saw it and then another cop car that actually pulled me over
[1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:42.100]  at a stop sign and they said I rolled through the stop sign, which I didn't do and they
[1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:44.860]  ended up giving me a warning, but I thought, you know, isn't that kind of odd?
[1:25:44.860 --> 1:25:50.020]  No, no, and they're still moral. They're immoral. They violated the Fourth Amendment,
[1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:54.460]  but they're moral and that they didn't give you a ticket because you weren't really speeding.
[1:25:54.460 --> 1:26:00.060]  That was a search, sir. They're telling them to randomly pull people over that quote, don't
[1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:04.620]  break the traffic laws under the guise they say, because it's anti-terror. This is in
[1:26:04.620 --> 1:26:12.060]  the memos, but, but so they can go after regular citizens. It is, it is martial law training.
[1:26:12.060 --> 1:26:17.020]  Yeah, it's just, it's just awful. I'm, you know, I'm, that way in the future, they can
[1:26:17.020 --> 1:26:21.740]  run your tags if you're on the red list for pickup to go to an extermination facility.
[1:26:21.740 --> 1:26:25.660]  They'll never even know they're sending you to be killed. Uh, and those are run mainly
[1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:30.820]  by foreigners and I'm not joking around listeners. This isn't a joke. I don't say this for effect
[1:26:30.820 --> 1:26:35.140]  or if you're going to be sent to a forced labor facility, you know, yeah, it's interesting,
[1:26:35.140 --> 1:26:39.100]  Alex, because I'm not originally from Oklahoma, but I've been here for a while and it seems
[1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:43.620]  like of all the, uh, uh, the places I lived at, you know, people joke about go home and
[1:26:43.620 --> 1:26:48.420]  say, uh, uh, oh, geez, and things are backwards here. But, you know, interestingly enough,
[1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:53.020]  fairly, you know, we're still kind of secluded from the police state here to some extent.
[1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:57.020]  I mean, there's not traffic cameras really in, in the cities yet. There's a couple here
[1:26:57.020 --> 1:27:02.220]  and there, uh, but the license plates aren't the kind that they can, you know, automatically
[1:27:02.220 --> 1:27:05.460]  they, you know, read some easily. I mean, they have the cameras that do it still, of
[1:27:05.460 --> 1:27:11.260]  course, but well, here's the problem. There are too many police now and not enough crime.
[1:27:11.260 --> 1:27:15.700]  They're not allowed to go after illegals. And so they go after us, the fat dumb cattle.
[1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:19.540]  Now that's what they're told. They just think they're getting revenue off the fat cattle,
[1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:22.580]  but this is really martial law training. Good to hear from you, sir. Keep up the great
[1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:28.140]  work. God bless you. Let's take a call off my board. Let's talk to Dr. Bob in California.
[1:27:28.140 --> 1:27:32.220]  You're on the air, Bob. Alex, great talking to you. You're the hero of the nation. And
[1:27:32.220 --> 1:27:36.860]  I want to thank you for your work. I want to give you heads up next Monday, April 28th,
[1:27:36.860 --> 1:27:42.580]  the American driver truck strike on Washington, Washington, D.C. over 5,000 trucks are moving
[1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:47.220]  there, combined with the 911 truth of the movement. And then on, on to a New York City
[1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:52.820]  May 1st. But I think this is our, our, our last chance to do something and then stop
[1:27:52.820 --> 1:28:00.420]  D.C. and get some real press. Well, you notice diesel now is above $4 a gallon. The, all of
[1:28:00.420 --> 1:28:04.860]  us, a lot of people say, I don't care if them truckers pay that. Hey, idiots, that cost
[1:28:04.860 --> 1:28:09.700]  gets passed on to you. See a lot of Americans now who aren't good people, most of us still
[1:28:09.700 --> 1:28:15.020]  are decent. Think it's only about them. And so they laugh. Everybody else is misfortune.
[1:28:15.020 --> 1:28:21.060]  You pay in higher prices when the truckers are, are, are having to do that. And they're
[1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:27.420]  talking about $5 diesel. They're talking about $5 normal gas. I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:33.060]  Well, 70% of all commerce is moved by trucks. And I thought it was 80. I thought it was
[1:28:33.060 --> 1:28:37.500]  80. Yeah, you know, whatever you, you and I know that that diesel is a byproduct from
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:40.060]  gasoline. It should be one fifth the price of a gallon of gasoline.
[1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:44.220]  No, no, it's in fact news articles and lawsuits have been filed. It's definitely part of a
[1:28:44.220 --> 1:28:45.220]  staged event.
[1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:49.300]  Well, these criminals, I mean, it's our last chance to try and get our country back and
[1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:54.780]  combine with the truth movement. But you know, Monday, April 28th, you know, this is one
[1:28:54.780 --> 1:29:01.260]  chance to finally, you know, stop D.C. and his tracks and get some real media attention.
[1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:06.980]  And also a lot of the European media is coming over for this also. But it's insane what's
[1:29:06.980 --> 1:29:11.180]  going on. As you know, I mean, the city is just a mind boggling. I'm a pilot of mixed
[1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:15.820]  air force. The mechanical prototype is an engineer as a welder fabricator for many years. Nothing
[1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:23.140]  they said on that date was possible except in cartoon. It's certainly insulting and ridiculous.
[1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:27.780]  But the public can't find the U.S. on a map. So if the feds blow up some buildings and
[1:29:27.780 --> 1:29:31.700]  tell them people it was jet fuel, they're going to believe it. Hey, folks, jet fuel doesn't
[1:29:31.700 --> 1:29:37.340]  make buildings disintegrate and spray over several miles. Only high powered explosives.
[1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:42.740]  Thank you, sir. More calls straight ahead. Stay with me. We're on the March, the empires
[1:29:42.740 --> 1:29:52.420]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Doctors around the world claim that cancer
[1:29:52.420 --> 1:29:57.300]  and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment. But as you know, most
[1:29:57.300 --> 1:30:02.820]  people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise. pH balance is the
[1:30:02.820 --> 1:30:07.420]  foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease. People
[1:30:07.420 --> 1:30:12.020]  who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and
[1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:16.380]  loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water. But due to
[1:30:16.380 --> 1:30:21.100]  modern way of life, most people are overly acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:25.940]  exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular
[1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:32.100]  basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now. Alcovision

[1:30:49.020 --> 1:30:56.020]  Doing things. I am Dr. Buell Von Schein with the White Paper Chronicles. Mr. Steve Schenck with this
[1:30:56.020 --> 1:31:01.220]  Fearless Radio program is correct when he says the solution to our difficult times is to store
[1:31:01.220 --> 1:31:07.300]  food and get healthy. My comrades and I of the media don't want you to panic. We, unlike Fearless
[1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:13.300]  Radio, try not to tell you about the food control legislation. Hurricane Katrina, the American famine,
[1:31:13.300 --> 1:31:18.100]  families unable to buy food. If we told you the solution to all these problems,
[1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:23.460]  this is food you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it disappeared or you couldn't afford it,
[1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:29.140]  you'd completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control and then kick us out of the
[1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:36.020]  Survivors Club. You are a sissy chicken if you call JMSEfoodsDirect.com and order food. This is

[1:33:14.220 --> 1:33:32.540]  focus on the pain. The only thing that's real. The needle tears the hole. The old familiar
[1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:53.820]  sting. Try to kill it all away. But I remember everything. What have I become? My sweetest
[1:33:53.820 --> 1:34:15.420]  friend. Everyone I know goes away in the end. And you could have it all. My empire of dirt.
[1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:30.300]  I will let you down. I will make you hurt. So many of you have sold out your soul, your
[1:34:30.300 --> 1:34:41.580]  name, everything you are for pieces of silver. Your soul, your life is about standing up against
[1:34:41.580 --> 1:34:52.860]  evil. It's about loving. It's about having courage. It's not about wearing a black uniform
[1:34:52.860 --> 1:35:01.900]  and bossing your pathetic, haggard, overworked American citizens on their way home with kids
[1:35:01.900 --> 1:35:07.260]  that are in trouble and bills that are piling up to be pulled over by you randomly because
[1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:14.620]  you're searching for terrorists. Just absolutely criminal. Here's the deal. I got a lot I want
[1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:19.500]  to get to, a lot of news, but I also love your calls in the different directions. You take us in.
[1:35:20.220 --> 1:35:24.780]  Two different films that we're carrying. So we're going to your calls in a second,
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:28.700]  but we're going to be fast about it. We're going pretty quick today. American Drug War,
[1:35:28.700 --> 1:35:32.380]  the last wide hope. We have met the enemy and it's our own government. I'm glad that a lot of
[1:35:32.380 --> 1:35:38.700]  these are going out our door because it's a film I consulted on. It's a film I'm in and it really
[1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:43.180]  will wake up people that still believe in the phony drug war. And this is an info war. The
[1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:49.580]  propaganda is that ship the drugs in and still got some of the public, only about 30% for it.
[1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:54.140]  That's right. More than 70% are against it, but notice it doesn't stop because we're not a free
[1:35:54.140 --> 1:35:58.460]  country. We're a country where the criminals run things and want their product to be illegal so
[1:35:58.460 --> 1:36:03.420]  they get higher prices and can imprison your kids, but we're going to wake up the other 20% or so
[1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:08.300]  that, that aren't cops and government people. It's going to end up being five, six, seven percent
[1:36:08.300 --> 1:36:13.500]  there for it. And then it's just going to fall apart. Kind of like in Colorado at one university
[1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:19.180]  yesterday, 10,000 people came outside and fired up marijuana. By the way, I don't think it's cool
[1:36:19.180 --> 1:36:25.580]  or funny or neat. I don't like marijuana. It literally makes me paranoid mess, but my point
[1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:29.500]  is it doesn't most people. So more power to you want to smoke it. It's a lot better than alcohol
[1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:33.340]  for your body and your mind. Not saying it's good. By the way, I don't worship it like some of you
[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:39.900]  do, but right there, that's the defiance and it's basically being decriminalized on a city by city
[1:36:39.900 --> 1:36:47.020]  basis. 20 something states have tried to decriminalize and the feds have said no. So I'm already ranting
[1:36:47.020 --> 1:36:50.780]  about the drug war. Now I'm going to go to your calls. The point is that we are going to take
[1:36:50.780 --> 1:36:55.900]  your market away drug dealers. Then the government will just come out with super hardcore synthetic
[1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:59.740]  drugs that magically come out of factories that they own and control and they'll bust you for
[1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:04.780]  having them, but never bust their factories. But it doesn't matter. The people understand who's behind
[1:37:04.780 --> 1:37:11.100]  it and understand it's a false paradigm. American drug war. The last white hope, infowars.com
[1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:20.380]  or call 888-253-339 to order. Also, William Lewis's new film, which is again, I think it's the new
[1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:26.940]  America freedom to fascism. It is so good. It exposes the whole new order system. The police state
[1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:34.380]  very well done. This is such an important film. Washington, you're fired infowars.com to order
[1:37:34.380 --> 1:37:46.300]  via the safe secure online shopping cart or call toll 3888-253-3139-888-253-3139.
[1:37:46.300 --> 1:37:57.980]  Or write to me, Alex Jones at 3,001. South Lamar, sweet 100. Austin, Texas, 787-04. American
[1:37:57.980 --> 1:38:02.380]  drug war in Washington. You're fired. You can also get discounts on those films when you get them
[1:38:02.380 --> 1:38:09.260]  with my videos like in game and terror storm. Okay. That said, I've been giving each caller
[1:38:09.260 --> 1:38:12.380]  about three minutes. I got to give you each a minute now because if I don't do that, I won't
[1:38:12.380 --> 1:38:18.380]  get to the next person. Let's talk to Louise in mass. You're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. This
[1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:23.900]  is Louise and I'm just getting disgusted with all the news and I'm so depressed, but I want to do
[1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:30.220]  something. And I was thinking, what if we got a network of people, state to state, town to town,
[1:38:30.220 --> 1:38:39.100]  and just went to our local offices or to the city's main, wherever they do their their government,
[1:38:39.100 --> 1:38:47.020]  and just tell them we don't want to have any more federalized money for our cops. We don't
[1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:54.220]  want any more federalized money for state troopers. And if the law enforcement won't,
[1:38:54.220 --> 1:38:59.900]  you know, follow this, maybe we can fire them and just volunteer as citizens and do our own
[1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:05.340]  policing. Well, here's the problem. Now, the average cop doesn't know this. They won't hire
[1:39:05.340 --> 1:39:09.420]  one over 100 IQ now. And that's mainstream news. If you don't believe me, listeners can Google it,
[1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:14.540]  who have thinking skills. Now, I'm not saying they're all dumb. Some act dumb and slip through.
[1:39:15.100 --> 1:39:18.460]  Others don't know why they got refused. Well, it's because you're too smart.
[1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:24.140]  And they just started this the last 15 years. And it's a good idea to interface with your local
[1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:29.820]  government. Here's the problem. The feds take our money, then they send 33 cents back on average
[1:39:29.820 --> 1:39:36.700]  with strings attached. Also, the police departments have jobs and people's jobs that are paid for
[1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:41.900]  with that. So it doesn't matter if it's evil, they're still going to go with it. Also, feds lobbied
[1:39:42.540 --> 1:39:48.700]  in all 50 states and almost every state has this law. I believe it's all 50 to where the states
[1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:56.380]  can't give asset forfeiture, seizure stuff. The police have stolen two. And I appreciate your
[1:39:56.380 --> 1:40:01.980]  and I appreciate your call. It's a really good point. Let me comment on that off air now. The
[1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:12.860]  problem is that the feds got laws passed locally where only the feds can give 85% of the money back.
[1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:18.780]  If police raid money and get money and quote crime related things, course, no due process,
[1:40:18.780 --> 1:40:24.540]  and it goes to the state, they only get 10%. But if the feds, if they give it to the feds first
[1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:30.860]  in the asset forfeiture seizure, they get 85% back. See all cold bloodedly engineered to federalize.
[1:40:31.980 --> 1:40:36.380]  And so you got people that went to college, they got black uniforms, they got scheme ask,
[1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:42.380]  you know, they got CPS, CPS grows each year under federal grants, they got to take more kids.
[1:40:42.380 --> 1:40:45.980]  And it's going to get bigger each year, they're going to take more kids each year. And you bet
[1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:50.060]  they're going to interrogate your kids in school. You think quote, oh, there's counseling at the
[1:40:50.060 --> 1:40:57.580]  school. The counselors aspire to CPS your kids. Just like when you go to have a baby, they ask
[1:40:57.580 --> 1:41:02.300]  the man to go, oh, you go take this paperwork downstairs to this nurse for me. And then as
[1:41:02.300 --> 1:41:07.340]  soon as the man leaves, they go, honey, we don't like the man in here. This is just girls talking
[1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:13.340]  as friends. Tell me, is he hitting you? Is your home safe? Again, guilty until proven innocent,
[1:41:13.340 --> 1:41:18.060]  not telling her, by the way, honey, we're going to snatch your kid and sell it to pedophiles.
[1:41:18.060 --> 1:41:21.420]  Of course, the dumb nurse doesn't know that. They're just following protocol or
[1:41:21.420 --> 1:41:24.700]  we're going to fly your kid out to Saudi Arabia. Now that's if they're not lucky.
[1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:28.940]  Usually they're just going to go to some yuppie family that pays 350 grand for that blonde hair
[1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:35.260]  blue eyed baby. See, and folks, I'm not kidding when I say this, it's worse than what I'm saying.
[1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:40.300]  They're everywhere, scum, criminal, filth, violating the bill of rights, violating the
[1:41:40.300 --> 1:41:46.300]  Constitution, hurting families, spying on all of you. And they're hiring more and more and more
[1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:53.420]  and more and more everywhere. What you do is you run and you get elected mayor. You may even have
[1:41:53.420 --> 1:41:58.620]  to covertly play along with them like you're an enemy operative to get in so you can defend the
[1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:03.100]  Republic. There's good cops inside there. There's good police. There's good people in the government.
[1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:07.100]  They're saying no to a lot of it. Why do you think they try to come out and say torture's good on
[1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:16.380]  the news to get wide acceptance because their own military and their own FBI refuse to do it?
[1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:20.860]  Now, do they have cadres that'll do anything? Yes. And they're trying to grow those cadres
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:26.780]  hiring felons, hiring the former Latin American death squads for operations in the U.S. Red level
[1:42:26.780 --> 1:42:37.900]  mayday. Everything I just said is true. Do you realize the magnitude of that? Okay, thank you.
[1:42:40.060 --> 1:42:43.420]  Louise, you're a great caller. I shouldn't rant. I'm not going to get to everybody.
[1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:49.580]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peggy in PA. Peggy, you're on the air.
[1:42:50.380 --> 1:42:56.380]  Alex, I have two short questions. First of all, would you extrapolate the probable future
[1:42:56.380 --> 1:43:03.500]  of the Lakota nation vis-à-vis the federal government? And second, is or is not Costa Rica
[1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:09.100]  neocon or not necessarily neocon, but New World Order? Well, yeah, it was good 10, 15,
[1:43:09.100 --> 1:43:14.540]  20 years ago, and they've raised taxes, gone under global agreements. They've started checkpoints,
[1:43:15.500 --> 1:43:21.340]  police state activity. Every spook you can imagine retires down there because they know
[1:43:21.340 --> 1:43:27.820]  the future of the U.S. So they've all been moving down there. But yeah, Costa Rica is getting worse
[1:43:27.820 --> 1:43:32.700]  and worse. But that's from folks that have been down there. A lot of people that live there.
[1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:40.300]  So the long arm of the New World Order is everywhere. It's global. And it's all about the
[1:43:40.300 --> 1:43:45.500]  trillionaires and billionaires not letting anybody else run anywhere. And they use government to
[1:43:45.500 --> 1:43:49.660]  steal your money and then give it to themselves through government contracts. Government is a
[1:43:49.660 --> 1:43:54.620]  tool of the global corporations. The left won't tell you that. The right won't tell you that.
[1:43:54.620 --> 1:44:00.060]  What about Lakota? I don't want to throw a wet blanket on it. I think the people coming together,
[1:44:00.060 --> 1:44:05.420]  a nation within a nation declaring itself, they have the right to do it. And I'm all in support
[1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:09.820]  of it. At least psychologically separating themselves from the globalist because the U.S.
[1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:13.820]  doesn't even exist anymore. We're under globalist control and they are allowed to get out of their
[1:44:13.820 --> 1:44:18.380]  trade easing. You know, I think it's one out of a 20 chance that it could actually happen. But
[1:44:18.380 --> 1:44:25.260]  they're waking up. They're coming together. It's forming communities. And they got guts. And so I
[1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:32.060]  got to support them. All right. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Peggy. Let's go ahead and talk to Rob
[1:44:32.060 --> 1:44:37.500]  in New Yorker on the air. Rob? Yeah, hey, Alex. I have a disagreement with you. But first, I wanted
[1:44:37.500 --> 1:44:45.340]  to make a little comment. I went to a presentation at Columbia University by one of their professors
[1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:50.540]  was talking about the global credit crisis. And I got handed to you. You're right on that issue.
[1:44:50.540 --> 1:44:54.460]  I mean, he tried to move the issue off and said, oh, it's a problem with structured finance and
[1:44:54.460 --> 1:45:00.220]  it's never been tested. But he failed to mention that it's all eruded in factional reserve lending
[1:45:00.220 --> 1:45:04.540]  when the bank's trying to get this stuff, you know, cut off books. But just want to hand you
[1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:10.460]  some credit on that. The other thing I wanted to mention was you had an economist on a while ago.
[1:45:10.460 --> 1:45:15.100]  I had a lot on who was it? He was one of your friends. He was in the
[1:45:15.100 --> 1:45:21.340]  after hours. George Humphrey. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So one of the things that kind of bugged me about
[1:45:21.340 --> 1:45:26.860]  your show and remember, I'm a big fan of yours. You got, he was talking about how the New World
[1:45:26.860 --> 1:45:30.780]  Order is kind of atheistic and he was kind of implying and he didn't actually say it,
[1:45:30.780 --> 1:45:35.100]  but he was kind of implying that we don't have kind of a moral base as atheists. And your show,
[1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:38.940]  you know, you were talking about, you had the clips with the preachers talking about, you know,
[1:45:38.940 --> 1:45:43.820]  all this crazy stuff. You know, historically, you know, they get Christianity, the slaves,
[1:45:43.820 --> 1:45:47.580]  they use it to all kinds of things. And I mean, why is it that you guys paint the New World Order
[1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:53.980]  as this, you know, kind of a, you know, a group of people without a, you know, kind of a moral
[1:45:53.980 --> 1:45:57.900]  base? I mean, we have, you know, ethics and things like that. Well, by the way, did you tell the
[1:45:57.900 --> 1:46:01.820]  fellow answer in the phones? I want to be clear. Did you tell them you disagree because you go to
[1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:06.940]  the head of a line if you disagree? I told them I disagree with how you paint atheists. I mean,
[1:46:06.940 --> 1:46:10.060]  you say it a lot of times, you say the New World Order. Okay. Well, sometimes the guys answering
[1:46:10.060 --> 1:46:15.980]  the phones get busy and don't tell them because they're doing five jobs, but you make sure that's
[1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:20.060]  clear. Tell them, put you out of the line so they remember, or I think there was a star by it. Maybe
[1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:25.340]  I forgot that it doesn't matter. Point is you're on the air and your call wasn't screened because a
[1:46:25.340 --> 1:46:29.740]  lot of people are saying all our phone calls are staged and I'm just sick of it. None of our calls
[1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:34.380]  are staged and I'm really tired of the people that lie about us and say that, look, look, I
[1:46:34.380 --> 1:46:39.900]  appreciate your call. Let me try to answer the question this way. It was more nuanced and we
[1:46:39.900 --> 1:46:50.460]  weren't being clear there. Okay. I'm saying that the globalist push atheism only to remove the
[1:46:50.460 --> 1:47:00.780]  original mores, social morals and move it on to a new age one and a New World Order brand new age
[1:47:00.780 --> 1:47:09.900]  to be specific. Like Oprah Winfrey starting a giant global new age church and I guarantee you
[1:47:09.900 --> 1:47:17.180]  she's doing it like the Scientologists did to get tax exemption. They're calling for a world
[1:47:17.180 --> 1:47:22.060]  religion. The Pope, if you believe in Christian, you know, my point is all these people that give
[1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:26.540]  Christianity a bad name, they don't follow Christianity. I mean, as an atheist, have you
[1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:30.700]  read what Jesus says? Isn't that good stuff? I mean, you know, the point is the Pope running around
[1:47:30.700 --> 1:47:37.180]  in Dagon outfits and calling for world government and kissing the UN flag and
[1:47:38.780 --> 1:47:44.860]  you know, doing all of this. It's a new world order. I mean, Pat Robertson is out on the
[1:47:44.860 --> 1:47:53.660]  Protestant side pushing TV ads calling for global taxes. All the high places are held and controlled.
[1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:58.220]  I mean, do we come on and say Pastor Haggies, a political prostitute, a pulpit prostitute?
[1:47:58.220 --> 1:48:02.300]  I mean, do we come on air and expose that most of the churches are bought off an evil and say,
[1:48:02.300 --> 1:48:07.340]  don't go to these churches? Yes. But then the salt of the earth fight the New World Order
[1:48:07.980 --> 1:48:12.780]  and who really care are the Christians. Nine times out of 10. I mean, an atheist, they think the New
[1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:18.620]  World Order is a great idea. Now, maybe you're different, but I'm not here bashing you and I'm
[1:48:18.620 --> 1:48:22.300]  out here getting into a religious debate or discussion. I mean, we have some religious
[1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:26.140]  guests on. I am a Christian, but I understand why you don't like Christianity because you've
[1:48:26.140 --> 1:48:29.900]  seen the main line Christianity and you think that's what we are. We are not that.
[1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:36.620]  Let's go. It was also Christians that helped end slavery. You know, every major group had
[1:48:36.620 --> 1:48:41.420]  slavery. It was Christians that ended it. Did a group of Christians use it and try to misinterpret
[1:48:41.420 --> 1:48:47.100]  stuff in the Old Testament to say blacks weren't human? Yes. So you are telling the truth there.
[1:48:47.100 --> 1:48:53.660]  But who ended slavery? Who were the abolitionists? You know, who went and blew up armories and shot
[1:48:53.660 --> 1:49:01.420]  slave owners and it was white Christians. That's why I'm so sick and tired of people like
[1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:05.340]  Barack Obama's preacher saying all whites are bad. That's like saying all blacks are bad.
[1:49:06.140 --> 1:49:09.420]  No, it's evil in the human psyche. It's evil mindsets.
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:15.980]  Let's take a network phone call. Let's jam this in the middle of the half. We've got
[1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:21.260]  Mike in Michigan. You're on the air. Hi, Alex. This is Mike in Wyoming. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead.
[1:49:21.900 --> 1:49:29.900]  Yeah. I have been in touch with Mr. Hamad, the guy who was drowned in whatever it is,
[1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:37.260]  Colorado River, and he had sent me a bottle of olive oil. I paid 20, 25 bucks for it.
[1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:40.060]  You know, it's a contribution to the Palestinian children.
[1:49:40.060 --> 1:49:47.020]  And I sent you his contact information, which is to the Palestinian Children's
[1:49:47.020 --> 1:49:50.700]  Welfare Fund. Yeah, we've been, what addresses you send that to?
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:56.780]  To your news tips through your info wars.com. You know, I get so flustered. I saw that and I
[1:49:56.780 --> 1:50:02.860]  forgot to give that to Trey. I just called phone numbers. Yeah, send it to Trey. When did you
[1:50:02.860 --> 1:50:08.060]  send it? Just this morning, just an hour and a half ago. Okay. Well, I want to get somebody
[1:50:08.060 --> 1:50:11.900]  on from that grid because I've tried to call four different Hamad numbers in Austin,
[1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:14.700]  and none of them were him. Do you have his phone number?
[1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:23.020]  I sent you the phone number that I have. It's a 512 number. It's probably just to his group.
[1:50:23.020 --> 1:50:27.020]  Tell you what, stay there. By the way, I know Mike, he's a doctor. Sent me a lot of good info
[1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:31.980]  over the years. Stay there, Mike. We'll talk more about this and get your take on Hamad.
[1:50:31.980 --> 1:50:39.740]  A bound, gagged, duct-taped arms and legs drowned in the river. The info I've got from news insiders
[1:50:39.740 --> 1:50:46.620]  that heard the scanners was that it looked like he'd been gone over, hurt. But the Austin police,
[1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:47.900]  they serve the dark side.
[1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:55.260]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history
[1:50:55.260 --> 1:51:01.260]  comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that

[1:51:11.180 --> 1:51:16.460]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change Final Cut
[1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:22.060]  is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the

[1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:49.420]  information war. Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:51:49.420 --> 1:51:54.460]  to Big Brother. Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a
[1:51:54.460 --> 1:51:59.660]  pH-balanced alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress,
[1:51:59.660 --> 1:52:04.940]  acidic diet, and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect
[1:52:04.940 --> 1:52:09.900]  health, as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they drink experience
[1:52:09.900 --> 1:52:14.860]  normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to
[1:52:14.860 --> 1:52:20.300]  drink alkaline water. But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic. The fact is that
[1:52:20.300 --> 1:52:25.020]  disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates if a person consumes
[1:52:25.020 --> 1:52:30.540]  too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge
[1:52:30.540 --> 1:52:35.740]  your body now. Alcovision Plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[1:52:35.740 --> 1:52:41.660]  that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops. Order your bottle

[1:52:49.420 --> 1:52:55.020]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism,
[1:52:55.020 --> 1:52:59.180]  but globalism. Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American Empire.
[1:52:59.180 --> 1:53:03.740]  Instead of what's fair for the American people, the only antidote to the poison of globalism
[1:53:03.740 --> 1:53:08.140]  is nationalism, which is why you should be reading The Nationalist Times each month.

[1:54:21.180 --> 1:54:24.620]  Hey, Mike, good to hear from you. Yeah, we actually have gotten in touch with their
[1:54:24.620 --> 1:54:29.900]  family and folks. We are having them on very soon. May even be in the third or fourth hour
[1:54:29.900 --> 1:54:35.340]  today popping in while George is with us. But go ahead and give me your take on what's happened.
[1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:41.260]  Yeah, I've gotten in touch with Mr. Hamad. I just got frustrated watching the Palestinians
[1:54:41.260 --> 1:54:47.340]  be turned back at the Egyptian border. I'm sure at the coercion of the Israelis,
[1:54:47.340 --> 1:54:54.380]  they didn't want anyone leaving the gulag there, the Gaza gulag. So I contacted Hamad and asked
[1:54:54.380 --> 1:55:01.580]  if he needed some surplus medical equipment and I needed some specifics from him. I never got that
[1:55:01.580 --> 1:55:06.620]  from him. But anyway, he seemed like a nice guy. But recently, he had sent out an email
[1:55:06.620 --> 1:55:12.060]  saying he was under investigation by the FBI and I knew it didn't sound good.
[1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:23.500]  And then the next time I hear, he's found and drowned in Lady Burke Lake. I called Austin
[1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:28.380]  Petey. I talked to a guy named Gary. I think he was an officer there. I said, I'm a real
[1:55:28.380 --> 1:55:33.420]  disappointed if this is found to be a suicide. I mean, anyone with two brain cells together
[1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:37.660]  knows this is not a suicide. And I hope other people will do the same thing.
[1:55:38.380 --> 1:55:40.860]  These people need to know that they're under investigation.
[1:55:40.860 --> 1:55:46.540]  Are you kidding? Kids get hung in the schools when they try to tell on their teachers around
[1:55:46.540 --> 1:55:51.740]  here and the cops cover it up. It's very corrupt. Yeah. Well, just wishful thinking on my part.
[1:55:51.740 --> 1:55:58.140]  But, you know, not to change the subject, but recently you had Mike Rivera on for his monthly
[1:55:58.140 --> 1:56:05.660]  visit and he said something that was 180 degrees out of phase with the truth. He commented on the
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:13.900]  military manual being changed back in 1929 or so to where it said, you know, previously it said,
[1:56:13.900 --> 1:56:20.060]  this is not a democracy. Democracies are horrible. And he said, well, thank God they
[1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:24.380]  changed that and said now that we are a democracy and he approved for that change.
[1:56:24.380 --> 1:56:29.020]  I don't even remember that. I thought that democracy was bad thing was in there until the 50s.
[1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:35.900]  No, it was until the 20s, right? Well, I've seen a copy of that manual where it says,
[1:56:35.900 --> 1:56:38.140]  where it explains it was between a democracy and a republic.
[1:56:38.780 --> 1:56:43.180]  Yeah, but he got it exactly backwards. I thought you're just being nice to him to let that slide.
[1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:48.460]  Well, I normally pay attention to guest, but a lot of times they come in during and give me
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:53.900]  stuff. So I'll hit pause here and there and mute my mic and I won't be listening for 30 seconds or
[1:56:53.900 --> 1:56:59.100]  so. So, I mean, I do miss things. Sure. The other thing, John Taylor Gatto, you had on his
[1:56:59.100 --> 1:57:03.740]  guest, great, great guest. He said something that's absolutely profound and I hope people will take it
[1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:08.780]  to heart, especially these, you had several callers who were just starting to wake up and you
[1:57:08.780 --> 1:57:13.420]  alluded to it. He said, you know, people need to adopt the mindset of a saboteur.
[1:57:13.420 --> 1:57:19.180]  You know, people need to, if you need to pretend to go along with this nonsense, do it just to get
[1:57:19.180 --> 1:57:24.700]  into positions where, you know, you have a little clout. People like Alex and me are already on the
[1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:30.140]  record and, you know, they know what we're all about. But you, you young guys who are just waking
[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:35.340]  up, you're still in that position to do that. And, you know, I encourage you to do so.
[1:57:37.100 --> 1:57:42.060]  Absolutely. And we do have people in every position out there who give us intel,
[1:57:42.060 --> 1:57:46.300]  who tell us what's going on. That's how we knew 20 years ago about their Marshall op land. Mike,
[1:57:46.300 --> 1:57:50.380]  the globalists have really taken their time setting this up. And I think they're, they're
[1:57:50.380 --> 1:57:54.940]  having a lot of setbacks, but across the globe. But I still think they're going to go ahead and go,
[1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:59.820]  go ahead with it. Oh, they are. Yeah, no doubt. They're, they're under the gun from the, you know,
[1:57:59.820 --> 1:58:05.580]  the European banking establishment. And they're already frustrated with the, the slow pace going
[1:58:05.580 --> 1:58:12.620]  on in America. And it's going to backfire on them. It's going to get messy. Yeah, there will be people
[1:58:12.620 --> 1:58:17.180]  that resist and, and everybody's going to see through it that they're not terrorists. Everybody
[1:58:17.180 --> 1:58:22.620]  knows who the real terrorists are now. Mike, good to hear from you. All right, I'm going to come back,
[1:58:22.620 --> 1:58:26.620]  give you some news. Then we've got two guests coming on. And yes, we'll continue to take your
[1:58:26.620 --> 1:58:38.300]  calls. Stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.

[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:49.980]  any reason but I was running and he said running after me and then he then he I don't know when
[2:14:49.980 --> 2:14:55.020]  I was just getting away from he seemed to trip or jump and he grabbed onto my backpack and ripped

[2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:28.380]  demand that the beat notice bbc didn't give names the bbc admits the police didn't do anything
[2:15:28.380 --> 2:15:34.780]  showing their a pack of liars are you not angry yeah I was very angry and shocked like all the
[2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:41.660]  probably without a question you know and a part of helping get tougher tougher questions on the
[2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:45.020]  part well listen well listen I interrupted I mean I want to hear if you're mad about them lying and
[2:15:45.020 --> 2:15:50.460]  turning his assault of you into an assault of the EU the precious sweetie cakes slitting your
[2:15:50.460 --> 2:15:56.540]  sovereignty's throat destroying your country now now let's go back here now at this point he's grabbed
[2:15:56.540 --> 2:16:02.220]  your backpack he's fallen down in his frothing hatred uh tell us what happened next yeah so you
[2:16:02.220 --> 2:16:06.300]  can see in the video nobody pushed him down there's nobody behind him to push him out to like about
[2:16:06.300 --> 2:16:12.140]  three four and one from when he jumped or fell down and then a man there restrained him for about
[2:16:12.140 --> 2:16:17.340]  20 seconds and then like this is the second part of the video which you haven't uploaded because
[2:16:17.340 --> 2:16:22.860]  there the police told us maybe not to upload video and so in the second part why did the police
[2:16:22.860 --> 2:16:29.180]  tell you why did they not tell you to upload it to cover up for him yeah they said we might not
[2:16:29.180 --> 2:16:33.980]  yet use video on court so he only put half of the video on just to prove that we were innocent
[2:16:33.980 --> 2:16:38.700]  because the paper said he asked for the camera to be put down and then we pushed him to the ground
[2:16:38.700 --> 2:16:44.540]  and you can see that I want you you need to sue that newspaper and you and the police don't do
[2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:50.780]  anything you need to sue him civilly for assault and battery the thing is that the sunday times
[2:16:50.780 --> 2:16:56.300]  contacted us and wanted to do an interview and I spoke with the sunday times Richard Oakley
[2:16:56.300 --> 2:17:03.820]  and uh it turns out uh fox uh sorry real but my dog news corresponds to sunday times and
[2:17:03.820 --> 2:17:10.220]  I upload the audio of that as well the interview but in the and I told him that we are 100% innocent
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:14.940]  we're very happy to hand over the videos to the police that completely clears us we never touched
[2:17:14.940 --> 2:17:21.340]  them uh and put in the article that he printed on sunday it says that we at physically he was
[2:17:21.340 --> 2:17:28.460]  exactly physically attacked him it says mrs rosson must be wondering why uh we are changed
[2:17:28.460 --> 2:17:33.260]  are physically attacked but again but again but again when I read that article it said police
[2:17:33.260 --> 2:17:39.900]  were there but didn't arrest you and I I I I flagged down the place I've been a van gone by I
[2:17:39.900 --> 2:17:44.300]  found the police other people found exactly and I came on come by I pulled down the police
[2:17:44.300 --> 2:17:49.580]  and I have a camera as well me talking to the police this is an outrage not just that he assaulted
[2:17:49.580 --> 2:17:53.980]  you and his hatred of freedom but and he does he hates your country sovereignty he wants to hand
[2:17:53.980 --> 2:17:58.860]  it over to those criminals in brussels not just that that happened and by the way it's admitted
[2:17:58.860 --> 2:18:03.500]  there are a bunch of crooks stealing and thieving and taking people's freedoms uh both at both
[2:18:03.500 --> 2:18:09.740]  headquarters of the EU this is but then they lie in the media and turn it into a victory for them
[2:18:09.740 --> 2:18:14.220]  that's why the mainstream media are hated because they're a bunch of dirtbag liars go ahead
[2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:23.180]  yeah and um the vote the question we're asking was why did he vote not to respect Ireland's
[2:18:23.180 --> 2:18:28.700]  decision in the referendum the EU parliament actually had a crazy vote they voted will we
[2:18:28.700 --> 2:18:34.140]  respect Ireland's decision on the listening treaty if they vote no and their Irish representative
[2:18:34.780 --> 2:18:41.420]  he voted not to respect their vote a decision yeah let's be clear saying that if Ireland doesn't
[2:18:41.420 --> 2:18:47.100]  want to join and give up its sovereignty will europe allow them to not join see saying they're
[2:18:47.100 --> 2:18:52.700]  dictators but the thing is that it's mostly propaganda because the vote was not legally
[2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:58.060]  binding it wasn't a legally binding vote so it's just pure propaganda well i know i'm yelling and
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:19:03.900]  screaming because i'm so i think of luke out there out there when they come up on camera in

[2:25:02.620 --> 2:25:08.620]  this out this credit the lying snake media again are you angry by being set up in the international
[2:25:08.620 --> 2:25:15.580]  media and national us tv everything being set up for assaulting a member of parliament when he attacked
[2:25:15.580 --> 2:25:22.300]  you hi alex it's keep back here yeah we're completely outraged and you know during the week
[2:25:22.300 --> 2:25:26.540]  we were very nervous what was going to happen we didn't know if he was like prosecuting us or
[2:25:26.540 --> 2:25:32.700]  you're going to be set up or whatever but um we are absolutely 100% innocent of what the papers
[2:25:32.700 --> 2:25:40.460]  are saying and we have to videotape the vindicators anything else uh from your friend uh who was
[2:25:40.460 --> 2:25:43.660]  actually assaulted give us i've talked to him before give us his full name for the article
[2:25:45.660 --> 2:25:52.540]  his name is Anthony Gibbons any other key points for the article paul watson's doing right now
[2:25:52.540 --> 2:25:59.020]  yeah alex it's important to know i am i was behind Anthony when he was running and i saw what
[2:25:59.020 --> 2:26:04.540]  happened from behind that the roster and that basically like you can see me right in the back
[2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:10.300]  of where the camera is that's me closest to it so i observed what he did he chased Anthony around and
[2:26:10.300 --> 2:26:15.660]  he was running him towards the window like i mean this window would have been around 10 feet high
[2:26:15.660 --> 2:26:19.180]  and literally like something legal could have happened in there if the two of them ran through
[2:26:19.180 --> 2:26:25.420]  the window so what happened there was he kind of like maneuvered himself uh around the pillar
[2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:30.700]  and continued to run and then the roster just locked onto his back and then he wouldn't let go
[2:26:30.700 --> 2:26:37.820]  with like a total war well well that would have been a very embarrassing if it was the headline
[2:26:37.820 --> 2:26:44.860]  member of european parliament assaults youths steals bag you know went into a frothing rage
[2:26:44.860 --> 2:26:50.140]  of kleptomania why was he trying to get this bag why did he greedily want that for himself
[2:26:51.100 --> 2:26:57.740]  i'm expecting what happened was he noticed that he assaulted a person first and i i think that he
[2:26:57.740 --> 2:27:02.300]  knew that we had the videotape so maybe he was trying to steal the bag in order to get the videotape
[2:27:02.300 --> 2:27:08.860]  office i don't know but can i please note something that we found on wikipedia about this man um it
[2:27:08.860 --> 2:27:15.340]  says he was directly active in shin fane and the ira from an early age and was interned in the courier
[2:27:15.340 --> 2:27:21.340]  which is a prison from 1956 until 1959 by the way you know those guys all work for the government
[2:27:21.340 --> 2:27:28.540]  at the top this guy again i don't want to make any closer or allegations at the moment no i'm
[2:27:28.540 --> 2:27:34.060]  saying that the don't come out in the news that the top of the ira and shin fane are british operatives
[2:27:34.060 --> 2:27:39.580]  90 percent of the time i mean he may not be yeah that has been admitted all right but the fact is
[2:27:39.580 --> 2:27:45.660]  like you know the media over here has really kind of painted a picture completely opposite to what
[2:27:45.660 --> 2:27:50.700]  actually happened and the funny thing is like there's people saying oh we we deserve to be
[2:27:50.700 --> 2:27:55.100]  prosecuted and all this and we mugged him like there's people literally think that we mugged
[2:27:55.100 --> 2:27:59.500]  this man when they see the video but see notice they're not charging you that's how before i got
[2:27:59.500 --> 2:28:04.380]  you on i didn't even know the video was on the web i knew that it was really going to be him i knew
[2:28:04.380 --> 2:28:12.140]  it i just know the enemy oh yeah sick sick but i mean how could somebody be selling out his country
[2:28:12.140 --> 2:28:18.940]  sovereignty and not be a lying punk actually alex this is very important to know we pulled over the
[2:28:18.940 --> 2:28:22.940]  uh the police we pulled them over to the side of the street and we were the ones making the report
[2:28:22.940 --> 2:28:30.060]  that's right you called the police and what do you get do you get justice you get fraud and what
[2:28:30.060 --> 2:28:35.100]  happened was other other members of the Irish parliament who are part of that party were coming
[2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:40.780]  out of the venue where the debate was and they were like going to the police or they were videotaping
[2:28:40.780 --> 2:28:44.860]  us without permission and stuff like that trying to get the police to take the videotape from us
[2:28:45.420 --> 2:28:50.060]  so then what happened was we were kind of like giving our names and giving our addresses and all
[2:28:50.060 --> 2:28:56.780]  the general information the police had to know in case they wanted the contacts and still to this day
[2:28:56.780 --> 2:29:02.460]  alex it happened a week ago they haven't called us whatsoever yeah they don't want those videos
[2:29:02.460 --> 2:29:06.380]  and if i was you i'd just go ahead and upload all of it i wouldn't listen to them telling you
[2:29:06.380 --> 2:29:13.180]  don't upload all the video guaranteed this they may come in and raid you for that video later
[2:29:13.180 --> 2:29:17.980]  and an attempt to continue the cover up nine times out of ten they're corrupt now the fact
[2:29:17.980 --> 2:29:22.540]  that didn't take your cameras is a good sign i tell you what stay there george butler's coming

[2:33:10.860 --> 2:33:23.260]  and about 9 11 being an inside job and i learned today that last week it was in msnbc ap bbc
[2:33:23.980 --> 2:33:29.980]  headlines about how this wonderful sweet person who did nothing wrong was viciously
[2:33:29.980 --> 2:33:37.740]  attacked for no reason by a group of devilish hoodlums you can go to if you're a prison planet
[2:33:37.740 --> 2:33:44.220]  dot tv member you can you can see this headline right now on the document cam anti-eu gang assaults
[2:33:44.220 --> 2:33:50.220]  irish member of parliament member of european parliament and it says they attacked him they
[2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:56.060]  chased him down they stole his bag they tackled him that's everything he did to them and i didn't
[2:33:56.060 --> 2:34:00.540]  even know there was a video of this out but i predicted in the office and then someone on
[2:34:00.540 --> 2:34:03.900]  air though i didn't want to say on there i just said i bet it's the other way around but that's
[2:34:03.900 --> 2:34:11.340]  exactly what happened but they cannot have that they cannot have uh one of their people assaulting
[2:34:11.340 --> 2:34:19.180]  irish citizens so they have engaged in a huge lie uh going back to keith brine and others uh
[2:34:20.860 --> 2:34:24.540]  keith uh you guys finish up with any other key points that need to be made here
[2:34:25.420 --> 2:34:30.540]  yeah like it's really important to note that if we can defeat this listen tree like i mean this is a
[2:34:30.540 --> 2:34:37.420]  huge blow to the globalist idea i'm not only that we've made it a documentary i've used some end
[2:34:37.420 --> 2:34:42.540]  game footage in it it's called end of nations so if people kind of like pick that up even if you're
[2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:46.780]  american or if you're in europe or whatever just watch that documentary and float the forms and
[2:34:46.780 --> 2:34:53.340]  tell everybody about it because like this is the real deal i'm not only that alex um if this treaty

[2:37:28.460 --> 2:37:35.500]  the treaty EU leaders signed the document in lisbon last year with the aim of making EU
[2:37:35.500 --> 2:37:41.340]  institutions more efficient more efficient getting the rabble out of the way now that the block is
[2:37:41.340 --> 2:37:47.100]  27 member states in his statements mr gilmore said a minority of people had tried to disrupt the
[2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:56.700]  meeting using ugly and intimidating tactics and a shouting abuse through a loud halo i was greatly
[2:37:56.700 --> 2:38:02.620]  shocked by what happened to him you named him my democratically elected representative must be free
[2:38:02.620 --> 2:38:08.060]  to walk the streets without threat of physical abuse he must be free to walk around and chase
[2:38:08.060 --> 2:38:13.980]  people down growling and ripping bags off of them while filming at the mouth i added that part
[2:38:14.620 --> 2:38:20.700]  police took statements from the witnesses but made no arrests mr. de la resa is well known
[2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:27.340]  figure in the irish republic having served as a cabinet minister in 1990s and as a member of
[2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:33.980]  parliament since 1999 he was unavailable for comment oh yeah i have it on camera as well
[2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:41.420]  well when mr the roster came over to 14 he said to the police was they filmed me without my permission
[2:38:41.420 --> 2:38:47.900]  that's the fourth thing he said of the reason why it happened well he's a public figure
[2:38:48.460 --> 2:38:53.500]  he's a public figure he's not in a private place he has no reasonable expectation of
[2:38:53.500 --> 2:38:59.100]  privacy that's what they do when they cram cameras all over our cities watching us you use that right
[2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:04.940]  back on him and then he held he held up his finger it reminded me of like a little five-year-old boy
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:10.700]  he held up his finger which he scraped when he fell he held up his great finger to the police
[2:39:10.700 --> 2:39:17.740]  he said i i hurt myself i remember bullies that would come up and start fights with me and then
[2:39:17.740 --> 2:39:21.580]  when they were getting put on the ambulance they'd be trying to fill out reports that i assaulted
[2:39:21.580 --> 2:39:27.260]  them but there were always witnesses again they want to come up to you they want to attack you
[2:39:27.260 --> 2:39:31.100]  and then when they fall down on their frothing fit they get mad at you go ahead
[2:39:32.300 --> 2:39:37.820]  yeah the thank god he didn't get grab a hold of me it could have been a lot worse but i wouldn't
[2:39:39.020 --> 2:39:42.940]  wouldn't like that and uh yeah so he keeps wanting to make a point
[2:39:43.740 --> 2:39:47.660]  hey like it's important to know you know he come over with a little bit of blood coming out of his
[2:39:47.660 --> 2:39:59.660]  finger i'm sorry but in the paper but in the paper and one of the party pd's they're basically
[2:39:59.660 --> 2:40:05.820]  just members of fire's parliament said that he had blood on his hands as if him to make it the worst
[2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:11.420]  from what it was oh my god you know who what's this country coming to when a member of parliament
[2:40:11.420 --> 2:40:17.980]  can't assault some young men it's unbelievable oh they ran from him they should have knelt down to
[2:40:17.980 --> 2:40:22.460]  a lord and allowed him to stomp them in the heads so we could arrest them for assaulting him
[2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:29.900]  yeah but you know it's just basically over here all the forms are full of that we attacked
[2:40:29.900 --> 2:40:37.260]  and we were the perpetrators i'm our scum i'm my god it's deadly it's a deadly vicious attack
[2:40:37.260 --> 2:40:43.900]  on a member of the parliament a member of the european parliament the rest these names immediately
[2:40:43.900 --> 2:40:48.780]  but notice the police couldn't arrest you because nothing happened because it's staged absolute
[2:40:48.780 --> 2:40:57.260]  injustice give your websites out again slowly alex it's w a c ireland.org that's the website of
[2:40:57.260 --> 2:41:05.180]  these outrageous criminals and wiseupjournal.com and if you want to google search end of nations
[2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:11.660]  documentary you will find out that we kind of explain things much better and the MEPs
[2:41:11.660 --> 2:41:16.700]  actually good representatives that represent the people they come out and they detailed
[2:41:16.700 --> 2:41:22.140]  their personal stories of the european union and the corruption that's inside it. All right men
[2:41:22.700 --> 2:41:28.380]  good job i'm very sorry that i got on this a week late this is just unbelievably outrageous
[2:41:28.380 --> 2:41:32.380]  but that's why the mainstream media is losing all credibility that's why the governments are
[2:41:32.380 --> 2:41:40.140]  losing all credibility and i am very upset about this uh there is a story up on prisonplanet.com
[2:41:40.140 --> 2:41:44.700]  that watson has done covering this i'm asking leaders to get this out everywhere media labels
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:51.180]  activist questions as gang assault on politician thank you for coming on men alex thank you so much
[2:41:51.900 --> 2:41:56.860]  thank you very much alex now now i'll tell watson something right now have nemo changes
[2:41:56.860 --> 2:42:03.100]  headline it's a good story but to to to member of parliament oh i just hit refresh he did do it
[2:42:04.780 --> 2:42:09.900]  okay he did change the headline good MEP assaults activists media reports opposite
[2:42:09.900 --> 2:42:18.060]  and giant smear attempt we have the video red-handed this is a key weapon against the times of
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:23.660]  london the sunday times a key weapon against the bbc just like when we caught them reporting
[2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:28.860]  how building seven fell 25 minutes before it fell given the exact story of how it then did fall
[2:42:28.860 --> 2:42:36.700]  little false scripting no amount of bbc building seven movies will reprieve you enemy operatives
[2:42:36.700 --> 2:42:42.780]  nothing will save you from your criminal activity and i'm telling you right now this is criminal
[2:42:43.260 --> 2:42:50.060]  to knowingly lie about these men to knowingly lie and slander good men who are doing nothing

[2:44:58.700 --> 2:45:02.540]  website spend a few minutes talking about yourself then we're going to get into some of the news items
[2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:07.980]  and take some phone calls well we broadcast on genesis communication network we have a show called
[2:45:07.980 --> 2:45:14.700]  the secret truth at thesecrettruth.com along with co-host charlotte littlefield brown and uh as far
[2:45:14.700 --> 2:45:19.980]  as my background goes i'm a lifetime citizen of austin was in the asa army security agency in europe
[2:45:19.980 --> 2:45:25.260]  for three years spent my last year in berlin west berlin and saw a lot of very ugly things happen
[2:45:25.260 --> 2:45:31.180]  there uh i was 22 years old when i got out of the asa so i was pretty well educated in in a certain
[2:45:31.180 --> 2:45:36.940]  narrow area of communication security and intelligence and we saw a lot of tyranny there
[2:45:36.940 --> 2:45:43.740]  and uh this is this is probably what's motivated me to continue this fight and uh to try to reveal
[2:45:43.740 --> 2:45:49.500]  the truth about this big mind war system that we're all susceptible to mind war that's what it is
[2:45:49.500 --> 2:45:53.420]  that's what the germans called it you know my parents just got back from southern germany visiting
[2:45:53.420 --> 2:45:58.140]  some family that lives over there in the military and they brought me that famous photo i'd seen
[2:45:58.140 --> 2:46:03.740]  before uh right when they'd put up the bar bar a few months after and a german family got through
[2:46:03.740 --> 2:46:08.700]  but the toddler got caught in the bar bar and the east german soldier opens the bar bar and picks
[2:46:08.700 --> 2:46:12.780]  him up and lets him through you ever seen that famous photo yes i have i have oh my they gave
[2:46:12.780 --> 2:46:16.780]  me a big one i got to hang in my office wall now and i think i'm gonna hang it in here so people
[2:46:16.780 --> 2:46:21.820]  can think about it you know they took him tortured him killed him he disappeared but the fact is
[2:46:22.460 --> 2:46:26.460]  people got that choice to ask themselves now i mean they would just machine gun you tell folks
[2:46:26.460 --> 2:46:32.220]  about that wall that wall was something else uh there there is there was a lookout point at burnour
[2:46:32.220 --> 2:46:38.460]  strasa uh when i was there in 1965 and on one side of the street were buildings that had been cemented
[2:46:38.460 --> 2:46:45.340]  up both the doorways and windows and across the top of the roofs was bob wire and that actually
[2:46:45.340 --> 2:46:49.260]  was the wall the front of these buildings on one side of the street was the actual wall which they
[2:46:49.260 --> 2:46:56.380]  tore down later to put in a stronger more impenetrable type of structure which they designed later
[2:46:56.380 --> 2:47:01.580]  many years later but at that time it was a very very hideous looking wall it was the buildings
[2:47:01.580 --> 2:47:07.180]  that had been cemented up across the street and we would go downtown uh at the cool down the
[2:47:07.180 --> 2:47:12.220]  first indom in west berlin for for drinking and and celebrate you know going out on the night
[2:47:12.220 --> 2:47:17.580]  you know the night clubs and so forth and you could hear at night machine gun fire from from
[2:47:17.580 --> 2:47:21.820]  that close uh it was pretty close to the wall the downtown area was you could hear machine
[2:47:21.820 --> 2:47:27.020]  gun fire and see trip players go off at night as they were shooting people they were shooting
[2:47:27.020 --> 2:47:32.140]  people trying to get out to freedom and this this tyranny is something else and now they're
[2:47:32.140 --> 2:47:37.820]  turning america into one giant wall and in ireland it's it's the same everywhere yes it's it's a
[2:47:37.820 --> 2:47:42.060]  scientific dictatorship i think there were a couple of collins brothers that wrote a book
[2:47:42.060 --> 2:47:46.940]  back a few years ago and i think you've interviewed them and they call it a scientific dictatorship
[2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:53.100]  and and they have really done this in in very depth and uh and their expertise about how to
[2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:59.420]  control people through ideas and systems of thought is is hideous and now in canada if they catch you
[2:47:59.420 --> 2:48:03.740]  without a fair the police confirmed a day of the punishment is being tasered for the poor people
[2:48:03.740 --> 2:48:09.100]  that don't have money because it's like seven bucks to to to use the the subway when you're caught
[2:48:09.100 --> 2:48:13.820]  sneaking on it without paying your punishment now is to be tasered god i mean see how they're just
[2:48:13.820 --> 2:48:19.820]  announcing more and more it it when i was in london in 2006 it was like a maze running through a
[2:48:19.820 --> 2:48:24.380]  maze through the underground and so forth and they had everything thought out where you would get
[2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:29.500]  clipped going in and get clipped coming out they had it all down to money and they were milking
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:35.020]  everyone for as much as they could in in that city much less the country they had it scientifically
[2:48:35.020 --> 2:48:39.580]  set up over there and and what i saw that really impressed me was sitting there with it with a
[2:48:39.580 --> 2:48:45.340]  group of ladies at buckeham palace they're getting ready for the tour is that the riches that they
[2:48:45.340 --> 2:48:50.460]  were putting on display so excited the women especially women because of all those gowns and
[2:48:50.460 --> 2:48:56.140]  all those different awards given to the to the queen that it just it just it you know it it it
[2:48:56.140 --> 2:49:01.100]  what it does is appeals to the worst things in us worshiping bobble yes yes yes that stuff
[2:49:01.100 --> 2:49:05.260]  means nothing to me yes exactly i want to go camp up on the side of a mountain and see the stars
[2:49:05.260 --> 2:49:10.060]  that's diamonds we can only have one one god before us or we can only worship one thing
[2:49:10.060 --> 2:49:15.340]  either god or mammon and we've gotten into a big gigantic worldwide mammon worship system
[2:49:16.060 --> 2:49:20.780]  of wealth i hate mammon i don't even like the things i've got there they're a hassle
[2:49:21.980 --> 2:49:26.860]  yeah you know they they wall street a number of years ago came out with an investment kit for
[2:49:26.860 --> 2:49:33.180]  children so so they want to recruit people into that usury money making system from the from uh
[2:49:33.180 --> 2:49:37.900]  from the young age 10 or 12 years old i think that that this particular kit was designed for
[2:49:37.900 --> 2:49:43.340]  so get them into the investment deal collect interest get that usury going and so forth and so
[2:49:43.340 --> 2:49:49.900]  it's a mind system that's that's that's actually has been built around a money system of usury
[2:49:49.900 --> 2:49:57.420]  taking and and paying it's just amazing how much has america changed you know since you were back
[2:49:57.420 --> 2:50:02.300]  in the military back in the 50s 60s when i was here growing up in south austin that's where i
[2:50:02.300 --> 2:50:09.980]  grew up and went to to school here uh it was uh it was a much more moral society drug drug use
[2:50:09.980 --> 2:50:16.540]  was frowned on by by the peers anyone that was a drug user was a really scum just a low life
[2:50:16.540 --> 2:50:21.980]  and that's the way we we we looked at them coming into the beginnings of the vietnam war and so
[2:50:21.980 --> 2:50:27.820]  forth there was a liberalization uh you know uh which we now know is the cia which they
[2:50:27.820 --> 2:50:32.540]  yes just counterculture stay there george butler okay everybody we got a whole other hour the first

[2:51:54.620 --> 2:51:59.900]  pediatricist told me about callix ointment i'm amazed how fast and efficient this product is at

[2:54:32.380 --> 2:54:38.860]  here well um the uh when you were talking about the one world i mean the new world order and all
[2:54:38.860 --> 2:54:45.980]  that a name seemed to pop up in my head and that name would be Kurt Lewin l-e-w-i-n and what he was
[2:54:45.980 --> 2:54:52.380]  he was a german-born psychologist and sociologist that founded an idea of a force field theory
[2:54:52.380 --> 2:54:59.340]  and and he actually was pioneering in this in the in the mid 1940s 1947 actually is when he died
[2:54:59.340 --> 2:55:05.100]  but he came through uh england and did some work with the tavastok institute and then came over to
[2:55:05.100 --> 2:55:10.540]  america he got into group dynamics and things like that but also this field theory is all
[2:55:10.540 --> 2:55:15.020]  important for us to begin to try to understand what we're caught up in we're surrounded by
[2:55:15.020 --> 2:55:20.700]  electromagnetic radiation and and streams of light you could say are ideas and they're becoming
[2:55:20.700 --> 2:55:25.180]  planted in us they're streamed to us now this is what the elite actually believes yes yes they do
[2:55:25.180 --> 2:55:30.460]  this it's the group consciousness and they've done tests where they'll have monkeys 10 miles away
[2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:33.900]  with a net from another group of monkeys and when they teach the other monkeys how to do
[2:55:33.900 --> 2:55:38.140]  something suddenly the others learn yes that's called quantum entanglement in fact that's a
[2:55:38.140 --> 2:55:43.660]  that's a uh a that's an idea or a dynamic that that where you have instantaneous communication
[2:55:43.660 --> 2:55:47.980]  between those two yes it's the hundred monkey same thing of like you're in the woods and you
[2:55:47.980 --> 2:55:51.900]  know somebody's watching you and you go over the hill and there they are yes six cents but this is
[2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:56.220]  what they believe government documents even if you don't believe it listeners they believe it just
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:01.660]  like the crazy rulers of the world john ronson's new tv show you know has all these top generals
[2:56:01.660 --> 2:56:07.420]  the head of fort bragg where they believe they had troops killing goats with their minds yes
[2:56:07.420 --> 2:56:12.940]  much of this is is is in the head the ideas are used and planted and streamed into us
[2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:19.100]  and then manipulated from media sources and things like that it's a great white mind wash mind game
[2:56:19.100 --> 2:56:24.460]  well let's get into the the authoritarian personality too go ahead you got the floor okay go the the
[2:56:24.460 --> 2:56:30.540]  authoritarian personality type uh the frankford school was a school founded by neil marxist
[2:56:30.540 --> 2:56:35.580]  in frankford germany in the thirties and there were there were some of the greatest minds at the
[2:56:35.580 --> 2:56:40.140]  time and in their studies and so forth one of the ideas they came up with was what they call
[2:56:40.140 --> 2:56:46.140]  the authoritarian personality type and they use this and they from that was parlayed what they
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:51.660]  call the f factor and the f factor had to do with fascism and that's what makes it interesting in a
[2:56:51.660 --> 2:56:56.540]  way because these people are backed in a way by the very fascist that are running the world
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:57:02.060]  themselves so they're running both sides communism and fascism it's black uniform secret arrest
[2:57:02.060 --> 2:57:07.260]  femur camps they only give us a false choice of fascism or communism yes what came out of this
[2:57:07.260 --> 2:57:12.780]  the group that came out of this was a very libertine very liberal type of thinking that that
[2:57:12.780 --> 2:57:18.940]  penetrated our universities with some very libertine thoughts and if that's a sexual
[2:57:18.940 --> 2:57:23.340]  a liberation of sexuality and so forth was something that really permeated our universities
[2:57:23.340 --> 2:57:27.660]  but they said only to do that to pacify the public so they're busy playing and partying
[2:57:27.660 --> 2:57:32.220]  yes documents in the 60s in the u.s saying we're going to have a drug culture from 61
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:36.380]  and then they drove around with the government buses with the lsd and yes what what feels good
[2:57:36.380 --> 2:57:42.140]  do it ken keysy had a bus and he he was uh he was driving it all over it was painted with flowers
[2:57:42.140 --> 2:57:46.700]  and everything on it and he had lsd being distributed from that bus all over america
[2:57:47.340 --> 2:57:50.700]  drop drop acid drop out that was that course that was timothy
[2:57:50.700 --> 2:57:56.060]  and livery's turned out was fbi but that was a very similar type of thinking do your own thing
[2:57:56.860 --> 2:58:01.580]  take a little acid by the way in the 50s the owners of time-lapse books they were all having
[2:58:01.580 --> 2:58:06.540]  lsd parties yes so the point is you think you're rebelling against them using this stuff the point
[2:58:06.540 --> 2:58:11.180]  is they created it all they run it all george butler yes they did stay there we'll be right back

[3:00:27.980 --> 3:00:33.660]  amad and it turns out george butler an austinite since birth even though some of the teachers
[3:00:33.660 --> 3:00:39.660]  at the school where he was a teacher he was bound gagged clearly drowned the evidence clearly murdered
[3:00:39.660 --> 3:00:43.260]  but the police are saying that oh no it's they said it's quite i have their press release it's
[3:00:43.260 --> 3:00:47.980]  very normal to have someone bound when they kill themselves uh so uh we're going to be talking
[3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:53.340]  to that gentleman coming up about 30 minutes we've got a guest who works with him uh coming on the
[3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:57.740]  show uh george butler though we were getting into just just just just one of their mind control
[3:00:57.740 --> 3:01:04.140]  programs and and what they really believe uh going back almost a hundred years ago uh please continue
[3:01:04.140 --> 3:01:10.220]  george well uh we're talking about the frankford school there and this the authoritarian personality
[3:01:10.220 --> 3:01:17.500]  type but it is a mind war system that that conveys into us certain ideas and then those ideas are
[3:01:17.500 --> 3:01:23.980]  manipulated and changed and and reformed and and uh and uh massaged within our minds we take up this
[3:01:23.980 --> 3:01:30.700]  collection of ideas which i call streams of light and that forms our world view having a world view
[3:01:30.700 --> 3:01:36.460]  is is a way to control us and so we're actually become obsessed with extreme world views in some
[3:01:36.460 --> 3:01:42.300]  cases and then we fight each other from the left and the right which is again a controlled paradigm
[3:01:42.300 --> 3:01:49.100]  yes exactly so so it's it's hard to see because we're we're caught up in the field in the system
[3:01:49.100 --> 3:01:54.940]  of thought that we cannot see so it's hard for us to see what we're being addicted to and the
[3:01:54.940 --> 3:01:59.660]  ideas that we become compulsively addicted to it's hard to conceptualize it because it's not
[3:01:59.660 --> 3:02:04.620]  visual yes and we it's hard the only way you can try to do it is try to stand outside your
[3:02:04.620 --> 3:02:09.420]  mind and look back at your thoughts as they're they're flowing through your mind on a real time
[3:02:09.420 --> 3:02:14.220]  basis you got to get outside the box and analyze yes yes and and objectively and that's hard to do
[3:02:14.220 --> 3:02:19.740]  this so the another self and i always call it the real self has to try to nurture itself back
[3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:24.300]  to health it's been wounded from see that's the thing way you describe it i instinctively
[3:02:24.300 --> 3:02:28.940]  had this thought when i was three years old i'm on the back porch playing it's a sunny day the
[3:02:28.940 --> 3:02:33.580]  sprinkler spring it's like a rainbow it's beautiful and i had this understanding that the world was
[3:02:33.580 --> 3:02:38.940]  not me that i was on an island no man is an island and that i had had imaginary games and
[3:02:38.940 --> 3:02:43.900]  imaginary friends and played make believe and i realized that make believe wasn't real at that time
[3:02:43.900 --> 3:02:48.060]  and that there was a whole world outside of me and that i was a tiny island i think most people
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:02:52.060]  don't consciously think about death because they seem to see the stream of human society
[3:02:52.060 --> 3:02:58.380]  civilization and almost think like that is theirs no that is the species and just to extrapolate
[3:02:58.380 --> 3:03:04.300]  these ideas that i have realizing that literally the world is what is outside of me not what is in
[3:03:04.300 --> 3:03:09.740]  me it is the opposite of what the new agers teach and everybody else uh and and so then you are
[3:03:09.740 --> 3:03:13.820]  truly alive when you do realize that there's the rest of the world and that you are interconnected
[3:03:13.820 --> 3:03:19.180]  to it but but they have most adults i see all have their own little costumes whatever collect
[3:03:19.180 --> 3:03:23.260]  their part of whatever group they're part of and they all play to that and and and they're all in
[3:03:23.260 --> 3:03:28.140]  a little imaginary worlds about what position they're in that's why we're into uniforms,
[3:03:28.140 --> 3:03:33.820]  segments, class, all of these things go ahead you know there was a study that came out of the
[3:03:33.820 --> 3:03:39.980]  stanford research institute in the 70s early 70s and then and it was entitled changing images of
[3:03:39.980 --> 3:03:45.980]  man they went through they went back over 250 000 years to the present and started uh
[3:03:45.980 --> 3:03:51.180]  doing an assessment of the images of man during those eras and what they're what they're trying
[3:03:51.180 --> 3:03:55.980]  to do in today's world is they're trying to take us back to a very subjective view just exactly what
[3:03:55.980 --> 3:04:00.940]  you said a few moments ago and in that subjective view they can control that through the outside
[3:04:00.940 --> 3:04:07.260]  media but you will you will give up an objective view of the outside world and take on these inner
[3:04:07.260 --> 3:04:11.740]  notions but without proof and that's why they have these games that hundreds of millions play
[3:04:11.740 --> 3:04:16.700]  where it's imaginary worlds it's virtual yes it's like a virtual prison that they're building that
[3:04:16.700 --> 3:04:23.340]  we're building for ourselves it's an insertion yes exactly exactly alan george stay there we're

[3:04:37.580 --> 3:04:43.420]  a lake he was thrown in uh the colorado river now known as lady bird imperium

[3:08:09.580 --> 3:08:14.540]  your perspective you'll be guest host in the next month or so you'll do it um but you've been saying
[3:08:14.540 --> 3:08:23.580]  a lot about this gentleman who the evidence shows uh was killed i mean the apd immediately puts out
[3:08:23.580 --> 3:08:28.220]  this propaganda uh that he killed himself oh he was loosely bound this is just kind of like when
[3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:34.300]  they killed gary webb shot him twice in the head uh or fami malik with arkansas your comments on it
[3:08:34.300 --> 3:08:38.620]  yeah it says here this is the actual quotation out there when the body was removed from the
[3:08:38.620 --> 3:08:44.300]  lake tape was found around the eyes and the hands and legs were loosely bound the bindings of his
[3:08:44.300 --> 3:08:49.340]  hands and legs and placement of the tape were consistent with hamad having done this to himself
[3:08:49.340 --> 3:08:54.860]  so they were floating the idea on the 16th wednesday on the 16th at 2 p.m of suicide
[3:08:54.860 --> 3:08:59.420]  and there's no way that you can get suicide out of this uh the statement in any way yeah they
[3:08:59.420 --> 3:09:04.940]  said right there in the police statement there's just uh no end of these people and and it's the
[3:09:04.940 --> 3:09:14.380]  same mo and i read the paper uh friday on air and it said that uh his family said he had been upset
[3:09:15.020 --> 3:09:19.980]  about the fbi coming and grabbing all the school books he mailed to palestine and spying on him
[3:09:19.980 --> 3:09:25.820]  and detaining him and and then they spun that to me oh he did commit suicide it was the same thing
[3:09:25.820 --> 3:09:31.260]  with gary webb you know he had seen people in his house climbing out the back window then he moved
[3:09:31.260 --> 3:09:35.420]  he said he was getting threatened we had his friends on that said that and then they shot him
[3:09:35.420 --> 3:09:39.260]  and blew his jaw shot him in the back of the head the guy that exposed the cia drug dealing
[3:09:39.260 --> 3:09:43.740]  pulled a surprise when we had a new book coming out proving everything he'd said vindicating him
[3:09:44.460 --> 3:09:49.020]  and uh they had a head out on him and went and killed him like so many others and the police
[3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:53.980]  said oh i'll never forget it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head uh george
[3:09:53.980 --> 3:10:01.260]  you know the the some of the language in in this uh communicate from the apd said something like this
[3:10:02.060 --> 3:10:07.900]  information was provided to the missing persons unit by persons close to hamad this is what suspects
[3:10:07.900 --> 3:10:12.940]  persons close to hamad who are they tell us who they are okay that he had been experiencing
[3:10:12.940 --> 3:10:17.740]  suicidal thoughts then later on in the next paragraph they talk about this loosely bound
[3:10:17.740 --> 3:10:20.860]  and put in float this thing about but then two days later when the statesman talked to the
[3:10:20.860 --> 3:10:26.300]  family they just said no he'd been upset we need to talk to the family yes this was this was also
[3:10:26.300 --> 3:10:31.020]  they will threaten families and get the family to go along go ahead yeah these are very very it's
[3:10:31.020 --> 3:10:35.020]  like bobby kennedy's son won't talk about his dad's murder even though it's now admitted yeah they
[3:10:35.020 --> 3:10:40.220]  floated this just to get the idea out to the public that you know he he committed suicide
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:44.380]  there's no evidence there that that that existed that he did now you've talked to teachers that
[3:10:44.380 --> 3:10:52.540]  knew him yes a friend of mine uh came and sat down with me soon after this on about 30 sometime
[3:10:52.540 --> 3:10:58.060]  and i think it was after they had disclosed to the teachers that uh hamad had had died
[3:10:58.060 --> 3:11:03.900]  and they were the kids were all upset at the school clean small school middle school and also the
[3:11:03.900 --> 3:11:09.020]  teacher for mad is held because this man was very well loved by many of the teachers in the austin
[3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:13.660]  independent school district they knew him and and had worked with him for several years and they
[3:11:13.660 --> 3:11:17.820]  admired this man by the way those special guests we've got are we calling him from our end of the
[3:11:17.820 --> 3:11:23.340]  network in has any has that been flushed out we better find out that guest is on it about 15 minutes
[3:11:23.340 --> 3:11:27.100]  so let's find out if we're going to call from here in austin or the network is going to call
[3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:31.420]  um all right let's shift gears back into what you were covering them we'll recap this and have
[3:11:31.420 --> 3:11:37.580]  the guest on it about 20 minutes okay we were we're picking up on the the overall scheme of things
[3:11:37.580 --> 3:11:43.980]  is is a system and they're they use systems of thought that they impregnate us with and then
[3:11:43.980 --> 3:11:50.860]  those things are are manipulated from media and and and upsetting very things like this gm food and
[3:11:50.860 --> 3:11:57.980]  and the avian flu epidemics they they continue to uh keep us upset and and in that upsetness
[3:11:57.980 --> 3:12:03.980]  then they can change our views and uh we can we begin to reach different conclusions and different
[3:12:03.980 --> 3:12:08.620]  ideas and different worldviews and that's how they're manipulating and forming us into something
[3:12:08.620 --> 3:12:13.500]  that they want that is way way from our real self it's a it's a false self that's actually
[3:12:13.500 --> 3:12:19.340]  being fed by these false uh and they're not totally false there is truth on some of these
[3:12:19.340 --> 3:12:24.780]  ideas i call it a spell they're mesmerized with a false map made for the mind where it's like
[3:12:24.780 --> 3:12:29.500]  play along and and then i mean that's what all the terror drills and martial law drills and
[3:12:29.500 --> 3:12:33.980]  randomly pulling you over because there's terrorist i mean it's all about the illusion and the drills
[3:12:33.980 --> 3:12:40.060]  are all about feeding into the hysteria that some of the universities in england and great britain
[3:12:40.060 --> 3:12:45.820]  are dedicated to cognitive dissonance and i mean and cognitive psychology i should say
[3:12:45.820 --> 3:12:50.620]  and and on the west coast later on after louis had come in and started establishing his work
[3:12:50.620 --> 3:12:57.740]  in his career the west coast began to be a a cauldron of exactly what you're saying a subjectivism
[3:12:57.740 --> 3:13:06.060]  a a narcotism of al dus huckley comes over and starts building ices cults on the west coast
[3:13:06.060 --> 3:13:11.180]  and and it's all of these things to take us away from being able to discern and establish truth
[3:13:12.460 --> 3:13:16.940]  and and they're all cold-blooded rationalists but they destroy the old religious orders and
[3:13:16.940 --> 3:13:22.220]  bring in new ones to control us yes they don't they have they believe in nothing but but themselves
[3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:27.980]  as being olympian gods you could say they describe themselves as olympians among some of the closer
[3:13:27.980 --> 3:13:32.380]  circles the upper circles and they're uh yeah the great white brotherhood and and they on mount
[3:13:32.380 --> 3:13:37.020]  olympus and they argue that well they're in control that means they deserve to be in control well i
[3:13:37.020 --> 3:13:41.340]  argue they're a cancer just because a cancer kills the host doesn't mean it's elite and it means
[3:13:41.340 --> 3:13:46.780]  it's malfunctioning yes i think uh uses melons to use the word parasites i think in some of his
[3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:51.500]  writings and they're sucking the blood out of us in the very livelihood through interest in other
[3:13:51.500 --> 3:13:55.740]  things but not just our money they're they're sucking their madison avenue at a basic level
[3:13:55.740 --> 3:14:00.380]  admits they want to make you feel inadequate to then sell women hundred dollar cream packages that
[3:14:00.380 --> 3:14:04.940]  cost five dollars to make uh you know you know it's it's all to make you feel inadequate oh like
[3:14:04.940 --> 3:14:09.420]  you're not safe give up your freedoms or you're not pretty you gotta have plastic surgery meanwhile
[3:14:09.420 --> 3:14:15.580]  they're missing out on what life's really all about exploration exploring love passion creativity
[3:14:15.580 --> 3:14:21.500]  you know at one time that's a very important point alex is that they they uh behavioral psychology
[3:14:21.500 --> 3:14:26.540]  school the school of behavioral psychology came out of chicago and johns hopkins and then it moved
[3:14:26.540 --> 3:14:32.140]  very quickly to to madison avenue to to put together some of the largest advertising agencies in the
[3:14:32.140 --> 3:14:37.500]  world they used to want to just modify our behavior but what they've done now is they've reinvented
[3:14:37.500 --> 3:14:43.260]  and put into us identities that we don't really want if we knew what those identities really
[3:14:43.260 --> 3:14:48.620]  would spell let's see i see what identities are i see that they're like a suit of clothes yes and i
[3:14:48.620 --> 3:14:53.340]  see other people it's just like when you see a four-year-old playing with an imaginary character
[3:14:53.900 --> 3:14:58.540]  i see adults and i just instinctively learned this not reading their own documents i later did
[3:14:58.540 --> 3:15:05.420]  most people are play land yes playing the big radio executive that runs a network a patriot network
[3:15:05.420 --> 3:15:11.340]  they are playing uh you know the beautiful woman the seductress they are i mean and that's what police
[3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:17.020]  always talk about our role roles roles government roles and that's why they're so into drills and
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:21.580]  they don't realize that they're literally under mind control yes they are uh there's a story that
[3:15:21.580 --> 3:15:27.260]  judith bar says about the emperor with no clothes well there's a little kid down there that accompany
[3:15:27.260 --> 3:15:32.860]  his parents to watching the emperor parade down the street with no clothes but he says to his parents
[3:15:32.860 --> 3:15:38.380]  mommy daddy the emperor has no clothes they say shut up shut up kid when they got back home they
[3:15:38.380 --> 3:15:44.140]  ignored it totally meaning that we're from inception for my birth we're we're seated in
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:49.020]  some of the stuff that our parents are subjected to also they have not escaped out of it but they
[3:15:49.020 --> 3:15:53.980]  don't know any better by sitting it that's right that's right even if you don't watch television
[3:15:53.980 --> 3:15:58.860]  the mass programming has a feedback yes yes and that that that interacting with others we have
[3:15:58.860 --> 3:16:04.060]  to pick it up yeah and it's a synergy i call it social synergy and this social synergy becomes
[3:16:04.060 --> 3:16:09.900]  all in all overpowering one one influence alone alone by itself would not maybe make us
[3:16:10.460 --> 3:16:15.980]  do a certain action thousands of brands propaganda buffet of lies and in those collectively together
[3:16:15.980 --> 3:16:22.220]  overpower us and control us it's a potion yes a mix it's a sorcery potion and that's what it is
[3:16:22.220 --> 3:16:26.940]  and again they don't believe in the bubbly bubbly those are analogies for us to subconsciously
[3:16:26.940 --> 3:16:32.940]  understand a pinch of this a pinch of yes yes uh there it's a witch's brew it's witchcraft it's
[3:16:32.940 --> 3:16:39.580]  sorcery it's it's a mind control it's it's a mind that's what so he was yes yeah it's an out
[3:16:39.580 --> 3:16:45.260]  here chism of our alchemy of the of the spirit but there's they way want to give us the spirit
[3:16:45.260 --> 3:16:52.700]  that they want us to have to take us away from our real self and and and and concoct and and make a
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:59.580]  virtual well that's where petty and and and weak and and and and and you know corrupt and groveling
[3:16:59.580 --> 3:17:05.420]  then we are so insecure and so afraid we can't ever stand up and and get above it you know at
[3:17:05.420 --> 3:17:10.460]  you know the heights of goodness and just feel the crisp you know power of it all instead of
[3:17:10.460 --> 3:17:16.460]  being down on this level they love isolating us in that because when we do break out of that it
[3:17:16.460 --> 3:17:22.060]  totally defeats them yes if we continue to hate one another and even hate these people will never
[3:17:22.060 --> 3:17:26.940]  get out of it we have to forgive and through that forgiveness we awaken and we can stand outside
[3:17:26.940 --> 3:17:32.140]  and look objective and i agree with that but what i do george subconsciously is and everything on
[3:17:32.140 --> 3:17:37.980]  purpose is that i use anger which short circuits people they've programmed enough because they've
[3:17:37.980 --> 3:17:43.340]  used anger to let them wake up kind of like a blip in the tv stream so they're angry so for a minute
[3:17:43.340 --> 3:17:48.300]  they see reality so then they can get out of it yes i'm not mad when i'm not on air i get mad
[3:17:48.300 --> 3:17:54.860]  when i have to focus on this fully yes you have such an insight and it can be uh uh to to an extent
[3:17:54.860 --> 3:17:59.900]  that you get frustrated at times because you won't so badly to tell people what's really going on
[3:17:59.900 --> 3:18:04.940]  i want to show yes yes but but people are are people and they're not like a light bulb you turn
[3:18:04.940 --> 3:18:12.300]  on and off and it takes a long time to work for them to to awaken to what they're under this influence
[3:18:12.300 --> 3:18:18.780]  that synergistically addictively compulsively binding them to a false self but they little see
[3:18:18.780 --> 3:18:24.300]  they don't see it george what is the establishment going to do as their as their sorcery i mean it
[3:18:24.300 --> 3:18:29.180]  literally is a spell it is a spell yes it is we're mesmerizing yes i mean the tv screen yes yes it
[3:18:29.180 --> 3:18:34.940]  does what are they going to do as that spell evaporates which is now happening yes uh you're
[3:18:34.940 --> 3:18:43.980]  on the forefront of helping that that occur you know um it depends um uh the world is communicating
[3:18:43.980 --> 3:18:49.740]  to a greater extent than they than it ever has individuals worldwide are communicating through
[3:18:49.740 --> 3:18:55.980]  the internet and this has been a god sent type of uh technology and and in doing that what what i
[3:18:55.980 --> 3:19:03.100]  always say is that as as men and as the communication level increases then truth is more easily discernible
[3:19:03.820 --> 3:19:10.140]  with keeping us not uh you know isolated from one another example ten years ago ten years ago
[3:19:10.140 --> 3:19:14.540]  even five years ago youtube wasn't big or other ones we wouldn't see that we are change you uh
[3:19:14.540 --> 3:19:21.900]  uh ireland video of the member of parliament assaulting them and then the times of london
[3:19:21.900 --> 3:19:27.580]  would have gotten away with a lot yes exactly they could hide behind the curtain to veil but now
[3:19:27.580 --> 3:19:33.500]  it's hard to do that and if more of you will take your daggers and slice holes in the veil more
[3:19:33.500 --> 3:19:38.220]  sunlight is going to come in yes god's light will reach us pull out those down all right

[3:24:17.820 --> 3:24:22.860]  guest rapidly accelerating towards us i want to keep you on during that uh but continuing with the
[3:24:22.860 --> 3:24:27.100]  different control modes they have we were talking during the break about how they try to also
[3:24:27.100 --> 3:24:33.100]  balkanize patriot groups or divide and conquer any resistance trying to make people obsess on
[3:24:33.100 --> 3:24:38.700]  one group or another when in their own documents they talk about how they try to dominate every
[3:24:38.700 --> 3:24:44.540]  major group and even play those off against each other starting with left right yes i think this
[3:24:44.540 --> 3:24:50.140]  denver thing is very dangerous i think you had a show earlier last week uh on denver yeah the
[3:24:50.140 --> 3:24:54.780]  recreate 68 has subgroups that are calling for attacking police and now they've come out and
[3:24:54.780 --> 3:25:01.260]  i said we're white supremacists using classic cop attack yes that again that signature is federal
[3:25:01.260 --> 3:25:06.300]  but we already know they're tied in with it yeah we we saw that during the vietnam protest era and
[3:25:06.300 --> 3:25:11.180]  the peace movement also they went in and infiltrated these peace groups and these and then totally
[3:25:11.180 --> 3:25:16.540]  agent for farcature radicalized radicalized them the weathermen oh by the way clinton did
[3:25:17.180 --> 3:25:24.380]  pardon some weathermen but that's okay yeah and obama did bring that up against her so
[3:25:24.380 --> 3:25:29.580]  i thought that was pretty good uh pretty good hit on on the clinton's uh so so they're not what
[3:25:29.580 --> 3:25:35.420]  they appear to be but no one is that it's a mirage it's a delusion it's a it's an illusion
[3:25:35.420 --> 3:25:39.740]  that's presented to us absolutely you know we were talking during a break about how you know
[3:25:39.740 --> 3:25:44.780]  i realize there's evil people in control of every major group and i haven't been pigeonholed because
[3:25:44.780 --> 3:25:50.300]  we want to have a wide appeal to get everybody to fight the policies of the new world order
[3:25:50.300 --> 3:25:54.460]  instead of making it about a particular racial group or subgroup because then they can pigeon
[3:25:54.460 --> 3:25:58.940]  hole us there and that's also in their own battle plans to keep us uh from doing it they want to
[3:25:58.940 --> 3:26:04.620]  make us pick a group to attack to limit our effect yes you're exactly right what they've done also
[3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:09.580]  they pitted the hispanic americans or the mexican americans against the other people in this country
[3:26:09.580 --> 3:26:14.620]  but what we need to do is we need to both we need to wake up on both sides of the border and say hey
[3:26:14.620 --> 3:26:20.220]  we have our leaders to fear on both sides of the border and them alone that's that that we are
[3:26:20.220 --> 3:26:24.300]  at the same time the threats they create are so real you have to respond which then feeds into
[3:26:24.300 --> 3:26:28.940]  the paradigm all i'm saying is let's be honest the mexicans have been taught in mexico that this
[3:26:28.940 --> 3:26:34.140]  belongs to them and that gringos are bad need to die and my whole point is that i'm not trying to
[3:26:34.140 --> 3:26:38.940]  balkanize them when i talk about it let's just be honest about what's i mean just like police i'm not
[3:26:38.940 --> 3:26:43.020]  against the average cop but i'm against them being trained for martial law and violating our rights
[3:26:43.020 --> 3:26:48.460]  yes exactly but they do martial and control those people through hate and and that's the way they
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:55.500]  keep everyone separate absolutely continue we just need to wake up to to these mechanisms that then
[3:26:55.500 --> 3:27:01.580]  these techniques of of continuing to to nurture and and put forward these very hate-filled ideas
[3:27:01.580 --> 3:27:05.740]  about one another whether it's the hispanics against the gringos or whatever or the blacks
[3:27:05.740 --> 3:27:10.220]  against the whites and so forth they've got us totally uh you know what i mean at each other's
[3:27:10.220 --> 3:27:14.780]  throats and it's working because human natures is is susceptible to that's what they said over
[3:27:14.780 --> 3:27:18.220]  a hundred years ago they went to the british crown and others and said look we have sciences of the
[3:27:18.220 --> 3:27:23.660]  mind in germany and in england the main places it came from we can and two competing schools that
[3:27:23.660 --> 3:27:28.060]  merged this is all documented and they said i've had historians and educators and department of
[3:27:28.060 --> 3:27:33.180]  education policy heads on to talk about it and they said we can scientifically craft this and
[3:27:33.180 --> 3:27:37.740]  and have a dictatorship of the elite that never ends and we're a hundred years into this and now
[3:27:37.740 --> 3:27:43.420]  they're getting it ready for the mass extermination yes there's a group in england at sussex university
[3:27:43.420 --> 3:27:48.460]  of sussex that's called the cogs group and if you go into there i recommend you go into there
[3:27:48.460 --> 3:27:53.820]  and to that website at sussex and start drilling down into that site and seeing the white papers
[3:27:53.820 --> 3:27:59.100]  that that that group is putting out and i can't even explain and and tell you what some of those
[3:27:59.100 --> 3:28:05.660]  the titles of some of those papers mean they're deeply into mind research and sociology and
[3:28:05.660 --> 3:28:10.300]  so forth and it's really mind boggling what what they're doing there universities aren't even for
[3:28:10.300 --> 3:28:15.660]  teaching people they take your money your savings to send your kids to school and then literally 90
[3:28:15.660 --> 3:28:20.780]  percent of ut is weapons research mind control research or it's for buying corporations biggest
[3:28:20.780 --> 3:28:26.460]  university in the world here in austin 50 plus billion in their liquid cream fund that increasing
[3:28:26.460 --> 3:28:32.700]  the taxes the taxes pay for it no more free tuition and you go to the psychology department
[3:28:32.700 --> 3:28:36.860]  and of course they got them all over the world other facilities and it's all i was allowed to
[3:28:36.860 --> 3:28:41.260]  see the declassified stuff by somebody that works there who runs all their computers and
[3:28:41.820 --> 3:28:46.140]  it was all mind control they didn't even deny it was how to flicker the tv to control us
[3:28:46.140 --> 3:28:51.500]  how to get women sexually excited with tv to sell them products i mean it's all it's all they do
[3:28:51.500 --> 3:28:58.060]  24 7 what i what i did a while back in my own studies was i took and looked at the isms and
[3:28:58.060 --> 3:29:03.500]  and started substituting the word systems of thought but so there's political systems of
[3:29:03.500 --> 3:29:08.220]  thought and and and so forth and there's psychological systems of thought and so forth
[3:29:08.220 --> 3:29:12.140]  and these are all used to compartmentalize us and to manage us we're gonna have this guest for
[3:29:12.140 --> 3:29:15.740]  about 10 15 minutes but then we're gonna come back to you george stay there i want you to question

[3:33:37.260 --> 3:33:44.620]  uh he is a phd human rights activist for peace and justice in palestine he is the treasurer
[3:33:45.420 --> 3:33:55.020]  uh of the organization that uh raid uh was part of uh he last Tuesday came up missing when
[3:33:55.020 --> 3:34:02.220]  then was found late last week uh in the colorado river a section of it known as ladybird lake
[3:34:02.220 --> 3:34:09.900]  here in austin texas and uh he so he's obviously one of the closest people we can get to this case
[3:34:09.900 --> 3:34:14.460]  and who talk to this man who people are very upset who know him here in austin george knows
[3:34:14.460 --> 3:34:19.420]  some of the teachers at the school he was loved george we didn't make that point clear you have
[3:34:19.420 --> 3:34:24.140]  friends of uh that are teachers or they say he was just loved at the school he was well respected
[3:34:24.140 --> 3:34:31.900]  and loved by by the students and and the faculty and he mailed books to palestinian children yes
[3:34:31.900 --> 3:34:36.860]  he was doing he was doing uh charity work and trying to help those people that were in need
[3:34:36.860 --> 3:34:41.340]  over there okay well people want to just get to the bottom of this we're trying uh dr paul laura
[3:34:41.340 --> 3:34:46.300]  d uh thank you for coming on the air with us sir my pleasure to be with you thank you for having
[3:34:46.300 --> 3:34:51.020]  me you've got the floor everybody we're talking to thinks this is suspicious it stinks to high
[3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:55.500]  heaven can you tell us what you first heard the police first said they thought it was suspicious
[3:34:55.500 --> 3:35:01.340]  and they said it wasn't uh he was bound i mean tell us what you know and what you think and
[3:35:01.340 --> 3:35:05.420]  i was talking to you during the break when we first got you on you said that that the whole
[3:35:05.420 --> 3:35:09.500]  thing is suspicious the way he was treated the way it was handled he went on democracy now about
[3:35:09.500 --> 3:35:15.180]  the harassment uh dr david kelly's told friends they're gonna quote kill me if i don't shut up and
[3:35:15.180 --> 3:35:19.340]  then he was killed and the evidence shows he was murdered but they said it was a suicide
[3:35:19.340 --> 3:35:24.300]  in england i mean there's so many cases of this or or is it a suicide where he would stage his own
[3:35:24.300 --> 3:35:28.380]  death to make it look like he was murdered i mean i that's hard to believe you've got the floor
[3:35:28.380 --> 3:35:37.820]  tell us what you think really happened well i probably will um put to rest some ideas of uh
[3:35:37.820 --> 3:35:43.580]  of conspiracy but maybe feed some other ideas of conspiracy and i believe that there was some
[3:35:43.580 --> 3:35:50.300]  conspiracy involved but perhaps not in the same way that most people do with regard to the specific
[3:35:50.300 --> 3:35:59.180]  events of riad's death um in retrospect all his activities leading up to the time of his death
[3:35:59.740 --> 3:36:05.740]  appear to have been organized in order to take care of his affairs he was carefully putting
[3:36:05.740 --> 3:36:13.020]  his affairs in order and turning over responsibilities and bank accounts and and passwords and uh
[3:36:13.660 --> 3:36:19.340]  and web accounts and all this sort of thing to other people that were close to him including
[3:36:19.340 --> 3:36:31.980]  myself and uh so that's an indication that he was trying to control events and i uh as far as
[3:36:31.980 --> 3:36:40.860]  the what happened the very evening of his disappearance and his death um he i i was the one
[3:36:40.860 --> 3:36:49.180]  who had the very last conversation with him and within a few hours after that his wife uh uh
[3:36:49.180 --> 3:36:56.860]  called me and said we've reported him missing nobody can find him and so forth and um the
[3:36:57.660 --> 3:37:03.580]  and then the next call that i got regarding this was from a police detective or investigator
[3:37:04.220 --> 3:37:11.580]  who said that they were following up on her report uh her missing persons report and he
[3:37:11.580 --> 3:37:21.740]  said that they they did have some uh new information the new information was that uh they had traced
[3:37:21.740 --> 3:37:32.700]  the cell phone signal and into the general area and they found his car and the car was unlocked
[3:37:32.700 --> 3:37:42.620]  but uh the door closed and on the seat of the car were his uh the car keys and his cell phone
[3:37:43.660 --> 3:37:49.580]  why would he not leave a note if he did bound himself i'll come to that well well can we go
[3:37:49.580 --> 3:37:53.420]  back to your last conversation with him since you were the last to talk to him sir okay but
[3:37:53.420 --> 3:37:59.900]  there's something that didn't make the news very much because the one thing that he uh that this
[3:37:59.900 --> 3:38:07.340]  uh uh investigator told me was that they had a photographic record of some of his last moments
[3:38:07.980 --> 3:38:16.460]  because in these situations they look for um like atm surveillance cameras and things like that
[3:38:16.460 --> 3:38:22.300]  and they found a convenience store across the street i think it was that did have a camera that
[3:38:22.300 --> 3:38:30.300]  captured uh some of what happened and that camera captured him driving up sitting there for a period
[3:38:30.300 --> 3:38:35.420]  of time then getting out of out of the car and walking in the direction of a direction of the
[3:38:35.420 --> 3:38:41.660]  lake then returning to the car getting in the car for a briefer period of time and then getting out
[3:38:41.660 --> 3:38:53.260]  of the car again and going to the lake and that um the uh uh that second time was uh corresponded
[3:38:53.260 --> 3:39:02.140]  to the time that he called me have you seen this uh footage i haven't seen the footage myself i think
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:10.220]  his his family has seen it but uh but i it's in it's in often so they can well that's that's big
[3:39:10.220 --> 3:39:15.180]  we're seeing the truth there looks like some dirty dealing to me but uh you're you're saying and
[3:39:15.180 --> 3:39:20.780]  and you're the treasure of the organization uh tell us about the organization well the
[3:39:20.780 --> 3:39:27.020]  organization was uh set up by riyadh uh to a large extent it was a one person show although
[3:39:27.020 --> 3:39:34.220]  there were uh he had volunteers uh uh who contributed in various ways to that including
[3:39:34.220 --> 3:39:40.140]  and especially in palestine uh where he had people who were working on the projects that
[3:39:40.860 --> 3:39:46.940]  the organization supported okay let's get into the part of of of what he said to you and we
[3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:52.540]  appreciate your time sir on the phone right before he reportedly killed himself uh and then expand
[3:39:52.540 --> 3:39:59.340]  from there uh what you do believe is a conspiracy well it was as it turns out it was a very routine
[3:39:59.340 --> 3:40:08.300]  conversation um that uh he just asked if i had followed up on his uh uh uh if i had seen his
[3:40:08.300 --> 3:40:19.820]  emails that he had sent earlier and i said yes and uh uh then i said to him well uh he was he
[3:40:19.820 --> 3:40:24.780]  was about ready to go he whenever he was on the phone it was like he wanted to always get off the
[3:40:24.780 --> 3:40:30.620]  phone as quickly as possible uh as if he was busy or something and so you could never get in a word
[3:40:30.620 --> 3:40:36.700]  edgewise uh with him most of the time and i said wait a minute don't go i said uh i've got some good
[3:40:36.700 --> 3:40:45.500]  news and the good news is that the account that i set up for pc wf in california um had started
[3:40:45.500 --> 3:40:51.340]  to receive donations because he was worried about that uh that no donations had come into this new
[3:40:51.340 --> 3:40:57.660]  account that i'd set up um because donations used to come in on a regular basis well i said
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:03.420]  not only did we receive a donation a donation today but it was a thousand dollars and he said oh was
[3:41:03.420 --> 3:41:10.380]  it from so-and-so and i i looked at it and i i said uh just a second let me find it he said oh it
[3:41:10.380 --> 3:41:17.820]  doesn't matter and i said no no no wait uh and uh so i looked it up and i gave him the name of the
[3:41:17.820 --> 3:41:23.180]  person who had sent the donation and it wasn't the same as the one that he thought and he said oh
[3:41:23.180 --> 3:41:27.980]  okay that's great i'm glad to hear it so forth and he uh he said okay take care of yourself
[3:41:28.540 --> 3:41:33.980]  and that was the end of it that was it was a very routine conversation in many respects well let me
[3:41:33.980 --> 3:41:40.140]  just say this he had the fbi afteream they detained him they'd gone through his house and business
[3:41:40.140 --> 3:41:45.900]  taken all his books and things uh and gone through all his papers and so if he is being
[3:41:45.900 --> 3:41:50.460]  investigated and people involved with sending school books and money to palestine and other
[3:41:50.460 --> 3:41:55.420]  things are getting arrested of course he would start phasing out and moving himself out of the
[3:41:55.420 --> 3:42:01.340]  business and then we have israel saying in upi and ap what five six years ago that they would kill
[3:42:01.340 --> 3:42:07.340]  people in the us supporting palestine uh or you know any terrorist connections i'm not saying israel
[3:42:07.340 --> 3:42:12.540]  did it i'm saying we have to look at that i mean his legs are bound his arms are bound uh you know
[3:42:12.540 --> 3:42:18.620]  all the you know he's got stuff over his eyes uh and and then you're saying that i mean maybe
[3:42:18.620 --> 3:42:22.460]  he was meeting somebody at the lake he was going to give him a big donation i mean i'm just saying
[3:42:22.460 --> 3:42:27.500]  the police always have and it's come out before they made it look like bobby was killed by sir
[3:42:27.500 --> 3:42:32.140]  hand sir hand and then now it's come out the three cia guys were there and they've admitted they
[3:42:32.140 --> 3:42:37.260]  killed him or you know they made it look like kennedy uh i was killed by one guy and now it's
[3:42:37.260 --> 3:42:41.500]  admitted that it that you know that he wasn't i'm just saying that just because he was getting
[3:42:41.500 --> 3:42:48.060]  account shifted over to other people uh that i mean that i don't think proves that he wasn't
[3:42:48.060 --> 3:42:56.780]  suicided no i don't think it does but uh if but i anybody who knows riad would know that he would
[3:42:56.780 --> 3:43:04.460]  never allow himself to uh to be controlled by other people and that's that's that i think is
[3:43:04.460 --> 3:43:09.900]  the real issue and that's where the conspiracy part comes in uh well you think they knew his
[3:43:09.900 --> 3:43:16.620]  psychology and tried to push him over the edge not necessarily but i know but uh i i don't think
[3:43:16.620 --> 3:43:21.180]  they knew his psychology that well you have to really be intimate with him to understand that
[3:43:21.180 --> 3:43:26.620]  i don't think they cared uh as long as they destroyed him that was that was what they that
[3:43:26.620 --> 3:43:32.300]  was what they wanted and they did yeah and he knew that he was essentially being destroyed
[3:43:32.300 --> 3:43:39.980]  he um the mere fact that they it took away his his records and papers and all that sort of thing
[3:43:40.540 --> 3:43:49.820]  and put some controls on his bank account and took away his uh his passport all of that meant
[3:43:49.820 --> 3:43:55.500]  that they were in the process of destroying him now they never found enough evidence to
[3:43:56.220 --> 3:44:02.060]  uh to indict him or arrest him well they always take everything so you can't fight
[3:44:02.060 --> 3:44:08.300]  back it's part of it exactly exactly exactly so that that is that is what was of concern to
[3:44:08.300 --> 3:44:13.500]  him that basically they were destroying what he had created by doing that and furthermore
[3:44:14.060 --> 3:44:22.700]  they were uh making life problematic at at minimum for his family they were going after
[3:44:22.700 --> 3:44:28.700]  his family and and interviewing them and he was concerned and i think there was justification
[3:44:28.700 --> 3:44:35.180]  for this now i've seen the media calling by by raid hameed or hamaud is it a hameedy how do you
[3:44:35.180 --> 3:44:43.420]  pronounce hamed hamed finally got it right there hamed got you sorry so uh so anyway he he um
[3:44:44.220 --> 3:44:50.380]  uh he was very concerned for what was happening to his family that that in in effect the investigators
[3:44:50.380 --> 3:44:55.580]  were trying to get at him through his family and that they were going to accuse his family members
[3:44:55.580 --> 3:45:00.300]  of of being part of a conspiracy oh so he did that you're saying he killed himself to protect his
[3:45:00.300 --> 3:45:08.860]  family by destroying the only link yeah and at the same time he uh uh he was to some extent
[3:45:09.900 --> 3:45:15.820]  protecting his his creation the apiece of the well i'm not i'm not saying i agree with you that
[3:45:15.820 --> 3:45:21.260]  that they drove into suicide but i do see your point and i do see the palestinians uh it's
[3:45:21.260 --> 3:45:26.940]  almost like a what is this cultural thing about he was a hero for for for doing what he did because
[3:45:26.940 --> 3:45:33.500]  because what he was saying is i'm not going to let you go through and indict me and create all
[3:45:33.500 --> 3:45:40.860]  kinds of suspicions and and control my life and have a show trial yes and and to maybe make some
[3:45:40.860 --> 3:45:44.300]  people doubt me and hate me and all that sort of thing let me get george butler's comment
[3:45:44.940 --> 3:45:49.660]  yeah i'm not going to give you control over my life and over my family or anything like
[3:45:49.660 --> 3:45:55.980]  i'm going to take control and his way of taking control is not only to to uh take things out of
[3:45:55.980 --> 3:46:06.300]  their hands but also in the manner of of ending his life that he cast suspicion on his enemies
[3:46:06.860 --> 3:46:18.540]  and uh you know i don't by any means want to end the the speculation about uh about uh how somebody
[3:46:18.540 --> 3:46:23.740]  might have murdered him uh because that that's his legacy yeah paul i've got a yeah this george
[3:46:23.740 --> 3:46:29.660]  butler i have a couple of uh uh comments here for one why don't they present the video to us so we
[3:46:29.660 --> 3:46:35.100]  can look at it and analyze it and it could diffuse this speculation about that should be out quickly
[3:46:35.100 --> 3:46:41.820]  number two uh normally they would by the way number two we need more details on the bounding of of
[3:46:41.820 --> 3:46:48.220]  uh uh raid himself what their reports it says loosely was it loosely or was it firmly bound
[3:46:48.220 --> 3:46:53.340]  if he was firmly bound then it was murder uh this loosely thing i think was floated to put forward
[3:46:53.340 --> 3:46:58.780]  the idea and support the idea of suicide which i don't agree with it at the outset on the outset
[3:46:58.780 --> 3:47:06.860]  here it's possibility but it's not likely um whether it was loosely or or tightly if riyadh
[3:47:06.860 --> 3:47:12.460]  really wanted to do it i think he could find a way to to bind himself tightly uh i don't know the
[3:47:12.460 --> 3:47:20.060]  details of uh of this but he was he was pretty ingenious so he's going to bind to blind himself
[3:47:20.060 --> 3:47:24.780]  and walk down to the lake and throw himself in it's not consistent no the the the story that
[3:47:24.780 --> 3:47:30.460]  they floated is not consistent with suicide well i i as far as i know the what time did he supposedly
[3:47:30.460 --> 3:47:36.300]  do this because it's so busy down there yeah i see i i i don't know too much about the details but
[3:47:36.300 --> 3:47:41.180]  the well he called you you're sitting right before he killed himself uh or or speculating i mean when
[3:47:41.180 --> 3:47:50.300]  did he call you now uh the call was um monday night the 14th that's easier than i seven thirty
[3:47:50.300 --> 3:47:57.180]  in the evening my time which would be nine thirty in in austin well we know this we know that the
[3:47:57.180 --> 3:48:02.620]  sod does run around killing people all all over the world do they not well that's the other thing
[3:48:02.620 --> 3:48:12.860]  that uh he he had reported to me that his neighbor uh had had seen people to two people with funny
[3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:23.180]  accents and uh and uh guns automatic weapons that uh that looked like uh uh the galila weapons
[3:48:23.180 --> 3:48:30.380]  that uh oh my god that that were next door now i all i can do is report to you what he said to me
[3:48:30.380 --> 3:48:34.220]  and well he doesn't sound like somebody who makes stuff up did you know him to make up stuff
[3:48:35.340 --> 3:48:43.500]  uh no not to make up stuff but okay so his neighbor his neighbor sees people with quote funny accents
[3:48:43.500 --> 3:48:49.660]  with with what looks like israeli rifles right yeah the oh yeah the information i have also from
[3:48:49.660 --> 3:48:54.860]  my sources say that the neighbors were approached several months before for surveillance they were
[3:48:54.860 --> 3:48:59.500]  trying to set up surveillance is that correct is that correct some of the surveillance people were
[3:48:59.500 --> 3:49:04.380]  these people with funny accent okay well then i mean you're getting from teachers i got it
[3:49:04.380 --> 3:49:08.380]  from two different stations that heard the scanners that it looked like he'd been tortured
[3:49:08.380 --> 3:49:15.260]  okay okay and and present if the police want to diffuse this uh the speculation about uh
[3:49:15.260 --> 3:49:19.900]  murder and suicide and all that give us those tapes and and i want to see the man walking back
[3:49:19.900 --> 3:49:25.100]  and forth around there i i just it's hard to believe it's unbelievable it's preposterous in my my
[3:49:25.100 --> 3:49:34.460]  opinion well yeah i think the uh the tapes should be released i know at one time when i was asked to
[3:49:35.340 --> 3:49:46.460]  not to um not to mention these in interviews because because uh uh uh because the the case
[3:49:46.460 --> 3:49:51.980]  was still under investigation but as far as i'm concerned uh because they they were still
[3:49:51.980 --> 3:49:56.380]  supposedly they were still pursuing the idea that he was murdered and so there were certain
[3:49:56.380 --> 3:50:02.540]  things that they didn't want to reveal poll poll poll i know that uh a lot of this stuff may seem
[3:50:02.540 --> 3:50:07.900]  like little points to you but every little tidbit is big specifically what did he say about men with
[3:50:07.900 --> 3:50:14.540]  foreign accents and israeli style machine guns at the neighbor's house that they were watching
[3:50:14.540 --> 3:50:20.460]  and that they had communicated with the u.s and investigators oh yeah well then we need a full
[3:50:20.460 --> 3:50:27.260]  blown investigation of very very we need to in panel uh uh look the israelis are good the israelis
[3:50:27.260 --> 3:50:30.940]  are good they make it when i don't want them killing me and everybody's saying i committed
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:37.100]  suicide dammit i'm not killing myself he told me that i asked him to take uh photos of them
[3:50:37.100 --> 3:50:40.940]  if possible stay there stay there we got a break well they're right back unbelievable

[3:54:47.580 --> 3:54:51.420]  okay i want to make this point i have made preparations for the government to kill me
[3:54:51.420 --> 3:54:56.460]  because i've been threatened and physically attacked and then they could later spin that to
[3:54:56.460 --> 3:55:01.980]  say oh look he was you know you will see you too oh look he's suicidal oh look he's bad
[3:55:02.700 --> 3:55:07.340]  he knows that misad or shin bad or whatever hit team they hired is running around his house the
[3:55:07.340 --> 3:55:12.140]  neighbors are telling him this of course he starts getting ready to die and a lot of times
[3:55:12.140 --> 3:55:18.140]  what i've been told by people in dea cia fbi that when a mafia group hits you they usually contract
[3:55:18.140 --> 3:55:22.540]  for somebody else to do it they they come into your house it's dark they say okay come with us
[3:55:22.540 --> 3:55:26.060]  you're going to write a suicide letter we're going to kill your family you know watch your
[3:55:26.060 --> 3:55:29.500]  daughter get dropped off at school today i'm going to rape her i'm going to cut her head off
[3:55:30.060 --> 3:55:33.740]  i'm going to rape her for a couple days before i kill her or maybe we'll fly her into saudi
[3:55:33.740 --> 3:55:38.940]  arabia to a slave brothel so they might have told him to go commit suicide i mean very
[3:55:38.940 --> 3:55:44.220]  sophisticated ways to get this done so all i'm saying is this thing sticks to high heaven
[3:55:44.220 --> 3:55:48.300]  and the cops at first were saying they thought it was suspicious then they changed her story
[3:55:48.300 --> 3:55:54.060]  all i'm saying is with them with the uh what looks like israeli is running around the surveillance
[3:55:54.060 --> 3:55:58.300]  the harassment he was getting his doctorate why would he want to give up on life i mean that's
[3:55:58.300 --> 3:56:05.740]  my question uh to you doctor well there's more to it than that because the timing of it i discussed
[3:56:05.740 --> 3:56:11.980]  this with riyadh i believe that the raid was connected to my cooperation with riyadh uh
[3:56:11.980 --> 3:56:17.340]  with another organization the free gaza movement that is taking boats into gaza this summer in
[3:56:17.340 --> 3:56:24.460]  defiance of the israeli blockade and we were at a stage where he was going to get those boats for
[3:56:24.460 --> 3:56:31.900]  us and him being taken out of the picture at that time with the fbi raid really caused some damage
[3:56:31.900 --> 3:56:38.140]  not complete damage to what we were doing so now we learn how it turned into a military operation
[3:56:38.140 --> 3:56:42.220]  why they probably gave the red line and again they're very slick they say they're the slickest
[3:56:42.220 --> 3:56:48.620]  uh comments george was that again what kind of operation was that it was bringing aid supplies
[3:56:48.620 --> 3:56:55.180]  on boats aid supplies no but uh we're taking volunteers in there to to end the blockade of
[3:56:55.180 --> 3:57:01.500]  gaza and and this was at a crucial time when he was involved in boat procurement for us
[3:57:02.060 --> 3:57:07.180]  but this was a charitable uh type of uh operation there was a human rights operation
[3:57:07.180 --> 3:57:13.900]  it was similar to no military no military implications of any kind of no material good
[3:57:13.900 --> 3:57:18.220]  guys have had him go over you with a fine tooth comb i mean you guys all espouse peaceful right
[3:57:18.940 --> 3:57:24.220]  yeah of course but uh the point is if they wanted to disrupt our operation and end our
[3:57:24.220 --> 3:57:29.260]  operation that would have been a very good way to do it and so that's what that's where we believe
[3:57:29.260 --> 3:57:36.780]  the israeli connection came in that the israeli uh uh uh fed something to the u.s investigators
[3:57:36.780 --> 3:57:43.820]  in order to in order to cause this disruption but they've been after him for years i'm even excuse me
[3:57:43.820 --> 3:57:49.900]  for for decades uh they they've been after him this is not the first well the israelis were
[3:57:49.900 --> 3:57:54.220]  seen running around with machine guns they did that on purpose to create and instill terror
