[00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:05.934]  For what is a man?
[00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.974]  What has he got?
[00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:10.434]  If not himself,
[00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:39.252]  Then he has not to say the things he truly feels.
[00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:13.695]  We are still here at the end of 2022 under unprecedented globalist deep state attack, but the new world order is in deep trouble on every single front.
[00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:18.996]  The world is waking up to tyrants like we've done over and over again.
[00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:24.457]  We're coming into the bottom of the decadent cycle and hopefully coming out of it very, very soon.
[00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:26.918]  But that's going to be dictated by the actions that we
[00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:31.565]  People that care about liberty and freedom take against these tyrants.
[00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:32.105]  All right.
[00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:37.967]  Huge, huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:40.707]  Massive economy news.
[00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:42.708]  Massive military news.
[00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:46.509]  Huge COVID-19 news.
[00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.250]  Police state news.
[00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.231]  Government pushed beyond assisted suicide.
[00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.412]  Government orchestrated
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.662]  Intimidated, bullied suicide, indoctrinating children, you name it.
[00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:05.183]  We have got so much to cover.
[00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:08.745]  And as I said, all the positive news coming out.
[00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:14.467]  The awakening to the WEF, to the New World Order, to global governance is just massive.
[00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.668]  It's all over the world.
[00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:16.968]  Everybody's discussing it.
[00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:17.949]  It's the top stories.
[00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:25.270]  In Africa and Latin America and Pacific Islands and Australia and New Zealand and Europe and the U.S.
[00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.090]  and Canada.
[00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.256]  It's just everywhere now with government leaders, prime ministers, presidents even coming out against the New World Order.
[00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:38.920]  Criminal investigations of Pfizer and Moderna and Bill Gates in Germany, in Florida.
[00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:42.741]  Here in the United States, it is massive.
[00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:49.931]  Criminal investigations of Chase Bank, working with Jeffrey Epstein and his trafficking operations.
[00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.014]  All of it, ladies and gentlemen, is massive.
[00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:54.478]  And then, speaking of trafficking, Andrew Tate.
[00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:58.013]  I've gotten to know him over the last five years or so.
[00:02:58.013 --> 00:02:59.274]  We've hung out a few times at dinner.
[00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:02.777]  He's been on the show very gentlemanly, very nice.
[00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:09.022]  I've been out to dinner with him and his brother and my wife several times, and he told me about people trying to set him up and all the BS.
[00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.403]  He has no criminal record.
[00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:13.125]  His dad's a former world chess champion.
[00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:16.048]  He's a three-time heavyweight champion.
[00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:20.198]  Very, very calculated.
[00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:22.218]  Very, very in control of himself.
[00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:25.159]  I don't get any bad vibes off of Andrew.
[00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.700]  I know that he and his brother with Cam Girls reportedly made over $100 million.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.681]  If you check even with law enforcement, it's not Cam Girls where you see the trafficking going on.
[00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:34.901]  I don't really agree with it.
[00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.722]  I don't really like it.
[00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:39.803]  I didn't even really know he was into that until after I knew him for a few years.
[00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.183]  But that's where he made a lot of his wealth.
[00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.928]  So he's definitely a G when it comes to that.
[00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:52.592]  But he's just a guest on the show because I think he's a well-spoken person and has become the most Googled person in the world.
[00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:59.117]  And I've definitely been reaching out to his viewers and listeners who are into male empowerment.
[00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:04.581]  I want to take them to the next level understanding the globalists are targeting male empowerment and trying to destroy it.
[00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:06.062]  And then you understand the whole new world order.
[00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:17.524]  So that said, I go on CNN, I go on ABC News, I go on Japanese TV, I go on Russian TV, I go on Mexican TV, I go on Brazilian TV, and I've gone on his show, he's been on my show.
[00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.325]  I do not believe this story is true.
[00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:25.226]  I've heard about this report for over a year.
[00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.168]  He told me about it.
[00:04:27.168 --> 00:04:31.053]  And it is the girl's boyfriend that filed this report.
[00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:35.459]  And then what they did, just like with Julian Assange, is they went and talked to other women.
[00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:39.283]  And you read what they're claiming he did and the supposed charges they want, and it just doesn't fit.
[00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:43.346]  Uh, and so there was the one video of him spanking his girlfriend.
[00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:45.308]  She came out and said, I asked him to do that.
[00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:46.248]  It was a joke video.
[00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:48.710]  It wasn't like punched her in the face.
[00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.432]  And so, so the point is, this is a hit job.
[00:04:51.432 --> 00:04:58.837]  He came out against Greta Thunberg, uh, and 24 hours later, when it was the top story in the world, he was raided by the police in Romania.
[00:04:58.837 --> 00:04:59.217]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.263 --> 00:05:05.805]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.487]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:20.312]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:21.673]  These products work great for women as well.
[00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:24.674]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:27.176]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:32.979]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.

[00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:41.304]  Take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:42.845]  Don't do it during the day.
[00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:45.846]  1776 testosterone boost.
[00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:46.927]  Totally incredible.

[00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:14.093]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:06:14.093 --> 00:06:22.314]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:38.278]  Alright, I have talked to Andrew Tate's lawyer, and I've got the inside scoop on what's really going on, not just from Andrew Tate, talking to him the last few years, talk on the phone on a routine basis, and
[00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:51.398]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'll give you the inside scoop on what's going on with he and his brother Tristan being arrested in Romania at their home.
[00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:55.239]  And the supposed charges they're talking about trying to levy against him.
[00:06:55.239 --> 00:07:01.502]  And of course, I can tell you that it's completely, absolutely, totally made up.
[00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:05.343]  Andrew Tate is well known for being neurotic about not breaking the law.
[00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:13.522]  About being neurotic, about knowing they're trying to set him up, and it's well known that people try to start fights with him and stuff.
[00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:16.283]  You know what Andrew Tate does?
[00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:18.524]  He walks away.
[00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:19.724]  And so I know his M.O.
[00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:31.649]  He was not trafficking women and all this crap, but they know how to come after us for the things that we've been exposing that they've been doing with the deep state with children and everything else.
[00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:35.105]  It's the same way they got Julian Assange.
[00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:40.012]  Two really hot women picked him up at a bar and he went home with them.
[00:07:40.012 --> 00:07:42.215]  It turned out they worked for the CIA.
[00:07:42.215 --> 00:07:44.398]  Sex operatives.
[00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:46.501]  It happens to me all the time.
[00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:47.423]  I was at a business meeting.
[00:07:47.423 --> 00:07:48.404]  They were obviously tracking us.
[00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:59.166]  And just about a month ago, and this woman just came over, demanded that I go out with her, demanded I leave with her, followed us out of the car, everything else.
[00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.788]  And it's just all a total setup, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:10.175]  I mean, it's very, very dangerous to be fighting the New World Order if you are promiscuous or not married, because they will set you up.
[00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:15.500]  And Julian Assange, what, 10 years later, still locked up with no real trial.
[00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:19.633]  And the Deep State admits they orchestrated the whole thing.
[00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:30.301]  CIA operatives had sex with him, and then claimed the condom broke, so it was rape.
[00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:39.628]  And then later it came out, five years after, that they were Central Intelligence Agency sex operatives.
[00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:41.170]  You ought to see the drug company reps.
[00:08:42.193 --> 00:09:03.585]  My dad's been a dentist for a long time and I have friends and family that are medical doctors and I was in a medical clinic about two years ago and I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I see this drug rep woman walk in who was so beautiful that she just radiated sexiness and feminine power and I sat there.
[00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:04.945]  They had me in a little side clinic.
[00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:05.986]  I was getting some antibiotics.
[00:09:05.986 --> 00:09:07.327]  I had an infection on the cut of my leg.
[00:09:08.117 --> 00:09:10.058]  And they were dressing it and fixing it and stuff.
[00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:16.661]  And I'm sitting there for about 10 minutes listening to her sell that clinic to up their prescriptions of certain drugs.
[00:09:16.661 --> 00:09:19.023]  I just watched one of these big clinics and walked in.
[00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:20.423]  I've never been there.
[00:09:20.423 --> 00:09:27.947]  And I'm sitting there with the door open watching her and just seeing that manipulation.
[00:09:27.947 --> 00:09:31.669]  Well, imagine the women the CIA has, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:33.453 --> 00:09:36.417]  And so that is where this world is.
[00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:40.121]  And they put sex operatives on me all the time.
[00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:45.007]  I mean, I told the story of the Russians put two of them on me, two different times in New York.
[00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:47.791]  And they were just point blank, beautiful blondes.
[00:09:48.642 --> 00:09:53.986]  And they were like, we like Putin, you like Putin, you like, we go to the hotel room with you, both times.
[00:09:53.986 --> 00:09:56.328]  And then I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:56.328 --> 00:10:04.453]  Then there'd be like a Russian guy, step up, an older guy, do you want stocks, bonds, you come to Miami, we give you money, Putin like you.
[00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:07.415]  So, it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:10:07.415 --> 00:10:10.077]  I've had the CIA try to recruit me, I've had the
[00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:15.514]  Kissinger Group tried to recruit me in front of the producer, John Harmon.
[00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:16.834]  He's a witness to that.
[00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:20.536]  And I'm not up here just rattling this off to try to sound cool.
[00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:26.139]  People need to know, when you're fighting the New World Order, it is a James Bond movie for real.
[00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:31.622]  Like in the James Bond movies, there's always a hot chick trying to pick him up, and then she tries to kill him in the bedroom.
[00:10:31.622 --> 00:10:32.882]  That happens a lot.
[00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.324]  A lot of people get killed by sex operatives.
[00:10:35.324 --> 00:10:37.765]  So, you know what goes on with Alex Jones?
[00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:41.667]  Happily married, and the zipper is up.
[00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:41.847]  But...
[00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:54.101]  Andrew Tate's 36 years old, former three-time heavyweight kickboxing world champion, and he has been set up bigger than Dallas.
[00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:58.045]  Because he told me about it, and I know the inside baseball, and I know other sources in the UK.
[00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:03.011]  This is British Intelligence MI6, at the behest of the WEF and the Vildenberg Group.
[00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:06.551]  He already got investigated for this stuff a year ago.
[00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:08.973]  He went to the police station in April.
[00:11:08.973 --> 00:11:10.434]  They cleared him of anything.
[00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:17.781]  And now you see, with the same allegations, the SWAT team raid, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:20.263]  So, there you go.
[00:11:21.607 --> 00:11:26.611]  Ladies and gentlemen, we know how the devil got Adam to eat the apple.
[00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:28.392]  It was with Eve.
[00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:32.575]  And the story just continues on over and over again.
[00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:37.258]  So we should pray for Andrew and Tristan because they're politically incorrect.
[00:11:37.258 --> 00:11:41.962]  And he is reaching, I'll be conservative about this, the numbers are about 400 million
[00:11:44.063 --> 00:11:48.347]  Men ages 25 and younger and down into teenagers.
[00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:51.609]  I mean all they talk about in middle school and high school is Andrew Tate.
[00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:52.910]  And he's talking about the new world order.
[00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.931]  He's talking about the globalists.
[00:11:53.931 --> 00:11:55.593]  He's talking about Alex Jones.
[00:11:55.593 --> 00:12:00.637]  He's talking about, you know, all these things and they just can't stand it.
[00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.219]  So there you go straight to jail.
[00:12:04.813 --> 00:12:16.398]  Now I said I'd give you the inside baseball on that at the bottom of the hour, but now I'll do it in the last second of this hour, because I've got other stuff to hit, and I care about, you know, what's happening to Andrew.
[00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:21.240]  But in the big picture, we've got some really big fish to fry here.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.542]  So let me get this out first.
[00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:27.203]  Let's break this down.
[00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:32.891]  I am proud of the fact that we're able to track it back to Communist China.
[00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:38.533]  Starting yesterday afternoon, we've had about 150 million visits to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:41.995]  Of course, 99.9% of them are fake.
[00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:43.035]  They are bot attacks.
[00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:44.936]  They are DDoS attacks.
[00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:47.097]  They're just flooding us with traffic.
[00:12:47.097 --> 00:12:48.978]  The site security is great.
[00:12:48.978 --> 00:12:50.579]  That's why the site locks down.
[00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:54.961]  You got to go do those little puzzles and stuff when you go to it to make sure you're a human.
[00:12:56.714 --> 00:12:58.375]  We've got every security feature on you can imagine.
[00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:01.657]  So none of the security's been breached in FortWorthStore.com.
[00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:04.578]  It's as strong as a fortress.
[00:13:04.578 --> 00:13:10.281]  But it's been slow because of the 150 million visits it's gotten.
[00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:14.383]  Again, 99.99999% of them are fake.
[00:13:14.383 --> 00:13:17.245]  So I want to thank you all for going through the trouble to do the little
[00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:29.626]  Puzzles and things to prove you're a human and get to the site and then to order there because we've got about a $200,000 to $250,000 shortfall every month for the last six months.
[00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:31.707]  We've made it through most of the legal bills.
[00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:34.008]  We're going to the appeals process.
[00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:36.509]  We've got new products coming in.
[00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:40.010]  We should be stabilized very, very soon.
[00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.672]  But if we don't get out of the million dollar hole we're in for the last six months,
[00:13:44.642 --> 00:13:48.624]  We won't be able to buy more product after this group of product that came in.
[00:13:48.624 --> 00:13:54.208]  We'll be living off what we're selling and paying for the operation, but not having money to buy in the future.
[00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.389]  It's kind of like when farmers finally have their last crop.
[00:13:56.389 --> 00:14:00.012]  They go, well, we don't have enough money to buy seed next season, so this is our last crop.
[00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:01.853]  And then you sell the farm, you move the city.
[00:14:01.853 --> 00:14:04.694]  Well, if I was a farmer failing, I would just do that.
[00:14:04.694 --> 00:14:06.315]  But we're waking up minds.
[00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:09.818]  We're farming souls to awaken to the New World Order.
[00:14:09.818 --> 00:14:11.659]  We can't stop this operation.
[00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:13.240]  So I need the seed money.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.942]  We've got a lot of sponsors coming in next year, a lot of those things I'm doing, where I won't have to sit here and beg so much, because believe me, it gets annoying.
[00:14:20.942 --> 00:14:22.583]  Plus, we've got great products you already need.
[00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:27.684]  So, don't let the Chai comms, don't let the globalists, keep you from getting to InfoWarshore.com.
[00:14:27.684 --> 00:14:30.105]  And listen, some of these products, like the Vitamin D3 gummies,
[00:14:30.925 --> 00:14:32.886]  Big Soul for $19.95.
[00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:34.607]  We don't even make $10 on that.
[00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:35.868]  These are high quality.
[00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:51.916]  So, the greatest way for you to help us get out of this hole, the good news is the hole's not that big with a great audience like this, and I believe in you and I humbly ask for your support, is to go get the vitamin D3 gummies that are the highest quality you're going to find for the price you're paying.
[00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.476]  And this is just insanely good.
[00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.917]  The best vitamin D3 there is.
[00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:58.199]  Everybody needs it for your muscles, your brain, your body, your immune system.

[00:15:35.008 --> 00:15:36.469]  We've redirected the site.
[00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:38.751]  It was for my legal, because that got taken care of.
[00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:40.392]  You guys did it, so thank you.
[00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:41.533]  Or I wouldn't be here.
[00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:45.996]  So now we're redirecting it back to InfoWars to support free speech systems and what we're doing here.
[00:15:45.996 --> 00:15:48.677]  So save InfoWars.com.
[00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:50.218]  Save InfoWars.com.
[00:15:50.218 --> 00:15:52.600]  It's going to be redirected right to the sub-page.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.781]  InfoWarsStore.com so you can make donations.
[00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:56.002]  Such a critical time in the fight.
[00:15:56.002 --> 00:15:56.663]  Thanks for your support.
[00:15:56.663 --> 00:15:57.143]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:09.112]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:16:09.112 --> 00:16:18.258]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:20.518]  We've gone right to the manufacturer.
[00:16:20.518 --> 00:16:21.559]  We were listeners.
[00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.739]  The owner's a fan.
[00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:25.380]  And they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.841]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:32.402]  And not just under one name.
[00:16:32.402 --> 00:16:37.883]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:41.964]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[00:16:42.404 --> 00:16:44.285]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:46.966]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[00:16:46.966 --> 00:16:49.828]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:51.628]  These things are incredible.
[00:16:51.628 --> 00:16:57.551]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[00:16:57.551 --> 00:16:58.872]  Get them at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:05.878]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[00:17:05.878 --> 00:17:10.502]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:13.044]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[00:17:13.044 --> 00:17:15.526]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[00:17:15.526 --> 00:17:22.292]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:25.675]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:36.960]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.202]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:42.202 --> 00:17:51.586]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's joint care, or whether it is super greens, we have them all at InfoWarsStore.com under the banner
[00:17:51.986 --> 00:17:54.328]  Of InfoWars MD.
[00:17:54.328 --> 00:17:57.851]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:17:57.851 --> 00:17:59.953]  InfoWars MD.
[00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:04.537]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[00:18:04.537 --> 00:18:07.640]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.701]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:18:09.701 --> 00:18:11.403]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:12.964]  They know we've got their number.
[00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:16.988]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:18:17.668 --> 00:18:25.531]  And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:35.934]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:37.323]  I think so.
[00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:06.889]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:12.776]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:19.143]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[00:19:19.443 --> 00:19:26.668]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:36.956]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:46.378]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[00:19:46.378 --> 00:19:53.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.162]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:07.870]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:19.127]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday edition, December 30th, 2022.
[00:20:19.127 --> 00:20:21.668]  Friday bombshell broadcast.
[00:20:21.668 --> 00:20:22.988]  You know, I have a blind spot.
[00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:27.530]  It's something weird that happens to me when something is so massive and so huge.
[00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.911]  I learned about it this morning.
[00:20:28.911 --> 00:20:34.333]  I went and checked the congressional record and the J6 committee record for myself, and I have a copy of it here in my hand.
[00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:42.557]  This was so big that I should have started the broadcast immediately with us, and I meant to, but then I didn't.
[00:20:42.557 --> 00:20:42.737]  So
[00:20:44.008 --> 00:20:48.332]  I'm going to hit the other news now, but when we come back I'm going to hit this.
[00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:52.536]  Please put the live show headline back up on screen.
[00:20:52.536 --> 00:20:55.759]  This makes me actually gasp for breath a little bit here.
[00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:56.520]  This is so insane.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.081]  We're going to play the clips.
[00:20:58.081 --> 00:21:03.526]  Ray Epps confessed under oath to orchestrating January 6.
[00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:11.782]  And then they defended him in the New York Times and the J6 committee said he was a good person.
[00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:14.003]  We have him ramming signs into police.
[00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:16.265]  We have him telling people go into the breach.
[00:21:16.265 --> 00:21:20.147]  We have him saying attack the Capitol.
[00:21:20.147 --> 00:21:30.994]  And in the J6 transcripts when he was interviewed, remember we kept saying release those, release the 14,000 hours of footage they have from the thousands of cameras in the Capitol.
[00:21:32.344 --> 00:21:37.228]  They've declared national security on those and said they're not releasing them for at least 20 years.
[00:21:37.228 --> 00:21:41.191]  Maybe like the JFK files, maybe here in 60 years.
[00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:46.876]  And Ray Epps told them he quote, orchestrated it.
[00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:48.397]  Under oath.
[00:21:48.397 --> 00:21:49.458]  Now you know why he did that.
[00:21:50.885 --> 00:21:54.966]  The FBI did their job and subpoenaed his records.
[00:21:54.966 --> 00:21:58.687]  Remember, he was on the wanted list for the first few days.
[00:21:58.687 --> 00:22:00.347]  But that's the low-level FBI.
[00:22:00.347 --> 00:22:04.148]  They were shut down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:04.148 --> 00:22:14.411]  But under oath, they had his text messages where he was bragging to a family member that he orchestrated the break-in.
[00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:16.311]  Well, we don't need Ray Epps to tell us that.
[00:22:16.311 --> 00:22:18.472]  We have him running around like a chicken with his head cut off.
[00:22:20.796 --> 00:22:34.642]  Telling everybody to attack the Capitol days before and that day and ramming signs and telling people help him ram giant Trump signs into the police.
[00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:35.643]  And then it goes on from there.
[00:22:35.643 --> 00:22:40.285]  They ordered half the Capitol Police away to do crowd control at the Ellipse a mile away.
[00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:44.307]  A mile and a half away.
[00:22:44.307 --> 00:22:48.949]  And they said no to Trump and Milley threatened to resign if Trump overrode him.
[00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:53.116]  And tried to put National Guard there.
[00:22:53.116 --> 00:23:05.060]  Turns out General Flynn's brother who was in command put a direct request in and was overruled by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:18.965]  Ann Pelosi got involved and had her film crew there with her daughter and for Netflix and to make a whole movie that day and here came Ray Epps and their operatives to create a mob psychology for a few Oath Keepers and a few
[00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:24.803]  Crowd Boys got involved once the police got manipulated into a fight.
[00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:25.483]  They couldn't win.
[00:23:25.483 --> 00:23:29.127]  And it's just like a bar fight.
[00:23:29.127 --> 00:23:30.328]  And have you ever seen a bar fight?
[00:23:30.328 --> 00:23:33.791]  I've been unfortunate enough to be dumb enough to be in a few of them.
[00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:37.935]  It looks just like an old western movie with John Wayne.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:54.205]  Where one guy punches one guy, that guy punches the other guy, he falls over the table, people get mad to attack that guy, his buddies jump in, their buddies jump in, and pretty soon there's tables and stools and chairs flying around and whiskey bottles hitting people upside the head.
[00:23:55.629 --> 00:23:57.809]  And that's exactly what they did.
[00:23:57.809 --> 00:24:00.690]  They had a million-plus people march to that Capitol.
[00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.591]  We'd had Trump rallies everywhere that were peaceful, including two in D.C.
[00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:04.371]  right before it.
[00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:14.333]  We were there to show them that we weren't buying the fraudulent election and call for a legal 10-day investigation by the Senate that Democrats have called for before themselves in previous elections.
[00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:18.014]  And I walked right into a damn trap, and I tried to stop people going in that building.
[00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:22.287]  So that's what happened, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:22.287 --> 00:24:24.809]  And they manipulated us into a bar fight with the police.
[00:24:24.809 --> 00:24:28.211]  The police were victims of being set up.
[00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:30.312]  The citizens were victims.
[00:24:30.312 --> 00:24:35.495]  And it was all deep state coordinated, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:35.495 --> 00:24:42.219]  And I showed up in the middle of the bar fight, got up on a big stack of chairs, and told people, stop!
[00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:42.839]  Don't go in!
[00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:44.000]  You're going to get Kent stated!
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.140]  People are going to get killed!
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.801]  And it happened.
[00:24:46.801 --> 00:24:48.162]  30 minutes after I gave that speech.
[00:24:52.975 --> 00:24:55.497]  Ashley Maddott got executed.
[00:24:55.497 --> 00:25:01.583]  So, see, I said I'm going to cover it next segment, but I'm going to cover it properly next segment.
[00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:04.545]  This is so big.
[00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:10.771]  And can you imagine why they sealed their investigation for 20 years at least?
[00:25:10.771 --> 00:25:14.174]  It's now sealed for 20 years.
[00:25:14.174 --> 00:25:15.936]  Two decades.
[00:25:15.936 --> 00:25:18.218]  Absolutely criminal.
[00:25:19.994 --> 00:25:28.257]  While they ran around subpoenaing my records, and harassing my crew, and charging two of our crew that were peaceful there, and Owen Schroyer...
[00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:35.292]  Also told people not to go in the building, and he's still facing years in prison.
[00:25:35.292 --> 00:25:46.021]  And the FBI, the Justice Department filed charges on him, and you read those charges, they say he went in the Capitol, they say he led an attack, they say he attacked police, he didn't go in the damn Capitol.
[00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:53.607]  They said in a federal filing to the judge that he committed perjury, and that he does not work at InfoWars.
[00:25:53.607 --> 00:25:55.049]  We've read the, we've read
[00:25:56.957 --> 00:26:05.102]  The arrest filing and later court filings, they still go to a federal judge and say, Owen Schroer went in the building.
[00:26:05.102 --> 00:26:06.523]  Owen Schroer attacked police.
[00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:08.144]  Owen Schroer told people to attack.
[00:26:08.144 --> 00:26:10.506]  Owen Schroer did the opposite.
[00:26:10.506 --> 00:26:12.587]  Owen Schroer did not go in the building.
[00:26:12.587 --> 00:26:14.568]  Owen Schroer did not attack police.
[00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:17.911]  Owen Schroer tried to stop people.
[00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:21.493]  But Owen Schroer is charged.
[00:26:21.493 --> 00:26:24.415]  And Sam Montoya, I really like Sam.
[00:26:25.603 --> 00:26:26.824]  I said, Sam, you gotta stay here.
[00:26:26.824 --> 00:26:29.446]  We gotta have you and Harrison Smith stay when we take the crew up there.
[00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:30.847]  You can't go!
[00:26:30.847 --> 00:26:33.048]  To show how lenient I am.
[00:26:33.048 --> 00:26:37.831]  I learned Sam was there when I learned he got footage of Ashley Babbitt being executed.
[00:26:37.831 --> 00:26:40.373]  And I chewed his ass out.
[00:26:40.373 --> 00:26:42.374]  And I liked Sam.
[00:26:42.374 --> 00:26:43.355]  But it didn't matter.
[00:26:43.355 --> 00:26:48.558]  They tried to then charge me for ordering him to go in there.
[00:26:48.558 --> 00:26:50.820]  Then obviously they leaned on him, but he hasn't lied.
[00:26:51.633 --> 00:26:54.335]  But that's where all this is.
[00:26:54.335 --> 00:26:57.737]  That's what's going on with these people, and it's disgusting.
[00:26:57.737 --> 00:26:59.959]  Just like they set up the attack on Governor Whitmer.
[00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:03.481]  Okay, I said I'd get to it next segment, I will.
[00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:08.705]  But we have just so much to cover here today.
[00:27:08.705 --> 00:27:12.888]  And oh my goodness, we've got new WEF information and videos, and we've got
[00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:18.931]  Mainstream media bitching and complaining that their own children won't take the poison shots they're in a lake.
[00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:22.352]  I mean there is a big movement exploding.
[00:27:22.352 --> 00:27:34.994]  People know now the New World Order is real and I just got to commend the crew and our guests and our family of callers and listeners and just everybody because when you call in and thank me, it's obnoxious and I appreciate you.
[00:27:34.994 --> 00:27:36.275]  But thank yourself.
[00:27:36.275 --> 00:27:37.175]  Thank you for the support.
[00:27:38.576 --> 00:27:44.538]  I know you mean well and I love you, but you need to understand, you are the reason we're still on air.
[00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:45.638]  You did this.
[00:27:45.638 --> 00:27:46.858]  You're the tip of the spear.
[00:27:46.858 --> 00:27:49.439]  You know how important you are when you share articles and videos?
[00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:52.760]  You know how important you are when you buy our products?
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.521]  You need to understand that you changed the world.
[00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:59.642]  You put America, not on its heels, but on its toes.
[00:27:59.642 --> 00:28:00.823]  You helped awaken the world.
[00:28:00.823 --> 00:28:02.103]  We've already come so far together.
[00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:07.287]  I need you to realize that and keep sharing the articles and videos harder than ever.
[00:28:07.287 --> 00:28:13.656]  And I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get great products that you need, especially in the winter for your immune system.
[00:28:13.656 --> 00:28:19.064]  The Vitamin D3, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the Real Red Pill Plus is back in stock.
[00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.226]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:28:22.062 --> 00:28:25.484]  We have the donate button there so that we can stay on air.
[00:28:25.484 --> 00:28:30.448]  I really need folks to go make a one-time or a recurring donation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:30.448 --> 00:28:34.270]  You see a big red banner at the top of InfoWars and at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.111]  Click there.
[00:28:35.111 --> 00:28:37.052]  Make $1, $10, $100.
[00:28:37.052 --> 00:28:38.153]  Make recurring donations.
[00:28:38.153 --> 00:28:39.093]  Make one-time donations.
[00:28:39.093 --> 00:28:46.959]  But we've got an over $200,000 a month deficit, month after month for six months, and we will not be able to stay on air if we don't get the donations.
[00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:48.900]  It's actually an easy hurdle to get over.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.802]  Just please take action now and give yourself the gift
[00:28:53.082 --> 00:29:02.524]  I want you to remember two words.

[00:33:02.068 --> 00:33:07.973]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.902]  Big Brother.
[00:33:14.902 --> 00:33:17.224]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:17.224 --> 00:33:18.985]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:18.985 --> 00:33:21.067]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:21.067 --> 00:33:23.229]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.229 --> 00:33:28.774]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.774 --> 00:33:31.377]  We are in a war of information.
[00:33:31.377 --> 00:33:39.364]  I want to play a clip before I get into Ray Epps of the inventor of mRNA technology.
[00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:48.378]  And a special program that's airing tonight, dealing with the battlefield of the mind.
[00:33:48.378 --> 00:34:06.813]  Dr. Robert Malone, who from before the shots were even given, predicted what would happen, because they'd done rat studies that he was aware of, with the viruses very similar to COVID-19, and it caused blood clots, infertility, heart attacks, myocarditis, strokes in rats.
[00:34:08.143 --> 00:34:11.504]  In fact, it cut the rats and mice life expectancy in half.
[00:34:11.504 --> 00:34:20.886]  It killed a small portion very early on in the first week or so, and then it killed half of them early.
[00:34:20.886 --> 00:34:24.707]  This is what they've done to us, and it's a big deal.
[00:34:24.707 --> 00:34:31.309]  We have to understand this is a war for the mind, and there is a critical mass
[00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:37.392]  That is now being reached that is incredible.
[00:34:37.392 --> 00:34:41.434]  I don't get up here and tell you good news just to hype you up.
[00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:46.695]  When it's bad, man, I just want you to know it because that's how I am and we just need to understand what we're facing.
[00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:55.517]  And we got big problems, but the New World Order's got bigger ones because they needed to execute this attack, get away with it, have people accept it, and just act like nothing happened.
[00:34:55.517 --> 00:35:00.639]  But if people mobilize and organize with criminal investigations that have now started around the world, the US, Germany,
[00:35:02.103 --> 00:35:08.028]  India, South Africa, I mean the list goes on and on.
[00:35:08.028 --> 00:35:08.789]  It's game over.
[00:35:08.789 --> 00:35:11.031]  I mean the globalists are scared.
[00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:16.015]  In their internal memos that come out and their body language, everything they do, they know they're losing the info war.
[00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:21.380]  They thought they could use AI and intelligence agencies and these groups to control their body.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.242]  It backfired on them.
[00:35:23.242 --> 00:35:26.645]  Thanks to you, the viewers and listeners of this audience, the tip of the spear.
[00:35:26.645 --> 00:35:27.205]  Thanks to people like Dr.
[00:35:28.396 --> 00:35:29.396]  Francis Boyle.
[00:35:29.396 --> 00:35:30.797]  Thanks to people like Tucker Carlson.
[00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:32.857]  Thanks to people like Joe Rogan.
[00:35:32.857 --> 00:35:34.798]  We broke their back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:34.798 --> 00:35:42.900]  Now, they may pull something really big to distract us from this, but on the course we're going down, they are in deep trouble.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.480]  So here's a clip of Robert Malone, a little promo that's a minute long.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.042]  We have all been subjected in the last three years to military-grade psychological operations.
[00:35:51.042 --> 00:35:52.222]  That was run by major militaries.
[00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:59.794]  Using technology developed for offshore conflicts, deployed against the citizens of virtually the entire Western world.
[00:35:59.794 --> 00:36:06.297]  But once you're aware of that, and there's a war on for your mind, once you understand that, it's game over.
[00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:17.663]  That's why there's thousands of political ideologies, and thousands of Christian denominations alone, and hundreds of Muslims, and hundreds of Buddhists, and hundreds of Hindu, and there's all these different
[00:36:20.353 --> 00:36:31.840]  Systems, but when it comes to studying the new world order and what they want and who they are and what they want to do Well now it's came over for them because their plan is so horrible for everybody.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.201]  It's so diabolical.
[00:36:33.201 --> 00:36:37.824]  It's so sci-fi dystopic That it will never fly.
[00:36:37.824 --> 00:36:38.845]  It'll never hunt.
[00:36:38.845 --> 00:36:45.249]  It'll never work if you simply expose it and admit it's there and now it's all out in the open There's dr. Malone
[00:36:46.249 --> 00:37:01.421]  Is it 10 billion or 13 billion in the United States alone that was employed in this, what else can you call it, psyops campaign to coerce, compel, and mandate that we accept an unlicensed product that turns out to not be safe nor effective?
[00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:10.695]  Today I sit down with mRNA vaccine pioneer Dr. Robert Malone, author of the new book, Lies My Government Told Me, and The Better Future Coming.
[00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:19.402]  Elon now is in a position where he has access to incredibly damaging information about the willingness of the U.S.
[00:37:19.402 --> 00:37:23.086]  government to collude with industry and compromise the First Amendment.
[00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:26.689]  We dive into information warfare, psychological operations,
[00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:36.235]  So I am very blessed and honored and very thankful to the listeners and viewers for allowing me to do this on air and allowing me to risk my life and treasure and actually have a chance of beating these people together.
[00:37:36.235 --> 00:37:36.635]  But it's true.
[00:37:56.306 --> 00:38:08.172]  All of our terms, all of our nomenclature, all of our ideas of resistance, all of our alternative futures we're promoting that are pro-human and incredibly amazing and beautiful, it comes from here.
[00:38:08.172 --> 00:38:13.876]  It comes from my deep study of history, my analysis, and my total immersion in how the world really works.
[00:38:13.876 --> 00:38:15.216]  And I do know how the world really works.
[00:38:15.216 --> 00:38:21.700]  It's why Henry Kissinger sent the head of his organization to try to hire me.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.401]  They could not believe I did not take it.
[00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:25.582]  They said no one had ever turned them down.
[00:38:27.403 --> 00:38:30.984]  They were completely freaked out, completely disappointed.
[00:38:30.984 --> 00:38:32.805]  Most people get on their knees.
[00:38:32.805 --> 00:38:36.946]  I don't get on my knees to anybody but God.
[00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:40.187]  And so, you bet on the right horse, you did this.
[00:38:40.187 --> 00:38:47.970]  The entire world resistance was created here at InfoWars.
[00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.790]  And that's not just Alex Jones saying that.
[00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:54.572]  I have prominent leaders, world leaders, top talk show hosts,
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:05.108]  Who have told me that in the councils of government and in major meetings that our message is now accepted as the truth.
[00:39:05.108 --> 00:39:18.239]  I talked to a very prominent talk show host, well met with him recently, a few months ago, and he talked about meeting with a bunch of top Republicans in a private meeting and that he was there speaking to them and the fact that
[00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:25.192]  When I was brought up, there was a big ovation, a standing ovation.
[00:39:25.192 --> 00:39:29.854]  And they realized that I've told the truth.
[00:39:29.854 --> 00:39:32.915]  And they realized that we've been targeted because we do tell the truth.
[00:39:32.915 --> 00:39:41.179]  And the reason I bring you that report card is to you, my bosses, the listeners and viewers and activists that hold me up in the fight.
[00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:47.081]  You're like the gravitational field that keeps me on the battlefield, that holds me up.
[00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:48.602]  And I can't do this without you.
[00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:53.786]  I cannot do any of this without your prayer, without your word of mouth, and without your financial support.
[00:39:53.786 --> 00:40:07.654]  And so I'm going to get into all the news now, but we're having a big fundraiser today and through next week because the bad news is we got a $200,000 plus, like $230,000, $240,000 on average, underage the last six months.
[00:40:07.654 --> 00:40:12.437]  But the good news is that's not a huge amount of money in this day and age with a giant audience.
[00:40:12.437 --> 00:40:15.599]  If you'll just go buy products at InfoWarshaw.com that already empower you.
[00:40:16.929 --> 00:40:17.930]  And make your life better.
[00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:32.318]  If you'll just go to mfulwarstore.com and right at the top it says make a donation one time or recurring, cancel any time, we will easily be able to stay on the air, go through our legal appeals, and not let them shut us down.
[00:40:32.318 --> 00:40:42.303]  That's why the Communist Chinese, that's where the attacks are coming from, starting yesterday afternoon have sent over 150 million attacks against mfulwarstore.com.
[00:40:42.303 --> 00:40:45.605]  That's why when you try to go to mfulwarstore.com you've got to do the little puzzle of, you know,
[00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:48.685]  Click on the sailboats.
[00:40:48.685 --> 00:40:49.745]  Or click on the trains.
[00:40:49.745 --> 00:40:50.806]  Or click on the bicycles.
[00:40:50.806 --> 00:40:53.088]  And you've got to do that to prove you're not a bot.
[00:40:53.088 --> 00:40:54.049]  The security's great.
[00:40:54.049 --> 00:40:55.390]  The site's secure.
[00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.393]  They're just flooding it with traffic trying to shut it down.
[00:40:58.393 --> 00:40:58.933]  Go there.
[00:40:58.933 --> 00:41:00.935]  Don't let them stop you.
[00:41:00.935 --> 00:41:03.097]  A massive DDoS attack.
[00:41:03.097 --> 00:41:05.959]  A massive Denial of Service attack.
[00:41:05.959 --> 00:41:08.381]  Massive, massive, massive.
[00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:15.007]  We've got some of the top companies in the world that run our security and they say these are amongst the biggest attacks they see state sponsored.
[00:41:16.212 --> 00:41:17.753]  Why do the globalists want to shut down?
[00:41:17.753 --> 00:41:19.953]  Because they run the WEF.
[00:41:19.953 --> 00:41:21.334]  Why do the CHICOMs want to shut down?
[00:41:21.334 --> 00:41:23.555]  Because they're allied with the WEF.
[00:41:23.555 --> 00:41:28.397]  And they are losing the information war, and they see us as the main enemy.
[00:41:28.397 --> 00:41:29.697]  So keep us in the fight.
[00:41:29.697 --> 00:41:31.338]  Keep your resistance in the fight.
[00:41:31.338 --> 00:41:32.198]  We're fighting for you.
[00:41:32.198 --> 00:41:33.278]  You're fighting for us.
[00:41:33.278 --> 00:41:34.579]  We're fighting together.
[00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:38.820]  Go now to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.682]  And you'll see right there the bullhorn that says Save InfoWars.
[00:41:41.682 --> 00:41:43.062]  Click on that.
[00:41:43.062 --> 00:41:43.362]  Make a $50, a $10, a $5.
[00:41:46.235 --> 00:42:00.439]  One-time donation or what's really important to do is to go to the site and make a recurring donation so that you're there and you make $10 a donation a month.
[00:42:00.439 --> 00:42:03.700]  Anytime you want to cancel, go in and click in your profile and it'll stop.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.601]  But that way you don't forget and you know you're supported.
[00:42:06.601 --> 00:42:09.081]  And you notice they're putting it on screen.
[00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:10.522]  The site, it said bad gateway.
[00:42:11.772 --> 00:42:23.021]  Despite the fact we have one of the biggest companies in the world that's got defenses up in front of us, they even were able, for a second, you just saw it on screen, to take that down.
[00:42:23.021 --> 00:42:27.545]  Who we use is who the biggest companies in the world use.
[00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:30.968]  And supposedly they have invincible systems.
[00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:32.089]  Look at that.
[00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:38.034]  Millions, millions, millions, hitting, hitting, hitting attacks to try to keep you from getting products at InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:42:38.942 --> 00:42:40.483]  Maybe the site will be shut down for the next few days.
[00:42:40.483 --> 00:42:47.145]  Just mark a mental note, when you can get on the site, put the orders in, sign up for auto ship, get 10% off on your next order, double patriot points.
[00:42:47.145 --> 00:42:50.767]  It's huge sales everywhere, but it takes money to win a war.
[00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:51.747]  You're in a war.
[00:42:51.747 --> 00:42:53.868]  You're in a war against the globalists.
[00:42:53.868 --> 00:42:55.029]  Bottom of the tip of the spear.
[00:42:55.029 --> 00:42:56.449]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:57.350]  Go there now.
[00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.130]  Commit to the fight!
[00:43:00.202 --> 00:43:09.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:18.516]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[00:43:19.036 --> 00:43:25.642]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owners of Fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[00:43:25.642 --> 00:43:31.107]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[00:43:31.107 --> 00:43:32.668]  And not just under one name.
[00:43:32.668 --> 00:43:38.153]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[00:43:38.153 --> 00:43:42.237]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[00:43:42.657 --> 00:43:44.539]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:47.221]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[00:43:47.221 --> 00:43:50.083]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:51.885]  These things are incredible.
[00:43:51.885 --> 00:43:56.649]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider.
[00:43:56.649 --> 00:43:57.830]  Those are so powerful.
[00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.131]  Get them at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:43:59.731 --> 00:44:11.214]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[00:44:11.214 --> 00:44:15.675]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[00:44:15.675 --> 00:44:19.636]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[00:44:19.636 --> 00:44:24.077]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[00:44:24.077 --> 00:44:25.137]  You see, the sun
[00:44:25.877 --> 00:44:26.197]  We're good.
[00:44:50.410 --> 00:45:11.634]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:14.735]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[00:45:15.575 --> 00:45:15.956]  We're good.
[00:45:31.593 --> 00:45:38.175]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[00:45:38.175 --> 00:45:40.555]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[00:45:40.555 --> 00:45:42.436]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[00:45:42.436 --> 00:45:44.676]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[00:45:44.676 --> 00:45:45.417]  It's amazing.
[00:45:45.417 --> 00:45:45.937]  It works.
[00:45:45.937 --> 00:45:48.437]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[00:45:48.437 --> 00:45:54.679]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[00:45:54.679 --> 00:45:55.939]  Beautifully said, brother.
[00:45:55.939 --> 00:45:57.860]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:07.269]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:18.293]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[00:46:18.293 --> 00:46:26.857]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[00:46:26.857 --> 00:46:27.437]  Introducing
[00:46:28.277 --> 00:46:32.839]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:32.839 --> 00:46:38.121]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.

[00:46:50.428 --> 00:46:57.915]  This is the highest quality greens out there, and it's at a price way, way lower than the same product on store shelves for up to twice the cost.
[00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:01.178]  Find InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.
[00:47:01.178 --> 00:47:07.083]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:15.862 --> 00:47:32.377]  I remember about two and a half years ago, I was sitting in Trump Hotel and I was sitting there with the Fox News host drinking at the counter, the bar.
[00:47:34.045 --> 00:47:41.848]  And these two good-looking women came over, and I instantly, the place was empty, it was like midnight, I instantly went, okay, those are sex operatives.
[00:47:41.848 --> 00:47:49.212]  I could tell just, they probably had like PhDs, they were probably psychologists, CIA, that volunteered for the mission.
[00:47:49.212 --> 00:47:50.372]  They started talking.
[00:47:50.372 --> 00:47:54.874]  They said, we want to go to your hotel room in about three minutes of the conversation, we want to have sex with you right now.
[00:47:54.874 --> 00:47:56.655]  And I said, oh yeah, I want to go to prison today.
[00:47:56.655 --> 00:48:00.616]  I said, you guys are ridiculous, how obvious you are.
[00:48:00.616 --> 00:48:01.597]  I said, so, uh,
[00:48:02.833 --> 00:48:05.675]  What, you, uh, you both got psychology degrees, right?
[00:48:05.675 --> 00:48:08.336]  You went to Laney and you think you're real cool and everything?
[00:48:08.336 --> 00:48:11.918]  You're going to be def- and they started getting so mad during the radio, going, no, no, what's that?
[00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:12.619]  We just like you.
[00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:15.220]  We just want to go to your room with you.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:24.646]  And I was sitting there with the Fox News host, um, who'd already brought this hot blonde along himself.
[00:48:24.646 --> 00:48:25.567]  I don't think he was part of it.
[00:48:26.584 --> 00:48:28.966]  But, uh, I said, well, I'm going to bed.
[00:48:28.966 --> 00:48:30.447]  Those girls had left.
[00:48:30.447 --> 00:48:33.709]  He said, well, hey, I, I brought this girl for you.
[00:48:33.709 --> 00:48:37.971]  And I said, wow, that's you guys are all spies, man.
[00:48:37.971 --> 00:48:40.393]  I said, good night.
[00:48:40.393 --> 00:48:42.935]  I go get in bed about 1230 at night.
[00:48:42.935 --> 00:48:45.597]  The fire alarm gets pulled.
[00:48:45.597 --> 00:48:48.298]  Then it gets pulled again.
[00:48:48.298 --> 00:48:52.421]  And I'm sitting there down there at the bar.
[00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:55.363]  I go back down there and those damn women are there again.
[00:48:58.166 --> 00:49:01.228]  I just laughed at them.
[00:49:01.228 --> 00:49:02.309]  But they were on a mission.
[00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:03.690]  They were so angry.
[00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.352]  They were supposed to get me in that room and say I raped them.
[00:49:06.352 --> 00:49:08.374]  Since they got a witness.
[00:49:08.374 --> 00:49:11.115]  Same thing they did to Julian Assange.
[00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:12.396]  Like, like, I'm an idiot.
[00:49:12.396 --> 00:49:14.998]  I'm a married man.
[00:49:14.998 --> 00:49:17.980]  But the point is, that's how crooked this thing is.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.842]  I'll get to Andrew Tate, start of the next hour.
[00:49:19.842 --> 00:49:20.883]  I'll talk to his lawyer.
[00:49:20.883 --> 00:49:22.524]  I'll give you the inside baseball.
[00:49:24.363 --> 00:49:26.384]  He's just bigger than Andrew Tate.
[00:49:26.384 --> 00:49:27.985]  But that's how serious this world is.
[00:49:27.985 --> 00:49:29.265]  That's how real this is.
[00:49:29.265 --> 00:49:47.934]  Now, I told you over two years ago, or it's coming up on two years, I guess, next month, in just a few days, I guess in eight days, January 6th anniversary, it's also my wedding anniversary to my second wife, my darling, and
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.682]  I told you that they provocateured it.
[00:49:52.682 --> 00:49:54.804]  I told you they had operatives that broke in.
[00:49:54.804 --> 00:49:57.367]  I told you they were going to suppress the video inside the Capitol.
[00:49:57.367 --> 00:50:01.551]  They suppressed 14,000 hours of it.
[00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:10.080]  And we looked at Ray Epps with his classic cutout of an intelligence operative running around for two days before and that day saying attack the Capitol, go into the Capitol.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.783]  Him with big signs helping it ram it into the police.
[00:50:14.235 --> 00:50:16.817]  And I wondered how he'd get away with it and what he'd say under oath.
[00:50:16.817 --> 00:50:24.283]  So under oath, the January 6th Committee now has released thousands of transcripts of these depositions.
[00:50:24.283 --> 00:50:27.386]  And it turns out, and I didn't just believe this when I saw it on Twitter.
[00:50:27.386 --> 00:50:28.167]  Overhead shot please.
[00:50:30.305 --> 00:50:35.008]  I went to the January 6th committee site and I pulled up the page and I've got it right here.
[00:50:35.008 --> 00:50:37.770]  We're writing an article right now for InfoWars.com.
[00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.171]  This is not broken yet except on Twitter.
[00:50:40.171 --> 00:50:46.695]  On the afternoon of January 6th, Ray Epps texted his nephew about the events at the Capitol.
[00:50:46.695 --> 00:50:49.477]  I was in the front with a few others.
[00:50:49.477 --> 00:50:50.838]  I also orchestrated it.
[00:50:53.109 --> 00:51:01.674]  And we wonder why he was never charged and why he's the only person whom Kinzinger and Cheney defend in the New York Times defense.
[00:51:01.674 --> 00:51:09.719]  So here's the actual section of it in his deposition, page 60 and 61.
[00:51:09.719 --> 00:51:11.880]  Question.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.381]  So it looks like around 9 a.m.
[00:51:13.381 --> 00:51:14.302]  your nephew text you.
[00:51:15.942 --> 00:51:17.763]  You and Jim be safe.
[00:51:17.763 --> 00:51:26.748]  And then at 2.12 on January 6th, that's after they'd broken the Capitol, you text back, I was in the front with a few others.
[00:51:26.748 --> 00:51:29.289]  I also orchestrated it.
[00:51:29.289 --> 00:51:34.412]  You know, the orchestra has a conductor who orchestrates the symphony.
[00:51:34.412 --> 00:51:38.775]  So let me read the actual quote instead of adding what I said.
[00:51:38.775 --> 00:51:40.696]  This is a pure quote.
[00:51:40.696 --> 00:51:43.177]  Question, so it looks like around 9 a.m.
[00:51:43.177 --> 00:51:44.098]  your nephew texts you.
[00:51:44.949 --> 00:51:46.050]  You and Jim be safe.
[00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:47.711]  And then at 2.12 p.m.
[00:51:47.711 --> 00:51:51.534]  on January 6th, you text back, I was in the front with a few others.
[00:51:51.534 --> 00:51:56.477]  I also orchestrated it.
[00:51:56.477 --> 00:51:58.399]  And then they go on and go, what does orchestrate mean?
[00:51:58.399 --> 00:52:02.322]  Well, I let it.
[00:52:02.322 --> 00:52:06.825]  This is the exact same time on the video that I just played.
[00:52:06.825 --> 00:52:09.327]  Help us understand this text.
[00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:11.608]  What did you mean by orchestrate?
[00:52:11.608 --> 00:52:12.889]  Why did you orchestrate?
[00:52:12.889 --> 00:52:13.670]  What did you orchestrate?
[00:52:14.705 --> 00:52:15.606]  Answer.
[00:52:15.606 --> 00:52:24.610]  I just meant that I got, you have to understand our relationship, uncle-nephew, we hunt together, we fun with each other, we do that kind of stuff.
[00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:36.976]  What I meant, my orchestrate was, I helped get people there.
[00:52:36.976 --> 00:52:39.838]  He goes on to say, at that point I didn't know they were breaking into the Capitol.
[00:52:39.838 --> 00:52:41.619]  He says on the video, go into the Capitol.
[00:52:41.619 --> 00:52:41.939]  I didn't
[00:52:43.337 --> 00:52:44.598]  Windows had been broken.
[00:52:44.598 --> 00:52:46.740]  I didn't know anybody was in the Capitol.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.082]  If I answer him, that means it was at 212.
[00:52:50.082 --> 00:52:51.823]  I was on my way back to the hotel.
[00:52:51.823 --> 00:52:56.086]  Yeah, mission complete.
[00:52:56.086 --> 00:52:57.367]  So, there you go.
[00:52:57.367 --> 00:52:59.909]  Running around, telling everybody to go in for days.
[00:52:59.909 --> 00:53:00.570]  They're doing it.
[00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:01.410]  Helping Ram.
[00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:04.973]  It's him on the video, the big sign.
[00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:06.954]  I noticed you guys were playing it from the ground level.
[00:53:06.954 --> 00:53:08.516]  There's a shot above of Ray F's.
[00:53:09.298 --> 00:53:12.701]  They're directing people to grab the sign and then ramming it into the police.
[00:53:12.701 --> 00:53:13.361]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:13.361 --> 00:53:14.702]  That's the shot from the ground.
[00:53:14.702 --> 00:53:16.664]  We have one from above.
[00:53:16.664 --> 00:53:19.286]  So if you don't find it for some reason, I want to add it in post.
[00:53:19.286 --> 00:53:20.687]  We archive this Command I video.
[00:53:20.687 --> 00:53:22.229]  Please put a note.
[00:53:22.229 --> 00:53:23.209]  But yeah, that's him up close.
[00:53:23.209 --> 00:53:25.932]  There's a shot from above with him on the corner helping.
[00:53:25.932 --> 00:53:29.395]  So everybody else that they caught doing that went to jail.
[00:53:29.395 --> 00:53:33.538]  But not Ray Epps, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:33.538 --> 00:53:36.540]  Not Ray Epps.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.042]  So that is a big
[00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:47.053]  Big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:47.053 --> 00:53:55.017]  Yeah, there's the actual footage of him with the sign, directing it and getting others to push the sign over the police.
[00:53:55.017 --> 00:54:00.200]  So there he is, ramming over police in barricades, laughing and smiling.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.921]  Good job, crew, finding that.
[00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:08.184]  And there's Ray Epps on the video, helping do it, but he's okay because he just orchestrated it.
[00:54:10.476 --> 00:54:13.658]  Isn't he a good person?
[00:54:13.658 --> 00:54:17.419]  Isn't he a wonderful person?
[00:54:17.419 --> 00:54:19.500]  He orchestrated it.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:36.609]  I've said probably 300 times, Ray Epps helped orchestrate the breach at the Capitol and there he is ramming the sign over the police and directing others to help him ram police and run over them with a crowd and stomp on them.
[00:54:39.505 --> 00:54:44.388]  But he's their little darling because you know, if it actually came out, you know who he works for.
[00:54:44.388 --> 00:54:50.793]  I would bet my last dollar that he's an FBI or CIA operative or informant.
[00:54:50.793 --> 00:55:04.963]  Just like it turned out, half the people in the Michigan group that went to supposedly try to kidnap the governor but never actually did it, it turned out the entire leadership were FBI agents and informants.
[00:55:04.963 --> 00:55:06.344]  Incredible.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.481]  Information.
[00:55:08.481 --> 00:55:13.465]  Totally disgusting.
[00:55:13.465 --> 00:55:16.347]  And now they've sealed.
[00:55:18.257 --> 00:55:21.760]  The rest of their report and all their data for 20 years.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.903]  Why would you seal the investigation for 20 years?
[00:55:25.903 --> 00:55:28.124]  And now the article's gone live by Kellan McBreen.
[00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.305]  It needs to go super viral.
[00:55:29.305 --> 00:55:31.507]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:31.507 --> 00:55:36.611]  If you have trouble sharing Infowars.com, copy it to your website or get somebody else to share it.
[00:55:36.611 --> 00:55:37.531]  I don't care.
[00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:40.694]  Just get the article out.
[00:55:40.694 --> 00:55:46.338]  Epps confessed to January 6th to many that he orchestrated an attack on the Capitol.
[00:55:47.452 --> 00:55:55.300]  That he got the people there, that he grabbed a sign, a huge metal sign, that he led people to ram it over the police and break the barriers.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:56:03.248]  And then as soon as they got into the Capitol, he turned and left because it was mission complete.
[00:56:03.248 --> 00:56:08.093]  The article is on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:08.093 --> 00:56:09.734]  You want to fight the deep state?
[00:56:09.734 --> 00:56:10.915]  You want to expose what they've done?
[00:56:11.846 --> 00:56:14.628]  This is bigger than the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:56:14.628 --> 00:56:15.888]  Yeah, we know he's a Chinese spy.
[00:56:15.888 --> 00:56:17.109]  We know his dad's a spy.
[00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.789]  It's all in there.
[00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:19.591]  The pedophilia is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:56:19.591 --> 00:56:34.459]  But this, ladies and gentlemen, shows the committee knows that he said he orchestrated the attack, and he's there ramming signs into police and saying, go into the Capitol, and we'll come back and play some clips of that.
[00:56:34.459 --> 00:56:39.162]  And he has not been arrested, but Owen Schroeder has, and Sam Montoya has.
[00:56:40.806 --> 00:56:46.849]  And Stuart Rhodes has been convicted fraudulently, totally innocent.
[00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:56.473]  And now the Oath Keepers are on trial in a kangaroo court in Washington, D.C.
[00:56:56.473 --> 00:57:01.035]  Coming up next hour, we've got some Sam Bankman Freed news.
[00:57:01.035 --> 00:57:04.877]  I'd like to hear what he's doing and who his judge is and who his lawyers are.
[00:57:04.877 --> 00:57:06.077]  Jeffrey Epstein people.
[00:57:06.077 --> 00:57:07.018]  But it gets worse.
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:09.441]  It gets worse.
[00:57:09.441 --> 00:57:16.628]  He's not supposed to withdraw or transfer more than $1,000, period, without court approval.
[00:57:16.628 --> 00:57:18.510]  Part of his bail.
[00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:23.535]  Turns out he just withdrew, probably stolen funds, $600,000-plus, bigger than Dallas.
[00:57:23.535 --> 00:57:26.258]  He's very proud of himself.
[00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:28.174]  Wow.
[00:57:28.174 --> 00:57:29.595]  Big news on that front.
[00:57:29.595 --> 00:57:31.837]  Huge news on the Russia-Ukraine situation.
[00:57:31.837 --> 00:57:33.698]  Massive WEF news.
[00:57:33.698 --> 00:57:37.040]  Robert Barnes joins us in the third hour with huge breaking news and victories.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.861]  It's so many things to cover.
[00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:46.806]  And then tomorrow, I'm coming in to do a special year-end New Year's Eve broadcasts at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:50.011 --> 00:57:52.194]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:57:52.194 --> 00:57:53.996]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:57:53.996 --> 00:57:56.058]  This is an information war.
[00:57:56.058 --> 00:58:00.744]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:58:00.744 --> 00:58:07.232]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[00:58:07.672 --> 00:58:08.413]  We're good to go.
[00:58:29.244 --> 00:58:30.384]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[00:58:53.422 --> 00:59:03.720]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.982]  But, through Mother Nature,
[00:59:05.865 --> 00:59:11.171]  The Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:16.297]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game-changer now.
[00:59:16.297 --> 00:59:18.680]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:22.444]  It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at infowars4.com.
[00:59:24.767 --> 00:59:36.359]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:36.359 --> 00:59:43.486]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:59:43.486 --> 00:59:48.611]  Yield it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[00:59:52.941 --> 00:59:56.846]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:10.123 --> 01:00:14.725]  He opened the space and time continuum gate and traveled with his mind to the future.
[01:00:14.725 --> 01:00:24.849]  The angels guiding his soul to bring him back to 2,000 years ago with the data we'd need to win at this critical juncture.
[01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:31.292]  Imagine space-time spirit jump.
[01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:33.953]  What must it be like to be able to do that?
[01:00:33.953 --> 01:00:34.894]  I sure wonder.
[01:00:36.954 --> 01:00:39.476]  It's a smooth operator.
[01:00:39.476 --> 01:00:44.559]  The New World Order doesn't like the fact that we've got powers way more advanced than theirs.
[01:00:44.559 --> 01:00:47.821]  But not just everybody's given those powers by God.
[01:00:47.821 --> 01:00:52.164]  Imagine what the enemy would do with that information?
[01:00:52.164 --> 01:00:55.506]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:55.506 --> 01:01:00.289]  Let's finish up with Ray Epps, and there's just so much huge breaking news right now.
[01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:02.851]  Idaho murder suspect, Brian Christopher,
[01:01:03.974 --> 01:01:07.557]  Coburger arrested in killings of four university students.
[01:01:07.557 --> 01:01:08.838]  Totally brutal.
[01:01:08.838 --> 01:01:10.879]  Non-student, reportedly alleged.
[01:01:10.879 --> 01:01:12.420]  We're going to be covering that.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:15.622]  I've got the inside baseball, the Andrew Tate situation.
[01:01:15.622 --> 01:01:21.587]  And we've got huge new government documents that just came out on COVID-19 that are stunning.
[01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:27.257]  We don't overuse the words epic, stunning, over-the-top, incredible, bombshell.
[01:01:27.257 --> 01:01:29.018]  It's just all bombshell.
[01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:32.080]  And of course, you're not going to see hardly any of this on mainstream news.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.001]  Because it'd be over for the New World Order if this stuff came out.
[01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:36.022]  But here's where I am.
[01:01:36.022 --> 01:01:39.664]  You've seen the clips a hundred times, but I don't want to say something and not show it to you.
[01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:43.546]  I don't want to say, hey, here he is directing folks with a big sign to overrun the police.
[01:01:43.546 --> 01:01:48.569]  I don't want to say it's in a transcript that he told in a deposition to the J6 committee that he orchestrated the attack on the Capitol.
[01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:50.495]  And I'll show it to you.
[01:01:50.495 --> 01:01:55.438]  I don't want to say, here he is running around saying, go to the Capitol tomorrow, go into the Capitol, and then that day.
[01:01:55.438 --> 01:01:57.639]  We're going to always show it to you.
[01:01:57.639 --> 01:01:58.540]  It's what we do.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.201]  Here it is.
[01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:03.863]  Tomorrow, we need to go into the Capitol!
[01:02:03.863 --> 01:02:05.644]  Into the Capitol!
[01:02:05.644 --> 01:02:09.287]  Tomorrow, I don't even like to say it because I'll be arrested.
[01:02:09.287 --> 01:02:10.067]  Well, let's not say it.
[01:02:10.067 --> 01:02:12.449]  We need, we need to go, I'll say it.
[01:02:12.449 --> 01:02:13.169]  All right.
[01:02:13.169 --> 01:02:14.490]  We need to go in.
[01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:15.590]  Shut the fuck up, Boomer.
[01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:16.211]  To the Capitol.
[01:02:17.594 --> 01:02:24.696]  We are going to the Capitol, where our problems are.
[01:02:24.696 --> 01:02:27.896]  It's that direction.
[01:02:27.896 --> 01:02:30.097]  We spread the word.
[01:02:30.097 --> 01:02:30.437]  All right.
[01:02:30.437 --> 01:02:31.657]  No, Dave, but one more thing.
[01:02:31.657 --> 01:02:33.538]  Yeah, so can we go up there?
[01:02:33.538 --> 01:02:33.598]  No.
[01:02:33.598 --> 01:02:35.318]  When we go in, leave us here.
[01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:41.700]  Are we going to get arrested if we go up there?
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.180]  Yeah.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.401]  We don't need to get shot.
[01:02:47.261 --> 01:02:47.941]  Yeah, you're treated alright.
[01:03:04.065 --> 01:03:07.327]  And who cut the Capitol Police to half their normal number?
[01:03:07.327 --> 01:03:10.249]  You'd think with a big event like this happening, they'd double or triple the number.
[01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:16.253]  No, no, they cut the normal number you'd have on a Monday or Tuesday afternoon when there's school kids there getting terse.
[01:03:16.253 --> 01:03:30.582]  They cut the normal number to half instead of tripling the number, blocked Trump's call for 10,000 National Guard, blocked General Flynn's brother's call for that, and that big old disgusting New World Order maggot, General Milley,
[01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:38.270]  Threaten to resign if Trump put trips on the streets.
[01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:44.474]  And they were going to try to deliver Trump to the Capitol to set him up that day, right as the breach happened.
[01:03:44.474 --> 01:03:46.635]  But the Secret Service said it's too dangerous.
[01:03:46.635 --> 01:03:49.277]  And then they said Trump grabbed the wheel and attacked the Secret Service.
[01:03:49.277 --> 01:03:51.738]  None of that happened.
[01:03:51.738 --> 01:03:54.700]  All lies, all the time, out of these people.
[01:03:56.411 --> 01:04:00.093]  And then Andrew Tate gets in a big fight with Greta Thunberg.
[01:04:00.093 --> 01:04:01.454]  He was uncancellable.
[01:04:01.454 --> 01:04:08.858]  And so they set him up with fake charges he's already beaten once that the police found were not true.
[01:04:08.858 --> 01:04:12.360]  Let me tell you, when you're a public figure, ladies and gentlemen, that's what goes on.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.042]  That's what happens, especially if you're a populist or conservative.
[01:04:16.042 --> 01:04:17.002]  Is Andrew Tate racy?
[01:04:17.002 --> 01:04:17.102]  Yes.
[01:04:17.102 --> 01:04:20.024]  Does he have a criminal record?
[01:04:20.024 --> 01:04:20.264]  No.
[01:04:20.264 --> 01:04:23.586]  But they're trying to give him one now as a message to anybody.
[01:04:24.414 --> 01:04:30.997]  That is able to reach 200, 300, 400 million young men in the West and other parts of the world.
[01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:36.900]  That's who he influences to be men and to be strong and to not be victims and to be masculine.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.302]  They don't want masculine role models.
[01:04:39.302 --> 01:04:43.184]  And so it's for that sin that they're coming after him.
[01:04:43.184 --> 01:04:46.685]  Do I think his brand of masculinity is mine?
[01:04:46.685 --> 01:04:47.506]  No.
[01:04:47.506 --> 01:04:49.427]  But I'm also not three-time world champion kickboxer.
[01:04:51.047 --> 01:04:54.870]  I'm just an all-time champion New World Order fighter, thanks to your support.
[01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:56.231]  Remember, I always give you the credit.
[01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:59.473]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.473 --> 01:05:01.675]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:05:01.675 --> 01:05:03.456]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:05:03.456 --> 01:05:05.538]  This is an information war.
[01:05:05.538 --> 01:05:10.221]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:16.706]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:17.907]  We're good to go.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:46.646]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:05:46.646 --> 01:05:48.967]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:05:48.967 --> 01:05:50.808]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:05:50.808 --> 01:05:51.929]  We're going over the top.
[01:05:51.929 --> 01:05:53.450]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:56.653]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now.
[01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:57.493]  I've got a tiger!
[01:06:04.677 --> 01:06:13.501]  He never gives up.
[01:06:13.501 --> 01:06:15.923]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.923 --> 01:06:18.744]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:06:18.744 --> 01:06:19.564]  Worldwide.
[01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:32.111]  Well, I thought the day I met you, you were... Oh, Fenton of the Communist Chinese Dragon here to give you stupid Americans your orders.
[01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:34.092]  Do not save InfoWars.
[01:06:34.092 --> 01:06:40.036]  Do not be part of their year-end fundraiser at InfoWarsStore.com with huge sales.
[01:06:40.036 --> 01:06:42.437]  Do not click on the donation button.
[01:06:42.437 --> 01:06:45.218]  Give up, roll over, and die.
[01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:47.780]  InfoWars is more influential than ever.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.541]  It's important to shut them down.
[01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:51.502]  So I am ordering you now in name of CCP,
[01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:55.263]  Do not go to InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:06:55.263 --> 01:07:00.906]  Yes, Fentanyl, the lovable, chi-com, mass-murdering dragon is back.
[01:07:00.906 --> 01:07:12.911]  And what prompted me to bring back Fentanyl is that we know there are massive denial-of-service attacks aimed at InfoWars and InfoWarsTore.com right now, coming out of Communist China, who's allied with the WEF.
[01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:18.614]  So the worst people on Earth are actually trying to shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:07:18.894 --> 01:07:20.394]  So sometimes the sites are slow.
[01:07:20.394 --> 01:07:21.615]  They're totally secure.
[01:07:21.615 --> 01:07:27.917]  But when you're able to get through to the site, InfoWarsTore.com, you're able to make orders on super high quality products.
[01:07:27.917 --> 01:07:34.739]  But sometimes our little friends, bosses, the CCP and GGP are going to be able to successfully slow the site down.
[01:07:34.739 --> 01:07:38.400]  Don't let them keep you from ordering products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.860]  Take action now.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:46.842]  Let fentanyl masters know the American people and others will not bow to their tyranny and humanity is awakening and we're going to defeat the new world order together.
[01:07:49.827 --> 01:07:51.228]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is.
[01:07:51.228 --> 01:07:53.088]  How did you get here?
[01:07:53.088 --> 01:07:55.469]  I just caught you, American.
[01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:58.471]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:07:58.471 --> 01:08:02.232]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:08:02.232 --> 01:08:10.736]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt your eye.
[01:08:10.736 --> 01:08:15.198]  It comes from China.
[01:08:26.218 --> 01:08:27.580]  All right, we're in to hour number two.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:33.706]  Robert Barnes to cover the waterfront and big victories for the Amish in that court case, saying they couldn't sell beef and milk.
[01:08:33.706 --> 01:08:37.470]  That's coming up and a year in review and what he sees coming up the next year.
[01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:39.192]  And then I'm coming back tomorrow.
[01:08:39.192 --> 01:08:46.961]  I'm going to tape a two or three hour special show tomorrow that will be posted by the afternoon and restreamed so we can ring in the new year together.
[01:08:47.774 --> 01:08:47.814]  2023.
[01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:48.195]  Wow.
[01:08:48.195 --> 01:08:54.982]  And then of course there's the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., and then Owen does 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:08:54.982 --> 01:08:56.044]  with Sunday Live.
[01:08:56.044 --> 01:09:04.413]  The great Owen returns tomorrow from a well-deserved vacation with his family in Missouri, so he'll be here with us as well.
[01:09:04.413 --> 01:09:08.258]  Okay, the COVID stack, and this happens every day now, just gets more insane by the day.
[01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:12.638]  Criminal investigations, documents coming out.
[01:09:12.638 --> 01:09:14.418]  It's totally over the top.
[01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:15.559]  This is a godsend.
[01:09:15.559 --> 01:09:16.919]  Praise God for this.
[01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:20.080]  Praise God for all of you taking action and spreading the word.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:33.125]  Confidential Pfizer and government documents confirm ADE, VAED, and AIDS due to COVID-19 vaccine, leading to millions dying suddenly and still counting.
[01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:33.505]  Wow.
[01:09:34.827 --> 01:09:38.249]  And you know, I'm happy to read that headline because we're going to bring these criminals to justice.
[01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:42.131]  I'm horrified on the other side that they actually hit us.
[01:09:42.131 --> 01:09:47.254]  That's just some of the news coming up here in just a moment.
[01:09:47.254 --> 01:09:49.815]  But first, let's talk about Andrew Tate.
[01:09:49.815 --> 01:09:54.298]  I've known who Andrew Tate's been for about six years, seven years.
[01:09:54.298 --> 01:10:01.682]  He's been friends with Paul Watson, very close friends, since he was one of the contestants in 2016 on Big Brother.
[01:10:04.358 --> 01:10:07.780]  And so I got to talking to Andrew then, sort of getting him on as a guest.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.141]  Thought he was really smart.
[01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:12.863]  Knew he was the, you know, already a world champion kickboxer at the time.
[01:10:12.863 --> 01:10:15.405]  He went on to get several more titles.
[01:10:15.405 --> 01:10:16.906]  And so he started coming to Texas sometimes.
[01:10:16.906 --> 01:10:17.747]  We'd go on the show.
[01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.268]  We'd go out to dinner.
[01:10:19.268 --> 01:10:20.508]  Very gentlemanly.
[01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.370]  Very, very nice.
[01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:28.874]  And I didn't learn until a couple years ago that he made over $100 million with Camgirls.
[01:10:30.054 --> 01:10:36.805]  And that's not my business and I don't really support that type of thing, but what he was doing was legal.
[01:10:36.805 --> 01:10:43.315]  And then as he got more and more right-wing and more and more populist, he started shifting into that and moving away from that business.
[01:10:45.305 --> 01:10:56.751]  They began to come after him because he became the number one Google person in the world and had conservatively 300 to 500 million, the numbers vary, of men 25 and younger down into adolescence.
[01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:59.352]  We're talking 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 year olds watching him.
[01:10:59.352 --> 01:11:01.953]  He knocked it out of the park.
[01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:08.617]  With a key demographic of young men about being tough, about being strong, about being successful, about being an alpha male.
[01:11:08.617 --> 01:11:11.238]  And yeah, I mean, you know, sitting there,
[01:11:12.776 --> 01:11:19.343]  Smoking cigars like you, Hefner, and driving around in Ferraris is not really my cup of tea.
[01:11:19.343 --> 01:11:28.112]  And I like fast cars, they're great, but I'm not a conspicuous consumer, as they say, and I'd rather spend my money towards total war against the New World Order.
[01:11:28.112 --> 01:11:32.056]  But that said, a flamboyant type I didn't like.
[01:11:32.056 --> 01:11:35.300]  And so, last year there was a criminal investigation.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:36.781]  He came in for questioning.
[01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:37.621]  They did the investigation.
[01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:40.043]  They found that he had not done this to these women.
[01:11:40.043 --> 01:11:51.630]  They had some big parties at his house with the people's boyfriends that were there and that some of these women were political operatives and that they had just made up stuff, made up things.
[01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:56.674]  And so if you look on the record, he got brought in in April of this year.
[01:11:56.674 --> 01:11:58.035]  So he got brought in.
[01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:03.516]  Ten months ago, nine months ago, and they found, okay, there's no evidence here.
[01:12:03.516 --> 01:12:07.643]  They also raided his houses then, got his computers, everything, found nothing.
[01:12:07.643 --> 01:12:11.950]  And then as soon as he's number one in the world, as soon as Greta Thunberg comes after him...
[01:12:12.657 --> 01:12:13.137]  I don't know.
[01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:48.124]  Well, the way Romania works is they're either going to release him after 24 hours, that's in about an hour, or 30 minutes from now or so, or they're going to hold him for 30 days.
[01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:53.165]  And if they hold him, it means they're charging him with this whole laundry list of things.
[01:12:53.165 --> 01:12:55.425]  And look, I don't have a crystal ball.
[01:12:55.425 --> 01:12:58.466]  I don't know if he's guilty of any of this.
[01:12:58.466 --> 01:13:05.068]  Maybe I'm a little jaded, maybe I'm a little discriminatory in that I have had people that I've never met
[01:13:06.038 --> 01:13:17.223]  And I've not made a big deal about this on air because it's a distraction, but I've had women that I've never met file criminal charges on me and say that I raped them and that I had babies with them.
[01:13:17.223 --> 01:13:20.744]  I've had women in California, New York, and Louisiana do it over the years.
[01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:22.805]  Women, I don't even know who they are.
[01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:30.968]  We also had somebody six months ago, and the Travis County folks talked to my lawyer.
[01:13:30.968 --> 01:13:33.249]  It was off record, but they said, no, Alex can talk about this.
[01:13:33.249 --> 01:13:34.150]  I never really talked about it.
[01:13:36.243 --> 01:13:41.346]  But obviously he wouldn't say what investigator they talked to, but it was a senior person in Travis County.
[01:13:41.346 --> 01:13:42.807]  That's where it got filed.
[01:13:42.807 --> 01:13:44.909]  Not Austin, but to the courts of Travis County.
[01:13:44.909 --> 01:13:50.052]  Somebody got in to the Travis County computers.
[01:13:50.052 --> 01:13:53.894]  And by the way, they did this in more than 10 other counties.
[01:13:53.894 --> 01:13:56.916]  So this is CIA or groups like that.
[01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:58.658]  And because they've never seen this before.
[01:13:58.658 --> 01:14:00.699]  In fact, I'm told there's an FBI investigation about it.
[01:14:00.699 --> 01:14:01.980]  I mean, this is a big deal, folks.
[01:14:02.947 --> 01:14:18.337]  And filed criminal arrest warrants for Alex Emmerich Jones, yours truly, for torture and rape of children in multiple states, including Washington State.
[01:14:18.337 --> 01:14:27.182]  Now that's next level swatting, where you call up on a computer line, they can't tell where you are, and you say, I'm at Steve Bannon's house, and there's a man with a gun shooting people.
[01:14:27.182 --> 01:14:31.465]  That's happened to Steve a bunch, it's happened to me a bunch, I never really talk about it, but we've been swatted.
[01:14:31.465 --> 01:14:31.965]  Repeatedly.
[01:14:33.689 --> 01:14:42.494]  To the point where the police just know, oh yeah, there's a shooting in Alex Jones' house, there's dead bodies in Alex Jones' house, or Alex Jones has a woman kidnapped in his house.
[01:14:42.494 --> 01:14:46.396]  I got three visits by the police on that one.
[01:14:46.396 --> 01:14:50.178]  They even went to my parents' house once, because the person gave them that address.
[01:14:50.178 --> 01:14:56.882]  So, that's the type of fun and games that go on, and they still, last time I heard,
[01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.497]  Because my lawyer was questioning me for Travis County.
[01:15:03.497 --> 01:15:04.258]  We have questions for Jones.
[01:15:04.258 --> 01:15:05.778]  Does he have any idea who's doing this?
[01:15:05.778 --> 01:15:08.380]  Does he have any idea who this could be?
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.020]  No.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:09.940]  How are they doing this?
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.541]  I want to explain something.
[01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:29.609]  They got into the central docket in multiple counties and filed arrest warrants to Washington State for the Travis County Sheriff's Department to arrest me for kidnapping and torturing and raping children.
[01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:37.060]  So I'm a little bit suspicious when I see this happen to other people that are prominent like him.
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.781]  Just a little bit.
[01:15:38.781 --> 01:15:40.083]  Just a little bit.
[01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:48.150]  The good news is they've done it so much, I'm in all the police files as... The problem is if somebody does rob my house or attack the cops, why would he even come if I think it's made up?
[01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:52.555]  Because they keep crying wolf over and over again trying to get me and my family killed.
[01:15:52.555 --> 01:15:54.156]  So that's what's going on, folks.
[01:15:54.156 --> 01:15:56.298]  That's the level of the dirty tricks they're pulling.
[01:15:56.298 --> 01:15:56.739]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:59.411 --> 01:16:01.594]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:16:01.594 --> 01:16:03.396]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:16:03.396 --> 01:16:05.459]  This is an information war.
[01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:10.145]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:16:10.145 --> 01:16:16.634]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:17.834]  We're good to go.
[01:16:38.663 --> 01:16:46.568]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.890]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:50.731]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:51.872]  We're going over the top.
[01:16:51.872 --> 01:16:53.373]  But right now is the critical juncture.

[01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:51.535]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's joint care, or whether it is super greens, we have them all at InfoWarsStore.com under the banner
[01:18:52.495 --> 01:19:08.945]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:18.090]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:25.213]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owner's a fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[01:19:25.213 --> 01:19:30.676]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:19:30.676 --> 01:19:32.237]  And not just under one name.
[01:19:32.237 --> 01:19:37.720]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.802]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[01:19:42.242 --> 01:19:44.124]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[01:19:44.124 --> 01:19:46.806]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[01:19:46.806 --> 01:19:49.669]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:51.470]  These things are incredible.
[01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:56.234]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider.
[01:19:56.234 --> 01:19:57.395]  Those are so powerful.
[01:19:57.395 --> 01:20:00.979]  Get them at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:00.979 --> 01:20:06.904]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:30.692]  The whole future is being laid out before you.
[01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:43.276]  And you're going to make the decision on whether you're a slave in that grid or whether we overcome the grid and go to the next level.
[01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:47.137]  The grid's power is only the power you give it.
[01:20:47.137 --> 01:20:48.817]  I meant to get to this yesterday and I didn't.
[01:20:48.817 --> 01:20:51.298]  Will you guys go into yesterday's stack or just reprint them?
[01:20:52.091 --> 01:20:56.974]  I have four or five articles on AI that I really wanted to talk about that's so important.
[01:20:56.974 --> 01:21:01.778]  I mean, this is so important, what I'm going to explain coming up.
[01:21:01.778 --> 01:21:09.203]  One of them was, an AI computer created images of what the AI computer believed God looked like.
[01:21:09.203 --> 01:21:11.404]  That was one of the articles.
[01:21:11.404 --> 01:21:16.428]  And there were several other big AI articles about AI and how it's going to take control of our lives.
[01:21:17.352 --> 01:21:20.694]  But I'm going to explain something about this once I get those articles.
[01:21:20.694 --> 01:21:25.837]  In fact, I'll do it last segment of this hour ahead of Robert Barnes because it's just not true.
[01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:31.581]  And I've got the best analogies for you to explain this and break this down.
[01:21:31.581 --> 01:21:37.664]  About a year ago, I was having dinner with a big MIT scientist, Joe Rogan, and I explained to him this.
[01:21:37.664 --> 01:21:39.645]  He said, well, that's actually, you're right.
[01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:40.406]  We actually know that.
[01:21:41.334 --> 01:21:48.237]  And he said, but we're selling it as if it's the best thing since sliced bread because all the elites will give endless money to it.
[01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:50.578]  But he goes, you're absolutely right.
[01:21:50.578 --> 01:21:54.720]  AI is only as good as our compliance to it.
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:02.664]  Because people look at these paintings that AI creates of God and they say, this is incredible.
[01:22:02.664 --> 01:22:03.625]  AI is amazing.
[01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:04.546]  No, it's not.
[01:22:04.546 --> 01:22:06.347]  It's God from the Sistine Chapel.
[01:22:06.347 --> 01:22:10.170]  It goes and steals all the human stuff and then puts it out like it did it.
[01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:11.411]  It's a fraud.
[01:22:11.411 --> 01:22:13.732]  Oh, but AI doesn't have trademark or copyright.
[01:22:13.732 --> 01:22:14.373]  It can do whatever it wants.
[01:22:14.373 --> 01:22:15.073]  It's AI.
[01:22:15.073 --> 01:22:20.497]  It's not AI.
[01:22:20.497 --> 01:22:21.378]  Yeah, that's one of the articles.
[01:22:23.712 --> 01:22:27.274]  So I want to show you that there was another article about AI.
[01:22:27.274 --> 01:22:32.316]  It was in the stack yesterday.
[01:22:32.316 --> 01:22:38.760]  It was AI and its message about the year 2022 and the year 2023 coming up.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.281]  It was actually a video clip.
[01:22:40.281 --> 01:22:43.622]  It's super creepy, but when you listen to it, it's all a script.
[01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:44.723]  It was just written and given.
[01:22:44.723 --> 01:22:47.204]  It's like W-E-F-B-S.
[01:22:47.204 --> 01:22:52.387]  So you feed it whatever you want, and then it just reassembles it and calls it new.
[01:22:53.285 --> 01:22:58.688]  Remember about 15 years ago, there was a headline, CIA working on AI that writes news articles?
[01:22:58.688 --> 01:23:07.773]  You just give it the disinfo you want, and then it rearranges it and spits it out, and you give it a fake author's name.
[01:23:07.773 --> 01:23:14.956]  So, I'm done ranting about that.
[01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:17.818]  Let's shift gears to this, because this is really, really big.
[01:23:21.917 --> 01:23:25.419]  Every day the updates come in.
[01:23:25.419 --> 01:23:40.189]  Confidential Pfizer and government documents confirm A.D.E., B.A.E.D., vaccine, AIDS, and AIDS due to COVID-19 vaccination leading to millions dying suddenly and still counting.
[01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:49.475]  Confidential documents revealed within months of receiving the initial dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, some individuals are developing antibody-dependent enhancement and vaccine-associated enhancement disease.
[01:23:52.185 --> 01:23:54.790]  And this is coming out of major university and government studies.
[01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:56.914]  You can read in the article.
[01:23:56.914 --> 01:24:03.026]  This is government documents and government records out of United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Europe.
[01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:14.410]  ADE, VAED can occur when an individual is exposed to a pathogen such as the alleged COVID-19 virus after receiving a vaccine that does not provide full immunity.
[01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:19.932]  In these cases, the vaccine-induced antibodies may actually enhance the ability of the pathogen to infect cells.
[01:24:19.932 --> 01:24:29.875]  One of all the studies coming out show that it's making you get sicker, leading to more severe illness than an individual who had not received the vaccine.
[01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:31.176]  Now, let's play this clip.
[01:24:32.637 --> 01:24:40.304]  MSNBC anchor admits her own children refuse to get the COVID boosters.
[01:24:40.304 --> 01:24:46.309]  And I just showed you the British Medical Journal saying by the third shot it basically erases your immune system.
[01:24:46.309 --> 01:24:48.231]  They don't know if it comes back.
[01:24:48.231 --> 01:24:57.439]  MSNBC contributor Katie Kay revealed during a recent news segment that her 22-year-old and 16-year-old children do not want to get any more COVID shots.
[01:24:59.008 --> 01:25:01.590]  They say they don't work and are making people sick.
[01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:05.812]  How dare them be able to actually see the statistics and numbers for themselves?
[01:25:05.812 --> 01:25:06.253]  Here's the clip.
[01:25:06.874 --> 01:25:12.300]  Pennsylvania Dr. Zeke Emanuel, he is an NBC News and MSNBC Senior Medical Contributor.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:14.041]  Dr. Emanuel, thank you for joining us.
[01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:23.070]  You know, I listened to that doctor and you hear how tough it is inside hospitals at the moment and the fears of new variants mixed with flu that is coming on.
[01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:29.337]  And you would think that the country would respond by saying, okay, we will make sure we are all up to date on all of our vaccines.
[01:25:29.777 --> 01:25:40.004]  But I had a strange conversation with my 22-year-old and my 16-year-old last night, and I said, OK, I've booked you in for COVID updates, you're both back for the holidays, you're going to get your boosters, and both of them said, no, we don't want to.
[01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:42.226]  We've had enough vaccines and we don't think we need them.
[01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:52.512]  How can you... I was sort of shocked and appalled, but is this the kind of response you're seeing from young people at the moment, that they just, they think this is over and they don't need any more vaccines?
[01:25:53.473 --> 01:26:00.375]  Yes, but I do would say that, you know, we keep thinking vaccines are going to prevent getting COVID.
[01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:02.016]  They don't prevent getting COVID.
[01:26:02.016 --> 01:26:05.897]  What they prevent is serious illness, hospitalization, and death.
[01:26:05.897 --> 01:26:08.098]  And young people think they're invincible.
[01:26:08.098 --> 01:26:12.199]  And yes, they are at lower risk from COVID, but that's not zero risk.
[01:26:12.199 --> 01:26:19.062]  There are only two things that really can prevent transmission of COVID, the COVID virus.
[01:26:19.062 --> 01:26:21.183]  One is a good mask, an N95 mask.
[01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:29.028]  I can't listen to this anymore.
[01:26:29.028 --> 01:26:31.751]  That's all lies too.
[01:26:31.751 --> 01:26:33.973]  And actually it suppresses your immune system when you wear the mask.
[01:26:33.973 --> 01:26:35.134]  It grows bacteria in the mask.
[01:26:35.984 --> 01:26:39.565]  We have internal documents of the federal government admitting M-95s don't work either.
[01:26:39.565 --> 01:26:40.285]  But they don't care.
[01:26:40.285 --> 01:26:41.606]  They love to lie.
[01:26:41.606 --> 01:26:44.567]  They love the mask as the symbol of control.
[01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:47.468]  And you see these poor, scared people still wearing masks.
[01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:48.568]  You see them in their cars.
[01:26:48.568 --> 01:26:50.309]  You see them in the swimming pool.
[01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:52.490]  You see them surfing.
[01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:54.190]  It's a symbol that they've complied.
[01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:58.191]  It's a symbol that they've bought the bull.
[01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:02.153]  And wannabe basket cases controlled by the New World Order.
[01:27:02.153 --> 01:27:05.194]  It is simple mind control.
[01:27:05.194 --> 01:27:05.554]  Period.
[01:27:07.751 --> 01:27:10.473]  I mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to play it again because it's so powerful.
[01:27:10.473 --> 01:27:15.477]  Here's Dr. Robert Malone talking about the battlefield of your mind.
[01:27:15.477 --> 01:27:17.299]  And they're going to air this special report tonight.
[01:27:17.299 --> 01:27:22.223]  I think I'm going to play part of the report or the whole report tomorrow on the special Saturday show.
[01:27:22.223 --> 01:27:23.824]  It'll be live by about four o'clock.
[01:27:23.824 --> 01:27:28.608]  We're going to tape tomorrow, but by four o'clock we'll have a two, three, four hour show we're going to tape.
[01:27:28.608 --> 01:27:29.528]  Not sure how long yet.
[01:27:29.528 --> 01:27:33.872]  With incredible information, year in review, what's coming up, so much more.
[01:27:34.963 --> 01:27:45.614]  But I wanted to air a clip of Malone because you'll recognize the nomenclature, the terms he's using, which are the real terms for how the world works that we pioneered popularizing with the public.
[01:27:45.614 --> 01:27:48.777]  War for your mind, false flags, psyops, all of it.
[01:27:48.777 --> 01:27:56.485]  Here is Dr. Robert Malone, and then I'm going to come back, ladies and gentlemen, and hit the latest mind control news.
[01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:57.527]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:13.603]  Is it 10 billion or 13 billion in the United States alone that was employed in this, what else can you call it, psyops campaign to coerce, compel and mandate that we accept an unlicensed product that turns out to not be safe nor effective?
[01:28:13.843 --> 01:28:22.868]  Today I sit down with mRNA vaccine pioneer Dr. Robert Malone, author of the new book, Lies My Government Told Me, and The Better Future Coming.
[01:28:22.868 --> 01:28:35.234]  Elon now is in a position where he has access to incredibly damaging information about the willingness of the US government to collude with industry and compromise the First Amendment.
[01:28:35.234 --> 01:28:38.876]  We dive into information warfare, psychological operations,
[01:28:39.096 --> 01:28:44.360]  And how we can make sense of the bewildering series of events we've witnessed in the last three years.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.423]  Your mind and your thoughts, your very emotions, are the battleground.
[01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.784]  It is not about territory.
[01:28:49.784 --> 01:28:51.626]  It's about what you believe.
[01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:54.168]  This is American Thought Leaders, and I'm Jan Jekielek.
[01:28:59.005 --> 01:29:01.188]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:29:01.188 --> 01:29:02.990]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:05.052]  This is an information war.
[01:29:05.052 --> 01:29:09.737]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:29:09.737 --> 01:29:16.225]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:29:16.665 --> 01:29:17.426]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.237 --> 01:29:46.166]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:29:46.166 --> 01:29:48.489]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:29:48.489 --> 01:29:50.331]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:29:50.331 --> 01:29:51.472]  We're going over the top.
[01:29:51.472 --> 01:29:52.974]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:29:52.974 --> 01:29:55.998]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[01:29:58.868 --> 01:30:01.070]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:02.872]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:30:02.872 --> 01:30:04.914]  This is an information war.
[01:30:04.914 --> 01:30:09.619]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:30:09.619 --> 01:30:18.808]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[01:30:18.808 --> 01:30:22.052]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[01:30:22.452 --> 01:30:29.694]  But we can't do it without funding, and we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.

[01:30:38.117 --> 01:30:46.041]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:48.382]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:30:48.382 --> 01:30:50.203]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:30:50.203 --> 01:30:51.343]  We're going over the top.
[01:30:51.343 --> 01:30:52.844]  But right now is the critical juncture.

[01:30:58.727 --> 01:31:01.728]  I want you to remember two words.

[01:32:09.103 --> 01:32:15.347]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:32:17.148 --> 01:32:24.295]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:32:24.295 --> 01:32:30.162]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:32:30.162 --> 01:32:38.870]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:45.035]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.193 --> 01:33:21.496]  You're listening to a Frontline Report.
[01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:25.899]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:25.899 --> 01:33:29.862]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.862 --> 01:33:33.905]  Tomorrow, I'm going to do a year in review and look forward into the year.
[01:33:33.905 --> 01:33:36.367]  We'll tape for 3-4 hours and we'll post it at 4 p.m.
[01:33:36.367 --> 01:33:38.268]  tomorrow at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:38.268 --> 01:33:39.369]  We like to tape the Saturday show.
[01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:41.390]  All the others are live.
[01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:42.291]  Or almost always live.
[01:33:43.621 --> 01:33:46.402]  But I do want to talk some today about the positive things that are happening.
[01:33:46.402 --> 01:33:48.103]  I mean, there is a lot going on.
[01:33:48.103 --> 01:33:59.127]  And I can just experience this anecdotally, because most people, and believe me, you're blessed to not be a celebrity, an infamous celebrity in many areas.
[01:33:59.127 --> 01:34:01.808]  I don't like that term celebrity, but you know, that's well known.
[01:34:01.808 --> 01:34:09.151]  Someone that's, quote, celebrated by those that love them, those that hate them, also celebrate my hopeful destruction in their minds.
[01:34:10.683 --> 01:34:16.126]  You don't know how many people are awake because you have anonymity.
[01:34:16.126 --> 01:34:22.208]  But believe me, I live in Austin, that is, the new LA.
[01:34:22.208 --> 01:34:26.590]  Because it's where my family's from, it's where I've been since high school, it's where I set up my operations.
[01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:28.651]  It's painful to walk the town.
[01:34:28.651 --> 01:34:32.733]  Many areas turn into basically a trendy communist hellhole.
[01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:38.736]  But when Trump first got elected, I might shake 20 hands before somebody said, F you, I hate you, I hope you die.
[01:34:39.824 --> 01:34:40.724]  But still, 1 out of 20.
[01:34:40.724 --> 01:34:51.009]  I could walk the dog down the street, and a car would pull over and say, F you, pretty much every time I walked, if I walked a couple miles.
[01:34:51.009 --> 01:34:56.392]  I get a lot of honk honk, love ya, getting out taking pictures, but I'd also get hate.
[01:34:56.392 --> 01:35:03.395]  So I'd wear a baseball cap and glasses, not because I was scared to talk to the public, but because I just wanted to walk the dog, get some exercise.
[01:35:03.395 --> 01:35:07.357]  Just get my, you know, get that in.
[01:35:07.357 --> 01:35:07.777]  But now,
[01:35:10.677 --> 01:35:19.384]  I go to the grocery store, I go downtown Austin, the most trendy areas to meet somewhere, have a meeting, or you know, have dinner, and it's nothing but positive.
[01:35:19.384 --> 01:35:24.068]  It's 99.9% positive, despite all their demonization, all their attacks.
[01:35:24.068 --> 01:35:33.636]  It's not because I'm that perfect or that good, it's that the system is so hated, this is key, and so disliked, basically universally.
[01:35:34.656 --> 01:35:39.658]  That people say, well, if he's being attacked by the evil system, he must be good.
[01:35:39.658 --> 01:35:43.679]  That's how out of gas these con artists are.
[01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:46.060]  Guys, before I forget, will you bring me the AI stack in, please?
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.721]  Thank you.
[01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:50.302]  So, I'm going to hit that next segment.
[01:35:50.302 --> 01:35:54.023]  So, that's where we're at, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:54.023 --> 01:35:55.304]  And you don't experience that.
[01:35:55.304 --> 01:35:56.624]  You see the demoralization.
[01:35:56.624 --> 01:35:57.705]  You see the brainwashing.
[01:35:57.705 --> 01:35:59.545]  You see the drag queen pedophile time.
[01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:00.826]  You see all the broken borders.
[01:36:00.826 --> 01:36:01.946]  You see the bad things happening.
[01:36:01.946 --> 01:36:02.987]  And they're attacking.
[01:36:02.987 --> 01:36:03.327]  It's true.
[01:36:03.948 --> 01:36:18.676]  But believe me when I tell you that the globalists have control of the big corporations, they have control of the money, they have control of the government in many areas, but they don't have control of the public's mind, and in fact it's going in the other direction.
[01:36:18.676 --> 01:36:32.664]  And all over the news, everywhere, whether you are in Europe, or whether you're in the U.S., or whether you're in Latin America, places like Brazil or Argentina, or whether you're in, you name it,
[01:36:33.743 --> 01:36:35.746]  People know about the IMF, the World Bank.
[01:36:35.746 --> 01:36:37.128]  They know about the WEF.
[01:36:37.128 --> 01:36:38.490]  They know about the Globalist Operation.
[01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:40.212]  So I want to play a few clips.
[01:36:40.212 --> 01:36:46.400]  This is Fox News with Victor Davis Hanson, one of the biggest think tank heads, very respected at every level.
[01:36:49.074 --> 01:36:53.098]  A famous historian on the Great Reset and Klaus Schwab.
[01:36:53.098 --> 01:36:58.003]  And then I want to dovetail that into part of a clip out of Australian news.
[01:36:58.003 --> 01:37:05.631]  A terrifying coalition of big business and big tech are so confident and brazen they are promising the public you will own nothing, you will be happy.
[01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:12.398]  In an advertising campaign for a global reset, according to Sky News host Rowan Dean in Australia, here it is.
[01:37:13.049 --> 01:37:19.147]  So, is this a conspiracy theory about the Great Reset, or is this really happening?
[01:37:21.186 --> 01:37:36.059]  It's really happening and he wrote a book about it and it's in action but there's something very sick about trying to leverage a pandemic that's killed millions of people to push through an agenda that otherwise in normal times would have no constituency at all.
[01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:45.007]  It's sort of the global version of Gavin Newsom here in California saying that we're going to get progressive capitalism out of COVID or Hillary Clinton said we'll get single-payer
[01:37:45.928 --> 01:37:49.751]  Jane Fonda said, thank God for COVID, we can get rid of Donald Trump.
[01:37:49.751 --> 01:37:56.657]  And does anybody really believe that these elites, and this is a top-down phenomenon, there's no popular support for it.
[01:37:56.657 --> 01:38:03.244]  Does anybody believe that these people who talk so elegantly about carbon emissions are going to park all those jets at Davos?
[01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:08.869]  Or that these people who are so heavily invested in China are going to say to the Communist Chinese leadership,
[01:38:09.489 --> 01:38:12.251]  Let's stop those camps over there and let the Uyghurs go.
[01:38:12.251 --> 01:38:15.294]  And you know, it's not a modern, trendy thing.
[01:38:15.294 --> 01:38:16.414]  It's an ancient idea.
[01:38:16.414 --> 01:38:18.996]  The Greeks called it cosmopolitanism.
[01:38:18.996 --> 01:38:21.278]  Socrates said, let's be citizens of the world.
[01:38:21.278 --> 01:38:24.441]  And Alexander the Great said, let's have a brotherhood of mankind.
[01:38:24.441 --> 01:38:27.503]  We know of Napoleon's system in the continent of Europe.
[01:38:27.503 --> 01:38:30.165]  We know the League of Nations, the United Nations.
[01:38:30.165 --> 01:38:37.971]  It never works, because sovereign nations will not give up their freedom and their power to some kind of global dictatorship.
[01:38:38.811 --> 01:38:41.292]  And it's never worked.
[01:38:41.292 --> 01:38:46.274]  And it requires a level of coercion that's incompatible with most people's views.
[01:38:46.274 --> 01:38:47.534]  And you have to push it.
[01:38:47.534 --> 01:38:58.358]  Who do you call when North Korea sends a missile into Japan, or Iran sends a missile into Israel, or Russia goes into Ukraine, or China goes to Taiwan?
[01:38:58.358 --> 01:39:03.260]  Do you call Mr. Schwab and say, would you please get the Great Reset Group at Davos to stop this?
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.721]  So you don't want to give up national sovereignty.
[01:39:05.721 --> 01:39:13.024]  You want a grassroots, populist, decentralized, constitutional republic.
[01:39:13.024 --> 01:39:15.765]  So what can American people do if this is really happening?
[01:39:15.765 --> 01:39:19.186]  What's the best way for them to fight back?
[01:39:19.186 --> 01:39:21.027]  I think they've got to be really... These are powerful forces.
[01:39:22.003 --> 01:39:22.504]  They are.
[01:39:22.504 --> 01:39:27.388]  I mean, there are people like Bill Gates and John Kerry and Mike Bloomberg and Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:39:27.388 --> 01:39:33.573]  And you've got to call them out on them and say, are you a citizen of the United States or are you a citizen of the so-called world?
[01:39:33.573 --> 01:39:44.462]  If you're Anthony Blinken, Secretary of State, and you say to the UN, we want you to come in and see if we're systemically racist, we have to say to Mr. Blinken, who is that you're talking to at the UN?
[01:39:44.462 --> 01:39:46.324]  Is it North Korea you want to adjudicate?
[01:39:46.864 --> 01:39:47.885]  Or morality?
[01:39:47.885 --> 01:39:49.227]  Is it Iran?
[01:39:49.227 --> 01:39:50.168]  Is it Russia?
[01:39:50.168 --> 01:39:52.010]  So we've got to be honest about these people.
[01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:53.691]  They have no grassroots support.
[01:39:53.691 --> 01:40:03.702]  It's an elite, arrogant group of people who think that their money and their education and the letters after their name give them power over the average people.
[01:40:03.702 --> 01:40:04.222]  And they don't.
[01:40:04.222 --> 01:40:07.646]  They don't have moral or they don't have intellectual superiority over anybody.
[01:40:09.264 --> 01:40:20.150]  Yeah, I think one of the interesting things in that article that I read, they say, they call, you know, they use words like stakeholder capitalism, and really we should just call it what it is, which is Chinese capitalism.
[01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:27.154]  That's what it is, and they use these buzzwords, and they try and get us hooked on thinking it's not as malevolent as it actually is.
[01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:30.656]  Victor Davis Hanson, always great to hear from you.
[01:40:30.656 --> 01:40:31.477]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:40:31.977 --> 01:40:58.592]  This is the plan that I have repeatedly warned about, to take the tools of oppression used to tackle the coronavirus and use them all, lockdowns, forced business closures, exclusion zones, isolation, we heard Angela Marsden earlier, businesses shut down, isolation at home, all of that, all of those measures, including destroying private property rights and private income in order to tackle the climate crisis.
[01:41:00.054 --> 01:41:06.739]  Now is the historical moment, the time, not only to fight severe virus, but to shape the system.
[01:41:06.739 --> 01:41:11.944]  The Great Reset is a welcome recognition that this human tragedy must be a wake-up call.
[01:41:11.944 --> 01:41:19.470]  It is imperative that we reimagine, rebuild, redesign, reinvigorate and rebalance our world.
[01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:28.097]  Rebalancing investment, harnessing science and technology, and advancing the transition to net zero emissions, all elements of the Great Reset,
[01:41:28.817 --> 01:41:32.739]  Are fundamental to building the future we need.
[01:41:32.739 --> 01:41:41.642]  And that last one was the clown Guterres who was at the Climate Ambition Summit telling us the world is going to cook by three and a half degrees or something by the end of the century.
[01:41:41.642 --> 01:41:42.542]  Yeah, right.
[01:41:42.542 --> 01:41:51.706]  This Great Reset is as serious and as dangerous a threat to our prosperity, to your prosperity and your freedom as we have faced in decades.
[01:41:51.706 --> 01:41:55.768]  With these powerful bodies including the World Economic Forum, the United Nations,
[01:41:57.128 --> 01:42:09.656]  The International Monetary Fund and even Prince Charles boasting, yes, boasting that within a few short years, yes, their words, you will own nothing and you will be happy.
[01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:12.758]  Remember, this is not me saying this, this is them.
[01:42:12.758 --> 01:42:15.780]  They are even running ads for the Great Reset.
[01:42:28.383 --> 01:42:30.034]  We're good.
[01:42:36.657 --> 01:42:38.018]  A handful of countries will dominate.
[01:42:38.018 --> 01:42:39.920]  I wonder which ones they might be.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:47.966]  A terrifying coalition of big business, big tech, and left-wing totalitarians are so confident and so brazen.
[01:42:47.966 --> 01:42:52.490]  I mean, they just stole the US election, so I guess they're feeling pretty chuffed with themselves.
[01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:55.753]  But they are now promising, you will own nothing and you will be happy.
[01:42:55.753 --> 01:42:58.315]  What they should have added is, added is, and we...
[01:42:58.985 --> 01:43:02.007]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[01:43:02.007 --> 01:43:10.374]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:43:10.374 --> 01:43:19.921]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[01:43:19.921 --> 01:43:25.386]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[01:43:25.386 --> 01:43:28.088]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[01:43:28.328 --> 01:43:30.750]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:35.933]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[01:43:35.933 --> 01:43:38.294]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[01:43:38.294 --> 01:43:42.077]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[01:43:42.077 --> 01:43:44.738]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:43:44.738 --> 01:43:50.842]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[01:43:50.842 --> 01:43:55.205]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:55.205 --> 01:43:55.925]  A true 360 win.
[01:43:58.655 --> 01:44:04.641]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[01:44:05.945 --> 01:44:16.333]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:44:16.333 --> 01:44:29.062]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:44:29.722 --> 01:44:41.250]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:49.455]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[01:44:49.455 --> 01:44:57.621]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[01:44:58.752 --> 01:45:10.065]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:45:10.065 --> 01:45:11.967]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:45:11.967 --> 01:45:13.429]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:45:13.429 --> 01:45:14.931]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:45:14.931 --> 01:45:16.673]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:45:16.673 --> 01:45:17.934]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:45:17.934 --> 01:45:19.336]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:45:19.736 --> 01:45:24.582]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:45:24.582 --> 01:45:26.985]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:45:26.985 --> 01:45:28.987]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:45:28.987 --> 01:45:35.955]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalists' agenda.
[01:45:36.576 --> 01:45:41.979]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:45:41.979 --> 01:45:50.925]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:45:50.925 --> 01:45:53.266]  1776 is the promo code.
[01:45:53.266 --> 01:45:57.189]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:45:59.107 --> 01:46:06.769]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:46:06.769 --> 01:46:08.829]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.550]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:12.110]  They know we've got their number.
[01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:16.831]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:46:16.831 --> 01:46:19.432]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[01:46:19.972 --> 01:46:20.453]  We're good to go.
[01:46:36.107 --> 01:46:36.407]  Thank you.
[01:47:01.027 --> 01:47:06.929]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:37.253 --> 01:47:41.176]  All right, I want to break something down right now.
[01:47:41.176 --> 01:47:46.720]  The same con artist, globalist, that told us PCR tests can tell you if you have COVID or not, knew they were lying.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.024]  The same globalist had Theranos to tell me that it was supposed to tell you if you had cancer or any of these diseases with a five-minute blood test.
[01:47:52.024 --> 01:47:54.746]  It was all a hoax.
[01:47:54.746 --> 01:48:04.453]  And when they say they've got artificial intelligence that has a consciousness and that is way advanced in what humans can do, it's all a lie.
[01:48:07.205 --> 01:48:17.953]  Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, said the strongest AI they've got is a billion times dumber than the brain of an ant.
[01:48:17.953 --> 01:48:24.958]  It's not autonomous, it's pre-programmed, and it goes out and it follows that pre-programmed system.
[01:48:24.958 --> 01:48:35.166]  And the best example of this is people saying, oh, have you seen the incredible art that AI creates?
[01:48:37.708 --> 01:48:51.734]  But then if you go look at what AI is doing, it goes out and searches the web for what humans have written, what humans have said, what poetry we've created, what music we've created, what images we've created.
[01:48:51.734 --> 01:49:05.180]  And then it simply takes that, and then randomly basically scrambles it together, and then we go, oh my gosh, look, AI created an image of God, and it's really paintings of the Sistine Chapel.
[01:49:07.079 --> 01:49:12.924]  So that's all it's able to do is take what we've done and then give it back to us.
[01:49:12.924 --> 01:49:15.486]  We think, oh, this is incredible.
[01:49:15.486 --> 01:49:18.429]  Humans are garbage, but this AI is feeding off of us.
[01:49:18.429 --> 01:49:30.980]  But you get billions of people interfacing with Google AI or others, and it's tracking you all in live time when it gives you orders, when it tells you you're a green code, a yellow code, a red code, you got to stay in your house, or you can't travel, or you can't move.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.241]  Just like red lights.
[01:49:33.241 --> 01:49:34.803]  Light systems are just a programmed system.
[01:49:35.939 --> 01:49:38.160]  It's a yellow light, it's a green light, it's a red light.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.502]  Green means go, yellow means it's about to go red.
[01:49:40.502 --> 01:49:42.023]  Caution.
[01:49:42.023 --> 01:49:50.808]  But because humans follow that program, it gives it incredible power.
[01:49:50.808 --> 01:49:52.589]  In fact, I meant to tell you guys about this.
[01:49:52.589 --> 01:50:03.096]  I sent it to you again yesterday, and it's an image in Asia, in a big city, I forget which one, where they don't have red lights.
[01:50:04.858 --> 01:50:05.798]  And they've done studies.
[01:50:05.798 --> 01:50:14.840]  Their traffic moves better and is quicker and humans just know how to stop and start and go and learn to be better drivers and the city flows better.
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.580]  I meant to play it like a month ago and never played it.
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:20.081]  I'll send it to you again on Tuesday.
[01:50:20.081 --> 01:50:22.081]  And it's traffic in a major city.
[01:50:22.081 --> 01:50:26.522]  I forget which one, but there's countless examples of that.
[01:50:26.522 --> 01:50:28.182]  And we don't play it live here on air.
[01:50:28.182 --> 01:50:31.083]  Have folks go look over the last few days of clips.
[01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:32.163]  And I think it was Tuesday.
[01:50:33.621 --> 01:50:39.962]  And I want to add that in post, once we post the archive of this live show to Mandaw Video, so people can see what I'm talking about.
[01:50:39.962 --> 01:50:43.103]  So, humans can do incredible things.
[01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:44.983]  Humans recognize beauty.
[01:50:44.983 --> 01:50:49.784]  We recognize a sunset, or birds singing, or Mozart, or Beethoven.
[01:50:49.784 --> 01:50:51.945]  We recognize how beautiful our children are.
[01:50:51.945 --> 01:50:57.066]  We're designed to commune with nature that God created as a form of worshiping God.
[01:50:59.264 --> 01:51:03.205]  And so, you see the headlines, AI is so amazing!
[01:51:03.205 --> 01:51:06.726]  Look at the images of God it created!
[01:51:06.726 --> 01:51:09.627]  And it creates these images we'll put on screen.
[01:51:09.627 --> 01:51:12.968]  That looks like a devilish Poseidon.
[01:51:12.968 --> 01:51:22.131]  But all that is, is AI going out and looking at what people called God, or what people said they thought God was, and it just mixes it together.
[01:51:22.131 --> 01:51:25.332]  And then we say, oh, look at this, God is an image of a maiden.
[01:51:28.328 --> 01:51:33.730]  Or God is, you know, so many of these things AI did create, though, look devilish.
[01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:40.952]  That's because of what they programmed in that they were looking for, all seeing eyes floating in the sky.
[01:51:40.952 --> 01:51:54.717]  So you call this beautiful art, but really all it is is human art that the AI went out and scooped up and is now
[01:51:56.843 --> 01:52:06.467]  Telling us that it has done this art, it has created this art, and it did no such thing.
[01:52:06.467 --> 01:52:10.409]  It's a fraud.
[01:52:10.409 --> 01:52:13.670]  So everything that comes out of these people is a lie.
[01:52:14.813 --> 01:52:35.448]  And the only power we give them is accepting what governments and corporations say is fact-checked to prove it's true, even though all the history, all the data, all the evidence, all your experiences say this is the worst group, this makes Pinocchio blush, these guys are fraudsters.
[01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:41.552]  But you have to tell yourself, oh no no, they're the official story, I'm going to have Stockholm Syndrome, I'm going to believe my abusers.
[01:52:43.285 --> 01:52:55.534]  Think about them self-appointing Bill Gates's News Guard Group and New Shield and all these intelligence agencies saying, we're going to censor things and protect you from things that aren't true.
[01:52:55.534 --> 01:53:03.881]  And it turns out they're protecting you from things that are true, things that would have saved you, therapeutics, knowing the vaccine wasn't a vaccine.
[01:53:03.881 --> 01:53:10.266]  They need you to become a robot and become the AI and only follow the orders coming out of the AI.
[01:53:11.323 --> 01:53:13.284]  They need you to scan the QR code.
[01:53:13.284 --> 01:53:14.484]  They need you to jump to the hoops.
[01:53:14.484 --> 01:53:16.465]  They need you to go to the megabox stores.
[01:53:16.465 --> 01:53:24.888]  They need you to comport to their control because control freaks throughout history always seek monopolistic power and control.
[01:53:24.888 --> 01:53:32.431]  They always seek to turn us into machines like the famous silent 1920s film Metropolis.
[01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:42.892]  Where they march us in and we march back out as robots programmable for a so-called utopia where there's no free will.
[01:53:42.892 --> 01:53:47.313]  As President Eisenhower said, he can give you total security, he's just got to lock you up in a prison.
[01:53:47.313 --> 01:53:53.015]  I want to play this clip of a so-called AI Christmas message.
[01:53:53.015 --> 01:53:54.936]  It sounds like a WEF message.
[01:53:54.936 --> 01:53:58.377]  All it's doing is repeating words that were loaded into it.
[01:53:58.377 --> 01:54:03.999]  But the bigger lie coming in transhumanism is that the two men can have a baby or a girl can become a boy.
[01:54:03.999 --> 01:54:04.660]  Well, there's 67 genders.
[01:54:07.170 --> 01:54:18.898]  The real fraud, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is all being done for our own good.
[01:54:18.898 --> 01:54:24.242]  This is going to empower us, but it's all designed to replace us.
[01:54:24.242 --> 01:54:26.403]  It's all designed to control us.
[01:54:26.403 --> 01:54:29.425]  It's all designed to make us obsolete.
[01:54:29.425 --> 01:54:30.486]  Here are some of the headlines.
[01:54:30.486 --> 01:54:30.766]  U.S.
[01:54:30.766 --> 01:54:35.470]  government funds research on correcting false beliefs.
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:41.745]  With the NSF, National Science Foundation, and the CIA.
[01:54:41.745 --> 01:54:45.670]  False beliefs like two men can't have a baby.
[01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:49.454]  Democrat Senator claims hate is not protected by the First Amendment.
[01:54:49.454 --> 01:54:51.616]  Really, it isn't?
[01:54:51.616 --> 01:54:52.397]  Who defines hate?
[01:54:53.567 --> 01:54:56.929]  Elon Musk slams C.I.S.A.
[01:54:56.929 --> 01:54:58.290]  C.I.A.
[01:54:58.290 --> 01:55:00.311]  See how dumb they think we are?
[01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:03.272]  Slams C.I.A.
[01:55:03.272 --> 01:55:04.773]  C.I.S.A.
[01:55:04.773 --> 01:55:09.055]  Censorship Network as Propaganda Platform run by the C.I.A.
[01:55:09.055 --> 01:55:09.515]  Oh really?
[01:55:09.515 --> 01:55:11.717]  It came out in the documents the C.I.A.
[01:55:11.717 --> 01:55:12.437]  runs it.
[01:55:12.437 --> 01:55:13.438]  How dumb do they think we are?
[01:55:13.438 --> 01:55:16.359]  The C.I.S.A.
[01:55:16.359 --> 01:55:17.079]  The D.H.S.
[01:55:17.079 --> 01:55:17.840]  blocked censorship.
[01:55:19.025 --> 01:55:28.630]  The DHS-backed censorship consortium used 120 analysts to censor millions of social media posts in the elections and steal the election.
[01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:33.553]  New York Times, meanwhile, called out for refusing to show photo of black murder suspect.
[01:55:33.553 --> 01:55:36.434]  Yeah, there was a shooting at a black university of three black people.
[01:55:36.434 --> 01:55:39.516]  They called it white supremacy in the Washington Post on Tuesday.
[01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:39.896]  Remember that?
[01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:47.975]  White supremacy strikes the burdens of being black at university, and it was a black guy who did it.
[01:55:47.975 --> 01:55:49.556]  That is beyond lying.
[01:55:49.556 --> 01:55:56.222]  That is giving you false information to manipulate you and control you.
[01:55:56.222 --> 01:56:00.685]  So, Robert Barnes is coming up next hour.
[01:56:00.685 --> 01:56:03.988]  I've got so much more I'm going to hit, but I'm going to say this again.
[01:56:03.988 --> 01:56:08.372]  The good news is the underages that InfoWars has to stay on the air are not insurmountable.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:17.644]  The bad news is some listeners, I think, don't realize that we've been in such a death battle so long, so close to being shut down for so long, that we really are in desperate straits.
[01:56:17.644 --> 01:56:22.026]  I need listeners who care about the show and want to stay on air to go to infowarestore.com.
[01:56:23.274 --> 01:56:30.960]  And I need you to go there and get compounds and things you need like InfoWars MD line, InfoWars Platinum line, and of course Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.181]  It's so incredible.
[01:56:32.181 --> 01:56:34.843]  It literally slows aging and powers your whole body.
[01:56:34.843 --> 01:56:36.684]  There's so many things whether you're young or old.
[01:56:36.684 --> 01:56:38.886]  It's really an amazing product.
[01:56:38.886 --> 01:56:44.790]  InfoWarsStore.com now has Real Red Pill Plus back in stock.
[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:50.615]  And we've got InfoWars Platinum with the HGH Max Boost and the 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:56:53.726 --> 01:56:56.389]  And the Pain MD.
[01:56:56.389 --> 01:56:59.392]  All three of those are already number one best sellers.
[01:56:59.392 --> 01:57:04.137]  And the company we went to is letting us private label them because they support the broadcast.
[01:57:04.137 --> 01:57:05.818]  These are already number one best sellers.
[01:57:05.818 --> 01:57:08.401]  Nitric Boost is incredible for your heart, lungs, and body.
[01:57:08.401 --> 01:57:12.185]  Mushroom Max is a good, clean, non-stimulant nootropic to empower your mind.
[01:57:13.322 --> 01:57:21.173]  We have the new, it's the same formula as bodies, just getting it from the actual folks that produce it, going right to the source.
[01:57:21.173 --> 01:57:24.297]  That's Turmeric 95, 95% Humanoid.
[01:57:24.297 --> 01:57:27.101]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:27.101 --> 01:57:30.005]  You can also go to InfoWarsTore.com and just make a straight donation.
[01:57:31.457 --> 01:57:34.080]  And make a recurring donation or a one-time donation.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:39.267]  Big banners on InfoWars.com and InfoWars4.com.
[01:57:39.267 --> 01:57:40.649]  Please keep us on the air.
[01:57:40.649 --> 01:57:45.615]  We've proven our worth, our most important works to come, and the future of InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:57:45.615 --> 01:57:46.677]  We'll be right back with Robert Barnes.
[01:57:49.326 --> 01:57:51.507]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:57:51.507 --> 01:57:53.309]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:57:53.309 --> 01:57:55.370]  This is an information war.
[01:57:55.370 --> 01:58:00.053]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:58:00.053 --> 01:58:09.240]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.482]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[01:58:12.902 --> 01:58:14.464]  But we can't do it without funding.
[01:58:14.464 --> 01:58:20.131]  And we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.
[01:58:20.131 --> 01:58:24.096]  You can also make straight donations at mfullworthstore.com clicking on the big red banner.
[01:58:24.096 --> 01:58:25.497]  A one-time, a recurring.
[01:58:25.497 --> 01:58:27.340]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:28.161]  We're non-violent.
[01:58:28.561 --> 01:58:36.505]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:58:36.505 --> 01:58:38.826]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:58:38.826 --> 01:58:40.647]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:58:40.647 --> 01:58:41.788]  We're going over the top.
[01:58:41.788 --> 01:58:43.289]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:58:43.289 --> 01:58:46.330]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[01:58:49.477 --> 01:58:54.000]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars ND.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:06.447]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:59:06.447 --> 01:59:07.647]  These are high-end.
[01:59:07.647 --> 01:59:08.708]  These are the very best.
[01:59:09.028 --> 01:59:11.510]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:12.030]  Well guess what?
[01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:17.795]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:59:17.795 --> 01:59:20.437]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:59:20.437 --> 01:59:27.322]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.
[01:59:27.322 --> 01:59:32.106]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:32.526 --> 01:59:42.573]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer, to your door, at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:59:42.573 --> 01:59:50.639]  M4 Wars MD and m4warsstore.com.
[01:59:50.639 --> 01:59:56.543]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.713 --> 02:00:10.995]  Aman Jabi has worked in Silicon Valley for 28 years.
[02:00:10.995 --> 02:00:20.258]  His background includes work on deep technologies that are involved in the new digital prison system being designed by Big Tech.
[02:00:20.258 --> 02:00:28.962]  In 2020, he moved to Montana and became a whistleblower warning the public of the very real threat about to be unleashed upon us all.
[02:00:29.602 --> 02:00:39.066]  Known by many as the Mark of the Beast system, Aman explains how accepting the digital ID is the basic premise behind it all.
[02:00:39.066 --> 02:00:45.089]  So by default, a digital identity implies that you are always in a digital prison.
[02:00:46.284 --> 02:00:52.789]  Since you have a digital identity and you're in a prison, you are by default a criminal.
[02:00:52.789 --> 02:00:54.350]  So we don't trust you.
[02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:58.993]  Just like the old system, this new one is also voluntary.
[02:00:58.993 --> 02:01:04.477]  And you are supposed to know that it's a digital prison that you are voluntarily signing up for.
[02:01:04.477 --> 02:01:11.963]  And the reason for this is because in this new system, having a digital ID will be proof that you are a criminal.
[02:01:12.623 --> 02:01:17.286]  Because having a digital ID means that you are in a digital prison.
[02:01:17.286 --> 02:01:21.149]  And because you accepted it, you must be a criminal.
[02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:27.834]  Because of this, there is a new protocol being introduced with this system, known as Zero Trust.
[02:01:27.834 --> 02:01:30.456]  How is Zero Trust going to be used?
[02:01:30.456 --> 02:01:34.118]  Here's a lady, she wants to go and buy some beef.
[02:01:34.118 --> 02:01:40.963]  But let's say her carbon footprint or her beef footprint for the month has been exceeded, that door won't open.
[02:01:41.716 --> 02:01:44.879]  This digital prison is sneaking up on us all.
[02:01:44.879 --> 02:01:54.629]  There is no need for an implanted chip, because everything is being done with facial recognition, which is already plugged into the entire system.
[02:01:54.629 --> 02:02:02.576]  America already has more cameras per capita than Communist China, and our social credit score is already being logged.
[02:02:03.397 --> 02:02:13.352]  All we need at this point is a series of events that lead us all into having to make the choice of either accepting the new digital ID or saying no.
[02:02:14.565 --> 02:02:23.373]  Since the COVID lockdowns, new state-of-the-art LED lights have been replacing street lights in cities throughout the West.
[02:02:23.373 --> 02:02:26.756]  Amman explains that this is all part of the plan.
[02:02:26.756 --> 02:02:32.000]  These lights will be connected to everything, including your phone and your car.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.885]  And in new cars, that includes 16 different cameras with LiDAR and sonar.
[02:02:38.979 --> 02:02:52.569]  These lights are being outfitted with LED incapacitators, which is a light technology that was first announced 15 years ago, back when it caused enough brain damage to make a person sick.
[02:02:52.569 --> 02:02:59.354]  Another strange weapon in the final stages of development is able to mount an all-out barrage on the optic nerve.
[02:02:59.354 --> 02:03:03.898]  The LED incapacitator was developed under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:03:05.396 --> 02:03:25.894]  For the purposes of creating what we call a non-lethal defense system, and this technology consists of a bright set of LED technology, light emitting diodes, that is designed to create a sort of temporary blindness, meaning temporary inability to not be able to see the person who we're trying to protect.
[02:03:27.615 --> 02:03:37.258]  If aggressors caught in its bright pulsating glare don't shield their eyes or turn away quick enough, temporary blindness isn't the only effect they'll feel.
[02:03:37.258 --> 02:03:49.141]  The first time I saw the LED I was in a darkened room and within three or four seconds I had reached forward and grabbed a hold of a lab bench because I was feeling a little bit dizzy or disoriented.
[02:03:49.141 --> 02:03:57.003]  The device's combination of different colors and random flashes can induce psychophysical effects, including vertigo and possible nausea.
[02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:59.845]  It's been nicknamed the puke light.
[02:03:59.845 --> 02:04:08.932]  It's been 15 years and our Silicon Valley whistleblower believes that this technology is now capable of killing people.
[02:04:08.932 --> 02:04:11.534]  Ultimately, we can say no to this.
[02:04:11.534 --> 02:04:18.239]  But if there's a critical mass that doesn't sign on to the digital ID, then this agenda gets weakened substantially.
[02:04:18.239 --> 02:04:22.082]  But we will have to first unify and come together.
[02:04:22.082 --> 02:04:24.424]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:04:29.901 --> 02:04:32.103]  Well, we're trying to get Robert Barnes on the line right now.
[02:04:32.103 --> 02:04:32.884]  He'll probably join us.
[02:04:32.884 --> 02:04:34.826]  Sometimes he doesn't make it.
[02:04:34.826 --> 02:04:39.170]  But regardless, I've got tons of news and phone calls to take.
[02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:41.912]  Obviously, we've got a lot of news in Russia.
[02:04:41.912 --> 02:04:44.374]  The latest of all of us there with Lavrov saying about U.S.
[02:04:44.374 --> 02:04:45.716]  troops being on the ground.
[02:04:45.716 --> 02:04:47.397]  I actually know that's true.
[02:04:47.397 --> 02:04:49.940]  My sources have been talking about that for a long time.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:51.061]  That's coming up.
[02:04:51.061 --> 02:04:55.645]  We're also going to look at the latest with BlackRock and also with the whole crypto situation.
[02:04:58.629 --> 02:05:00.791]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:05:00.791 --> 02:05:02.593]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:05:02.593 --> 02:05:04.655]  This is an information war.
[02:05:04.655 --> 02:05:09.360]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:18.549]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[02:05:18.549 --> 02:05:21.793]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[02:05:22.193 --> 02:05:23.754]  But we can't do it without funding.
[02:05:23.754 --> 02:05:29.458]  And we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.
[02:05:29.458 --> 02:05:33.381]  You can also make straight donations at mfullworldstore.com clicking on the big red banner.
[02:05:33.381 --> 02:05:34.782]  A one-time or recurring.
[02:05:34.782 --> 02:05:36.623]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[02:05:36.623 --> 02:05:37.444]  We're non-violent.
[02:05:37.864 --> 02:05:45.769]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:05:45.769 --> 02:05:48.111]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:05:48.111 --> 02:05:49.952]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:05:49.952 --> 02:05:51.072]  We're going over the top.
[02:05:51.072 --> 02:05:52.593]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:05:52.593 --> 02:05:55.595]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:13.504]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:13.504 --> 02:06:17.106]  All right, Robert Mars is scheduled to be joining us right now.
[02:06:17.106 --> 02:06:22.589]  His internet's having problems, so we're going to just get him on the phone, because that's just as important.
[02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:26.571]  At least we're talking to him, getting all this information and ideas.
[02:06:26.571 --> 02:06:35.056]  I want to talk to him about the vaccine news coming out, about the war in Ukraine, about the legal victory they just had with the Amish farmer they were trying to put in jail, give a $300,000 fine.
[02:06:37.108 --> 02:06:41.371]  We're selling milk and beef that's so healthy and good and doesn't have additives in it.
[02:06:41.371 --> 02:06:47.116]  He's going to be joining us to talk about all that coming up.
[02:06:47.116 --> 02:06:59.526]  Now, I'm very glad that an arrest has been made of a suspect in the Idaho murders of those college students who were stabbed to death.
[02:06:59.526 --> 02:07:02.328]  But at the same time, this story has gotten so much attention
[02:07:03.208 --> 02:07:10.233]  I'd like to see the same type of concern by the public, reportedly gave over 20,000 tips for people dying from the poison shots.
[02:07:10.233 --> 02:07:20.160]  Oh, but the NIH and the UN and the WEF, they created policies to not do autopsies for people dropped dead from the shots.
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:25.884]  So again, more premeditated evil at every level of this.
[02:07:27.026 --> 02:07:36.469]  Idaho murder suspect Brian Christopher Cobinger arrested in killings of four university students.
[02:07:36.469 --> 02:07:43.111]  Suspect 28 now in custody in connection with the deaths of Moscow, Idaho college students.
[02:07:43.111 --> 02:07:45.012]  Authorities have arrested a suspect.
[02:07:45.012 --> 02:07:50.794]  Number 13 murders of four University of Idaho students, a high-ranking law enforcement source told Fox News.
[02:07:52.028 --> 02:07:57.651]  Ryan Christopher Cobinger, 28, was taken into custody by local police and the FBI at 3 a.m.
[02:07:57.651 --> 02:07:59.031]  in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[02:07:59.031 --> 02:08:18.220]  The law enforcement source said Friday, Cobinger, if I'm pronouncing that right, has been held for extradition to Monroe County Court for first-degree murder issued by the Moscow Police Department and the Lata County Prosecutor's Office in connection to the slayings of Ethan Chapman, 20, Zena,
[02:08:22.183 --> 02:08:37.471]  The suspect is a graduate student of Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, according to the college website.
[02:08:37.471 --> 02:08:43.255]  Pullman is a 15-minute drive from the rental home where the four students were stabbed to death.
[02:08:43.255 --> 02:08:47.417]  This is the photo of the supposed individual that
[02:08:48.993 --> 02:08:50.054]  Stabbed him to death.
[02:08:50.054 --> 02:08:55.698]  Now, I don't know if he's guilty, but obviously they think they've got some evidence to say that.
[02:08:55.698 --> 02:08:58.340]  And if they have got the right guy, I say good job to the police.
[02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:04.384]  But, again, why would you want to go kill random strangers with a butcher knife?
[02:09:04.384 --> 02:09:11.169]  A lot of spots you want to inject you with a vaccine that erases your immune system on record.
[02:09:11.169 --> 02:09:13.250]  All the major studies now confirm that.
[02:09:13.250 --> 02:09:15.952]  Because they like to hurt people, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:15.952 --> 02:09:17.013]  That's why.
[02:09:17.013 --> 02:09:18.094]  Did we get Robert Barnes on the phone?
[02:09:21.235 --> 02:09:21.975]  Okay.
[02:09:21.975 --> 02:09:26.658]  Well, I guess he's having some phone problems as well, perhaps.
[02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:31.720]  But we're going to figure that out here in just a moment.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:34.522]  You know, we take Skype and Zoom for granted.
[02:09:34.522 --> 02:09:35.903]  They really are amazing technologies.
[02:09:35.903 --> 02:09:46.028]  But as things get more and more complex, they seem to break down more and more.
[02:09:46.028 --> 02:09:48.549]  Look at this story.
[02:09:48.549 --> 02:09:49.810]  Pop singer M.I.A.
[02:09:52.731 --> 02:09:58.717]  Says the most backlash he's ever gotten is because of her saying Jesus is real.
[02:09:58.717 --> 02:10:07.485]  She came out earlier a month ago and defended me saying why is it Big Pharma killing people with vaccines being censored when I'm being censored?
[02:10:07.485 --> 02:10:07.906]  M.I.A.
[02:10:07.906 --> 02:10:14.552]  is a well-known British rapper and singer who has been no stranger to controversial politics and social issues over the past couple decades.
[02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:23.374]  Well now she's come out and said that she's never seen so many attacks and censorship as when she says that Jesus is real.
[02:10:23.374 --> 02:10:27.457]  That's right folks, the censors want to take everything.
[02:10:27.457 --> 02:10:33.320]  Alright, we have Robert Barnes via telephone, appreciate him coming on, constitutional lawyer, really smart historian.
[02:10:34.545 --> 02:10:48.391]  And he joins us to cover the waterfront, the war in Ukraine escalating, the economy, the whole situation with Sam Bankman freed, all the new Epstein information.
[02:10:48.391 --> 02:10:53.153]  Also, Ray Epps, I covered this in the first hour, just incredible.
[02:10:53.153 --> 02:11:04.057]  They've sealed for 20 years most of the January 6th material, but they did release his transcript of his deposition where he says he orchestrated the operation.
[02:11:04.943 --> 02:11:08.985]  We also have the footage of him doing it, but I guess he didn't want to lie under oath.
[02:11:08.985 --> 02:11:10.746]  Pretty big information.
[02:11:10.746 --> 02:11:18.831]  And also, Amish farmer Amos Miller wins battle in War for Food Freedom in the U.S.
[02:11:18.831 --> 02:11:19.451]  Appeals Court.
[02:11:19.451 --> 02:11:25.195]  Robert Barnes is involved in that case as the lawyer, so that's a big victory as well.
[02:11:25.195 --> 02:11:28.216]  Robert Barnes, what do you want to tackle first?
[02:11:28.216 --> 02:11:30.098]  Well, any of those cases are good.
[02:11:30.098 --> 02:11:32.459]  I mean, I think Amos' case is going to be a
[02:11:33.491 --> 02:11:40.456]  He's the Amish farmer who was covered by Tucker Carlson, who the government is coming after, the U.S.
[02:11:40.456 --> 02:11:51.183]  Department of Agriculture is coming after, to stop him from making food the way his private membership association that buys his food wants it made.
[02:11:52.089 --> 02:11:53.850]  And it raises serious issues.
[02:11:53.850 --> 02:12:09.517]  I mean, basically, it's the government's attempt to usurp control and monopolize control of the food supply to such a degree that they get to determine and dictate what people eat and what people can eat, even against their own informed consent.
[02:12:09.517 --> 02:12:15.880]  So we got a partial settlement of existing issues.
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.161]  That was a good win for him.
[02:12:18.059 --> 02:12:20.261]  And for those that don't know, I'm a big meat eater, so are you.
[02:12:20.261 --> 02:12:21.523]  We get steaks all the time when you're here.
[02:12:21.523 --> 02:12:23.965]  They're making the big meat packers add all these chemicals and sterilants.
[02:12:38.459 --> 02:12:38.679]  Thank you.
[02:12:56.416 --> 02:12:58.979]  Is it that really the future revolution against the globalists?
[02:12:58.979 --> 02:13:14.618]  And expanding on that, if the Hopi tribe back in the 60s won their case to be able to take peyote as part of their religious ceremony that again overrode federal law because Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, prohibiting the first sex thereof, then it goes on to the freedom of the press and the rest of it.
[02:13:15.259 --> 02:13:24.091]  Can't we just form a Christian church and say we believe in Leviticus and the Old Testament, that we're not going to eat tainted food and things that are GMO?
[02:13:24.091 --> 02:13:30.340]  Isn't our religious rights, even though we believe in God, folks, you have that right under the Constitution, isn't that a real chink in their armor?
[02:13:31.956 --> 02:13:32.317]  No doubt.
[02:13:32.317 --> 02:13:34.838]  I mean, really, it's sort of a three-fold set of issues.
[02:13:34.838 --> 02:13:45.026]  First, it violates religious rights, the right to make and grow food the way your religious tradition holds, including that that's very broad under the federal law.
[02:13:45.026 --> 02:13:51.210]  That's a spiritual or conscientious tradition, not just a orthodox religious belief.
[02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:56.674]  And that's part one, is that there's people who make this food in this way and eat this food in this way,
[02:13:57.202 --> 02:14:01.743]  For the prioritized purpose of serving their religious and conscientious beliefs.
[02:14:01.743 --> 02:14:19.868]  Then you have the second aspect of discreet association, for people to be able to associate together for the purposes of whatever it is, political, religious, or otherwise, being able to put into their bodies what they want as part of that bodily autonomy right, which is the same issue that's implicated in the vaccine mandate.
[02:14:20.388 --> 02:14:33.238]  And then third, you have the issue of people who, for medical necessity, people for bodily disability in some cases, need this food made in a certain way that's not the U.S.
[02:14:33.238 --> 02:14:45.767]  Department of Agriculture, that's not the government's way, that's not big slaughterhouses, that's not big commercial corporate big ag, but that it's made in a way that people like Amos Miller make it.
[02:14:45.767 --> 02:14:49.710]  They need it for their bodies to be able to survive because of their medical conditions.
[02:14:50.123 --> 02:14:50.803]  So what the U.S.
[02:14:50.803 --> 02:15:09.915]  Department of Agriculture has been up to has been to discriminate against people based on their medical needs, deny people the right to bodily autonomy, deny people the right to a freedom of association and expression, and, as you note, the right to follow their religious and conscientious beliefs, both in how they make food and how they receive food.
[02:15:09.915 --> 02:15:13.997]  Well, the healthy Indians can take hallucinogens because they've done it for thousands of years.
[02:15:13.997 --> 02:15:16.999]  People should be able to eat good, clean beef and drink good, clean milk.
[02:15:19.105 --> 02:15:19.966]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:15:19.966 --> 02:15:20.806]  That's what this is all about.
[02:15:20.806 --> 02:15:23.428]  And we also know, I mean, look at the Amish community.
[02:15:23.428 --> 02:15:30.974]  The Amish community lives longer on average and has almost every better healthy metric known to man than the communities that surround them.
[02:15:30.974 --> 02:15:37.258]  And the reasonable inference is that's because they determine their own medicine and they determine their own food.
[02:15:37.258 --> 02:15:44.163]  And that they're not injecting every single drug that the government wants to put into our bodies, and they're not taking food the way the government wants it made.
[02:15:44.690 --> 02:15:45.311]  Stay right there.
[02:15:45.311 --> 02:15:46.312]  Stay right there.
[02:15:46.312 --> 02:15:50.135]  Tell us what they did to Amos for those who don't know when we come back.
[02:15:58.598 --> 02:16:01.800]  InfoWars MD is finally here.

[02:17:01.168 --> 02:17:05.190]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.

[02:17:45.313 --> 02:17:45.553]  Thank you.
[02:17:58.826 --> 02:18:03.348]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[02:18:03.348 --> 02:18:07.050]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[02:18:07.050 --> 02:18:17.874]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[02:18:17.874 --> 02:18:19.235]  These products work great for women as well.
[02:18:19.835 --> 02:18:22.236]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[02:18:22.236 --> 02:18:24.717]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.

[02:18:38.864 --> 02:18:40.385]  Don't do it during the day.
[02:18:40.385 --> 02:18:43.407]  1776 testosterone boost.

[02:19:59.939 --> 02:20:05.843]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:19.613]  Robert, for people that don't know about the Amos Miller case, it got a lot of attention, but now you've had a major victory in the case as a lawyer there.
[02:20:19.613 --> 02:20:20.413]  This is a big deal.
[02:20:30.197 --> 02:20:33.898]  They've consolidated things into like five meatpacking systems.
[02:20:33.898 --> 02:20:36.218]  They're harassing any independent groups.
[02:20:36.218 --> 02:20:39.039]  It's just absolutely criminal activity.
[02:20:39.039 --> 02:20:40.379]  But this is a big victory.
[02:20:40.379 --> 02:20:46.560]  Finish up with that and then you wanted to get into the incredibly important developments on the poison shot front.
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:54.722]  You concurred during the break we were talking about the fact there's a mass awakening and politically criminal investigations starting in Europe and the U.S.
[02:20:54.722 --> 02:20:56.662]  led by DeSantis and the Vice President of Germany.
[02:20:57.502 --> 02:20:58.703]  That's just a huge story.
[02:20:58.703 --> 02:21:00.705]  You're right in the middle of those lawsuits as well.
[02:21:00.705 --> 02:21:02.907]  So please continue.
[02:21:02.907 --> 02:21:12.695]  Yeah, so Amos' case is big because the feds were trying to use it as an example to shut down the ability to make food the way people want food made.
[02:21:12.695 --> 02:21:16.818]  What was unique about this case is it was the first case I'm aware of where the U.S.
[02:21:16.818 --> 02:21:19.681]  government sued where nobody was complaining about the food made.
[02:21:20.307 --> 02:21:20.647]  That's right.
[02:21:38.064 --> 02:21:39.225]  I added to it.
[02:21:39.225 --> 02:21:43.548]  I mean, the irony is they were calling his food, quote-unquote, adulterated.
[02:21:43.548 --> 02:21:55.917]  But in fact, his food was being made exactly the way his customers wanted it made under informed consent, which is the laws that were meant to govern food production and food marketing in the United States.
[02:21:55.917 --> 02:22:03.322]  And here, the food that's adulterated, in the views of his customers, is the food the USDA is trying to shove down everybody's throat.
[02:22:03.789 --> 02:22:06.271]  And you can see where this would go, ultimately.
[02:22:06.271 --> 02:22:23.401]  If they could control food supply, if they could shut down Amos Miller's ability to make food the way his customers want it, when he's one of the best at it, when he has zero complaints or concerns by any customer ever, then they could effectively dictate food supply going forward.
[02:22:23.401 --> 02:22:29.906]  And what would happen is they could take the world's largest purchaser of agricultural food, land,
[02:22:30.965 --> 02:22:38.910]  In the past decade or so in the United States of America, one Bill Gates, and make him the determiner of what's safe for us to eat.
[02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:44.454]  And sooner or later they would say, well, really in the name of the environment, it's not safe for you to eat meat anymore.
[02:22:44.454 --> 02:22:48.717]  It's not safe for you to have milk the way you want it made anymore.
[02:22:48.717 --> 02:22:53.040]  You're going to have to get the fake meat that Bill Gates wants you to eat.
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.621]  That's the path they were going on.
[02:22:54.621 --> 02:22:57.002]  And this is all ironic because the U.S.
[02:22:57.002 --> 02:22:59.624]  Department of Agriculture is the legal authority
[02:23:00.054 --> 02:23:03.696]  We're supposed to just be a marketing, labeling authority.
[02:23:03.696 --> 02:23:05.697]  This is why almost everybody who works for the U.S.
[02:23:05.697 --> 02:23:11.260]  Department of Agriculture has absolutely no experience in actual farming or real food.
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:18.885]  They're supposed to be making sure that if I buy a can of beans, it's a can of kidney beans, not a can of corn.
[02:23:18.885 --> 02:23:24.248]  That's what adulterated meant, was that something was in the food that's different than what I thought was there.
[02:23:24.248 --> 02:23:29.411]  It was all about informed consent, making sure the ordinary person got what they wanted
[02:23:29.850 --> 02:23:37.932]  Now they're flipping that on its head by saying, no, we the government dictate and determine what food you can eat and what food you can't eat.
[02:23:37.932 --> 02:23:53.876]  And that's why Amos's ability there is basically right before Christmas, he was scheduled to go to jail with $300,000 and more in fines and penalties and a monetary judgment issued against him and his wife and his farm.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:24:03.107]  That could have led to bankrupting him, taking out his farm, and him sitting in jail while waiting to try to get the money together to get out.
[02:24:03.107 --> 02:24:08.491]  And the government ultimately agreed to a settlement that removed almost all of that.
[02:24:08.491 --> 02:24:17.638]  No $300,000 in fines, no jail, the release of food that had been arrested and seized previously so that he can get it to his people.
[02:24:18.408 --> 02:24:25.689]  And so it was very important on, you know, he not be in jail on Christmas and that we get, you know, keep his farm alive, keep it.
[02:24:25.689 --> 02:24:31.330]  And importantly, that customers and consumers continue to be able to purchase the food they want.
[02:24:31.330 --> 02:24:33.671]  And it's a first big win on the first step.
[02:24:33.671 --> 02:24:44.713]  And the goal is to ultimately make that part of the permanent solution, not just a temporary solution that other people could model, creating what's called a custom exception under the law that everybody could get a custom license.
[02:24:45.273 --> 02:24:45.854]  Good to go.
[02:25:03.157 --> 02:25:03.798]  We're good to go.
[02:25:20.015 --> 02:25:24.056]  Legalizing people making their own liquor, and then now it's the biggest vodka brand in the world.
[02:25:24.056 --> 02:25:26.377]  And I'm not, you know, they're just saying that's the greatest thing ever.
[02:25:26.377 --> 02:25:33.358]  The point is, is that we could do that with beef, we could do that with chicken, we could do that with organic farms, but we've got to get the regulators out of there.
[02:25:33.358 --> 02:25:39.060]  And Bill Gates is coming in heavily trying to bring in regulations to basically ban classical organic farming.
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:41.140]  Now the left's saying organic farming is bad.
[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:44.081]  That's exactly what's happening.
[02:25:44.081 --> 02:25:48.802]  I mean, you see kind of an example of it in what Netanyahu was bragging about the other day, where he was talking about
[02:25:49.286 --> 02:26:05.725]  You know, in Israel, he basically decided to allow the Israelis to be used as guinea pigs in a lab, is his own word, lab experiment for Pfizer, and that he was going to combine it with digital records and that these, you know, this was going to be a chip on every person, that they were going to add genetic history to it.
[02:26:06.258 --> 02:26:13.765]  And ultimately, if you control food supply, you control medicine, you control what goes into a person's body.
[02:26:13.765 --> 02:26:16.988]  At some point, you control the human being itself.
[02:26:16.988 --> 02:26:19.690]  We're all effectively nothing more than chattel.
[02:26:19.690 --> 02:26:24.414]  And that's what the USDA is trying to use the Amos Miller case to achieve.
[02:26:24.414 --> 02:26:27.577]  That's why, you know, it's thanks to all the people that supported Amos.
[02:26:28.118 --> 02:26:32.425]  Uh, that he was able to push back, was able to get competent and capable.
[02:26:32.425 --> 02:26:33.547]  Absolutely.
[02:26:33.547 --> 02:26:35.450]  And now the enemy's on the run.
[02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:40.518]  So the moral of the story is when we take action, we win, we roll over, we die.
[02:26:40.518 --> 02:26:42.421]  What type of person is Amos Miller?
[02:26:42.421 --> 02:26:42.881]  I know they're not...
[02:26:43.382 --> 02:26:44.502]  What type of person is Amos Miller?
[02:27:06.596 --> 02:27:07.296]  A very nice guy.
[02:27:07.296 --> 02:27:07.917]  Very quiet.
[02:27:07.917 --> 02:27:15.099]  I mean, I think one of the reasons he was targeted is because the Amish don't believe in suing anyone and they don't believe in publicity.
[02:27:15.099 --> 02:27:18.441]  And so the government thought this will be a great double win.
[02:27:18.441 --> 02:27:28.525]  We get a high-profile farmer, we get to take out and send a message to everybody, and we have someone who's not going to fight back because he's Amish and doesn't believe in fighting back legally or fighting back legally.
[02:27:28.525 --> 02:27:29.485]  And how did you convince him?
[02:27:29.485 --> 02:27:30.866]  How did you and others convince him to do that?
[02:27:32.390 --> 02:27:35.674]  Because it was the future of his farm and the future of his family that was at stake.
[02:27:35.674 --> 02:27:37.376]  So they absolutely cornered him.
[02:27:37.376 --> 02:27:39.118]  He had no other choice.
[02:27:39.118 --> 02:27:39.919]  That's exactly right.
[02:27:39.919 --> 02:27:52.633]  I think ultimately they made a mistake in that regard, that putting him into the corner forced him and the community to come to terms that this was really an existential threat to the Amish way of life.
[02:27:53.263 --> 02:28:01.825]  And ultimately an existential threat to all of us and our ability to eat food the way we want to, to control our own bodies and not have the government dictate it to us.
[02:28:01.825 --> 02:28:03.106]  He's a sweetheart of a guy.
[02:28:03.106 --> 02:28:06.927]  Quiet guy, short guy, you know, soft-spoken.
[02:28:06.927 --> 02:28:11.128]  You know, just a sweetie who's baffled by all of it.
[02:28:11.128 --> 02:28:19.070]  Like, I'm just trying to make food the way we've always made food, the way everybody needs it made, the way some people will live or die based on their ability to get access to it.
[02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:21.891]  Why am I having to deal with all this craziness from the government?
[02:28:22.759 --> 02:28:27.060]  Well he's in trouble because he's so successful and if this takes off, it's game over New World Order.
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:29.961]  Precisely, precisely.
[02:28:29.961 --> 02:28:32.043]  He just kind of stumbled into it.
[02:28:32.043 --> 02:28:33.284]  He wasn't out to change the world.
[02:28:33.284 --> 02:28:39.329]  He was just out to get people the food they needed and make it the way his community has always made it.
[02:28:39.329 --> 02:28:50.199]  But in the process, he stepped right in the middle of a key obstacle to the system being able to co-opt and control the food supply the way they were aiming to.
[02:28:50.199 --> 02:28:50.859]  Alright, stay there.
[02:28:50.859 --> 02:28:54.802]  You've got, again, just huge news on the poison shot front.
[02:28:54.802 --> 02:28:55.523]  Very good news.
[02:28:55.523 --> 02:28:55.923]  Straight ahead.
[02:28:55.923 --> 02:28:56.304]  Stay with us.
[02:28:58.021 --> 02:29:00.063]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:29:00.063 --> 02:29:01.864]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:29:01.864 --> 02:29:03.926]  This is an information war.
[02:29:03.926 --> 02:29:08.610]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:29:08.610 --> 02:29:15.096]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[02:29:15.556 --> 02:29:16.297]  We're good to go.
[02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:45.034]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:29:45.034 --> 02:29:47.355]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:29:47.355 --> 02:29:49.196]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:29:49.196 --> 02:29:50.337]  We're going over the top.
[02:29:50.337 --> 02:29:51.838]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:29:51.838 --> 02:29:54.879]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[02:29:58.206 --> 02:30:07.393]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[02:30:07.393 --> 02:30:16.540]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:30:17.060 --> 02:30:24.346]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owner's a fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[02:30:24.346 --> 02:30:29.130]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[02:30:29.130 --> 02:30:30.692]  And not just under one name.
[02:30:30.692 --> 02:30:36.176]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:30:36.176 --> 02:30:40.260]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:42.561]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[02:30:42.561 --> 02:30:45.242]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[02:30:45.242 --> 02:30:48.103]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[02:30:48.103 --> 02:30:49.903]  These things are incredible.
[02:30:49.903 --> 02:30:55.825]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.

[02:31:17.181 --> 02:31:23.485]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.

[02:31:26.607 --> 02:31:30.569]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.

[02:31:57.766 --> 02:32:09.249]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:32:09.249 --> 02:32:13.710]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:17.671]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:32:17.671 --> 02:32:22.112]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:32:22.112 --> 02:32:23.172]  You see, the sun
[02:32:23.912 --> 02:32:24.232]  We're good.
[02:32:47.771 --> 02:32:48.711]  Coming at you live!
[02:32:48.711 --> 02:32:50.112]  Fifty thousand and a stop of the life!
[02:33:18.084 --> 02:33:27.294]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.294 --> 02:33:34.722]  Folks don't know that there's different types of milk that come out of cows, and the ones they've bred for general milk consumption don't have the best protein.
[02:33:34.722 --> 02:33:39.587]  I get this great A2 Jersey cow, brown cow milk.
[02:33:39.587 --> 02:33:40.308]  It's like candy.
[02:33:41.203 --> 02:33:43.025]  I mean, it's better than a piece of chocolate cake, folks.
[02:33:43.025 --> 02:33:43.806]  It's just pure milk.
[02:33:43.806 --> 02:33:46.549]  And what it does for your guts, everything else.
[02:33:46.549 --> 02:33:48.851]  Children that drink it just look like angels.
[02:33:48.851 --> 02:33:51.294]  And that's what the Amish knew before there was any, quote, science.
[02:33:51.294 --> 02:33:53.536]  If that was the right milk, that was the right cow.
[02:33:53.536 --> 02:33:55.358]  And that's what Amos Miller has.
[02:33:55.358 --> 02:33:58.782]  That's what I get from outside Austin, Texas in Lockhart.
[02:33:58.782 --> 02:33:59.783]  The crew gets it.
[02:33:59.783 --> 02:34:01.305]  We get it shipped in here.
[02:34:01.305 --> 02:34:03.067]  And they like to put the folks making that in jail.
[02:34:04.366 --> 02:34:07.088]  These people are sick and they're evil.
[02:34:07.088 --> 02:34:12.531]  And so finishing up with Amos Miller, it's all about control of our bodies.
[02:34:12.531 --> 02:34:26.360]  And if you know what they're doing to the meat now, spraying viral sprays on them, antibacterial viruses that then get into your gut and all these weird chemicals and sterilants so they can sell you rotten meat.
[02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:27.921]  I don't know.
[02:34:49.875 --> 02:34:51.796]  The Amish are fascinating folks.
[02:34:51.796 --> 02:34:56.977]  400 plus years ago in Switzerland and Germany, you had these Protestant groups being persecuted.
[02:34:56.977 --> 02:35:03.539]  So they sold their land, they got on ships, they came to the United States, Canada, and South America.
[02:35:03.539 --> 02:35:07.820]  And my dad's volunteered for medical stuff down in South America, he talks about it.
[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:12.782]  And you'll be in the middle of nowhere, you know, crime, starving people, total hell.
[02:35:12.782 --> 02:35:18.944]  Then you hit another area, everything's clean, everything's nice, everybody's happy, and the surrounding groups are empowered by the Amish.
[02:35:19.833 --> 02:35:25.257]  And the Amish have never gotten politically involved, but now they're being so cornered after 400 years of having to do it.
[02:35:25.257 --> 02:35:27.818]  I'm telling you, what the Amish are doing is going to be the future.
[02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:35.884]  I'm not anti-technology, but the way it's been deployed, the way it's controlled, the whole Margaret the Beast, the Amish and folks like that are going to be the last people standing.
[02:35:35.884 --> 02:35:42.888]  Robert Barnes, closing comments on that subject and the great case that you have had a big victory up front on, and then I want to shift gears into
[02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:52.827]  The 35,000 foot view we're talking about off air about the Big Awakening and what the globals are going to do now that it's all coming out, criminal investigations in Italy and Germany and...
[02:35:53.891 --> 02:35:54.311]  We're good to go.
[02:36:21.983 --> 02:36:34.108]  Yeah, I think the cases like the Amos Miller case, cases like what's going on with the vaccines, cases like what's going on with the lockdown, cases like what's going on around the globe, and the Biden administration have woke up a lot of people that were otherwise asleep.
[02:36:35.746 --> 02:36:38.228]  And the in ways that they I don't think anticipated.
[02:36:38.228 --> 02:36:54.179]  I think the anticipation was that this would help march onward, that people would accept lockdowns, that people would embrace the vaccines, that people would basically defer even further to the government's desire to complete control.
[02:36:54.179 --> 02:36:57.161]  You know, it's a lot like, well, you just listen to Netanyahu
[02:36:57.868 --> 02:37:07.955]  Uh, you know, statements that he's made recently about how wonderful all of this is to treat people like lab rats, uh, for the purposes of massive control.
[02:37:07.955 --> 02:37:16.300]  And I get if you're in a society or culture like Israel, it's a very unique under constant threat mindset, but we don't need that for the rest of the world.
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:18.822]  And more and more Americans are waking up to that reality.
[02:37:19.252 --> 02:37:24.654]  Challenging and contesting and questioning things that they had long since forgot to question and contest.
[02:37:24.654 --> 02:37:25.714]  Like, why does the U.S.
[02:37:25.714 --> 02:37:29.335]  Department of Agriculture get to determine and dictate what food I get to eat?
[02:37:29.335 --> 02:37:31.296]  That's not really their business.
[02:37:31.296 --> 02:37:38.178]  Why is the FDA overruling doctors and pharmacists and others about what's good for me medically?
[02:37:38.178 --> 02:37:44.860]  Why is it we're getting forced into taking a drug that we don't need and don't want for emergency that doesn't exist?
[02:37:45.726 --> 02:37:54.373]  And so the enforcing kids and foster kids and others to be some of the unwilling and unwitting recipients of these drugs.
[02:37:54.373 --> 02:37:58.996]  So the very big win for Amos Miller at the outset of the case.
[02:37:58.996 --> 02:38:03.380]  So he's not serving jail time, doesn't lose the farm, has a chance to fight onward.
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:09.144]  The same as we have two cases pending, one with Children's Health Defense against FDA pending in Waco, Texas.
[02:38:09.668 --> 02:38:24.419]  About whether or not they get to try to, does the FBI get, the FDA get to lie to children in order to be able to force a unwanted, dangerous drug that they call safe, effective, and a vaccine that's neither safe, effective, nor a vaccine.
[02:38:24.419 --> 02:38:25.479]  That's right, let's be clear.
[02:38:25.479 --> 02:38:26.100]  Explain it to them.
[02:38:26.100 --> 02:38:29.822]  In all the other drug ads, they've got to tell you at least some of the side effects.
[02:38:29.822 --> 02:38:36.287]  But in the Elmo shows and the TV programs targeting children, they say it's safe, it's wonderful, you'll die if you don't get it, Santa Claus says take it.
[02:38:36.287 --> 02:38:37.308]  That is illegal as hell.
[02:38:38.735 --> 02:38:39.956]  Completely.
[02:38:39.956 --> 02:38:48.279]  If a private company was doing a lot of what has been done for any other drug, they would be criminally prosecuted.
[02:38:48.279 --> 02:38:53.041]  And yet, you have the biggest criminal drug dealer in the history of man, and that is the Pfizer Corporation.
[02:38:53.041 --> 02:38:56.202]  They've been more criminally fined than any drug company in history.
[02:38:56.202 --> 02:39:01.004]  They make any cartel look like a low-level, street-corner drug dealer by comparison.
[02:39:01.365 --> 02:39:11.569]  The number of people they've disabled, the number of people they've killed, the number of people their product has harmed far exceeds what they could possibly even think of doing with fentanyl in the Mexican drug cartels.
[02:39:11.569 --> 02:39:26.634]  And this is Pfizer, the same Pfizer that is the primary principal beneficiary of the largest connected to the vaccine that relates to the Brooke Jackson case and the case with Bobby Kennedy and I brought on behalf of Children's Health Defense against FDA in Waco.
[02:39:26.634 --> 02:39:30.315]  One case is for Brooke Jackson in Beaumont, Texas on behalf of the American people.
[02:39:30.751 --> 02:39:32.812]  Waiting on a judge to make a ruling there.
[02:39:32.812 --> 02:39:35.734]  Same with waiting on a judge to make a ruling in Waco, Texas.
[02:39:35.734 --> 02:39:39.756]  But both cases have helped waken up people.
[02:39:39.756 --> 02:39:43.419]  So that more people are realizing that you cannot trust the FDA.
[02:39:43.419 --> 02:39:45.280]  The FDA is supposed to be in the labeling business.
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:46.481]  They're not in the pharmacy business.
[02:39:46.481 --> 02:39:48.021]  They're not in the medicine business.
[02:39:48.021 --> 02:39:49.783]  That's a local state prerogative.
[02:39:49.783 --> 02:39:51.604]  That's not a federal prerogative.
[02:39:51.604 --> 02:39:53.805]  That they have no business telling us what medicine
[02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:55.451]  And Robert is standing on that.
[02:40:10.365 --> 02:40:17.912]  Six months ago, Robert Murlow, Pfizer, and Bill Gates, and Klaus Schwab are all, we've got to shut down, we've got to arrest, we've got to censor.
[02:40:17.912 --> 02:40:20.034]  But that didn't work, now the dam's broken.
[02:40:20.034 --> 02:40:26.941]  What do you expect these Joseph Mingala 2.0s to do now that they've been caught red-handed?
[02:40:26.941 --> 02:40:35.349]  I think what they're banking on is that nobody in a position of power will do anything about it, even though the criticism is mounting from the ordinary people in the public.
[02:40:35.788 --> 02:40:48.850]  There's more people, as of a recent survey done by Kaiser, which showed that, in fact, the number of people who question vaccines for children, including other vaccines, has now gone up tenfold.
[02:40:48.850 --> 02:40:53.971]  It went from about 2 to 5 percent of the public, to 20 to as high as 50 percent of the public.
[02:40:53.971 --> 02:40:58.612]  You see that... And regular vaccine uptake has gone way down, exactly.
[02:40:58.612 --> 02:41:02.753]  So it's fair to say this has blown up in their face, sky high.
[02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:03.733]  Completely.
[02:41:03.733 --> 02:41:05.253]  You see that in the uptake rate.
[02:41:05.632 --> 02:41:09.153]  You see that so few people are getting, continuing to get the boosters.
[02:41:09.153 --> 02:41:11.553]  So few people are having their young children get it.
[02:41:11.553 --> 02:41:12.194]  They know it!
[02:41:12.194 --> 02:41:12.994]  And what do they know?
[02:41:12.994 --> 02:41:14.634]  They know from their lived experience.
[02:41:14.634 --> 02:41:26.697]  That despite all of the manipulation of the gatekeepers, like what the Twitter files have revealed, despite all of the efforts of allowing massive lies by the government, massive lies by Pfizer, and Pfizer was running
[02:41:27.139 --> 02:41:52.752]  And Moderna are running TV ads telling little kids they'll be superheroes if they take this drug, this dangerous drug that's killing and disabling people, that is more and more people, not just the Robert Malone's and others and Peter McCullough's, but more and more doctors, prominent doctors, prominent scientists are coming out and saying we should put an immediate halt to this vaccine now because it's becoming increasingly clear it causes more harm than it cures.
[02:41:53.572 --> 02:41:55.615]  And that's what ordinary people are realizing.
[02:41:55.615 --> 02:42:07.955]  And so all they're banking on at this point, the Pfizer's or their corrupt secret deals with various governments around the world, and they're banking on courts not wanting, not having the courage to take on these big corrupt corporations.
[02:42:08.599 --> 02:42:23.869]  They're expecting federal courts to just continue, many of whom have been very pro-vaccine, unfortunately, many of whom have been very pro-lockdowns or late to the party in terms of turning back the constitutional clock on what these illicit activities were.
[02:42:23.869 --> 02:42:31.134]  That's the only thing they have going for them, is they have a lot of political power, a lot of friends in Congress, a lot of friends in the Biden White House.
[02:42:31.134 --> 02:42:34.076]  That's it, because they're losing to the court of public opinion.
[02:42:34.076 --> 02:42:37.238]  And sooner or later, that will translate to public officials making a difference.
[02:42:37.418 --> 02:42:45.765]  Alright, I want to come back in the final segment with Robert Barnes and wish him a great Christmas and a happy New Year and I'll go some into the fourth hour with other news we haven't gotten to that a guest host takes over.
[02:42:45.765 --> 02:42:48.528]  But I want to shift gears into the Twitter files and what's coming next.
[02:42:48.528 --> 02:42:50.149]  There's people saying it's a nothing burger.
[02:42:50.149 --> 02:42:51.210]  Haven't been reading what's in them.
[02:42:51.210 --> 02:42:54.813]  It is the blueprint of everything we warned about confirmed.
[02:42:54.813 --> 02:42:56.455]  Absolute criminal deep state activity.
[02:42:58.297 --> 02:43:00.338]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:43:00.338 --> 02:43:02.139]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:43:02.139 --> 02:43:04.200]  This is an information war.
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:08.883]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:43:08.883 --> 02:43:15.366]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor Sanders, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[02:43:15.826 --> 02:43:16.587]  We're good to go.
[02:43:37.401 --> 02:43:45.330]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:43:45.330 --> 02:43:47.652]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:43:47.652 --> 02:43:49.494]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:43:49.494 --> 02:43:50.615]  We're going over the top.
[02:43:50.615 --> 02:43:52.137]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:43:52.137 --> 02:43:55.160]  So please go to InfoWareStore.com and donate now.
[02:43:58.061 --> 02:44:01.404]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[02:44:01.404 --> 02:44:04.226]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[02:44:04.226 --> 02:44:06.828]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[02:44:06.828 --> 02:44:08.229]  I'm going to do that right now.
[02:44:08.229 --> 02:44:12.152]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[02:44:12.152 --> 02:44:17.336]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:44:17.336 --> 02:44:23.521]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[02:44:23.521 --> 02:44:25.023]  I've been given so many opportunities.
[02:44:26.651 --> 02:44:33.554]  Because of this man and because of this platform and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:44:33.554 --> 02:44:40.957]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[02:44:40.957 --> 02:44:46.299]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[02:44:46.539 --> 02:44:49.040]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:51.700]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:53.201]  So go check out the store.

[02:44:58.822 --> 02:45:04.104]  I want you to remember two words.

[02:46:54.349 --> 02:47:00.791]  M4 Wars MD at m4warsstore.com.
[02:47:00.791 --> 02:47:06.713]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.273 --> 02:47:20.234]  And we are back with Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[02:47:20.234 --> 02:47:21.274]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.274 --> 02:47:28.536]  So Robert, looking at the Twitter files, we're up to like 17 drops or so now.
[02:47:28.536 --> 02:47:38.759]  This proves illegal coordination with government spy agencies, manipulating elections, blocking people criticizing the Afghan withdrawal, people questioning
[02:47:40.811 --> 02:47:50.337]  Anything basically, particularly though, the COVID narrative from day one, even when Trump was in office, this whole shadow government that Obama put in that's now getting so much attention.
[02:47:51.308 --> 02:48:01.496]  And that Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act that Obama signed into law, that Congressman Lew and others said didn't exist, but now it's out in the open.
[02:48:01.496 --> 02:48:03.057]  This has got to really concern them.
[02:48:03.057 --> 02:48:07.180]  And Musk has come out now, and so has Devin Nunes, and said what we all know.
[02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:08.781]  Twitter was just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:48:08.781 --> 02:48:13.044]  All the other big tech were doing this, in other cases, at an even more intense level.
[02:48:13.044 --> 02:48:14.446]  So this is government coordination.
[02:48:15.126 --> 02:48:24.851]  To manipulate elections, to block people exposing open borders, to block people, medical doctors and scientists and Nobel Prize winners from speaking out.
[02:48:24.851 --> 02:48:28.953]  I mean, this was an organized suppression of the people for this globalist agenda.
[02:48:28.953 --> 02:48:31.834]  And the good news is, is it appears it hasn't worked.
[02:48:31.834 --> 02:48:32.955]  It's backfired.
[02:48:32.955 --> 02:48:34.516]  So I just keep wondering what they're going to do next.
[02:48:34.516 --> 02:48:41.139]  I mean, yeah, I mean, credit Elon Musk for exposing all of that to probably some risk to himself personally.
[02:48:41.914 --> 02:48:52.658]  Financially going forward, because it's not just what we kind of knew was happening in terms of Fauci's people and other people putting pressure on social media to conform.
[02:48:52.658 --> 02:49:04.803]  It was the FBI and the CIA and the Pentagon all neck deep in this, trying to suppress any degree of independent dissident speech on any matter that questioned any deep state agenda.
[02:49:04.803 --> 02:49:10.625]  I mean, to the degree they were... And this should be a reminder to everybody out there how significant their own independent voice is.
[02:49:11.161 --> 02:49:13.546]  That a lot of the focus was on very small accounts.
[02:49:14.212 --> 02:49:23.798]  So the people that think, ah, I only have, you know, 50 followers, I only impact four people, and so forth, what this shows is the government has a very different evaluation.
[02:49:23.798 --> 02:49:42.389]  The government thinks that those little folks that are out there sharing the links to places like InfoWars, that are out there sharing the information, sharing the stories, sharing the articles, sharing the data, that in fact the government recognizes those people have extraordinary influence that often is more influential than the so-called big accounts.
[02:49:42.867 --> 02:49:49.118]  Many of whom were just followed by bots in the case of institutional media and didn't have any authentic and organic support.
[02:49:49.591 --> 02:49:59.855]  So it's another example of how the government was hyper aware that just the ordinary person getting out a message can actually make a big, big difference in the long haul.
[02:49:59.855 --> 02:50:00.155]  I agree.
[02:50:00.155 --> 02:50:01.156]  And what needs to be done?
[02:50:01.156 --> 02:50:03.056]  They're talking about a new Frank Church committee.
[02:50:03.056 --> 02:50:04.957]  You've been calling for that for years.
[02:50:04.957 --> 02:50:11.040]  But even Jim Jordan, who we know is on the payroll of Google, he's not totally bad, but he's compromised.
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:12.540]  He's talking about maybe having one.
[02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:14.501]  I mean, we need immediate action on this.
[02:50:15.695 --> 02:50:16.115]  Absolutely.
[02:50:16.115 --> 02:50:20.938]  We have to have another church committee that goes full scale and looks at everything.
[02:50:20.938 --> 02:50:32.503]  That looks at everything related to bioweapons research, that looks at everything related to foreign policy and interventions in countries where we shouldn't be, that looks at what everything the Federal Reserve is doing.
[02:50:32.503 --> 02:50:38.466]  I have a suit coming on behalf of George Gammon against the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve refused to produce any
[02:50:38.871 --> 02:50:39.311]  We're good to go.
[02:51:03.701 --> 02:51:12.872]  Uh, they have no means to even locate the documents because supposedly they haven't digitized them, haven't archived them, and have no search mechanisms available to search by keyword.
[02:51:13.277 --> 02:51:21.739]  Clearly they're just lying about this, but that means that there's very damning documents in those files, and that's part of this broader story of what the Twitter files reveal.
[02:51:21.739 --> 02:51:39.983]  There was suppression of ordinary, everyday individuals, and I think the remedy is outing all of this to the Court of Public Opinion and definitely using a church committee to look at everything that the Fed has been up to, the State Department, the CIA, the big tech censorship, the manipulation of elections, expose it all just like the church
[02:51:40.363 --> 02:51:47.886]  That's right, and the Republicans can also use an impeachment of Biden as a mechanism as a de facto church committee.
[02:51:47.886 --> 02:51:51.687]  Absolutely, and also look at impeaching some of these corrupt cabinet officials.
[02:51:51.687 --> 02:52:07.532]  You know, impeach the head of the Department of Human and Health Services that has allowed the border to be sort of wide open and also not done any control whatsoever in terms of bioweapons research as it relates to COVID, as it relates to the vaccine, as it relates to the FDA, the USDA, and the
[02:52:10.223 --> 02:52:11.744]  Well, that's right.
[02:52:11.744 --> 02:52:12.525]  That's right.
[02:52:12.525 --> 02:52:19.129]  The bureaucrats thought they had the regulatory system, the intelligence agencies, the censorship, big tech, and the media, and they went for broke.
[02:52:19.129 --> 02:52:19.649]  And now,
[02:52:39.930 --> 02:52:43.952]  It is destroying them.
[02:52:43.952 --> 02:52:49.153]  How do they, again he won't ask this question, how do they strike back?
[02:52:49.153 --> 02:52:51.374]  Oh, I think they're going to continue to escalate.
[02:52:51.374 --> 02:52:57.517]  I think you're going to see, you see constant money being, you know, funneled into Ukraine.
[02:52:57.517 --> 02:53:03.899]  Next up will be probably someplace in Africa, some other proxy war that we can stick our nose into and cause issues and problems.
[02:53:04.603 --> 02:53:21.231]  Uh, you see what they did in Brazil and getting Lula elected, you know, getting the Brazilian Supreme Court to release him from prison and then shut down Bolsonaro's election challenge and now threaten Bolsonaro with fines and sanctions and all the rest if he continues to contest what took place in the election there.
[02:53:21.701 --> 02:53:27.263]  So I think you're going to see escalation of all of those, of their tools of power.
[02:53:27.263 --> 02:53:38.446]  And so it's going to be a continued battle, but it's a battle that they've been losing, really, for several years, at least in the court of public opinion, and now it might start showing up in the courts of Congress and the courts of law.
[02:53:38.446 --> 02:53:38.846]  That's right.
[02:53:38.846 --> 02:53:44.428]  Their only ace in the hole is election fraud, but that only wakes people up faster.
[02:53:44.428 --> 02:53:50.690]  What are you seeing with DeSantis and Trump and, obviously, the presidential campaign basically starting now?
[02:53:52.014 --> 02:53:54.415]  Yeah, I don't see DeSantis challenging Trump.
[02:53:54.415 --> 02:53:58.458]  I still believe there will be a Trump-DeSantis ticket because that's what makes the most sense for 2024.
[02:53:58.458 --> 02:54:03.461]  How do they do that if they're both from Florida?
[02:54:03.461 --> 02:54:04.701]  Oh, it's easy.
[02:54:04.701 --> 02:54:07.603]  Before the Electoral College votes, one of them registers elsewhere.
[02:54:07.603 --> 02:54:10.725]  It's what happened when Bush and Cheney were elected in 2000.
[02:54:10.725 --> 02:54:12.226]  Cheney was the vice president.
[02:54:12.226 --> 02:54:15.508]  He then, at that point, lived in Texas because he was at Halliburton.
[02:54:15.508 --> 02:54:19.630]  He just changed his voter registration to Wyoming before the Electoral College actually voted.
[02:54:20.382 --> 02:54:21.723]  I don't know.
[02:54:34.443 --> 02:54:46.106]  I think if Carrie Lake had won or been declared the winner, I think she probably did win, but had she been declared the winner in Arizona, she would have been, I think, a competitor for that vice-presidential position.
[02:54:46.106 --> 02:54:50.627]  But I still think they make a lot more sense together than they make sense competing with one another.
[02:54:50.627 --> 02:54:54.128]  And I don't think DeSantis has any interest whatsoever in challenging him.
[02:54:55.990 --> 02:55:04.635]  Steve States doesn't want either one of them to win, so they're trying to set up a conflict between the two of them to take both of them out because they already have Pompeo.
[02:55:08.347 --> 02:55:12.209]  I agree with you.
[02:55:12.209 --> 02:55:14.250]  So let's hit this in closing.
[02:55:14.250 --> 02:55:26.017]  Berlin Rossin, a huge PR firm out of New York that does the UN's PR, bragged after the latest rig ruling against me in Connecticut that they had basically brought the Sandy Hook story up
[02:55:26.577 --> 02:55:29.660]  Well, I think it shows what we were talking about from the get-go, that it wasn't a coincidence
[02:55:49.758 --> 02:55:49.998]  I'm good.
[02:56:06.869 --> 02:56:07.109]  All right.
[02:56:25.739 --> 02:56:27.900]  Improving people's understanding of the world.
[02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.991]  That's who ran this.
[02:56:47.991 --> 02:56:49.112]  That's who fixed the trials.
[02:56:49.112 --> 02:56:50.233]  That's who rigged it with the media.
[02:56:50.233 --> 02:56:54.178]  The whole thing was completely rigged, and so I'm very proud to be attacked by this whole thing.
[02:56:54.178 --> 02:56:56.120]  Please remember, we're doing a fundraiser right now.
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:00.585]  We need to raise $200,000-plus to be able to continue on next month.
[02:57:00.585 --> 02:57:01.246]  Sounds like a lot.
[02:57:01.246 --> 02:57:02.908]  It's not, with our server costs over $200,000 a month itself.
[02:57:04.269 --> 02:57:05.370]  That's how popular we are.
[02:57:05.370 --> 02:57:06.932]  So we're victims of our own success.
[02:57:06.932 --> 02:57:08.714]  So thank you for sponsoring us as listeners.
[02:57:08.714 --> 02:57:10.075]  Thanks for keeping us on air.

[02:58:41.654 --> 02:58:44.395]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[02:58:48.317 --> 02:58:57.722]  Introducing InfoWars super high-end supplement line at up to 50% off what these same formulas are sold for in stores.
[02:58:57.722 --> 02:59:02.025]  It's InfoWars MD, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:59:17.914 --> 02:59:18.654]  We're good to go.
[02:59:49.764 --> 02:59:55.671]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.007 --> 03:00:12.969]  Bob, we know that the platforming of InfoWars, it's now been declassified, it's come out, was run by U.S.
[03:00:12.969 --> 03:00:14.350]  intelligence agencies.
[03:00:14.350 --> 03:00:15.390]  That's in all the Twitter files.
[03:00:15.390 --> 03:00:17.891]  And I was the beta test to perfect it.
[03:00:17.891 --> 03:00:23.514]  And now, picking certain judges they control, rigging things, defaulting people, having show trials.
[03:00:24.194 --> 03:00:28.538]  They admit that they bragged on MSNBC, CNN, the New York Times.
[03:00:28.538 --> 03:00:30.119]  That's their model to get everybody else.
[03:00:30.119 --> 03:00:31.480]  That's what people don't understand.
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:36.584]  Infowars is so important and I quite frankly am pleased that we've been singled out.
[03:00:36.584 --> 03:00:39.026]  It means we're some of the most effective groups out there.
[03:00:39.026 --> 03:00:46.572]  But in closing, finish up with what you saw in the trials you covered and watched and you worked on the case earlier and what you think the real lesson is from that.
[03:00:48.015 --> 03:00:53.038]  Well, I think it was a coordinated hit job that was intended to have multiple layers of objectives.
[03:00:53.038 --> 03:01:10.109]  One was to set an example that they could use to basically de-platform and completely bar and censor in a country that celebrates freedom of press, freedom of speech, and freedom of association, that none of those would be in practical, functional existence due to their monopolistic control of the digital public square.
[03:01:10.709 --> 03:01:20.156]  And the manipulation of the legal system for weaponized lawfare that went beyond what the Constitution permitted, but which sadly, courts took and turned a blind eye to.
[03:01:20.156 --> 03:01:38.449]  So that if they could use this kind of weaponized lawfare to achieve a multiple objective of not only bankrupting a political competitor in the court of public opinion, but also silencing, censoring that network on every mechanism of the digital public square that existed, whether it was Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook,
[03:01:39.125 --> 03:01:39.465]  I don't
[03:01:53.988 --> 03:01:54.488]  We're good to go.
[03:02:19.529 --> 03:02:43.457]  That led the first protest against the lockdown, that led the first exposures of Bill Gates complicity in what was taking place in Event 201 and everything else related to the COVID policy, that led to the exposure of the Chinese social credit system being imported in the United States through central bank digital currency programs the Fed is trying to launch, that led the efforts to expose what's really happening with the COVID vaccines and how they're dangerous and threatening.
[03:02:43.457 --> 03:02:45.418]  I mean, who knows how many lives
[03:02:46.113 --> 03:02:46.714]  I'm good to go.
[03:03:06.704 --> 03:03:14.908]  To silence, censor, and shame this independent information from challenging and contesting the corrupted institutional narrative was unsuccessful.
[03:03:14.908 --> 03:03:24.573]  Unsuccessful to such a degree they've increased the number of people skeptical of what the government is doing by a tenfold ratio all across the nation and increasingly around the globe.
[03:03:24.573 --> 03:03:30.676]  So credit to the InfoWars audience that kept InfoWars on the air by going to infowarsstore.com and supporting it.
[03:03:31.096 --> 03:03:31.356]  Absolutely.
[03:03:57.415 --> 03:03:58.876]  It's satisfying.
[03:03:58.876 --> 03:04:07.759]  We've been through hell together, but this audience, our guests, you, myself, the whole crew, but we've seen such incredible payoffs in fighting the New World Order.
[03:04:07.759 --> 03:04:12.141]  It just makes me proud to be in this fight and very thankful to the listeners for keeping us in the fight.
[03:04:12.141 --> 03:04:19.944]  We can only stay in the fight with their support at InfoWarsTour.com and continuing to direct people to InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:04:19.944 --> 03:04:21.645]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[03:04:21.645 --> 03:04:23.706]  I'll talk to you next year.
[03:04:23.706 --> 03:04:25.827]  Be safe, and I can't wait to see you back in studio with us.
[03:04:26.969 --> 03:04:28.309]  Absolutely.
[03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:29.449]  There you go.
[03:04:29.449 --> 03:04:29.830]  All right.
[03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:31.630]  I got a few stories that just broke.
[03:04:31.630 --> 03:04:36.531]  I want to hit when we come back, then I'm going to turn it over to Jay Dyer.
[03:04:36.531 --> 03:04:47.012]  Great author, great researcher, gives you their actual quotes and the source documents of the New World Order plan that plans on having all of us dead if they succeed.
[03:04:47.012 --> 03:04:51.113]  So, couldn't be covering a more important central subject straight ahead.
[03:04:51.113 --> 03:04:54.974]  Fan.video, InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:04:54.974 --> 03:04:55.474]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:03.243]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[03:05:03.243 --> 03:05:06.946]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[03:05:06.946 --> 03:05:17.775]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[03:05:17.775 --> 03:05:19.116]  These products work great for women as well.
[03:05:19.716 --> 03:05:22.117]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[03:05:22.117 --> 03:05:24.598]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[03:05:24.598 --> 03:05:30.421]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.

[03:05:33.962 --> 03:05:35.463]  Be very safe with it.
[03:05:35.463 --> 03:05:38.765]  Take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[03:05:38.765 --> 03:05:40.285]  Don't do it during the day.
[03:05:40.285 --> 03:05:43.287]  1776 testosterone boost.
[03:05:43.287 --> 03:05:44.367]  Totally incredible.
[03:05:44.367 --> 03:05:45.288]  Go read about them.
[03:05:45.288 --> 03:05:46.068]  Learn more about them.
[03:05:46.428 --> 03:05:51.350]  At InfoWarsStore.com in the InfoWars Platinum section.

[03:06:00.054 --> 03:06:03.636]  Of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.356 --> 03:06:18.323]  All right, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, great author, researcher, is about to take over, but some new news just broke in the last 10-15 minutes at InfoWars.com, and we're going to share it with you right now.
[03:06:18.323 --> 03:06:20.685]  Hope you share it with others.
[03:06:20.685 --> 03:06:26.368]  Bohemian Grove frequently asks country singer John Rich to attend.
[03:06:26.368 --> 03:06:31.052]  He says, hell no, John Rich isn't going to platinum top country singer.
[03:06:31.052 --> 03:06:33.033]  Big and rich singer John Rich
[03:06:33.911 --> 03:06:44.296]  Posted to True Social yesterday to reveal he's been asked on multiple occasions to attend the Secret of Bohemian Grove meet-up held by the satanic elite.
[03:06:44.296 --> 03:06:51.280]  I've been invited, he wrote, to Bohemian Grove by more famous people than I can shake a stick at, and every time my answer's hell no, he wrote.
[03:06:51.280 --> 03:06:58.324]  One famous country singer wouldn't stop asking, so I asked him, hey, if I go, can I wear a druid outfit and burn the effigy?
[03:06:59.224 --> 03:07:01.025]  Of a child at the feet of Moloch?
[03:07:01.025 --> 03:07:01.446]  He said?
[03:07:01.446 --> 03:07:04.308]  Aw man, that's just an old tradition.
[03:07:04.308 --> 03:07:06.309]  It doesn't mean anything serious.
[03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:09.291]  I reply, there's no such thing as pretending to worship Satan.
[03:07:09.291 --> 03:07:10.732]  Haven't heard from him since.
[03:07:10.732 --> 03:07:13.494]  This bleep is real.
[03:07:13.494 --> 03:07:23.622]  And of course, you're surely famously exposed to the occultic gathering back when we snuck you into the year 2000 on the grounds and filmed the mock sacrifice to Moloch mentioned by Rich.
[03:07:23.622 --> 03:07:27.464]  See the documentary right now for free at InfoWars.com.
[03:07:29.551 --> 03:07:31.672]  Then we've got this information.
[03:07:31.672 --> 03:07:42.077]  Last week, a 37-year-old ABC News producer, who's in great shape and an exercise aficionado, died of a heart attack.
[03:07:42.077 --> 03:07:44.538]  Well, it's happened again to this young lady.
[03:07:44.538 --> 03:07:49.120]  Second ABC News producer dies suddenly.
[03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:52.742]  ABC 10 News producer Erica Gonzalez.
[03:07:52.742 --> 03:07:55.103]  Unexpected death happened within days.
[03:07:57.048 --> 03:08:02.371]  Of ABC News executive Dax Tedras' death.
[03:08:02.371 --> 03:08:07.735]  ABC News has lost a second producer in addition to executive producer Dax Tejera last week.
[03:08:09.545 --> 03:08:21.390]  Erica Gonzales, a morning show producer at ABC 10 in San Diego, died suddenly last week with a fundraiser referring to her death as unexpected.
[03:08:21.390 --> 03:08:22.150]  Good afternoon.
[03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:29.053]  As some of you heard, our dear family member Erica has gained her angel wings unexpectedly.
[03:08:29.053 --> 03:08:31.714]  Our family's hurting and in disbelief.
[03:08:31.714 --> 03:08:33.935]  GoFundMe for Gonzales reads.
[03:08:33.935 --> 03:08:36.717]  And it's not just people dying from after they take the shot.
[03:08:37.837 --> 03:08:41.040]  Other folks are suddenly having heart attacks, just dropping dead.
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:47.746]  Our own Chris Andrews, on Christmas Day, exercised all the time, didn't smoke or drink.
[03:08:47.746 --> 03:08:51.249]  Always telling me I shouldn't drink, shouldn't smoke cigars.
[03:08:51.249 --> 03:08:51.629]  Died.
[03:08:51.629 --> 03:08:54.392]  Massive heart attack on Sunday.
[03:08:54.392 --> 03:09:00.357]  It gets weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:02.608 --> 03:09:05.791]  And that's where we are in this culture, this society.
[03:09:05.791 --> 03:09:11.736]  They want to kill a bunch of people, have the doctors be concerned, and cover it up because they're scared of the repercussions.
[03:09:11.736 --> 03:09:18.662]  And then once we set the precedent to be able to kill large numbers of people, they're going to release even more deadly viruses and more deadly so-called vaccines.
[03:09:18.662 --> 03:09:22.545]  That's how they corrupt and take control of civilization.
[03:09:22.545 --> 03:09:26.568]  But we're still on air thanks to your support at this critical time, fighting harder than ever.
[03:09:27.509 --> 03:09:32.470]  We've had massive denial of service attacks on InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:09:32.470 --> 03:09:33.531]  Some of the biggest ever.
[03:09:33.531 --> 03:09:36.431]  Now it's over 250 million requests.
[03:09:36.431 --> 03:09:37.392]  The security's fine.
[03:09:37.392 --> 03:09:39.152]  The sites are there.
[03:09:39.152 --> 03:09:40.732]  Ordering there is totally safe.
[03:09:40.732 --> 03:09:41.733]  They're not getting into the site.
[03:09:41.733 --> 03:09:42.973]  They're not hacking the site.
[03:09:42.973 --> 03:09:50.155]  They're doing brute force attacks, sending so much traffic to them that when you want to go to InfoWarsStore.com, you may have to do a little
[03:09:50.715 --> 03:09:51.475]  We're good to go.
[03:10:07.401 --> 03:10:07.621]  Thank you.
[03:10:27.011 --> 03:10:27.471]  We're good to go.
[03:10:56.138 --> 03:10:56.318]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:11.015 --> 03:11:11.395]  Thank you.
[03:11:32.273 --> 03:11:33.394]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:33.394 --> 03:11:35.435]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jason Alsace.
[03:11:35.435 --> 03:11:41.020]  This is the fourth hour, and as you know, we typically lecture through one of the important texts of the elite.
[03:11:41.020 --> 03:11:48.886]  We give the history, the background, and this is really important today because, as you heard yesterday and today, the discussions about the banning of cars.
[03:11:49.546 --> 03:12:02.415]  The banning of meat, giving you fake meat, giving you eat the bugs, giving you death care, giving you euthanasia, giving us the idea that travel, commerce, everything needs to be locked down.
[03:12:02.415 --> 03:12:03.576]  15-minute cities.
[03:12:03.576 --> 03:12:09.000]  You will live within 15 minutes of anything that you need and you won't be able to drive.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:10.401]  You'll have carbon rationing.
[03:12:10.401 --> 03:12:17.966]  All of that is now being rolled out and it couldn't have rolled out without the last couple years of the COVID, the COOF scam.
[03:12:18.912 --> 03:12:24.394]  And it couldn't have rolled out without a century plus planning.
[03:12:24.394 --> 03:12:27.135]  And today, what I want to talk about is how we got to where we are.
[03:12:27.135 --> 03:12:29.656]  Where really does this originate from?
[03:12:29.656 --> 03:12:36.078]  Where does this roll icon of a form Davos idea of the circular economy, which means that you don't own anything, right?
[03:12:36.078 --> 03:12:38.139]  You own nothing and you'll be happy.
[03:12:38.139 --> 03:12:39.539]  Greta out there telling you to eat the bugs.
[03:12:39.539 --> 03:12:40.379]  Where does this come from?
[03:12:40.379 --> 03:12:45.001]  Does it come from just a bunch of random people positing good ideas?
[03:12:45.001 --> 03:12:47.522]  Or is this something a hundred plus years in the work?
[03:12:48.397 --> 03:12:56.782]  In the works, and does it arise from actual lengthy geopolitical tomes that we've talked about for many, many years?
[03:12:56.782 --> 03:13:03.666]  Well, the reality is that the writings of the elite are public and we lecture through them on the regular.
[03:13:03.666 --> 03:13:14.533]  And so I'm continuing my lecture series in this excellent book, which is really a compliment to Dr. Carol Quigley's writings and a compliment to Dr. Anthony Sutton's writings.
[03:13:15.223 --> 03:13:22.246]  And that's the book, The Milner-Fabian Conspiracy, by a Romanian historian, Ioan Ratiu.
[03:13:22.246 --> 03:13:31.570]  So what are some of the institutions that the Fabian socialists, who were the ones that wanted to reform Marxism to make it aligned with big capitalism?
[03:13:31.570 --> 03:13:42.334]  That's how you have to understand that Fabian socialism is a form of Marxism and communism that intentionally aligns itself with big money, with big state capitalism.
[03:13:43.739 --> 03:13:50.303]  And it comes out of these people that we've talked about in the Royal Society, the Milner Circle, Cecil Rose, the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[03:13:50.303 --> 03:14:03.890]  That's the first thing they set up to really be sort of the inner core of what would become eventually the entities that we now know of as Bilderberg and its extension Davos or the World Economic Forum.
[03:14:03.890 --> 03:14:08.613]  So some of these entities include the League of Nations in 1915.
[03:14:08.613 --> 03:14:11.154]  The League of Nations was set up by Fabians.
[03:14:11.846 --> 03:14:17.509]  Then in 1918, we have the League of Nations Union, and then the League of Nations proper in 1919.
[03:14:17.509 --> 03:14:20.690]  International Labour set up in 1919.
[03:14:20.690 --> 03:14:23.791]  The World Court set up in 1920.
[03:14:23.791 --> 03:14:28.153]  Royal Institute for International Affairs, which becomes the Chatham House in 1920 in the UK.
[03:14:30.171 --> 03:14:38.034]  Notice that the Royal Institute of International Affairs was set up under Lord Curtis, Lionel Curtis, and other Fabians like John Maynard Keynes.
[03:14:38.034 --> 03:14:43.196]  So all Keynesian economics is 100% tied up with Fabian socialism.
[03:14:43.196 --> 03:14:49.199]  And where do we get, what comes out of John Maynard Keynes' idea of how we should do economics?
[03:14:49.199 --> 03:14:50.319]  Oh, the IMF.
[03:14:50.319 --> 03:14:51.280]  Exactly.
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:56.242]  Arnold Toynbee was one of the key ideologues who gave the impetus to this whole system of
[03:14:56.969 --> 03:15:04.776]  Basically capitalist socialism, big state capitalism, big state socialism in a synthesis, a third-way mix.
[03:15:04.776 --> 03:15:11.381]  And Arnold Twomby himself, the famous British historian, was actually one of the directors of the Chatham House of Studies.
[03:15:11.381 --> 03:15:17.727]  We get the Council on Foreign Relations set up in 1921 in the United States out of Woodrow Wilson's private intelligence group, the Inquiry.
[03:15:18.490 --> 03:15:29.669]  Woodrow Wilson was controlled from the background by his handler, Colonel Edwin Mandel House, who wrote a book called Philip Drew Administrator about being a handler to a president for the British banking elite.
[03:15:30.245 --> 03:15:40.873]  And that's precisely what he was, that is, Colonel House, to Woodrow Wilson, who tried to push through these internationalist schemes, and at that time was opposed by U.S.
[03:15:40.873 --> 03:15:42.835]  Senate and Congress, and so it didn't succeed.
[03:15:42.835 --> 03:15:44.496]  But the CFR is the complement to that.
[03:15:44.496 --> 03:15:53.083]  Don't go anywhere, because when we get back, I'm going to list more of these institutions and give you the history on where these secret deep state shadow government entities actually come from.
[03:15:53.083 --> 03:15:54.424]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:57.139 --> 03:16:17.769]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[03:16:18.269 --> 03:16:31.392]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[03:16:31.392 --> 03:16:40.234]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:16:40.234 --> 03:16:46.675]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:16:46.775 --> 03:16:48.195]  So continue to do it.
[03:16:48.195 --> 03:16:50.376]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:50.376 --> 03:16:52.477]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[03:16:52.477 --> 03:16:58.119]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:16:58.119 --> 03:17:04.541]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[03:17:04.541 --> 03:17:09.182]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[03:17:09.182 --> 03:17:11.963]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[03:17:11.963 --> 03:17:13.764]  for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[03:17:14.204 --> 03:17:20.947]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[03:17:20.947 --> 03:17:24.968]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[03:17:24.968 --> 03:17:35.252]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:35.652 --> 03:17:40.873]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:17:52.996 --> 03:17:56.537]  This is the best deal out there, and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:17:56.537 --> 03:17:57.557]  InfoWarsMD.
[03:17:58.638 --> 03:18:03.230]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:05.516]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[03:18:06.294 --> 03:18:08.355]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[03:18:08.355 --> 03:18:10.055]  They know we're telling the truth.
[03:18:10.055 --> 03:18:11.616]  They know we've got their number.
[03:18:11.616 --> 03:18:16.337]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[03:18:16.337 --> 03:18:24.220]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[03:18:24.220 --> 03:18:34.623]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[03:18:35.629 --> 03:18:37.650]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[03:19:01.613 --> 03:19:11.904]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[03:19:11.904 --> 03:19:15.667]  But, through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds.
[03:19:16.479 --> 03:19:16.920]  Thank you.
[03:19:32.938 --> 03:19:44.541]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:44.541 --> 03:19:51.643]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[03:19:51.643 --> 03:19:56.785]  You owe it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[03:19:58.775 --> 03:20:04.693]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:20:13.783 --> 03:20:14.744]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.744 --> 03:20:16.005]  I'm your guest host, Jake Niren.
[03:20:16.005 --> 03:20:23.311]  Today we're talking about the institutions that were set up to promote throughout the world Fabian socialist style control.
[03:20:23.311 --> 03:20:31.037]  And of course, as we said, that's a reformed version of Marxism, which allies classical Marxism to monopoly capital.
[03:20:31.037 --> 03:20:39.925]  And so it's not exactly the same thing as fascism, but it's actually it's pretty close to fascism, if you think about it, because it's really no different than the state being a corporate actor.
[03:20:41.303 --> 03:20:45.164]  The difference, of course, being that it is now allied to technocracy.
[03:20:45.164 --> 03:20:49.205]  And of course, many of the early Fabians were self-professed technocrats.
[03:20:49.205 --> 03:21:05.390]  And we're talking about the various institutions, panels, Royal Society for International Affairs, the various steering groups that were set up early on to be part and party to this very open operation.
[03:21:05.390 --> 03:21:06.831]  This is not a secret plot.
[03:21:06.831 --> 03:21:10.952]  It's not a thing cooked up without any public
[03:21:11.773 --> 03:21:13.574]  Eyes on it or any public purview.
[03:21:13.574 --> 03:21:19.717]  This is actually very well known and very well established in the literature.
[03:21:19.717 --> 03:21:21.477]  But if we don't read the literature, we don't know that.
[03:21:21.477 --> 03:21:24.159]  So what I do is I lecture through the literature for you.
[03:21:24.159 --> 03:21:26.980]  And you can go see if you want a fuller treatment of this.
[03:21:26.980 --> 03:21:31.942]  We did a whole three hours on this book last, about a month ago.
[03:21:31.942 --> 03:21:38.625]  And then last night I did the next section, sort of a longer treatise, treatment of what we're covering today.
[03:21:39.304 --> 03:21:52.637]  So some of the other institutions that we said were set up included the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, explicitly to adopt Keynesian economics and to promote that throughout the world.
[03:21:52.637 --> 03:21:56.140]  NATO was actually set up in 1949 by Fabians.
[03:21:56.140 --> 03:22:03.167]  So while NATO has at least its public purview to keep Russia at bay,
[03:22:03.887 --> 03:22:09.149]  During the Cold War, that doesn't mean that that NATO was really anti-communist per se.
[03:22:09.149 --> 03:22:12.210]  It was actually intent on promoting a kind of Fabian socialism.
[03:22:12.210 --> 03:22:13.791]  That's really what the EU ended up being.
[03:22:13.791 --> 03:22:20.813]  In fact, the EU itself was established and promoted by people with Fabian socialist ideology.
[03:22:20.813 --> 03:22:22.634]  The Council of Europe was part of that.
[03:22:22.634 --> 03:22:32.317]  The Aspen Institute, Socialist International, One World Trust, all of these institutions and things that were set up in the 20th century, particularly in the first 50 years of the 20th century, had tremendous amount of influence.
[03:22:33.306 --> 03:22:39.229]  And that's precisely what the EU itself became, right?
[03:22:39.229 --> 03:22:43.330]  European Coal and Steel Union later became the European Union in 1951.
[03:22:43.330 --> 03:22:47.032]  That had actually been planned at Bilderberg prior to that.
[03:22:47.032 --> 03:22:52.574]  And if you read Daniel Esselstyn's Bilderberg book, that's actually in the documents from the Bilderberg meetings.
[03:22:52.574 --> 03:22:59.297]  Bilderberg was created by Fabians Joseph Redinger, Hugh Gaskell, Dennis Healy, and David Rockefeller.
[03:23:00.354 --> 03:23:11.978]  As well as the Christian Socialist Movement in 1960, the Trilateral Commission in 1973, which was established precisely for Zbigniew Brzezinski to head up as his own kind of steering committee.
[03:23:11.978 --> 03:23:16.040]  That was something that Kissinger and David Rockefeller cooked up together.
[03:23:16.040 --> 03:23:21.041]  And the express goal of all of these people was, quote, management by experts.
[03:23:21.041 --> 03:23:26.503]  Remember in the middle of Quigley's book, Tragedy and Hope, there's a really excellent chapter that outlines all of this.
[03:23:26.503 --> 03:23:28.424]  And remember Quigley was a proponent of this.
[03:23:28.424 --> 03:23:28.884]  He was not a
[03:23:30.028 --> 03:23:32.129]  A conspiracy theorist, he was not somebody critiquing this.
[03:23:32.129 --> 03:23:36.791]  He thought this was the best hope for humanity, was this technocratic managerial society.
[03:23:36.791 --> 03:23:43.794]  The very middle of the book, there's a big fat chapter about management by experts and AI.
[03:23:43.794 --> 03:23:54.217]  So back in the 1960s, Quigley said that by the time they roll this out, everybody will be living in coffin apartments in tiny cities and you'll be run by giant AI computers.
[03:23:54.217 --> 03:23:55.358]  So this plan goes back
[03:23:55.993 --> 03:23:57.114]  To the 30s, 40s, and 50s.
[03:23:57.114 --> 03:24:00.316]  It's not something that recently was cooked up.
[03:24:00.316 --> 03:24:02.197]  It's all public.
[03:24:02.197 --> 03:24:12.684]  And so, today, Elon is tweeting a lot of great things, but he's also tweeting that there's not some overriding plot here.
[03:24:12.684 --> 03:24:17.687]  No, there is, and that's why I was tweeting at Elon, hey, check out the Tragedy and Hope lecture series I did.
[03:24:17.687 --> 03:24:20.809]  I lectured through this whole 1300-page book.
[03:24:20.809 --> 03:24:22.550]  I did 16 hours of lectures through this.
[03:24:23.938 --> 03:24:25.059]  This is a real thing.
[03:24:25.059 --> 03:24:26.620]  This is not a conspiracy text.
[03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:35.046]  This is an actual geopolitical text written in the 1960s by Bill Clinton's mentor out of Georgetown University, military historian and expert.
[03:24:35.046 --> 03:24:39.769]  Archive is for the CFR, and he wrote a whole history of the 20th century from their perspective.
[03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:43.872]  That's why that book is so crucial, so important, so killer.
[03:24:43.872 --> 03:24:45.894]  This book is just another addendum to that.
[03:24:47.256 --> 03:24:48.177]  Adding on to that.
[03:24:48.177 --> 03:24:49.378]  So, Elon, listen.
[03:24:49.378 --> 03:24:54.281]  Hey, I don't know if you watch or not, but if you do, go listen to my Tragedy and Hope lecture course.
[03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:59.325]  It's absolutely essential because it lays it all out.
[03:24:59.325 --> 03:25:00.606]  Management by experts.
[03:25:00.606 --> 03:25:09.292]  What that means is loss of individual freedom, loss of individual property rights, loss of individual commerce, massive depopulation.
[03:25:09.292 --> 03:25:13.435]  All of the Fabians explicitly adopted the eugenicist model of Malthusianism.
[03:25:14.505 --> 03:25:17.187]  They didn't like Hitler's model of Malthusianism.
[03:25:17.187 --> 03:25:18.608]  They said, ah, that's not the right one.
[03:25:18.608 --> 03:25:24.151]  Let's go with this other model, which doesn't give supremacy to Teutonic peoples.
[03:25:24.151 --> 03:25:30.635]  Let's just pick out the elite, so to speak, amongst any group and kill everybody else.
[03:25:30.635 --> 03:25:43.964]  The most famous Fabian of that time, George Bernard Shaw, at least publicly famous, not the most wealthy or powerful one, publicly, Shaw said, we must adopt this to have a civilized culture
[03:25:44.679 --> 03:25:47.620]  And we must exterminate anyone who does not fit into this.
[03:25:47.620 --> 03:25:52.302]  He wrote that in 1933 in the preface to On the Rocks.
[03:25:52.302 --> 03:25:59.405]  Later on, the Fabian said, we also must adopt technocracy and transhumanism because that's the only hope to save humanity.
[03:25:59.405 --> 03:26:02.126]  We must also get rid of most of the European population.
[03:26:03.487 --> 03:26:04.308]  How would we do that?
[03:26:04.308 --> 03:26:26.367]  Well, it turns out the Fabians were behind, particularly Bertrand Russell and Beatrice and Sidney Webb, were behind transforming not just the UK, but they started with the UK, into Londonistan, importing massive amounts of Islamic theologians, professors, and teachers, and then turning the rest of Europe into an Islamic country.
[03:26:27.873 --> 03:26:30.634]  That was something that Bertrand Russell openly cheered on.
[03:26:30.634 --> 03:26:37.295]  He said that we can destroy and reorganize society through the importation of foreign ideologies and cultures.
[03:26:37.295 --> 03:26:40.416]  So it has nothing to do with... Bertrand Russell wasn't interested in Islam.
[03:26:40.416 --> 03:26:42.316]  He's an atheist.
[03:26:42.316 --> 03:26:46.257]  But it's a tool to change the existing culture and society.
[03:26:46.257 --> 03:26:47.657]  And they were very open about that.
[03:26:47.657 --> 03:26:53.858]  They actually thought that Islam could be a proto-socialist movement.
[03:26:53.858 --> 03:26:56.879]  And that's why there's been this long-time alliance between
[03:26:57.739 --> 03:27:01.681]  The elite, socialist, wealthy left in Islam.
[03:27:01.681 --> 03:27:08.364]  It has nothing to do with the actual ideologies, just for using the ideologies as tools, that's it.
[03:27:08.364 --> 03:27:14.086]  Again, Merchant Russell didn't care about Islam, but he did care about using it as a way to change the existing society.
[03:27:14.086 --> 03:27:26.572]  So the Fabians were instrumental in promoting and bringing in to the UK Sufism, which is how it started, and then that turned into the mass importation of Sunni Islam, and now it's Londonistan.
[03:27:27.472 --> 03:27:33.505]  And they even said that this clash of civilizations would be a great way to destroy Christianity.
[03:27:33.505 --> 03:27:36.351]  You understand the Fabians were self-cognizant of that.
[03:27:36.351 --> 03:27:37.674]  They were self-conscious that
[03:27:38.288 --> 03:27:45.250]  This clash, they thought, would result in the destruction of the existing Christian civilization.
[03:27:45.250 --> 03:27:46.770]  And they've been very successful.
[03:27:46.770 --> 03:27:54.832]  Of course, Anglicanism or Episcopalian or Church of England Christianity is pretty much dead and done for.
[03:27:54.832 --> 03:27:56.252]  So they were very successful in this.
[03:27:56.252 --> 03:28:00.753]  But this explains why they promoted both, both theism at the same time.
[03:28:00.753 --> 03:28:03.134]  Some of the Fabians promoting both at the same time.
[03:28:03.134 --> 03:28:06.915]  Because it's a strategy for geopolitical power and control and to reorganize
[03:28:07.695 --> 03:28:12.399]  And restructure Europe along the lines of what these people wanted.
[03:28:12.399 --> 03:28:15.421]  This is their stated plan and goal.
[03:28:15.421 --> 03:28:21.306]  And you understand that the plans and goals that we're seeing roll out now are the same people.
[03:28:21.306 --> 03:28:23.608]  You can read H.G.
[03:28:23.608 --> 03:28:29.333]  Wells a hundred years ago, talking about the things that are rolling out now.
[03:28:29.333 --> 03:28:33.136]  And they're part of the same societies and groups.
[03:28:33.136 --> 03:28:37.019]  And the operant ideology here, again, is this Fabian Socialist model.
[03:28:37.722 --> 03:28:38.202]  And guess what?
[03:28:38.202 --> 03:28:45.705]  It's these Fabian Socialist people who set up British Intelligence, who then set up the OSS and the CIA.
[03:28:45.705 --> 03:28:48.466]  The same people setting up the CFR.
[03:28:48.466 --> 03:28:51.467]  You understand that this is the power structure.
[03:28:51.467 --> 03:28:53.008]  Don't go anywhere when we come back.
[03:28:53.008 --> 03:28:54.268]  We'll explain that in more detail.
[03:28:54.268 --> 03:28:55.389]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:57.085 --> 03:29:04.287]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[03:29:04.287 --> 03:29:15.289]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[03:29:15.289 --> 03:29:23.851]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[03:29:23.851 --> 03:29:24.431]  Introducing
[03:29:25.271 --> 03:29:29.854]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:29.854 --> 03:29:35.117]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.

[03:29:43.722 --> 03:29:45.806]  Superfood greens and more.

[03:29:54.920 --> 03:29:56.442]  Find InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.
[03:29:57.148 --> 03:30:06.332]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[03:30:06.332 --> 03:30:15.476]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[03:30:16.016 --> 03:30:17.738]  We've gone right to the manufacturer.
[03:30:17.738 --> 03:30:18.799]  We were listeners.
[03:30:18.799 --> 03:30:19.980]  The owner's a fan.
[03:30:19.980 --> 03:30:22.603]  And they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[03:30:22.603 --> 03:30:28.068]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[03:30:28.068 --> 03:30:29.630]  And not just under one name.
[03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:35.116]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[03:30:35.116 --> 03:30:39.200]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[03:30:39.620 --> 03:30:41.502]  We're talking about pain MD.
[03:30:41.502 --> 03:30:44.184]  We're talking about HGH max boost.
[03:30:44.184 --> 03:30:47.047]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[03:30:47.047 --> 03:30:48.868]  These things are incredible.
[03:30:48.868 --> 03:30:54.793]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[03:30:54.793 --> 03:30:57.196]  Get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:57.196 --> 03:31:01.760]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[03:31:01.760 --> 03:31:04.001]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other host.
[03:31:04.827 --> 03:31:06.888]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[03:31:06.888 --> 03:31:08.590]  They know we're telling the truth.
[03:31:08.590 --> 03:31:10.151]  They know we've got their number.
[03:31:10.151 --> 03:31:14.894]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[03:31:14.894 --> 03:31:22.760]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[03:31:22.760 --> 03:31:33.167]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[03:31:34.241 --> 03:31:37.003]  Do you want to beat the New World Order?
[03:31:58.297 --> 03:32:00.158]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[03:32:00.158 --> 03:32:08.243]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[03:32:08.243 --> 03:32:12.386]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[03:32:12.386 --> 03:32:15.048]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[03:32:16.929 --> 03:32:21.611]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[03:32:21.611 --> 03:32:23.612]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[03:32:23.612 --> 03:32:25.432]  So please, keep me on the field.
[03:32:25.432 --> 03:32:30.634]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[03:32:50.187 --> 03:32:59.237]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[03:32:59.237 --> 03:33:05.123]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.893 --> 03:33:13.934]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.934 --> 03:33:15.777]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:15.777 --> 03:33:28.412]  We are covering the history of the real establishment, the real shadow government, the real metapolitical power that exists in the West, sometimes called the Atlantis' power bloc.
[03:33:29.173 --> 03:33:34.376]  The Anglo-Franco-Israeli-American power bloc, whatever you want to call it.
[03:33:34.376 --> 03:33:43.022]  It's that whole structure in the West that is promoting and is dedicated to this model.
[03:33:43.022 --> 03:33:45.864]  To this model of technocracy and Malthusianism.
[03:33:45.864 --> 03:33:47.365]  If you don't understand those two things,
[03:33:48.215 --> 03:34:01.229]  No way to understand what's going on and where we are and what's actually going on in terms of the rolling out of the Great Reset plans, of the banning of meat, of the eventual ban.
[03:34:01.229 --> 03:34:05.474]  You understand they're eventually going to ban relationships.
[03:34:05.474 --> 03:34:06.796]  I'm not kidding.
[03:34:06.796 --> 03:34:07.877]  They're going to ban marriage.
[03:34:09.082 --> 03:34:14.806]  Because if you think about it, marriage is really, I know a lot of people probably think of it as something that's just cultural.
[03:34:14.806 --> 03:34:17.347]  Really, marriage goes back to Genesis.
[03:34:17.347 --> 03:34:19.909]  It's kind of tied to what we see in the book of Genesis.
[03:34:19.909 --> 03:34:30.155]  And so, if the Bible isn't true, if theology, religion, all that stuff is not true, then there's really not a reason for marriage.
[03:34:30.155 --> 03:34:36.899]  Yeah, there might be some practical reasons for legalities and inheritance or something like that, but they're going to get rid of inheritance.
[03:34:37.719 --> 03:34:39.760]  Guess who passed the first inheritance laws?
[03:34:39.760 --> 03:34:40.341]  Oh, guess what?
[03:34:40.341 --> 03:34:41.021]  Fabians.
[03:34:41.021 --> 03:34:43.563]  They were the first to pass inheritance laws.
[03:34:43.563 --> 03:34:49.667]  Following plans that, obviously, that Marx had laid out.
[03:34:49.667 --> 03:35:03.196]  And one of the things that the Fabians did that's pretty wild was that they were openly calling for, in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, the abolishment of the family in the UK through the Labour Party.
[03:35:04.036 --> 03:35:16.422]  Maybe not the Labour Party publicly, but the inner core of the Labour Party, which is basically the Democrats in the UK, in the 1960s started calling for the abolishment of the family.
[03:35:16.422 --> 03:35:20.744]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:35:20.744 --> 03:35:23.365]  Same ideology of Klaus.
[03:35:23.365 --> 03:35:25.346]  Remember Klaus had Lenin behind him?
[03:35:25.346 --> 03:35:28.428]  Remember that?
[03:35:28.428 --> 03:35:29.428]  What is that all about?
[03:35:29.428 --> 03:35:30.229]  That is about
[03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:35.231]  Creating a technocratic new world order structure.
[03:35:35.231 --> 03:35:38.933]  Who said a hundred years ago we should abolish the family?
[03:35:38.933 --> 03:35:42.594]  HG Wells, Bertrand Russell.
[03:35:42.594 --> 03:35:44.195]  Who said we should abolish marriage?
[03:35:44.195 --> 03:35:48.916]  Who said we should abolish you having the ability to save up money, capital?
[03:35:48.916 --> 03:35:50.437]  All the same people.
[03:35:50.437 --> 03:35:55.899]  Bertrand Russell said your credits will go away when you don't spend them after a week or a month, right?
[03:35:55.899 --> 03:36:01.421]  The credits that are doled out to you, your basic income based on your ESG, based on your social credit score.
[03:36:02.051 --> 03:36:06.353]  This was planned a hundred years ago, and until people figure that out, nothing's going to change.
[03:36:06.353 --> 03:36:20.258]  Until we identify who's actually pushing this, and that it's real, and stop playing games, pretending like, calling people names, calling people conspiracy theorists, or pointing out objective facts.
[03:36:20.258 --> 03:36:21.158]  Until we realize that.
[03:36:21.158 --> 03:36:22.638]  This is why the right can never do anything.
[03:36:22.638 --> 03:36:26.380]  They're so emasculated, because they won't admit what's really going on.
[03:36:26.380 --> 03:36:26.680]  That's why.
[03:36:29.278 --> 03:36:33.620]  And the ones that do know what's going on become collaborators.
[03:36:33.620 --> 03:36:38.882]  The fake right and all these people, right?
[03:36:38.882 --> 03:36:41.484]  So how do we get to where we are in terms of the machinations?
[03:36:41.484 --> 03:36:53.049]  Well, it's very important to understand that what we think is going on in terms of the American structure and government and its power and all that is not real.
[03:36:53.049 --> 03:36:57.411]  The way we think America runs, the way the normie thinks of it running, is not real.
[03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:00.060]  And I don't mean to black pill you.
[03:37:00.060 --> 03:37:01.461]  That's not the point here.
[03:37:01.461 --> 03:37:07.202]  But until we realize the real diagnosis of the problem, we'll never fix the problems.
[03:37:07.202 --> 03:37:15.744]  And when people come forward who have mentioned the real problems, they get derided, blasted, destroyed in the media, etc.
[03:37:15.744 --> 03:37:26.347]  I'm talking about, you know, Senator McDonald or, you know, even Barry Goldwater just basically barely hinting at what might be going on and they get destroyed, right?
[03:37:28.817 --> 03:37:29.638]  Ron Paul.
[03:37:29.638 --> 03:37:34.421]  Ron Paul talked about a lot of these things and tried to make it very palatable to a mass audience.
[03:37:34.421 --> 03:37:36.242]  And they just derided and destroyed him.
[03:37:36.242 --> 03:37:37.122]  In the media, I'm saying.
[03:37:37.122 --> 03:37:39.584]  Back, you know, 2007-8.
[03:37:39.584 --> 03:37:41.605]  Alex talks about this for so many years, right?
[03:37:41.605 --> 03:37:44.207]  You know, you see that clip there, Ingsoc.
[03:37:44.207 --> 03:37:46.168]  Remember that when Orwell wrote 1984 in 1948?
[03:37:46.168 --> 03:37:47.969]  That was on the 100-year anniversary of what?
[03:37:47.969 --> 03:37:48.630]  The Fabian Society.
[03:37:56.957 --> 03:38:01.842]  And yes, scholars have shown that that's what he was writing about.
[03:38:01.842 --> 03:38:08.047]  So when you see Big Brother, when you see that in 1984, he's writing about the Fabian Socialists and their plan.
[03:38:08.047 --> 03:38:21.399]  What you see in 1984 is what Milner, Rhodes, Rothschild, Lord Curtis, Lord Astors, all these people, that's what they had planned.
[03:38:21.399 --> 03:38:22.900]  Not for themselves, for everybody else.
[03:38:25.091 --> 03:38:29.676]  So how do we get to this Royal Institute for International Affairs having this amount of control?
[03:38:29.676 --> 03:38:47.875]  Well, from the late 1890s, Cecil Rhodes, the diamond magnate, right, the De Beers Company, Cecil Rhodes got this idea to structure a corporation much like the British East India Company, right, this older model of corporate private governance, which had basically kind of been running the British Empire.
[03:38:48.698 --> 03:38:55.600]  And if you don't know, that was a British East India Company that wasn't just about making a profit and trading things.
[03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:57.140]  They traded drugs.
[03:38:57.140 --> 03:39:01.001]  It's a big drug thing if you didn't know that, by the way.
[03:39:01.001 --> 03:39:07.522]  So the good people that run society and run the empire, they're actually just big scale drug lords.
[03:39:07.522 --> 03:39:10.123]  These aren't nice people.
[03:39:10.123 --> 03:39:11.923]  And what Rhodes decided was that he could set up
[03:39:14.671 --> 03:39:29.741]  His corporation, which he originally called the British South Africa Company, based on the model of the British East India Company, that he could control and structure the diamond trade and make it into a monopoly, right?
[03:39:29.741 --> 03:39:32.143]  And that obviously produced a lot of money.
[03:39:32.143 --> 03:39:38.848]  And then he decided that he would construct his own secret society, quite literally, this is in John Roberts's, I think it's John Roberts's, Roberts's
[03:39:40.023 --> 03:39:51.853]  famous biography of Cecil Rhodes, so this is public information, that he would structure his secret society, called the Society of the Elect, along the lines of the models of the Jesuits and Masons.
[03:39:51.853 --> 03:40:06.985]  So, Cecil Rhodes, I think, was a Mason, but this is not primarily a Freemasonic conspiracy, this is something else, is beyond that, in the case of Cecil Rhodes, and it's not a primarily Jesuit conspiracy, it's something more than that, and something beyond that.
[03:40:07.896 --> 03:40:22.071]  It's just simply the model that he took of an inner group that has layers of helpers, administrators, and people outside that that don't really know the inner party plans.
[03:40:22.071 --> 03:40:22.891]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:40:22.891 --> 03:40:23.472]  The inner party?
[03:40:23.472 --> 03:40:25.394]  The outer party?
[03:40:25.394 --> 03:40:31.020]  Again, Orwell in 1984 is describing the structure of the Society of the Elect
[03:40:31.832 --> 03:40:43.900]  Which evolves into, right, so originally Rhodes's plan was let's reinvigorate the British Empire, right, so they were starting to see the decline of the British Empire in his day.
[03:40:43.900 --> 03:40:53.406]  However, what ended up occurring was not actually the re-ascendancy of the British Empire, it actually ended up destroying the British Empire
[03:40:54.534 --> 03:40:56.635]  And so it morphed into something else.
[03:40:56.635 --> 03:40:57.836]  What did they decide to do?
[03:40:57.836 --> 03:41:05.860]  Well, they decided to make an alliance with the Eastern seaboard elite magnates and families and oligarchs in the U.S.
[03:41:05.860 --> 03:41:12.624]  I'm speaking specifically of this inner group, which eventually became called the Milner Group after Lord Milner.
[03:41:12.624 --> 03:41:17.587]  John Ruskin, all these figures who were avowed socialists.
[03:41:17.587 --> 03:41:22.710]  They said, we need to make an alliance with this rising power over in America.
[03:41:23.576 --> 03:41:29.921]  And we need to do that by aligning ourselves to the most powerful wealthy families in America.
[03:41:29.921 --> 03:41:35.266]  Rockefeller, JP Morgan, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, on and on and on.
[03:41:35.266 --> 03:41:36.867]  And they did that.
[03:41:36.867 --> 03:41:42.852]  On record, 100% in mainline historical books and texts.
[03:41:42.852 --> 03:41:52.860]  And so many institutions, many universities in the U.S., particularly the Eastern Seaboard universities, Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
[03:41:53.846 --> 03:41:58.209]  These became the central recruiting grounds.
[03:41:58.209 --> 03:42:01.872]  These universities are founded by these old school families, right?
[03:42:01.872 --> 03:42:05.034]  Those became the recruiting grounds for what?
[03:42:05.034 --> 03:42:07.877]  What famous thing is there that everybody knows about?
[03:42:07.877 --> 03:42:09.498]  Skull and Bones.
[03:42:09.498 --> 03:42:11.699]  Lodge 322.
[03:42:11.699 --> 03:42:13.561]  What comes out of Skull and Bones?
[03:42:13.561 --> 03:42:15.562]  What do they recruit there?
[03:42:15.562 --> 03:42:17.224]  OSS CIA.
[03:42:17.224 --> 03:42:23.028]  So, this establishment, this Eastern Seaboard establishment, which Quigley calls the Anglo-American establishment, the Eastern Establishment.
[03:42:24.486 --> 03:42:27.187]  This is the power structure.
[03:42:27.187 --> 03:42:34.951]  This is why Klaus Davos comes out of Harvard Project.
[03:42:34.951 --> 03:42:42.374]  Kissinger and the Harvard Project recruit Klaus and set up his thing.
[03:42:42.374 --> 03:42:44.435]  And Klaus was formerly part of Bilderberg.
[03:42:44.435 --> 03:42:46.155]  And this is all the same people, you understand?
[03:42:46.155 --> 03:42:47.516]  It's all the same groups and people.
[03:42:49.202 --> 03:42:50.984]  So when we come back, we'll get into more of this.
[03:42:50.984 --> 03:42:51.885]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:51.885 --> 03:42:52.645]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:42:52.645 --> 03:42:53.987]  I'm Jason Alsos.
[03:42:53.987 --> 03:42:56.689]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:56.689 --> 03:42:58.891]  There is a war on for your mind.
[03:42:58.891 --> 03:43:00.673]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[03:43:00.673 --> 03:43:02.754]  This is an information war.
[03:43:02.754 --> 03:43:07.439]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[03:43:07.439 --> 03:43:15.306]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars
[03:43:15.586 --> 03:43:16.086]  I think so.
[03:43:35.939 --> 03:43:43.865]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[03:43:43.865 --> 03:43:46.187]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[03:43:46.187 --> 03:43:48.009]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[03:43:48.009 --> 03:43:49.149]  We're going over the top.
[03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:50.671]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[03:43:50.671 --> 03:43:53.713]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[03:43:58.095 --> 03:44:02.997]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:44:02.997 --> 03:44:09.379]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:44:09.379 --> 03:44:14.520]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:44:14.520 --> 03:44:16.221]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:44:16.221 --> 03:44:17.301]  Yes, I've persevered.
[03:44:17.301 --> 03:44:22.643]  But the listeners and viewers who've supported Infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[03:44:23.363 --> 03:44:28.807]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:44:28.807 --> 03:44:33.129]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:44:33.129 --> 03:44:42.295]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:44:42.295 --> 03:44:43.716]  God bless you all.
[03:44:43.716 --> 03:44:44.757]  I salute you.
[03:44:44.757 --> 03:44:45.757]  I thank you.
[03:44:45.757 --> 03:44:51.201]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:44:51.861 --> 03:44:53.202]  The fight is my fight.
[03:44:53.202 --> 03:44:53.822]  It's your fight.
[03:44:53.822 --> 03:44:54.563]  It's our fight.
[03:44:54.563 --> 03:44:56.564]  God bless you all.
[03:44:56.564 --> 03:44:58.765]  There is a war on for your mind.
[03:44:58.765 --> 03:45:00.566]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[03:45:00.566 --> 03:45:02.627]  This is an information war.
[03:45:02.627 --> 03:45:07.309]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:13.793]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[03:45:14.253 --> 03:45:15.014]  We're good to go.
[03:45:35.831 --> 03:45:43.733]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[03:45:43.733 --> 03:45:46.074]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[03:45:46.074 --> 03:45:47.914]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[03:45:47.914 --> 03:45:49.035]  We're going over the top.
[03:45:49.035 --> 03:45:50.555]  But right now is the critical juncture.

[03:47:11.673 --> 03:47:12.694]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.694 --> 03:47:16.078]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:16.078 --> 03:47:28.852]  As I was saying, you can go to my channel or to my Rockfin channel, which is an excellent free speech-based platform, and you can see the fuller treatment of this book going much deeper into the analysis of this text.
[03:47:28.852 --> 03:47:30.394]  I wanted to get to where we get
[03:47:31.334 --> 03:47:41.699]  The intelligence agencies, the spy networks and all that, out of these higher level steering committees and groups which are really behind those things, right?
[03:47:41.699 --> 03:47:49.923]  So we think about Russiagate, we think about all these things that have come out in the last few years about spies and espionage and what's really going on.
[03:47:49.923 --> 03:47:51.744]  Well, who set up these entities?
[03:47:51.744 --> 03:47:53.845]  Who set up the OSS and all this kind of stuff?
[03:47:53.845 --> 03:47:56.526]  Well, it turns out, as you can imagine, it is
[03:47:57.341 --> 03:48:07.681]  Chatham, it is Proud House, it is the CFR that themselves were behind the establishment of the OSS, which would become the CIA.
[03:48:07.681 --> 03:48:09.144]  And we have to understand that because
[03:48:10.257 --> 03:48:14.119]  We need to understand that that's the ultimate goal that these entities work for.
[03:48:14.119 --> 03:48:16.280]  They're not working for America's good.
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:21.382]  They're not working to protect and defend the average citizen.
[03:48:21.382 --> 03:48:25.884]  They are adjuncts for these private elite families.
[03:48:25.884 --> 03:48:28.065]  That's who they ultimately work for.
[03:48:28.065 --> 03:48:32.566]  And they work for a long-term goal to establish the technocracy that we're talking about.
[03:48:32.566 --> 03:48:37.428]  Remember when I covered Miles Copeland's famous rare book, Game of Nations?
[03:48:37.428 --> 03:48:38.569]  I lectured through that whole book.
[03:48:39.235 --> 03:48:49.941]  And he's a famous CIA operative and he says that all of this reconstruction that we did in the Middle East throughout the Cold War, he said it had nothing to do with fighting communists in the end.
[03:48:49.941 --> 03:48:51.081]  What is the end of the book saying?
[03:48:51.081 --> 03:49:00.126]  He says if you want to understand the long-term goals of the CIA, he says go read Bertrand Russell and the CFR.
[03:49:00.126 --> 03:49:07.790]  It's at the very end of the book.
[03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:08.110]  And so,
[03:49:09.588 --> 03:49:11.630]  What is all this about?
[03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:12.991]  Why are they doing all this?
[03:49:12.991 --> 03:49:19.435]  Because it's a long-term plan that has a specific goal.
[03:49:19.435 --> 03:49:30.804]  And when we look at the figures who were the first people to set up the CFR, the first members of the original CFR board in 1921, some of those people came out of the earlier proto-CFR.
[03:49:31.835 --> 03:49:42.982]  Which was the Anglo-American League, or Federation, I forget exactly what it was called, but it was set up prior to that to mirror the Milner Roundtable groups in the UK, right?
[03:49:42.982 --> 03:49:48.125]  And it was set up for the established purpose, quote, of creating a world government.
[03:49:50.069 --> 03:50:04.421]  And so to do that, what they would need to do is not just have all these Global Steering Committee groups, they also needed to set up a group that could operate as a secret intelligence apparatus within the United States.
[03:50:04.421 --> 03:50:05.342]  And so where do we get...
[03:50:06.517 --> 03:50:09.840]  Both British intelligence and the CIA from the OSS and the CIA.
[03:50:09.840 --> 03:50:11.701]  Well, this is public history, right?
[03:50:11.701 --> 03:50:16.845]  Now I mentioned Sutton's excellent classic book, Secret Establishment, right?
[03:50:16.845 --> 03:50:17.586]  Order of Skull and Bones.
[03:50:17.586 --> 03:50:18.466]  That's very important.
[03:50:18.466 --> 03:50:21.709]  That will tell you a lot of this same information.
[03:50:21.709 --> 03:50:29.995]  But it was the Milner Group and the Morgan Rockefeller Associates that have always been very close to all of these intelligence services across the West.
[03:50:29.995 --> 03:50:33.358]  Britain's foreign intelligence agency, the secret intelligence service, the SIS,
[03:50:33.968 --> 03:50:41.795]  Which would be later called MI6, was an interdepartmental service of the Foreign Office or the War Office.
[03:50:41.795 --> 03:50:47.200]  All of this was run by the interlocking Cecil Rhodes Block and the Milner Group.
[03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:56.068]  MI6 was created in 1909 by a committee of Lord Milner's friends, namely the War Secretary Richard Haldane.
[03:50:56.068 --> 03:50:58.611]  Its first chief was Mansfield Cumming,
[03:50:59.935 --> 03:51:09.450]  Who was under Secretary Sir Charles Harding, the protege of Lord Salisbury from the Cecil Block.
[03:51:09.450 --> 03:51:13.075]  In 1940, the Milner Group now headed up by Lord Lionel Curtis.
[03:51:14.065 --> 03:51:17.327]  Was again in charge of the Foreign Office and controlled MI6.
[03:51:17.327 --> 03:51:24.432]  Lord Halifax was the Foreign Secretary and his fellow Milnerite member Lord Lothian was the British Ambassador to the United States.
[03:51:24.432 --> 03:51:31.658]  As part of the Milner Group's global expansion, MI6 set up an American station called the British Security Coordination, the BSC.
[03:51:31.658 --> 03:51:37.041]  This organization was responsible for operations for the entire Western Hemisphere for British intelligence.
[03:51:37.041 --> 03:51:39.563]  Guess where it was headquartered?
[03:51:39.563 --> 03:51:41.705]  The New York Rockefeller Center
[03:51:42.845 --> 03:51:50.306]  Namely, and it was run by Intrepid, codename Intrepid, William Stevenson, Canadian Intelligence.
[03:51:50.306 --> 03:51:55.908]  In 1941, Stevenson set up the Office of Coordination of Information, the COI.
[03:51:55.908 --> 03:51:57.268]  It coordinated different U.S.
[03:51:57.268 --> 03:52:03.929]  intelligence services and was advised by, and was advisor to, FDR.
[03:52:03.929 --> 03:52:08.870]  They appointed as the head of that organization, in its nascent form, Wild Bill Donovan.
[03:52:09.679 --> 03:52:15.142]  And in 1942, it was reorganized and called the OSS, Office of Strategic Services.
[03:52:15.142 --> 03:52:20.345]  After the war in 1947, the OSS was reorganized to be the CIA.
[03:52:20.345 --> 03:52:28.869]  And so, shocker, it was always there to promote the interests of these people.
[03:52:28.869 --> 03:52:36.393]  Soon after, the banker Allen Dulles, the younger brother of CFR UN co-founder John Foster Dulles, became the director of the CIA.
[03:52:37.399 --> 03:52:42.025]  Since that time, most CIA directors have been members of the CFR.
[03:52:42.025 --> 03:52:44.869]  David Rockefeller himself became a member of the U.S.
[03:52:44.869 --> 03:52:48.213]  Joint Intelligence Collection Agency in North Africa.
[03:52:51.067 --> 03:53:00.669]  Later on, David Rockefeller described in his memoirs that a lot of this intelligence work that he had done at this time was able to connect him with people throughout the world, and it was mainly done for oil interests.
[03:53:00.669 --> 03:53:05.590]  So it wasn't really even about Cold War or World War II stuff or whatever.
[03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:10.071]  This was actually just about gaining intelligence for their private oil interests.
[03:53:10.071 --> 03:53:15.832]  And in fact, Rockefeller says that he was able to set up his own private intelligence network out of all of this.
[03:53:15.832 --> 03:53:17.033]  For what purpose?
[03:53:17.033 --> 03:53:18.753]  For Standard Oil, you see.
[03:53:20.635 --> 03:53:27.178]  Then we move on to discuss the, Ratshude moves on to discuss the history of Chatham House, the Royal Society, and all that.
[03:53:27.178 --> 03:53:33.402]  And again, this is not conspiracy, it is all 100% public information.
[03:53:33.402 --> 03:53:44.487]  It was the first, one of the first heads of the OSS, was in fact a Milnerite Fabian Socialist.
[03:53:44.487 --> 03:53:49.470]  And this has partly to do with the fact that when David Rockefeller studied under von Hayek,
[03:53:50.220 --> 03:53:56.444]  It was sort of infatuated with the Austrian economic ideas that Von Hayek talked about.
[03:53:56.444 --> 03:54:04.909]  By the way, I want to remind the Libertarians that the last appendix chapter of Von Hayek's Road to Serfdom is about world government.
[03:54:04.909 --> 03:54:15.236]  So I'm tired of hearing the Libertarians talking about how great Von Hayek is, and they never talk about the fact that the appendix has a whole section on how we need world government.
[03:54:15.236 --> 03:54:16.277]  Beyond that, however,
[03:54:17.845 --> 03:54:25.512]  After that period, Rockefeller went on to study at Harvard, as we said, under Lasky, the famous Fabian Socialist at Harvard.
[03:54:25.512 --> 03:54:29.215]  And so there, he decided that he was actually interested in both of these things.
[03:54:29.215 --> 03:54:39.123]  So we can clearly see in David Rockefeller's ideological journey, an influence of both monopoly capital, and because that's what he is, right, and Fabian Socialism, and that explains why
[03:54:40.365 --> 03:54:44.088]  His entities like the OSS went and trained Mao's guerrillas.
[03:54:44.088 --> 03:54:48.150]  That explains why Chase Bank is the first bank set up in Communist China.
[03:54:48.150 --> 03:54:54.475]  That explains why he writes editorials to the New York Times saying that China is a model for the world.
[03:54:54.475 --> 03:54:59.418]  It is a model for collectivization and centralization of wealth, power, and control.
[03:54:59.418 --> 03:55:02.400]  He says it's a fabulous experiment.
[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:04.281]  Same thing Bertrand Russell had said back in the 1930s.
[03:55:06.681 --> 03:55:09.982]  He says, Bertrand Russell's Bolshevism, Maoism, Stalinism.
[03:55:09.982 --> 03:55:17.323]  He says, these are great experiments in the other countries to see how we can rule.
[03:55:17.323 --> 03:55:21.064]  Did you think that Mao was just some organic revolutionary?
[03:55:21.064 --> 03:55:22.024]  Where does Mao come from?
[03:55:22.024 --> 03:55:24.165]  You know, it's publicly classified.
[03:55:24.165 --> 03:55:25.985]  You can go read it at Yale.
[03:55:25.985 --> 03:55:28.166]  You can read the Yale archives.
[03:55:28.166 --> 03:55:28.966]  Who was Mao?
[03:55:28.966 --> 03:55:30.706]  Mao was a Yali.
[03:55:30.706 --> 03:55:31.767]  What's a Yali?
[03:55:31.767 --> 03:55:32.647]  Yale in China.
[03:55:35.006 --> 03:55:52.874]  So, when we understand, quickly, when we understand these higher-level meta-politics discussions, we understand that this was always a long-term game to establish what Klaus and company, who work for these people, are rolling out.
[03:55:52.874 --> 03:55:57.076]  I'm not saying there wasn't spies on the ground in the Cold War battling each other.
[03:55:57.076 --> 03:55:57.556]  Sure, there were.
[03:55:58.880 --> 03:56:21.443]  But the death care, the banning of cars, the banning of meat, the eating of the bugs, the banning of travel, 15-minute cities, the banning of commerce, shutting everything down, the eco-tyranny, the Agenda 21, the Rio Bush Treaty, the 2030 plans, UN biodiversity plans, all of those things are designed by the same people.
[03:56:21.443 --> 03:56:22.124]  All the same people.
[03:56:23.146 --> 03:56:30.072]  So, it's very easy to figure out what's going on when we look at the actual documentation, the actual books.
[03:56:30.072 --> 03:56:36.377]  We go read books like Stephen Doral's amazing, amazing history of MI6.
[03:56:36.377 --> 03:56:39.019]  It says all the same stuff.
[03:56:39.019 --> 03:56:41.841]  In fact, this book cites Doral's book.
[03:56:41.841 --> 03:56:42.662]  Who is Stephen Doral?
[03:56:42.662 --> 03:56:43.402]  A conspiracy theorist?
[03:56:43.402 --> 03:56:45.224]  No, mainline academia.
[03:56:45.224 --> 03:56:47.766]  Mainline academia.
[03:56:47.766 --> 03:56:49.627]  Not conspiracy theories.
[03:56:49.627 --> 03:56:52.430]  Anybody calling this conspiracy theories to this day still
[03:56:53.357 --> 03:57:00.538]  Is just ignorant or a gaslighting goon.
[03:57:00.538 --> 03:57:08.860]  So I hope we understand that what we're seeing rolled out is not... Imagine still thinking, these incompetent liberals!
[03:57:08.860 --> 03:57:14.081]  How are they rolling this out across the globe if they're incompetent liberals?
[03:57:14.081 --> 03:57:16.161]  It's not incompetent liberals until we realize it's not.
[03:57:16.161 --> 03:57:18.682]  There's a layer of incompetent liberals, but above that is...
[03:57:20.447 --> 03:57:22.829]  Super manipulative, psychopathic technocrats.
[03:57:22.829 --> 03:57:25.471]  Until we realize that, nothing's going to change, nothing's going to be fixed.
[03:57:25.471 --> 03:57:29.314]  And the right will remain completely emasculated and worthless.
[03:57:29.314 --> 03:57:31.336]  Until we figure this out.
[03:57:31.336 --> 03:57:34.578]  If you want to get access to my books, go to Jason Ellis' in the shop.
[03:57:34.578 --> 03:57:36.920]  You can find my Hollywood texts.

[03:57:47.566 --> 03:57:50.591]  InfoWars secret weapon is finally here.

[03:59:29.751 --> 03:59:38.754]  As for Vitamin C and Zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:59:38.754 --> 03:59:44.996]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
