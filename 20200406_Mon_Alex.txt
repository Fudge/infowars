[00:00.000 --> 00:10.200]  It is Monday, April 6th. The year is 2020. I am your host, Alex Jones. When we pull back
[00:10.200 --> 00:15.400]  and look at what's unfolding across this planet, clearly we are being domesticated. We are
[00:15.400 --> 00:19.760]  being brought into a medical tyranny. But what is the end game of the individuals carrying
[00:19.760 --> 00:25.480]  this out? Whether it's the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, Debo's Group, or the
[00:25.480 --> 00:30.640]  private world government group that Bill Gates set up with Jeffrey Epstein, Warren Buffett,
[00:30.640 --> 00:39.320]  Ted Turner, and others, their goal is depopulation. They see everyone else but themselves as cancers
[00:39.320 --> 00:45.440]  that live on the planet that they themselves have conquered. They have taken the world
[00:45.440 --> 00:51.400]  over through fraud, through fractional reserve banking, and through other criminal activities.
[00:51.400 --> 00:58.760]  And now they see us as useless eaters that aren't just cheap, who aren't just stupid,
[00:58.760 --> 01:05.160]  who aren't just ugly, but who are actually a negative, like garbage, that has negative
[01:05.160 --> 01:11.360]  value that needs to be taken out and thrown into a rubbish heap. We're seen as weevils
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.680]  that have gotten into their flower stores. We're seen as raccoons that have raided the
[01:16.680 --> 01:21.840]  refrigerator. We're seen worse than that. We're seen as cockroaches. And when you go
[01:21.840 --> 01:27.560]  back throughout history, every culture, whether it was the Aztecs or the ancient Babylonians
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.600]  or the ancient Druids, got into human sacrifice. There were always priest classes that were
[01:33.600 --> 01:40.800]  set up who would demand human sacrifice, particularly of children. And if you go read all the ancient
[01:40.800 --> 01:47.600]  text and quote, sacred scrolls of these groups, those priesthoods always at the end of a civilization
[01:47.600 --> 01:56.480]  would arise and would demand the blood of virgins, i.e. children. And they said that
[01:56.480 --> 02:04.520]  they were getting a dark energy or a dark force from it and that entities like the flying
[02:04.520 --> 02:13.240]  serpent and others would appear and give them sacred knowledge, mathematics, medicine and
[02:13.240 --> 02:19.480]  keys to this planet and understanding the universe we live in. This is the classical
[02:19.480 --> 02:28.120]  story that we see in the Old Testament first book of Genesis with this fallen one appearing
[02:28.120 --> 02:34.280]  as a serpent and then giving Adam and Eve the knowledge of not just good, but the knowledge
[02:34.280 --> 02:43.400]  of evil. And evil is, again, a cancer or a virus, a program of corruption on how to set
[02:43.400 --> 02:49.080]  up corrupt, twisted, manipulative, parasitic systems. That is the knowledge of good and
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.400]  evil. And if you look at every culture at the time, they believe that off-world advanced
[02:54.400 --> 03:00.680]  species who had a taste for children's blood, in every case, were giving them this advanced
[03:00.680 --> 03:07.160]  power, but, again, not to increase humans' longevity or make us better people or have
[03:07.160 --> 03:16.080]  a better life, to build temples and civilizations based in and around the killing and sacrifice
[03:16.080 --> 03:21.320]  of children and the innocence to release the dark energy. So that's why the abortuaries
[03:21.320 --> 03:25.800]  must stay open across the planet. That's why China has killed 400 million of its own children
[03:25.800 --> 03:30.200]  before they were born, 50 plus million after they were born. That's why they have to keep
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.400]  the abortuaries open across the United States, because it's seen as a form of sacrifice.
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.480]  And more and more comes out in FBI files that abortionists actually say they are high priests
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.800]  that are carrying this out, not for Satan, but for the Earth goddess that demands blood.
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.400]  Because all of this even predates the cosmology of Satan. Though, obviously, it is Satan.
[03:50.400 --> 03:55.000]  They believe they're doing it to save Mother Earth. Plato wrote about this in his republic
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.440]  2,200 plus years ago, and it leads down through to the modern age. This is eugenics. That's
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.360]  why Chuck E. Schumer, a month ago, threatened Trump's life and threatened the Supreme Court's
[04:08.360 --> 04:14.000]  life. Instead of Trump and the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and what we're doing,
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.440]  we are going to get them. We are going to take them down. We are going to destroy them.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.800]  And he actually showed some energy in life for the first time in his career, because
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.400]  now we're getting close to the apple of his eye, the stinking sacrifice of children, the
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.440]  blood of the innocent. And that's what all of this is about. And now they're going to
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.360]  move against all of humanity with this medical tyranny, with forced inoculations. They're
[04:37.360 --> 04:42.840]  preparing to shut down California for two weeks where you can't even leave your house.
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.440]  I said this yesterday on the show from our sources. Now it's being officially announced.
[04:47.440 --> 04:50.800]  They're getting you ready for it. This is a process of teaching you to be a prisoner
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.800]  in your own home. Awaken and say no and spread this link to everyone you know across the
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.280]  Internet. Now you have the power to say no to the same time during the month of March
[05:01.280 --> 05:10.040]  in the year 2020. The nations of the planet began to slip permanently into a form of martial
[05:10.040 --> 05:20.280]  law, a technocracy, a control grid enforced by a medical tyranny aided by robots and drones.
[05:20.280 --> 05:28.120]  Overseeing the human population, everyone was suspect. Everyone could be a carrier.
[05:28.120 --> 05:32.480]  It didn't matter if it was the common cold that had been weaponized. It didn't matter
[05:32.480 --> 05:37.520]  it came out of the wool on level four by a weapons lab. It didn't matter if Bill Gates'
[05:37.520 --> 05:44.440]  fingerprints were all over it. The crime was so big that no one dared challenge the power
[05:44.440 --> 05:52.320]  structure and thousands of years of hard fought basic jurisprudence of human rights disappeared
[05:52.320 --> 05:58.200]  in the twinkle of an eye and humanity slipped beneath the waves of the long dark winter.
[05:58.200 --> 06:16.560]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. Economists usually aren't
[06:16.560 --> 06:21.480]  unanimous on something, but I've done a wide survey of economists. There's several articles
[06:21.480 --> 06:27.920]  just up today with leading economist on infowars.com saying that if the shutdown continues into
[06:27.920 --> 06:35.400]  late April or early May, that it will cause a great depression. And if you notice, the
[06:35.400 --> 06:40.720]  blue cities, the Democrat controlled areas, the authoritarian nations like Communist China
[06:40.720 --> 06:45.280]  and the European Union system are all saying they want to shut down for six months to a
[06:45.280 --> 06:51.040]  year and a half, but China isn't. They know full well this will wreck the economy, wreck
[06:51.040 --> 06:56.560]  generations of savings, and devastate the medical system in this country. You think you've
[06:56.560 --> 07:01.960]  seen death so far. You wait till we're in a real great depression and this complex society
[07:01.960 --> 07:08.960]  breaks down. Back in the 1920s and 30s, more than half the population was self-sufficient.
[07:08.960 --> 07:15.360]  90% lived in rural areas. Now those numbers are more than reversed with about 10% living
[07:15.360 --> 07:21.000]  in rural areas. About half of them somewhat self-sufficient. So 5% of the population is
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.120]  self-sufficient. Now I know I've hammered this over and over again, but we've been made dependent
[07:27.120 --> 07:31.800]  with over 80% of our drugs, made in common to China, most of our computer components
[07:31.800 --> 07:37.760]  made in China, and now the globalists are showing us that you think you're going to
[07:37.760 --> 07:41.400]  escape our system. You think you're going to win a trade deal. You think you're going
[07:41.400 --> 07:45.800]  to stop the decline of America and the shutdown of our industry that they had set up by one
[07:45.800 --> 07:53.040]  side of trade deals over 50 years? No. We will show you, by monkey see monkey do, authoritarian
[07:53.040 --> 08:00.000]  states, set the precedent of total shutdown. And we'll show you numbers of dead comparable
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.320]  to what the flu kills in those nations each year. But we will personalize every single
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.640]  death of these people and hype it up like they do school shootings. And we will absolutely
[08:12.640 --> 08:17.800]  have big corporations shut down to trigger the decline of the economy. Then once it
[08:17.800 --> 08:22.920]  implodes and once nationalism and populism and capitalism is discredited, the globalists
[08:22.920 --> 08:29.040]  will just turn the money machines back on. They'll buy up the entire global market that
[08:29.040 --> 08:34.760]  they all got out of in December and January. Over 200 major CEOs, over 100 billionaires
[08:34.760 --> 08:40.000]  dumping record stock because you can't all put them in jail for insider trading. And
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.480]  now then again in unison, as a globalist strike against the people in the free market,
[08:46.480 --> 08:52.840]  they hold the economy hostage and shut down. This is the big issue. Not, not, oh, we're
[08:52.840 --> 08:59.840]  going to start having 2,400 people die a day at the peak by mid-April. That's terrible.
[08:59.840 --> 09:06.160]  That's, that's sad. But this is something that's always happened on earth. And anybody
[09:06.160 --> 09:11.000]  that tells you that you can stay locked up and you can control things like this is a
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.880]  liar. Now I'm not saying if you want a social distance, you shouldn't. I'm not saying if
[09:14.880 --> 09:19.800]  you want to stay in your home, you shouldn't. I'm pointing out the whole thing has been
[09:19.800 --> 09:28.600]  contrived from the beginning and organized, choreographed, orchestrated, and they admit
[09:28.600 --> 09:34.840]  they are and now Bill Gates funds Fauci and Fauci and all the rest of them are on TV saying
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.560]  we're not going to let you out and stop these restrictions till we have the vaccine, till
[09:39.560 --> 09:43.440]  we have the apps ready to roll out, which they already have in the vaccine. But that'll
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.600]  be next year to make you beg for it. And that you can never live the same until no one's
[09:48.600 --> 09:53.480]  dying of this virus or other viruses. Well, this is ruled by terror. This is ruled by
[09:53.480 --> 09:59.040]  virus. This is a biological dictatorship of the medical tyranny. Everything that we predicted
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.320]  because they were preparing this, they were gearing this up. This is their move in their
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.680]  white papers and their laws and in their movies and in the culture. They have absolutely primed
[10:09.680 --> 10:17.440]  the public for this. And then up front said, oh, it's just a two week extended spring break.
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.440]  You'll, you'll all be back after that. Remember that in March, start of March? And I told
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.080]  people back then I said, ladies and gentlemen, it'll be one month, two months. And if Trump
[10:29.080 --> 10:33.280]  can be hoodwinks into doing that, at the two month mark, we're done. Well, we're coming
[10:33.280 --> 10:38.560]  up on that in a few weeks and the economist agree, we will be absolutely totally screwed.
[10:38.560 --> 10:43.480]  Meanwhile, you've got a lot of the millennials and folks running around engaged in mentally
[10:43.480 --> 10:50.320]  ill activity, spitting and licking food and getting tackled and getting attacked. You've
[10:50.320 --> 10:55.000]  got other people calling the police in the UK and the US and in Spain on families in
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.920]  their backyards, barbecuing or families playing frisbee in their front yard or badminton in
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.440]  their front yard or weightlifting in their front yard. And that's why Newsom said over
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.000]  a month ago when he ordered the first lockdown in California, he said, listen, we need to
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.360]  call it martial law. The public with peer pressure is doing more than we even wanted.
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.600]  He was laughing about it to see how pliant the people were. So this is the new enforcement
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.000]  system. And this is what the nanny state has created. And these people that believe the
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.800]  state is going to take care of them, they want to prove how compliant they are and how
[11:27.800 --> 11:34.600]  good they are. Here's a microcosm of that. It's a big scandal that if a woman goes in
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.760]  and even has a polyp that is precancerous that they could easily just remove with a very
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.400]  inexpensive surgery where she's not even put under, they just numb the area, send in a
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.920]  biopsy point, remove it, make sure it's all gone, make sure nothing's cancerous around
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.280]  it. And they've got a 99.9% recovery rate with it never coming back. But it turns out
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.720]  those very common types of precancerous growths on a routine basis. If a woman goes in and
[11:59.720 --> 12:06.800]  totally trust them, they will do a major surgery, a mastectomy, remove that entire breast, sometimes
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.280]  tell her, oh, it's in your genetics to have breast cancer. Let's go ahead and remove the
[12:09.280 --> 12:14.040]  other one. Then they'll hit them with chemotherapy, which gives you cancer down the road. It's
[12:14.040 --> 12:17.880]  the number one cause of cancer is chemotherapy. Look it up. And then they'll hit you with
[12:17.880 --> 12:25.120]  up to six weeks of daily radiation. Those women are usually dead within five years,
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.320]  most of all sorts of sicknesses and problems. A lot of times women have heart attacks within
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.600]  four or five years. I spent a lot of time researching this last night because let's
[12:33.600 --> 12:38.080]  just say this, I have some not distant family, but not super close family that they're doing
[12:38.080 --> 12:45.120]  this to right now. They're killing her. And so I did hours of research last night looking
[12:45.120 --> 12:52.120]  at it and just refreshing my memory. Anybody can type into a search engine, women giving
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.600]  too much radiation, women who don't have breast cancer or being given breast cancer surgeries.
[12:57.600 --> 13:04.960]  I mean, it's crazy when it then comes home and you're watching the mind control of the
[13:04.960 --> 13:11.080]  sheep and of the compliant where doctors are gods. And meanwhile, the hospital's private.
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.080]  It's just got an actuary to its bioethics board that says if the person complies, hit
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.360]  them with everything you've got, get as much money out of them. They've got great insurance
[13:20.360 --> 13:25.840]  and then basically kill them. So that's how this thing operates. And that's how being
[13:25.840 --> 13:32.640]  compliant will get your ass killed. My grandmother, my dad's mom, super healthy, great lady.
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.520]  She had a broken blood vessel in her lung. It came up. They said, well, it could be cancerous.
[13:37.520 --> 13:42.800]  We want to cut part of your lung out. She lived another 15 years, but they made her
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.400]  have a stroke that messed up her heart. And it's just, it was just unbelievable to watch
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.120]  it ruin her life. And they admitted it wasn't cancer. My mom's mom, they went in saying
[13:53.120 --> 13:56.040]  she had cancer. It was early cancer. Then they came back and said, oh, we want to remove
[13:56.040 --> 14:02.680]  the whole breast a few years later. She said, screw you and lived over 12 years after that.
[14:02.680 --> 14:07.200]  Her doctor quote fired her as a patient said, you'll be probably dead in three years. Well,
[14:07.200 --> 14:12.680]  she lived 12 years scumbag. So that's what we're getting at here, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.080]  is that these doctors just do what the hospitals tell them. They put in the codes in the computer
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.960]  and it tells them what to do. They have no liability because the big bioepics boards
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.000]  programmed by folks like Bill Gates control it. There are still some good doctors out
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.120]  there, but the main line system is predatory and is evil. And it ties into the whole forced
[14:31.120 --> 14:36.200]  inoculation. And that's the other big closing news here before Owen takes over.
[14:36.200 --> 14:42.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a call, a special Saturday show I got by a man called X in California
[14:42.800 --> 14:48.080]  two weeks before they shut down California and had the lockdown. He said that he talked
[14:48.080 --> 14:54.720]  to the folks, the Dracleaners and that the Draclean's the police uniforms in Orange County
[14:54.720 --> 14:57.600]  and that they were going to be locking down coming up on that Monday. It happened exactly
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.240]  as he said. The same fella called in and said that he talked to his sources and they said
[15:02.240 --> 15:05.800]  that coming up within two weeks, Newsom is going to say for two weeks, you got to stay
[15:05.800 --> 15:08.960]  in your house completely. And you've only got a few days to get groceries and you're
[15:08.960 --> 15:14.320]  totally locked down. It's all a psychological warfare test, a huge open air experiment to
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.240]  then set the precedent to say Trump's got to keep the economy closed as well. He's not
[15:18.240 --> 15:21.880]  doing as much good as the Democrats. Then when people die of Trump opens the economy,
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.320]  they're going to blame him. Well, I made some calls to sources and they said, yes, Newsom
[15:25.320 --> 15:30.360]  is looking and so is Cuomo to totally lock things down for at least another month and
[15:30.360 --> 15:35.280]  it make the martial law even tighter. So again, this will create a depression. If Trump bucks
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.920]  it, then they'll blame him for every death. This is their master plan. But either way,
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.400]  they're going to blame Trump and America. All right, back to Owen shroyer and the live
[15:42.400 --> 15:45.800]  global transmission. Please tell everybody to tune in. That's how we reach new people.
[15:45.800 --> 15:49.640]  That's how we override the sensors. That's how we defeat the globalist in full wars.com

[17:06.240 --> 17:11.280]  quarantines, this will be the most important message you will ever hear. Here's why in
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.880]  the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices. If we've learned anything
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.680]  from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days
[17:21.680 --> 17:27.120]  away here in the US. Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.880]  enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one acre crisis garden. The truth is growing
[17:32.880 --> 17:37.200]  nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.680]  thing you do. Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature
[17:42.680 --> 17:48.400]  of the threat. This could be life saving. Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.
[17:48.400 --> 17:59.040]  Get free bonus seeds. Special quarantine reports too. Go to survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[17:59.040 --> 18:07.320]  It's incontrovertible. Humanity is dying. Every metric, every gauge we have shows that
[18:07.320 --> 18:16.320]  we're living shorter lives. We are diseased. Our IQs are plunging and we're ugly. We're
[18:16.320 --> 18:23.160]  falling apart. Big pharma and the entire lovelest operation is a kill grid. And the studies
[18:23.160 --> 18:30.320]  are clear. The average person is in a dream like state, a near dream like daydream world
[18:30.320 --> 18:37.520]  program of the flicker rates of the televisions and all the screens. We are in a trance and
[18:37.520 --> 18:43.120]  now they're turning up the power of the ambient electromagnetic radiation, which again, all
[18:43.120 --> 18:49.120]  the studies conclusively show, cause massive cancer and destroy your immune system and
[18:49.120 --> 18:55.240]  push viruses across the cell membrane. We are being murdered. And I've got to tell you,
[18:55.240 --> 19:03.840]  it's very sophisticated and looks not human. As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[19:03.840 --> 19:12.000]  in vitality, energy and overall wellness. And that's why we made one of our most popular
[19:12.000 --> 19:20.640]  formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper
[19:20.640 --> 19:27.840]  balance to create superior vitality in males. Now look, this unique formula promotes your
[19:27.840 --> 19:35.920]  body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[19:35.920 --> 19:43.360]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.680]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula. What
[19:48.680 --> 19:55.280]  are you waiting for? Go to the info or store. Never been a better time than right now. Super
[19:55.280 --> 20:18.120]  male vitality at info or store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show, leading
[20:18.120 --> 20:31.040]  a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order. It's Alex Jones, sitting in for Alex
[20:31.040 --> 20:46.080]  Jones. Now, ladies and gentlemen, even the best captain of a ship or a boat, even the
[20:46.080 --> 20:54.440]  best in the world. If he's out on choppy seas, if he's out on the ocean in the middle
[20:54.440 --> 21:05.560]  of a hurricane, like in Timothy of the K. Well, even the best captain in the world is likely
[21:05.560 --> 21:16.440]  to lose control of that boat and capsize and for everybody to be under water, even the
[21:16.440 --> 21:23.920]  best. And that's where we're at right now, folks. Now I've prayed to God for clarity
[21:23.920 --> 21:30.400]  on this and guidance on this. And I've got all the news laid out here organized with
[21:30.400 --> 21:37.160]  all the headlines. If you guys want to do a doc cam here, I've got my coffee from info
[21:37.160 --> 21:44.520]  or store.com. Wake up America, Patriot blend. So you know, I'm energized and focused. So
[21:44.520 --> 21:48.960]  we'll go through all the news. We'll try to make sense of it all. We'll see if we even
[21:48.960 --> 21:58.880]  can. But here's one thing that's clear to me. There is no debate on this. America has
[21:58.880 --> 22:10.360]  a choice to make this week or this month. What we want our future to look like. And
[22:10.360 --> 22:22.000]  if we decide we're willing to hand it all over and give it all up out of fear and then
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.920]  let the government run our lives, tell us when we can't operate our business when we
[22:26.920 --> 22:35.320]  can or can't work or drive or commute or engage in social activities or commerce or anything.
[22:35.320 --> 22:44.920]  Well then we've actually handed over America. And so you're going to see the death counts
[22:44.920 --> 22:49.000]  rise in the coronavirus graphics and you're going to see it all and it's going to keep
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.560]  happening in the press conferences and the this and the that. But it's ultimately going
[22:55.560 --> 23:00.000]  to be the same issue that we're facing and it's not this virus, folks. Yeah, is the virus
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.720]  deadly? Is it going around? Is it a bio weapon? We're going to get into all of that. But what
[23:05.720 --> 23:09.400]  happens at the end of this debate, whether it's another month, two months, three months
[23:09.400 --> 23:14.240]  a year, what happens when we wake up and I guess maybe we just decide it's finally over,
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.760]  it is finally over and then America is dead. The economy is dead and socialism has now
[23:20.760 --> 23:32.680]  taken over and a one world government infrastructure has taken over. What then? What do you do then?
[23:32.680 --> 23:40.400]  Nobody's asking that. Nobody cares about that. No, actually people do care. You just not
[23:40.400 --> 23:54.880]  seeing or hearing them in government, in media because they've all been censored. Now, who
[23:54.880 --> 24:00.960]  though? Who? And I promise you, we're going to get through all of this news day and then
[24:00.960 --> 24:08.080]  the guests coming up G Edward Griffin and Gerald Salenty and I'm going to get to all
[24:08.080 --> 24:19.480]  this news. But who or what news organization has had you more prepared for this than anyone
[24:19.480 --> 24:27.120]  else out there? Well, that would be info wars, wouldn't it? So they can say whatever they
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.280]  want about Alex Jones and info wars and try to censor us off of everything and demonize
[24:32.280 --> 24:38.840]  us and lie about us and engage in all kinds of lawfare against us. But who had you more
[24:38.840 --> 24:45.760]  prepared for this moment than anyone else out there? Well, I don't think there's a debate
[24:45.760 --> 24:59.800]  on that is there? It's been Alex Jones. It's been info wars. And now you even see UK ministers
[24:59.800 --> 25:06.280]  no longer discounting theory that coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China. Well, who
[25:06.280 --> 25:16.040]  told you that first? But we don't have that conversation, do we? We don't have that debate,
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.120]  do we? Is that because we did report it first? So if info wars report something first, then
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.880]  we just don't count it. That how that goes. So I guess in a weird ironic way info wars
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.080]  is actually the best and the worst thing in the world. It's the best thing in the world
[25:28.080 --> 25:31.440]  because well, we've warned you about all this. We're next year's news today. We're the most
[25:31.440 --> 25:35.760]  accurate cutting edge. Oh, but then there's the other aspect. Well, info wars reported
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.760]  it. So we're just going to ignore it. Oh, came out of a lab in Wuhan. Nobody talked
[25:40.760 --> 25:48.440]  about that info wars reported it first. We don't want to give them any credit. So let's
[25:48.440 --> 25:56.400]  just ignore that. Let's just not respond to that. Let's not look into that. Well, as the
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.720]  days go by, more and more people are starting to realize you can censor info wars as much
[26:02.720 --> 26:12.040]  as you want, but the truth will still get out. And so now there's doctors, government
[26:12.040 --> 26:17.280]  officials all over the world looking at the bio weapons lab in Wuhan right next to the
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.680]  outbreak probably never even heard them in fours or Alex Jones and they're just saying,
[26:21.680 --> 26:29.320]  what are the odds of that? What are the odds that the one most censored news organization
[26:29.320 --> 26:38.320]  in America told you that back in January? And if you even recall, folks, I remember sitting
[26:38.320 --> 26:46.400]  right here in this studio talking to Francis Boyle when this was first happening. When
[26:46.400 --> 26:49.840]  we were on the front lines of this, the lines weren't even formed yet. We were on the front
[26:49.840 --> 27:00.320]  lines. And I remember just sitting there thinking like, my gosh, because they always do this,
[27:00.320 --> 27:06.280]  folks. They cannot. It's like, if we say something, then they just immediately discount it no
[27:06.280 --> 27:12.520]  matter how real it is. Hey, Trump's probably going to beat Hillary. What info wars are
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.080]  saying over here? Trump's going to be Hillary 99% of the New York Times. Hillary's going
[27:18.080 --> 27:25.960]  to win that info wars over there. They were saying Trump was going to get out of the Republican
[27:25.960 --> 27:33.320]  nomination process to they're crazy. Oops, it all happened. Hey, those info wars guys,
[27:33.320 --> 27:39.880]  they said these social media companies are going to start censoring people. Yeah, right.
[27:39.880 --> 27:48.680]  Alex Jones laughable. Oh, wait, they did. Now they don't even let you put pictures on
[27:48.680 --> 27:54.840]  Instagram or other places of personalities quote unquote, they've deemed. I don't even
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.320]  know what they've deemed them, but they just can't be shared on the internet. The Voldemorts
[27:59.320 --> 28:06.920]  of the world. Hey, did you see those conspiracy theorists over at info wars talking about a
[28:06.920 --> 28:14.400]  bio weapons lab in Wuhan? That made me chuckle. I also heard him say that we should shut down
[28:14.400 --> 28:26.640]  the borders and stop people coming in from China. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So it's almost
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.880]  like maybe we should just go away and disappear so that other people can report on this news
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.920]  and then maybe they'll take it seriously. Because for whatever reason, if we report
[28:37.920 --> 28:45.360]  it first, they don't seem to listen. Are you listening yet? Here's what we're telling
[28:45.360 --> 28:58.520]  you now. You better free America or she will die. You better put a date on this. We can
[28:58.520 --> 29:04.400]  all agree. These are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[30:04.400 --> 30:11.080]  K formula is back in stock. Winter sun. In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your
[30:11.080 --> 30:16.120]  body when you're not getting sunlight on the skin does not produce vitamin D3. So it's
[30:16.120 --> 30:21.880]  important to be ingested, but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut. So you take
[30:21.880 --> 30:27.320]  this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there about 30 seconds
[30:27.320 --> 30:33.560]  to a minute and then you swallow the rest and it's just amazing. It's back in stock

[30:59.000 --> 31:05.480]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key. Sure, coffee, candy
[31:05.480 --> 31:11.960]  and other highly sugar filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[31:11.960 --> 31:18.320]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[31:18.320 --> 31:24.800]  Turbo force. Similar to other mix in energy packets, turbo force from info wars life utilizes

[31:31.920 --> 31:38.120]  focus, clarity and a boost of energy when you need it. Turbo force is certainly a force
[31:38.120 --> 31:44.680]  to be reckoned with for portable, affordable and tasty energy. And speaking of affordable,
[31:44.680 --> 31:51.280]  you can even try turbo force for a limited time at an incredible 40% off. Don't wait

[31:59.400 --> 32:05.840]  Listen to me very carefully. We have confirmed that California is set within days or weeks
[32:05.840 --> 32:11.880]  to announce a total stay at home order and we'll shut down grocery stores and yes, even
[32:11.880 --> 32:17.280]  pharmacies, ladies and gentlemen, this is what they're announcing to create total panic
[32:17.280 --> 32:22.000]  to try to trigger a depression to blame on Trump. Then when Trump doesn't fall suit,
[32:22.000 --> 32:29.640]  they will blame every single death on President Trump. This is a Psyop using a real deadly
[32:29.640 --> 32:36.320]  virus. This is super dangerous and everyone needs to get supplies in now. The food chain
[32:36.320 --> 32:43.200]  is getting low as well and you need to get the supplements just to be safe at infowarstore.com
[32:43.200 --> 32:47.080]  and stock up because who knows in the future if we'll even be able to operate. We're ready

[33:02.160 --> 33:09.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:09.160 --> 33:17.760]  We now take you live to the central Texas commence ever and the heart of the resistance
[33:17.760 --> 33:32.760]  and now your host, Olin Troyer.
[33:32.760 --> 33:55.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Sitting in for Alex today, I am Olin Troyer. The news
[33:55.080 --> 34:02.600]  just continues to pile up on my desk. I'm going to do my best to get to all of it.
[34:02.600 --> 34:13.400]  I want to get to a couple video clips first. Obviously, President Trump is doing daily
[34:13.400 --> 34:19.360]  press conferences. See, this is the problem. I just, I say one thing and then immediately
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.720]  it's like a million things just went off in my head like an explosion. Hey, Trump's
[34:24.720 --> 34:28.320]  doing a daily press conference and then he goes to my head. Why hasn't he been doing
[34:28.320 --> 34:33.720]  this for three years? Why didn't he do this when the Obama spy gate was breaking, the
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.920]  FISA abuse was breaking, the Comey leaks were breaking, the Hillary email cover up
[34:37.920 --> 34:41.640]  was breaking. I mean, we should have been having these daily press briefings for the
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.080]  last three years dealing with the damn date state and we might not be in this mess right
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.160]  now. Sorry, I'm ranting, but see, it just, that's how it works, folks. But I just have
[34:51.160 --> 34:54.840]  to bury that. Hey, the president should have been doing daily press briefings on all the
[34:54.840 --> 35:00.360]  abuses during the Obama years and the illegal spying and the drug running and the gun running
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.040]  and the State Department abuses and Benghazi and the cover up of Hillary Clinton and the
[35:05.040 --> 35:08.920]  emails and everything in the WikiLeaks with the kids in the pool for their entertainment
[35:08.920 --> 35:13.720]  and Anthony Weiner and Laura Sillsby. We should have been having daily press conferences.
[35:13.720 --> 35:19.480]  We should have been doing this. Sorry, it's just like, you know, now I'm dealing with
[35:19.480 --> 35:28.600]  it. So let's go to Trump, one of the anti-Trump, just 95% of them in the media asking President
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.120]  Trump why he hasn't closed all grocery stores. Obviously, we know anyone can spread the
[35:33.120 --> 35:37.960]  disease, right? Unwittingly. Right. So why even have a few businesses open? Why not just
[35:37.960 --> 35:41.680]  shut everything down? They're a grocery store that are open, fast food places. Why even
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.720]  take a little chance? Just shut it away. We'll answer that question later. All I can
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.560]  say is that right now, things are looking really good and opening up with a bang will
[35:50.560 --> 35:57.600]  be a great thing. And there's nobody going to be happier than me. Now, the reporter actually
[35:57.600 --> 36:04.080]  asked a fair question. But it's the same issue that's been the problem, folks. How do you
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.960]  decide what gets open and what gets closed? Hey, we're going to make grocery stores instead
[36:09.960 --> 36:16.700]  of 24 hours, just 12 hours a day. Well, what? The virus only spreads for 12 hours. And
[36:16.700 --> 36:24.080]  you know what hours it's most active? Of course not. That's ridiculous. So it's all a test.
[36:24.080 --> 36:31.800]  It's all a rollout. But yeah, I mean, but again, see, and this is another ripple. Hey,
[36:31.800 --> 36:38.360]  what? What do they know about this virus that they're not telling us? What makes this thing
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.080]  so deadly? What makes this thing so contagious? Was it made in a lab? Do we know that? Have
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.080]  we investigated that? Where's the UN investigating China? Oh, no, they just put China on the
[36:47.080 --> 36:58.440]  head of their board. We'll get into that. But then you have the issue of the chloroquine,
[36:58.440 --> 37:02.940]  hydrochloroquine, Zepax and everything. And I got a little insider information on this
[37:02.940 --> 37:06.400]  as far as why they aren't pushing anything as a be all end all because there's so many
[37:06.400 --> 37:10.880]  different complications with these drugs and heart problems and other things where if you
[37:10.880 --> 37:14.480]  take it, it could be deadlier for you than the virus. And so they don't want a blanket
[37:14.480 --> 37:23.080]  statement to be rolled out. But they are definitely trying to suppress this as an effective cure,
[37:23.080 --> 37:30.480]  which it is. And you have the story. It was on, I believe the Gateway Punnett. Yes, here
[37:30.480 --> 37:36.840]  it is. Dr. Fauci cheered hydroxy chloroquine success, treating MERS and coronavirus in
[37:36.840 --> 37:40.440]  2013. But today he's skeptical. Isn't that weird? Well, I think everybody's learning
[37:40.440 --> 37:49.880]  who Dr. Fauci really is. Deep State minion. I mean, that guy sucks. All he does is TV
[37:49.880 --> 37:57.720]  interviews. Why don't you get back in the lab? You twerp. So here's President Trump addressing
[37:57.720 --> 38:06.560]  chloroquine. I want people to live and I'm seeing people dying. And I've seen people
[38:06.560 --> 38:13.680]  that are going to die without it. And you know, the expression when that's happening,
[38:13.680 --> 38:19.560]  they should do what really do we have to lose. We also have this medicine has been tested
[38:19.560 --> 38:24.400]  for many years from malaria and for lupus. So it's been out there. So it's a very strong,
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.520]  powerful medicine, but it doesn't kill people. We have some very good results and some very
[38:29.520 --> 38:35.440]  good tests. You've seen the same test that I have. In France, they had a very good test.
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.800]  They're continuing. But we don't have time to go and say, gee, let's take a couple of
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.840]  years and test it out. And let's go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.
[38:44.840 --> 38:49.560]  We don't have time. I'd love to do that. But we have people dying today as we speak. There
[38:49.560 --> 38:56.880]  are people dying. If it works, it'll be great. If it doesn't work, we know for many years,
[38:56.880 --> 39:01.440]  malaria. It's incredible what it's done for malaria. It's incredible what it's done for
[39:01.440 --> 39:07.200]  lupus. But it doesn't kill people. That's one of the things with a vaccine. When we have
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.960]  a vaccine, we have to do tests because when you inject that vaccine, when they take whatever
[39:12.960 --> 39:18.660]  it is they have to take, we have to make sure it doesn't have a horrible impact, destroy
[39:18.660 --> 39:25.760]  somebody. Good. So we have to test it for a long period of time. This one, not so much
[39:25.760 --> 39:33.760]  because it's been out there. Now I'm not acting as a doctor. I'm saying do what you want.
[39:33.760 --> 39:42.240]  But look at all the things that don't add up at the very medical level. So you have
[39:42.240 --> 39:47.520]  doctors and nurses being told not to wear masks, not to wear gloves while they're at
[39:47.520 --> 39:59.120]  the hospital. They're also told not to do a chest compression on somebody that has coronavirus.
[39:59.120 --> 40:05.960]  I mean, what? But then you're supposed to wear a mask in public. You're supposed to
[40:05.960 --> 40:11.240]  wear gloves in public. And then you had another doctor come out and say, hey, look, these
[40:11.240 --> 40:16.400]  ventilators might not be working. This disease might not be what we thought it was. And then
[40:16.400 --> 40:21.240]  you have people showing cat scans and lung scans and all these different scans. And oh,
[40:21.240 --> 40:25.200]  it could be this and the coronavirus. Folks, I think we have more questions about this
[40:25.200 --> 40:30.640]  than we even know. And we are just so desperate for an answer because we've been driven in
[40:30.640 --> 40:35.880]  this hysteria. We just go along with whatever is available and just say, oh, we're fighting
[40:35.880 --> 40:42.920]  the coronavirus. Who even knows what we're dealing with? The more I see these people
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.360]  running around and having these press conferences and the more we learn, the more I realize
[40:46.360 --> 40:52.920]  they don't know Jack. They may think they know something. They don't know a damn thing.
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.440]  How many of these people dying are actually dying from coronavirus and not other complications?
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.880]  How many of these people showing you their lung scans, their brain scans, their liver's
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.400]  tests, all this stuff? How do we know they didn't already have those problems? Now they're
[41:05.400 --> 41:11.600]  just in a panic over coronavirus. How is it that some people can get rapid testing?
[41:11.600 --> 41:14.440]  And this is the big global pandemic and we want to figure it out. Some people can get
[41:14.440 --> 41:18.720]  rapid testing, but then if you go and try to get tested for coronavirus, you'll get
[41:18.720 --> 41:29.360]  rejected. It doesn't make sense. And then there's the ultimate crime. The government
[41:29.360 --> 41:32.920]  telling you you can't go out on the streets. The government telling you you have to wear
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.320]  a mask. The government arresting you for paddle boarding in an ocean, riding a bike, having
[41:37.320 --> 41:50.040]  a birthday party, hosting a wedding, going to church. No. I got news for you. Tyranny
[41:50.040 --> 42:01.280]  and communism are more deadly than the flu. Tyranny and communism are more deadly than
[42:01.280 --> 42:11.160]  the coronavirus. And so folks, it's hard to believe what we're going through right now.
[42:11.160 --> 42:18.720]  It's hard to make sense of it. And I guess that's why so many people have latched onto
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.960]  the cue movement because it's the only thing that makes sense to them at this point. So
[42:23.960 --> 42:33.560]  I get it. But I'm going to, I mean, it's time for the people in the Trump administration
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.680]  and people in the media. This is the week, folks. It's make or break this week. Okay.
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.440]  We can't go on like this anymore. Reopen the economy next week. Reopen everything next
[42:43.440 --> 42:48.360]  week. Or I mean, I really might come on here and start calling for just revolting against
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.320]  this. I mean, I'm not calling for violence or illegal activity, but I'm saying host parties
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.240]  go out on the town in groups, go to your stadiums. They open up the ball games again. I mean,
[42:57.240 --> 43:02.320]  America, let's let's let as bad as things are with now more than half the world population
[43:02.320 --> 43:08.480]  under martial law being directed by the UN. There is a massive awakening happening to
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.880]  the tyranny of big pharma and the medical mafia, the forced inoculations of the UN admitting
[43:14.880 --> 43:19.320]  that vaccines are killing people and they've covered it up. And everywhere I go, I am just
[43:19.320 --> 43:24.960]  mob, my folks on the street now, even in leftist Austin, who used to attack me just a few years
[43:24.960 --> 43:32.280]  ago saying you were right about 5G. 5G is killing us. I looked it up. It's causing cancer.
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.560]  It destroys immunity. It says that it makes it easier for viruses to attack. People are
[43:37.560 --> 43:44.320]  really starting to wake up and they know they're under attack at a spiritual and subconscious
[43:44.320 --> 43:51.160]  cellular level. So now, my friends, educate everyone you know, they're ready to listen.
[43:51.160 --> 43:55.120]  They're ready to learn and they're ready to take action. I'm Alex Jones and this is the
[43:55.120 --> 43:58.920]  info war.
[43:58.920 --> 44:06.440]  My mind for more than eight weeks has been fixed, constantly scanning, constantly computing
[44:06.440 --> 44:12.320]  to understand the strategic attack we're witnessing. We know by the scripting and the choreography
[44:12.320 --> 44:17.440]  and the fact that the virus has been scanned, that it's man made and an attack on our economy.
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.040]  The globalist media is firmly behind this devastating United States and driving Trump
[44:22.040 --> 44:28.400]  from power. But now we know from scores of studies from China, the UK, the United States,
[44:28.400 --> 44:36.320]  Europe, Brazil, Japan, that the virus reinfects and attacks different parts of the body. That,
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.360]  ladies and gentlemen, is an engineered bio weapon just as the Indian scientists eight
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.360]  weeks ago conclusively proved their major university. They have a name for it at the
[44:45.360 --> 44:51.560]  Pentagon. It's called a soft kill weapon. It doesn't kill you usually the first time,
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.040]  but the next time or the third time or the fourth it does and it weighs down your economy
[44:56.040 --> 45:00.760]  in the process.
[45:00.760 --> 45:06.800]  Do yourself a favor and fund the info war at the same time. Go to infowarstore.com and
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.440]  read about the ingredients, the highest quality like black walnut and others that are in this
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.160]  baby and then read some of those reviews for yourself. And then don't just believe info
[45:15.160 --> 45:20.760]  wars. Go out online at major nutrition sites and others and look at the studies for yourself.
[45:20.760 --> 45:24.640]  Go out and engage in your first amendment right to research and your first amendment
[45:24.640 --> 45:29.840]  right to tell others about incredible compounds God has given us through Mother Nature. Living
[45:29.840 --> 45:35.280]  Defense is at infowarstore.com sold out for four months. Now back at stock for a limited
[45:35.280 --> 45:40.120]  time at 40% off people are doing their own research and they're getting living defense
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.200]  at 40% off infowarstore.com and we've got our great super blue toothpaste the best seller
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.400]  for five years with the nano silver the tea tree and the iodine it's selling out still
[45:49.400 --> 45:55.080]  50% off and the iodine selling out the X3 it's 60% off because I want you to experience
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.960]  how amazing it is.
[45:59.960 --> 46:06.880]  The ultimate tyranny would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do anything
[46:06.880 --> 46:13.120]  that could possibly hurt them and that's the globalist plan and now Mr. Fauci at the NIH
[46:13.120 --> 46:17.480]  last night in the press conference standing right next to president said we're gonna have
[46:17.480 --> 46:24.280]  a global lockdown because he talked to world leaders until not one more person is dying
[46:24.280 --> 46:30.640]  or one more person is infected the videos posted on info wars.com ladies and gentlemen
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.760]  that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu not one person can die
[46:35.760 --> 46:41.160]  from a cold everyone will be surveilled in lifetime by their cell phones and apps and
[46:41.160 --> 46:47.160]  drones and an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny and remember it's a big
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.400]  farmer that has on the level for bio weapons labs that keeps leaking all these man made
[46:51.400 --> 47:02.000]  viruses they're holding us all hostage oh and he talked about forced denotinations.
[47:02.000 --> 47:10.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.080 --> 47:30.680]  Ladies and gentlemen welcome back live to the Alex Jones show when Shroy are filling in
[47:30.680 --> 47:38.120]  for Alex Jones you know sometimes when you're on a mission that is task oriented you can
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.240]  get distracted really easily and kind of end up floating into another channel that kind
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.960]  of gets you off the main mission even though it's a mission like a channel of the main
[47:48.960 --> 47:55.400]  mission you forget to go straight down the middle and I just had that moment when I saw
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.720]  this tweet from Brian Stelter which of course I'm blocked from seeing Brian Stelter's tweet
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.680]  so I had to have someone share this with me and it all came clear to me folks what we're
[48:04.680 --> 48:09.520]  really dealing with and again I'm gonna go back into all the channels you know what's
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.400]  the truth about the virus how we're being lied to how we're being put into control all
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.040]  the signs that this has been rigged from the beginning all the signs that we've been lied
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.400]  to from the beginning the numbers don't add up all the different stuff I'm gonna get into
[48:23.400 --> 48:30.720]  all these different channels but something just came in during the break and just smacked
[48:30.720 --> 48:37.720]  me right back into the main channel into the mainstream into the agenda the task at hand
[48:37.720 --> 48:43.200]  Brian Stelter of course it's not Stelter he's just the creepo messaging boy that just crawled
[48:43.200 --> 48:50.520]  out of the sewer saying come down here we have hot dogs and popcorn Pennywise Stelter
[48:50.520 --> 48:59.000]  just announced CBS ABC NBC networks are coming together to air one world together at home
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.600]  Saturday April 18th Colbert Kimmel and Fallon will co-host it'll be on broadcast plus more
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.080]  than a dozen cable channels YouTube radio etc what else do you need to know folks you
[49:11.080 --> 49:22.600]  think this is about a virus I'm so stupid man I fall for their crap I can't help it
[49:22.600 --> 49:29.600]  they're so good they are so good at brainwashing us we're so stupid I'm talking about myself
[49:29.600 --> 49:39.080]  folks yeah the virus is real it's probably but so here's the question here's the question
[49:39.080 --> 49:44.840]  are we more concerned over this virus that was obviously man-made and put out and released
[49:44.840 --> 49:51.720]  to send us into one world government one world new world order new world order worldwide communism
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.520]  it's not really communism it's just corporate control call it communism call whatever you
[49:56.520 --> 50:01.560]  want it's corporate government it's worldwide you have no freedoms you're not a sovereign
[50:01.560 --> 50:07.640]  citizen sovereign nations don't exist anymore now we'll still have the fact similarly and
[50:07.640 --> 50:15.840]  the ceremony of all of this but in practice it's dead and there it is folks the mainstream
[50:15.840 --> 50:21.880]  news they're there for you oh it's the one world together at home just like what they
[50:21.880 --> 50:32.000]  want for all time so again we're sitting here obsessing over a virus or a disease outbreak
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.440]  whatever you want to call it it's a distraction folks it's a distraction yeah it's real yeah
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.080]  people are dying yeah people are getting sick truthfully we don't know as much as we think
[50:41.080 --> 50:46.800]  we know about this deal or at least we're not being told the truth folks we're being distracted
[50:46.800 --> 50:53.760]  by a virus while the worldwide enemy the corporate world system of control is coming in and mopping
[50:53.760 --> 50:59.320]  us up and we're all in fear over a virus we're all getting impacted if we don't go along
[50:59.320 --> 51:03.440]  with it we're going to cause people to die and we're all giving up our freedoms and our
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.640]  rights because of all the fear that's been drummed up and the death tally that we see
[51:07.640 --> 51:13.760]  on tv every day i mean you can't change the channel without seeing coronavirus you can't
[51:13.760 --> 51:18.760]  flip the channel you can't browse the internet you can't go out in the streets you can't
[51:18.760 --> 51:26.280]  do anything that hasn't been affected somehow by the coronavirus it's all by design folks
[51:26.280 --> 51:33.080]  it's 110 percent all by design to take our freedoms to create a one world corporate government
[51:33.080 --> 51:40.000]  period end of story now if you want to sit back and say oh but people are dying oh my
[51:40.000 --> 51:50.360]  gosh the hospitals fine but just know you went along with it you went along with tyranny
[51:50.360 --> 51:54.840]  and so you can't see but that's the thing too you can't blame me for people dying from
[51:54.840 --> 51:59.760]  coronavirus i'm never going to accept that you shouldn't either even if i reject the
[51:59.760 --> 52:05.120]  whole quarantine whole cloth and say screw it go out on the streets kiss all the strangers
[52:05.120 --> 52:09.680]  you want i don't give a damn you have the freedom to choose if you want to stay home
[52:09.680 --> 52:17.600]  or go out and be free that's your choice that's not my choice but if you're gonna sit there
[52:17.600 --> 52:24.120]  and tell people to quarantine tell people to stay home tell people to give up their freedoms
[52:24.120 --> 52:28.960]  then guess what bro when we are engulfed in a one world tyranny when we're engulfed in
[52:28.960 --> 52:36.080]  a corporate world government i'm looking straight at you jack oh you want to tell me i can't
[52:36.080 --> 52:39.960]  go on the streets oh you're gonna tell me i have to be afraid of a virus oh you're gonna
[52:39.960 --> 52:45.440]  tell me i have to give up all my freedoms and take a vaccine if i want to go out on
[52:45.440 --> 52:49.480]  the streets i have to be tracked on the internet i got all the news right here folks it's everything
[52:49.480 --> 52:55.880]  we warn you about oh those info wars guys conspiracy theorists again saying that the
[52:55.880 --> 53:03.480]  coronavirus is meant to bring in world government folks i have literally i mean f bryan stelter
[53:03.480 --> 53:08.040]  and jimmy kimmel with their little stupid world one world at home stupid bs i don't
[53:08.040 --> 53:16.440]  give crap about that i have stories from henry kissinger telling you you're dead your freedom
[53:16.440 --> 53:21.560]  is dead the coronavirus has just enslaved you worldwide do you get it yet are you still
[53:21.560 --> 53:30.440]  afraid of a virus now look if this thing is man made in a lab which it probably was why
[53:30.440 --> 53:36.360]  aren't they telling us that why aren't we going after who made it why aren't we putting
[53:36.360 --> 53:45.200]  china on the table pointing our finger at them you know why because we've been duped
[53:45.200 --> 53:53.640]  and we've been dominated by the un see and and and president trump is guilty of this
[53:53.640 --> 54:00.840]  too because he's fallen for it folks they've scared president trump out of being the strong
[54:00.840 --> 54:05.920]  man american patriot that he is saying we're gonna make this coronavirus death count as
[54:05.920 --> 54:11.080]  high as possible and we're gonna blame you and there's nothing you can do about it but
[54:11.080 --> 54:19.800]  president trump you have to understand history will print stories about a coronavirus outbreak
[54:19.800 --> 54:24.440]  during your presidency but guess what what would you rather have history print about
[54:24.440 --> 54:31.360]  your presidency that there was a deadly infectious disease or that you were the president when
[54:31.360 --> 54:45.800]  america died that's not up to me i don't have to make that decision
[54:45.800 --> 54:57.280]  but when you have anthony fauci anthony fauci this fraud this swamp creature yeah you know
[54:57.280 --> 55:03.040]  what let's play the video guys let's flash the clocks back this was a week before see
[55:03.040 --> 55:06.640]  i got all the news too it's like see now i'm so scatterbrained i'm unorganized i'm gonna
[55:06.640 --> 55:11.200]  reorganize in the second hour and really hammer this out because i got the news proving everything
[55:11.200 --> 55:15.640]  that we're gonna get into here because they want to blame trump for this folks it has
[55:15.640 --> 55:23.160]  not this has nothing to do with trump let's go to anthony fauci ten days okay anthony
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.920]  fauci yeah the guy that does ten television interviews a day i'm not sure when he's actually
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.040]  doing any scientific research or anything about this coronavirus or if he's ever in
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.240]  a lab or if he's testing anything probably not but dan does he know how to put on makeup
[55:34.240 --> 55:42.000]  and do an interview ten a day here's fauci see if you can understand why this is so critical
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  here's anthony fauci ten days before donald trump was even inaugurated is that there is
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.820]  no question that there will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of
[55:55.820 --> 56:01.120]  infectious diseases both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease
[56:01.120 --> 56:06.280]  and we have certainly a large burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak
[56:06.280 --> 56:15.280]  and well it's not a surprise if you knew about it isn't there doctor so and it wasn't just

[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.520]  i'm not even saying it's all fake i'm not even saying people aren't getting sick obviously
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:29.080]  people are getting sick but it's just like they keep building up this hysteria and it's
[1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:37.240]  nowhere to be found we did a whole i mean people there was a whole trend on twitter
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:40.520]  film your hospital everybody went to their local hospitals nobody can find a panic i went
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:45.520]  to two hospitals here in austin where they allegedly have the coronavirus patients no
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:50.400]  panic nothing people are getting laid off doctors told they can't wear masks around
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:02:06.480]  the hospital can't i mean what this is unbelievable man i mean it's like
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:12.480]  how do you get americans to see what it is we're actually dealing with yeah there's
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:18.600]  the story at info wars dot com where they have this this video that they're showing
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:26.240]  on on the news treating chronovirus patients it's a dummy it's not even a real person
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:33.280]  members cbs members cbs showing the footage from italy claiming it was new york fake they
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:38.400]  knew that was fake hell i'm even doubting the footage from italy it was real i doubt
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:45.520]  them all i think they're all liars i just can't even believe that this is what we're
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:51.800]  going through right now but you know what here's what it is this is what we have to
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:56.400]  understand this is what we need the president to understand and i just don't know it may
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:03.240]  be too late for him to get this this isn't an insult i'm just calling it as it is folks
[1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:09.760]  president trump has what do we have now guys like 200 days till the election six months
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:19.720]  or something so president trump has till november pretty much to save this country but it's
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:27.120]  not president trump it's us too but president trump is the leader he's the figurehead and
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:32.680]  so it really comes down to whether he goes along with this shutdown quarantine or if
[1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:38.240]  he finally bucks it and calls it for what it really is worldwide and points the finger
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:45.480]  to the man-made virus lab and wuhan and i mean can i get an investigation of bill gates
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:54.040]  i mean is that so much to ask hi i'm bill gates i create and kill viruses oh really
[1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:59.240]  oh please can't wait to get your vaccine i mean everywhere the mill and melinda gates
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:04.240]  foundation goes major outbreak of disease and then the bill and melinda gates foundation
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:11.320]  comes in and swaps it up with a vaccine i mean are you that stupid yes we are yes we
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:19.840]  are we really are i don't know folks i really i really i just the fact that we still fall
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:29.920]  for this crap is unbelievable but it's the it's the tv folks the tv runs your life you
[1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:34.320]  get that now literally the tv is your master the television is the president of the united
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:39.360]  states the television is the leader of the world whatever the tv tells you to do whatever
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:45.520]  the tv tells you to be afraid of whatever the tv dictates reality is we buy it even
[1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:53.040]  though it's all fake it's all corporate control it's all to make you a slave it's now more
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:05:01.680]  obvious than ever ladies and gentlemen a huge development just took place on the police state
[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:08.280]  new order doomsday clock walmart has announced as of yesterday that no one can buy non-gmo
[1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:13.240]  heirloom seeds or other seeds that produce more fruits and vegetables communist regimes
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:19.720]  especially always block farmers getting planting seed because they want to control people now
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:25.280]  did this as well ladies and gentlemen this is communist blueprint seeds are absolutely
[1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:29.160]  essential for people to grow their own food but they don't want you to be self sufficient
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:32.600]  we have the widest selection you're going to find out there of non-gmo heirloom seeds
[1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:36.240]  from eight different companies fruit trees everything get them all you can we have a
[1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:41.440]  huge selection but we're going to sell out quickly info or store dot com get these seeds
[1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:47.000]  that could plant for thousands of years creating new seeds while you still can info or store
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:51.760]  dot com this is a gigantic sickening evil development but we can take action by farming
[1:05:51.760 --> 1:06:07.360]  and gardening now the clock is ticking it never stops your destiny our destinies are
[1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:20.000]  all intertwined so many people to the show and they think that it's just one more ideology
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:27.640]  one more movement out there another school of thought and it's not our broadcast is
[1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:36.840]  the most real politic transmission to ever exist the guest the callers the analysis everything
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:44.720]  we do has chronicled who the major players on the planet are and what their ideologies
[1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:50.920]  are and then I simply point out we should have a pro human ideology we should have a
[1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:56.280]  movement of the public becoming aware of the infrastructure and the social engineering
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:02.200]  going on on the planet so that we can all be part of that debate and not just see the
[1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:10.080]  post human era brought in by stealth and the work we've done info wars has already launched
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:14.720]  nationalist and populist movements worldwide you the audience of activists have done that
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:21.000]  and we cannot overstate the importance of this transmission and the fact that we're still
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:28.920]  on air almost everyone else now has been censored into oblivion or to the little local
[1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:34.200]  TV and radio stations that they're still on I was on a fellow show today who once was
[1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:39.160]  syndicated across the country and was as big as Howard Stern he's on one radio station
[1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:46.600]  and one TV station and he's very popular where he's at but none of the articles or videos
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:54.560]  or post he gets out can be seen they're all shadow band well if we the people realize
[1:07:54.560 --> 1:08:02.680]  that's happening with big tech and every day realize it's a fight it's a war it's an adventure
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:08.840]  to buy word of mouth share information via email text message and face to face we can
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:14.360]  over drive and override this entire system and we better do it now because the globalist
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:22.600]  have been behind but now they're accelerating their whole program for forced inoculation
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:29.320]  and esterilence that are in those vaccines on record and the loss of immune system function
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:36.600]  you get with every vaccine you take that's a undisputed fact so today I wanted to just
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:40.680]  remind all of you that listen how really important you are and the fact that you resonate with
[1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:47.440]  the truth and the fact that you're aware of what's going on means that you've really
[1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:52.520]  have a responsibility because of how you were brought up what you saw what you learned they
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.920]  experienced as you had to try to warn others and look I know you're doing that but you
[1:08:56.920 --> 1:09:03.440]  really have to do it and you shouldn't be arrogant about it but you should be very
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:08.600]  very confident in because we've been proven right about the new world order and the human
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:15.320]  animal clones and the satanism of the globalist and the human sacrifice and the pedophilia
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:20.840]  yeah I know 25 years ago it was scary to hear stuff like that I believe it when I first
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:26.080]  heard Ted Gunnerson high-level FBI agent exposing it but he had the proof and all these years
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:30.880]  later it turns out it was worse than he was even saying I remember Ted Gunnerson he used
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:35.680]  to come on the show and he just rattled this and that and talk about this and that and
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:38.440]  how they caught him devil worshiping here and human sacrificing there and they took
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:42.000]  over whole town here and how they infiltrated the Pentagon and how they and I'm thinking
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.200]  this is just once you get all that knowledge it's like an invasion of the body snatchers
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:53.080]  the original 1950s that's you know based in based in Bakersfield and he gets out of the
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:57.080]  town has been taken over he's running towards the highway he climbs up the back of an army
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:03.320]  truck and it's full of the pods I'm using that as an analogy and he goes oh my god
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:07.960]  they're everywhere you're in danger help help help that's how the movie almost ends then
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:14.400]  it cuts to him going into a doctor's office they he's a doctor they listen to him they
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:18.760]  believe him and they say let's call the governor's office let's do something let's stop this
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:23.560]  and then you don't know if we ever stopped the alien takeover well this is a takeover
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:29.280]  of evil spiritual takeover but in the movie the doctors like you gotta listen to me I'm
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:32.840]  telling you I was just at the town it all happened and now there's army trucks rolling
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:37.400]  in with more of them they've taken over the army and it's the same thing that once you
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:42.000]  know this people say why are you so excited because I could talk for 10 hours and tell
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.760]  you just about the current stuff that's happening just last night we got another call from a
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:51.280]  source who was dead on about the California lockdowns to the day from law enforcement
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:55.160]  I made some calls they said yeah they're looking in the next two weeks to announce don't go
[1:10:55.160 --> 1:11:00.640]  to the grocery store don't go to the even the pharmacy get it all now don't leave for
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:06.880]  two weeks so they're just clamping down clamping down clamping down and then sure enough I'm
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:12.240]  on this radio show this morning I'll just say it in Chicago and he goes you just see
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:17.440]  where the White House where Fauci's not saying it and so as I was on that show driving in
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:21.720]  the work I got in the office and pulled it up and sure enough they're already getting
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:27.120]  everybody ready like oh maybe you shouldn't go to the bank or go to the store or go to
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:32.320]  the pharmacy but you know once every few weeks you need to stay in they're already pre-programming
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:37.000]  for that and you just see the news is closing so we're going to go to break more about shroyer
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.320]  coming up but I want to air this four minute clip of the head scientist at the WHO and
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:45.360]  others from back in December saying that the vaccines are hurting people there's been a
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.000]  cover up the front line of doctors is wobbly the adjuvants are causing problems so you
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:55.800]  can understand how serious all of this is now they're not studying the vaccines and
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:12:00.360]  now this is the ultimate medical tyranny now we let them abort all the kids and now ladies
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:06.360]  and gentlemen now they're coming for our health as well all right info wars dot com news wars
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:10.920]  dot com tomorrow since the day please let everyone you know do it daily this is an info war you
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:15.680]  are beyond essential God bless you here's the UN report we really don't have very good
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:21.680]  safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miss communication and
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.840]  the miss apprehensions because we're not able to give clear cut answers when people ask
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:30.240]  questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:36.280]  blown up in the media one should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:40.480]  is happening what the cause of deaths are but in most cases there's some obfuscation
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:47.120]  at that level and and therefore there's less and less trust the first accusation is it
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:51.840]  is the adjuvant and yet without adjuvants we are not going to have the next generation
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:56.280]  of vaccines and many of the vaccines that we do have ranging from tetanus through to
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:02.280]  HPV require adjuvants in order for them to work when we add an adjuvant it's because
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:08.560]  it is essential we do not add adjuvants to vaccines because we want to do so but when
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:15.240]  we add them it in it adds to the complexity and I give courses every year on how do you
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  develop vaccines how do you make vaccines and the first lesson is while you're making
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:27.720]  your vaccine if you can avoid using an adjuvant please do so it seems to me that adjuvants
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:38.480]  multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to and that is their intention
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:46.120]  it seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity in many instances and therefore it seems to
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:54.920]  me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:00.640]  associated with the antigen but may not have been detected through lack of statistical
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:06.640]  power in the original study the major health concern which we are seeing our accusations
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:12.400]  of long-term long-term effects it's also the subject population that you administer
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:20.920]  the adjuvant to because we've seen data presented to us where an adjuvant a particular adjuvant
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:26.920]  added to a vaccine and it did really nothing when administered to a certain population
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:34.280]  and it's usually the elderly you know compared to administering the same formulation to younger
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:40.840]  age strata so these are things which need to be considered as well and further complicate
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:46.320]  safety and effectiveness evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens I cast back
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:53.880]  my mind to our situation in Nigeria where at six weeks ten weeks fourteen weeks a child
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:59.560]  is being given different antigens from different companies and these vaccines have different
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:06.120]  adjuvant different preservatives and so on something crosses my mind is there possibility
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:14.360]  of these adjuvants preservatives cross-reacting amongst themselves have they ever been a study
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:18.600]  on the possibility of cross-reactions from the panel members that you can share the
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:26.040]  experience with us we have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:32.720]  question vaccines and the safety of vaccines when the frontline professionals are starting
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:39.720]  to question or they don't feel like they have enough confidence about the safety to stand
[1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:47.160]  up to it to the person asking them the questions I mean most medical school curriculums even
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:53.600]  nursing curriculums I mean in medical school you're lucky if you have a half day on vaccines

[1:18:56.560 --> 1:19:04.280]  sometime during the month of March in the year 2020 the nations of the planet began to slip
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:13.240]  permanently into a form of martial law a technocracy a control grid enforced by a medical
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:23.640]  tyranny aided by robots and drones overseeing the human population everyone was suspect
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:29.560]  everyone could be a carrier it didn't matter if it was the common cold that had been weaponized
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:34.400]  it didn't matter it came out of the wool on level 4 by a weapon slam it didn't matter
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:41.320]  if Bill Gates' fingerprints were all over it the crime was so big that no one dared
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:47.920]  challenge the power structure and thousands of years of hard fought basic jurisprudence
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:53.560]  and human rights disappeared in the twinkle of an eye and humanity slipped beneath the
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:20:20.760]  waves of the long dark winter you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:28.840]  using the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones and now your host
[1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:37.680]  owin shroyer you want to put the world into tyranny step one worldwide fear and panic drive
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:44.960]  it home with consistent messaging step one is complete you want to know step two for
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:51.880]  global tyranny well let's go to the head of the saint louis federal reserve and find
[1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:58.680]  out do you think that this global economy is going to look the same on the other side
[1:20:58.680 --> 1:21:04.560]  of this pandemic are those jobs actually going to exist for people to go back to you know
[1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:08.880]  I have good news for you marvin because we have a there is a solution using available
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:15.160]  technology today to fix the economic part of this problem the solution is universal
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:20.920]  testing what you want is every single person to get tested every day and then they would
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:26.640]  wear a badge like they would after they voted or something like that to show that they've
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:33.000]  been tested this would immediately sort out who's been infected and who hasn't been infected
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.200]  that would help the healthcare sector but it would also help the economy because we
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:42.600]  could interact with each other with a lot of confidence so there you go ladies and
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:47.480]  gentlemen you're seeing phase two of global tyranny being rolled out right in front of
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:53.440]  you forced vaccinations forced tests digital tracking that's what the 5g is for which is
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:58.680]  probably making this virus outbreak worse if not causing it all together and they just
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:05.600]  do it right in front of your face but you're so scared the fear driven into you by the
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.920]  television media you're willing to give up all your freedoms for it and I'm getting
[1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:17.840]  sick and damn tired of so-called patriots and influencers on social media going along
[1:22:17.840 --> 1:22:26.000]  with this what happened to being a rough and tough gritty American land of the free home
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.480]  of the brave are we just done with that did we just did we just wake up one day and just
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:34.720]  decide we're just done with that that's just no not our thing anymore alright I'm gonna
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:39.200]  bear down here and just start to just rigorously go through these headlines to the best I can
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:46.360]  to to put it all together for you here we go UK ministers no longer discounting theory
[1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:52.960]  that COVID-19 leaks from Wuhan lab lab yes pretty much totally confirmed and so this
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:57.720]  is a man-made bio weapon and we're not being told the truth about it and it it came out
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:02.800]  of China and we get no investigations and China actually gets put on the UN human rights
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:07.400]  abuses board that's just great isn't it oh yeah by the way still all the manufacturing
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:12.200]  and production like like for like what 75% of the world is all coming out of China still
[1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:17.880]  too so that's nice don't forget about this folks Harvard professor among three charged

[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:10.960]  leak out in fact the global pandemic but hey you know China put them on the UN board for
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:16.520]  human rights abuses story in fours that confirm Jamie White video shows hospital using dummies
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:20.480]  and ER for coronavirus footage so they're all faking the footage folks like they do this

[1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:55.280]  don't like knowing this but this is something that is tough and a burden that we just have
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:01.680]  to accept folks the average Trump hating Democrat is so committed to their hatred for hatred
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:07.160]  for Trump they will lie about anything folks they will stage anything lie about anything
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:11.800]  do anything yes that goes from the top of the power structure like the Obama administration
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:16.680]  and all the illegal treason that they engaged in and it even goes to the bottom in the middle
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:21.000]  with the Jesse small let's faking hate crimes but it also goes to the very bottom folks

[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:39.280]  but it's kind of hard not to considering what we're dealing with but you know there's
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:44.400]  all these obvious questions that we're just I guess too afraid to ask or we just don't
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:49.840]  bother asking because we know they won't be answered so we don't want to have this exercise
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:56.800]  of utility but the numbers keep coming out and what do they keep saying this is from
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:03.120]  ABC News this morning the United States has by far the highest national tally in the world
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:07.220]  according to data compiled by the Centers for System Science and Engineering at Johns
[1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:13.040]  Hopkins University who was also involved in event 201 that well they literally practiced
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:17.600]  this whole thing back in October but still couldn't figure it out so they did the simulations
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:21.400]  which by the way Bill Gates is doing television interview after television interview look folks
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:27.560]  I monitor news and cable news and as much as about anyone on earth I would imagine I
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:31.280]  don't know how you can do it more Bill Gates never does TV interviews the fact that he's
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:40.000]  done about five in the last two weeks I mean come on come on folks but why is the United
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:46.440]  States leading the world in cases why why is nobody asking that why does the United States
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:50.920]  have the most cases it is it because we have a lot of 5g I mean obviously China's lying
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:54.720]  I mean that goes without saying but why do we have the most cases because we have the
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:59.200]  most 5g outside of China is it because we have the best testing and we're just testing
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:03.840]  the most people and so we know that is it because we're just assuming everyone that
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:09.800]  steps into a hospital with a cough or a broken toe has coronavirus I think it's all of the
[1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:15.000]  above why to get Trump folks it's not even to get Trump is to kill America see Trump
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:21.480]  is just not anti-American Trump is actually American trying to be the U.S. president the
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:27.360]  criminal cabal that's been behind the last like five presidents the criminal cabal that
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:33.840]  killed JFK the criminal cabal that launched it all folks they launched the fake wars they
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.960]  launched it all they killed they've done it everything it's the same group shadow group
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:44.120]  of people that now want a corporate government worldwide why is the United States leading
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:49.120]  the world in cases why is nobody calling out China for lying because it's not about the
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:53.120]  truth it's not about stopping the virus it's not about saving humanity from a virus it's
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:50:08.840]  about killing America that's what it's about Fauci and Birx who by the way who by the way
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:20.000]  Patrick Halley was on Patrick Halley was on info wars yesterday breaking this down Birx
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:29.240]  her medical license is expired so what in the hell is she doing Fauci and Birx both
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:33.880]  have big money Bill Gates conflicts of interest yeah Fauci and Bill Gates are like tight at
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:41.000]  the hip folks when will somebody investigate Bill Gates Bill Gates calls coronavirus pandemic
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:46.360]  a nightmare scenario but predicts lower death toll than Trump well yeah as long as he gets
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:50.680]  to inject you with his vaccines and make a billion more dollars but it's not even see
[1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:54.400]  but this is the other thing people keep passing this thing off like come on oh and Bill Gates
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:59.600]  has hundreds of billions of dollars he doesn't need to do this he cares about people okay
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:07.440]  when you at a certain level of the top echelon of elite folks money is nothing money is like
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:16.200]  fart in the wind the real the real economy at that level is not money it's it's power
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:25.320]  it's influence it's resources it's cheese pizza it's blackmail that's the real economy
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:30.640]  money is just a digital number to them it's all rigged they don't give a damn about that
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:34.840]  they don't they don't pedal in money they pedal in blackmail they pedal in influence
[1:51:34.840 --> 1:51:42.800]  they pedal in resources why do you think billionaires buy up failing publications like the New
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:49.480]  York Times because it's not about making money it's about influence and power Fauci's
[1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:58.320]  a total fraud seven years ago cheers hydro hydroxychloroquine as a successful drug now
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:03.200]  he's skeptical inside the White House blow up over hydroxychloroquine here's the answer
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:13.320]  fire Fauci get that rat swamp creature out of there it's really that simple I don't know
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:21.240]  why nobody else can seem to figure that out maybe it's all part of the plan as Trump administration
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:28.120]  okay so now see in here's where you get to the meat as Trump administration debated travel
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:32.800]  restrictions thousands streamed in from China well who was telling Trump not to do that
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:37.960]  it was the Democrats calling him racist remember that and now they want to blame Trump no folks
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:43.760]  Trump wanted to shut it all down they wouldn't let him and now they're blaming him for not
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:50.400]  doing it I mean he has to see through this it's just like Trump sees limit of his presidency
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:56.960]  in avoiding blame for virus again so it's all about they spread it by telling him he's
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.400]  racist if he won't shut down the borders they spread it by launching the 5g networks they
[1:53:01.400 --> 1:53:09.200]  spread it by literally making it a lab in China and then it's all Trump's fault oh yes
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:14.680]  and then here we go state Democrat representative once Trump in front of the Hague for crimes
[1:53:14.680 --> 1:53:18.880]  against humanity now you have multiple Democrats and you have worldwide leaders saying Trump
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:25.880]  deserves to go to jail for spreading the coronavirus but China Charles Lieber Bill Gates and everything
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:34.000]  that they've done no no no no no media will talk about that no no no no no no no no you
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.760]  don't touch the almighty Bill Gates you don't touch the all mighty China that launched this
[1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:45.920]  virus and then lied about it and still is to this day no no no no see we set Trump up
[1:53:45.920 --> 1:53:50.920]  we frame Trump and then we blame Trump and then we use the media to hammer at home and
[1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:56.240]  drive the fear to blame Trump and then we can defeat him in 2020 that's the plan with
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:01.680]  the fake election they're about to have and so look I'm not the president and I'm doing
[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:06.160]  my role as a citizen here but let me tell you something if President Trump doesn't move
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:13.240]  against the deep state and we don't see 10 20 30 100 arrests by November he's done and
[1:54:13.240 --> 1:54:22.080]  America's done I hope people realize that because again he can build up the economy
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:26.160]  that was great they just crashed it folks it took him a week it crashed the whole damn
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:32.040]  thing they shut it down six million people applied for unemployment in one day that's
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:44.080]  a record it's not even close the second highest alright now here's a twist let me try to get
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:50.200]  into this one Navy captain removed from carrier test positive for coronavirus let me just hit
[1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:55.960]  these headlines and tell you what's going on leaders back Navy firing of ship captain
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:01.520]  sailors cheered him well maybe it was a political thing aboard the USS Roosevelt sailors braced
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:07.680]  for the worst Theodore Roosevelt captain followed in footsteps of ships namesake by riding bombshell
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:15.560]  letter leaking to the media CNN's tapper grills defense secretary Esper on Trump attacking
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:21.960]  Navy captain who raised alarm on coronavirus outbreak Biden says dismissal of air cat carrier
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:26.920]  captain is close to criminal look at how they treated the military during the Obama years
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:32.280]  U.S. expansion expands Navy presence in Caribbean is military action against Maduro likely now
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:38.800]  think about that folks as the Navy is actually in in golfing on some serious missions in
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:45.680]  central and South America this Navy captain was leaking to the media that his entire
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:54.480]  carrier ship is basically in quarantine he tried to dock without permission he went through
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:56:04.360]  the command order so the guy deserve to be removed from the ship just on out of the manual
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:09.560]  basically but there's something else going on here folks there is something else going
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:14.360]  on here and I'll be honest I knew something was going on here about over a week ago and
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:17.880]  I didn't get into it because everybody I talked to this was for whatever reason it was so
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:21.120]  sensitive so fragile I just decided not to and then there's this whole weird thing with
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:25.640]  military people in the Navy and it's like then everybody just kind of craps on the Navy
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:31.240]  people I'm not a military guy I'm not involved with that but so there's that angle too when
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:36.320]  I try to it's like all these Navy guys they are yeah yeah they got their own thing going
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:46.400]  on you know but so what's going on here well let's see so Crozier the captain who was relieved
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:52.560]  of duty is again breaking chain of command trying to dock without permission and then
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:57.920]  leaking to the media that his aircraft carrier ship is basically inflicted and unoperable
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:04.120]  because of coronavirus okay so he's relieved of duty for that and and should have been
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:09.680]  but then you have people saying oh he's a hero he is a hero by the way this guy's a
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:17.840]  Democrat oh he's a hero they say okay well why well he's stopping the spread of coronavirus
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:24.760]  well what happened after he got relieved a thousand crew members of the carrier went
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:31.640]  out and cheered him and did what stood shoulder to shoulder no gloves no masks were high fiving
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:35.480]  screaming and chanting and shouting their spittle going everywhere so they just spread
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:41.120]  coronavirus so they just inflicted the entire ship with coronavirus thanks to this naval
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:47.920]  officer so is he really a hero I don't know one of our best selling products is living
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:52.720]  defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients

[2:05:30.160 --> 2:05:36.200]  by a weapons lab it didn't matter a bill gates his fingerprints were all over it the crime
[2:05:36.200 --> 2:05:43.360]  was so big that no one dared challenge the power structure and thousands of years of
[2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:50.000]  hard fought basic jurisprudence and human rights disappeared in the twinkle of an eye
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:06:09.920]  and humanity slipped beneath the waves of the long dark winter live from austin texas broadcasting

[2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:30.760]  lining to this with g edward griffin who is my guest from red pill expo dot com so we've
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:38.040]  seen the most ridiculous two trillion dollar boondoggle under president trump most ridiculous
[2:07:38.040 --> 2:07:44.560]  stimulus package in the history of this country and it happened under donald trump now there
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:49.440]  are again silver lining to this that people think there may be something else happening

[2:07:56.440 --> 2:08:02.800]  red pill expo dot com we saw the two point two trillion dollar stimulus get totally abused
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:08.480]  and poked by the democrats they're now already suggesting more stimulus what's next three
[2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:16.600]  trillion four trillion ten gajillion where does it end g edward griffin boy that's a
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:21.800]  good introduction no one thank you we are where does it end I I guess that assumes that
[2:08:21.800 --> 2:08:28.000]  there is an end I'm beginning to wonder if there is an end because I see this as a continuum
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:33.120]  that's been going on for so long and it's all I guess there is an end game to everything
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:39.800]  yeah you can't keep pumping up a bubble until forever it's it's some at some point it breaks
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:44.920]  but old guys like myself have been predicting that the bubble is going to really splat any
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:49.640]  day now we've been doing that for so long that our credibility is somewhat stretched
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:55.160]  but that didn't change the laws of mathematics or the laws of nature it's going to happen
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:09:01.960]  yes it's ridiculous but the question arises do these guys in congress who are passing
[2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:06.440]  that you are approving of these acts the federal reserve is doing some of it just on its own
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:11.840]  but congress has to come along at some point and and sign the paper and say yeah that's
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:17.760]  that's legal do they do they really think it's going to solve anything or is there an agenda
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:24.400]  that we can't see well I've become kind of skeptical over the years I one of the few
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:32.600]  things I ever agreed with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was he said that in politics nothing
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:38.600]  is a coincidence I thought well that is true and so and especially the bigger the event
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:44.480]  and the more absurd it seems to be the more likely in my view that it's not a coincidence
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:48.440]  so I don't think it's stupidity either although I have to admit that some of these guys appear
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:53.680]  to be pretty stupid but I think it's stupidity is kind of an excuse that they they know that
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:10:00.600]  what they're doing is unsustainable they know it's going to really wreak havoc in the economy
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.640]  going to put a lot of people in the under the streets that may even trigger some food
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:10.440]  riots like we've seen in other countries could it be that they really are looking forward
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:16.360]  to that that's a heck of a question isn't it who would look forward to riots in the
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:21.760]  street and all kinds of calamity and and and people are going hungry and losing their housing
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:26.720]  and all of that who would want that well the fact is that there are people who want that
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:32.640]  and they've written books about it these people have existed for over a couple of centuries
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:38.800]  now they've talked about the necessity to change society that in particular the necessity
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:44.760]  to change the American society to get the Americans off of their their addiction as
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:49.720]  they call it to the comforts of life to get them away from this this dreaded thing called
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:57.040]  capitalism get them to join the the beehive economy and political system of collectivism
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:02.600]  sometimes we call that communism fascism and Nazism socialism but it's collectivism and
[2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:08.040]  they they think that's the ideal and they know wisely I think they figured it out that
[2:11:08.040 --> 2:11:14.400]  when people are desperate for existence if they're on their knees begging for help help
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:22.320]  against some dreaded threat and help against an enemy from abroad in a war or a pandemic
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:27.120]  or global warming that's going to destroy the planet or crime or drugs or whatever the
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:32.200]  all whatever this great threat is they turn for help and they don't ask about whether
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:37.720]  it's legal or whether it's right or wrong whether it's constitutional a drowning man
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:42.520]  is not much concerned about the constitution and they know this so yes the answer to that
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:47.840]  question is yeah there are people who do want to see things collapse and they do everything
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:53.120]  possible to collapse the system so people will be on their knees begging for help and
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:59.000]  not asking too many questions and that's what they're waiting for they can move in completely
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:03.760]  revise the system and nobody will object in fact they'll say oh thank you for martial
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:08.000]  law on the streets oh thank you for protecting us and by the way where's our food coupon
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.440]  and and where do we sleep tonight and so forth so that's how I look at it and it's an ugly
[2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:18.600]  view I wish I didn't feel that way you said here is Griffin he'll have a silver lining
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:23.880]  and through the storm cloud that was not a silver lining so what can I say except that
[2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:29.000]  the silver lining if there is one is the fact that this thing is becoming so obvious now
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:35.720]  that it does not make sense in in the normal use of that word it makes only sense only
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:40.200]  in the in the minds of those who are seeking destruction and that's becoming so obvious
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:46.280]  now that maybe maybe some of us who have been trying to alert our our friends to the possibility
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:52.600]  that we better get off of our couches and get out there getting active in politics and in
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:56.920]  social events and get involved in organizations and take back control of the system while
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:02.440]  we still have that window of time it's closing it's closing it's getting smaller but we still
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:07.560]  have time to do it so I think that maybe the silver lining if I may get back to that is
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:12.480]  the fact that people are waking up to this and if we ever have a chance to change it
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:18.200]  it's now well and going back to what you said the quote from FDR there are no coincidences
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:23.600]  in politics so there's no coincidence here either the fact that it's more prescient for
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:28.880]  Americans to get active in their local communities their national government and everything in
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:33.560]  between it's more important for people to get active now it's no coincidence that the virus
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:38.340]  happens now and they tell us to shelter in place so that you can't get involved suspending
[2:13:38.340 --> 2:13:43.320]  your first amendment suspending your second amendment so that's definitely not a coincidence
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:48.480]  as you stated it's more important for Americans to be active and organized and informed than
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:54.400]  ever so oh perfect timing here comes a coronavirus shelter in place watch your Netflix movies
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:00.400]  and TV series and don't worry about America it's all under control fouchy has your back
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:05.920]  so obviously that's not a coincidence is it no I don't think it is but then you have to
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:11.160]  forgive me I've lived a long time and I've seen a lot of so-called coincidences that
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:17.120]  turn out to be hidden agendas so I'm a little jaundiced on that topic and I don't think that
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:24.240]  suddenly all of these people in Washington have decided to stop furthering their own
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:29.280]  personal agendas and put them the benefit of the American people ahead of their own
[2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:36.000]  personal agendas I just don't see that as happening so we're about to go to break but
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:41.120]  I want to really get into this question in the next segment how much do we really know
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:46.640]  about the federal reserve and maybe now is the time where Americans are actually asking
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:51.120]  that question saying oh and two trillion dollars like what hey I'm a physical conservative I
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:54.200]  elected Trump as a physical conservative he said he was going to do something about the
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:58.280]  debt and mitigate it and the deficit it's only gotten worse under President Trump hey I support
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:02.160]  the president that's a fact guys President Trump has done worse for the debt and the
[2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:06.920]  deficit than and Obama did so you can love Trump till the day is over but that's just
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:12.760]  a fact and then I think the bigger issue as well that I want to get G Edward Griffin's
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:20.360]  take on is the fact that you have to understand folks the worldwide control grid through the
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:26.120]  corporate government trying to take over actual sovereign states the reason why they have
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:29.240]  to take over America and hate America and this is something that's been hundreds of
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:35.000]  years in the making if not thousands folks they hate America because it proves self government
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:43.040]  works it proves that free market capitalism is the most sustainable answer for the commonwealth
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:47.920]  and the average citizen to have a high standard of living so you see once that got proven
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:53.720]  to the world well how do you roll out communism now that free market capitalism works best
[2:15:53.720 --> 2:15:58.680]  attention all radio listeners who still need food supplies if you thought about the implication
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:03.520]  of food related supply chain disruptions and are concerned about the coming quarantines
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:08.160]  this will be the most important message you will ever hear here's why in the next few
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:13.800]  days all Americans will face extremely hard choices if we've learned anything from China
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:18.800]  and Italy it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:24.840]  the US listen while dehydrated food is becoming scarce you can still get enough open pollinated

[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:45.480]  weapon the globalist in the trajectory of but it's real target is confidence in the

[2:20:21.400 --> 2:20:32.840]  red hill expo dot org we're talking federal reserve so i asked g edward griffin this because
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:39.840]  i think you know it's a weird thing at a certain age or something where americans decide to
[2:20:39.840 --> 2:20:47.600]  quit questioning their reality and i'm speaking specifically about money at what point do we
[2:20:47.600 --> 2:20:52.800]  quit being curious where does this money come from what gives it value most people couldn't
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:58.760]  even begin to answer that or even begin to think about the answer to that so i asked
[2:20:58.760 --> 2:21:07.680]  g edward griffin today how much do we really know about the federal reserve as an american
[2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:13.960]  community how much do we know even with the most information that is publicly available
[2:21:13.960 --> 2:21:18.440]  with a fractional reserve banking system and then how much are people learning do you think
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:25.240]  now as the stimulus bill is passing and and people are seeing now communist style government
[2:21:25.240 --> 2:21:31.160]  paychecks coming out so you would imagine the curiosities about this are are are beginning
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:36.760]  to get flared up again so what do you think how much do we know about the fed how much
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:41.280]  do we know about the fed even if we have the most information and then just to the general
[2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:47.600]  public what did they not know that they may be learning now boy that's a good one that's
[2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:52.680]  an open field i can run any which way up with that one but i think the short answer oh and
[2:21:52.680 --> 2:21:58.320]  is that the american people what do they know about the fed the answer is not nearly enough
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:03.600]  and the fact that we we maybe know a little bit more about it and i say we collectively
[2:22:03.600 --> 2:22:10.840]  know a lot more now than we did ten years ago or twenty years ago it's not nearly enough
[2:22:10.840 --> 2:22:16.280]  as you know i i give seminars on this topic i've been known to to talk about this for
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:20.920]  a full day and at the very end it's having to rush through the notes that i couldn't
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:26.840]  get to so it's impossible to cover it but i i came up with kind of a humorous way of
[2:22:26.840 --> 2:22:32.400]  summarizing this because you know things can be condensed and when you're on the lecture
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:37.080]  circuit sometimes you have to condense your huge topic down into little sound bites if
[2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:41.440]  you have a chance to be interviewed by some television station which doesn't happen too
[2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:44.640]  often but when it happens boy you better get it quick because they won't give you more
[2:22:44.640 --> 2:22:51.440]  than about fifteen seconds to say it all so i developed a talent for condensing these
[2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:57.560]  humongous topics into a very few words and i found out that i could summarize the federal
[2:22:57.560 --> 2:23:04.360]  reserve system in three words as incredibly as it may sound the federal reserve system
[2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:10.640]  oh yes it's a scam any questions all right there's the there's the hardcore of it anybody
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:15.360]  can understand what a scam is but now what makes the federal reserve a scam and how did
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:21.800]  how did they pull it off is a very interesting story and it's a long journey but basically
[2:23:21.800 --> 2:23:27.840]  it boils down to the fact that a group of bankers in the united states in fact all the major
[2:23:27.840 --> 2:23:34.600]  banks of the united states back in nineteen thirteen past a piece of legislation they presented
[2:23:34.600 --> 2:23:39.680]  it to congress and they lobbied congress and the congressman voted in called the federal
[2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:47.960]  reserve act and in that piece of legislation they convinced the bankers convinced the congress
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:53.800]  to turn over to the banking group which was a cartel let me emphasize that these banks
[2:23:53.800 --> 2:24:00.560]  formed a cartel which is that takes a little explanation it's an association of banks but
[2:24:00.560 --> 2:24:05.440]  they formed together to further the interests of the members of the cartel which means the
[2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:10.280]  banks and that was their sole purpose they're not interested in advancing the interests
[2:24:10.280 --> 2:24:15.480]  of the american people are doing what is right for the economy cartels never do that oil
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:22.280]  cartels banana cartels peanut cartels and banking cartels have just one purpose and
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:27.880]  that's to advance the benefit and the advantage of the members of the cartel period so they
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:34.680]  went to congress they convinced congress to give them the banks private banks the power
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:41.720]  to create the nation's money supply and to determine credit and to control the money
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:48.000]  supply of the nation just as though the bankers were the government itself and congress gave
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:52.840]  them that power in the federal reserve act so what you understand now with that just
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:59.520]  simple introduction to the topic what we have in place and have had for a very long time
[2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:05.640]  is a banking cartel of private banks that literally control the money system of the
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:12.160]  united states of america and congress has no power over it over their decisions or their
[2:25:12.160 --> 2:25:19.920]  policies congress can do nothing about it except to amend the federal reserve act or
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:25.240]  to abolish the federal reserve completely that's their only power and in fact looking
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:31.280]  back over the years congress has never made any serious attempt to reduce the powers of
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:36.080]  the federal reserve the federal reserve act has been amended over a hundred times since
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:41.480]  it was created and each time with a possible exception of one or two minor instances the
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:46.360]  power of the fed was greatly expanded to the point where today it can do just about anything
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:52.680]  it wants to do and it's legal because congress put the stamp of approval on it now that's
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:57.560]  that's the short answer to what the fed is it's a cartel and it's got the power of government
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:03.000]  behind it which is why people think it's a government agency and if you violate the
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.840]  terms of the cartel agreement of the bank you go to prison because there's a law that
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:11.760]  says you must follow their decisions and who can put you in jail only the government right
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:17.360]  well no not quite so if the if a cartel can get the government to pass the law to make
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:22.560]  it illegal to violate your personal agreement what then private interests can put you in
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:28.480]  prison so there's the background and you wonder where is all this money going how come how
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:33.040]  come where does this money go how come it doesn't help the american people we know it doesn't
[2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:37.640]  because the more money they throw into the economy the worse the economy gets and you
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:42.800]  might notice that the money always winds up in the banks either they're bailing out the
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:49.560]  banks directly or they're creating money to give to corporations and governments around
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:54.120]  the world who owe huge amounts of money to the banks they can't pay to the banks are
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:59.360]  going bankrupt and so the federal government passes more laws to send money to those corporations
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:05.560]  and to those governments so they can continue to send interest to the banks the money always
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:11.880]  comes back to the banks there's no surprise here the federal reserve system was created
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:17.480]  by the banks and for the banks and of the banks that is its purpose and so it's only
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:22.280]  doing what it was designed to do that's the short clash course on what the federal reserve
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:28.080]  system is and the american people don't understand that that's for sure most americans think
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:32.640]  that the federal reserve is a government agency and that they're doing their best that you
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:37.240]  know to protect america and they're trying to cool inflation order or to stimulate employment
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:41.040]  or something like that and they're all convinced that it's really a wonderful thing and we
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:45.560]  learned that in school if we read our textbooks and pay attention to the teachers that's what
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:51.120]  they teach us but in fact it's just the opposite but that's the short answer to your question
[2:27:51.120 --> 2:27:56.240]  oh and it's it's something and we have we say in the red pill expo thank you for that
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:00.600]  introduction by the way red pill is the thing that you take and you take and you realize
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:05.360]  oh this is reality break out of your illusions and see lights the way it really is well the
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:10.200]  federal reserve is not what it appears to be when you take the red pill you find out
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:17.440]  that it is nothing more or less than legalized plunder when we get back from the next break
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:24.040]  I want to get into with g edward griffin from the red pill expo the fractional reserve banking
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:30.280]  system and then the notion of the federal reserve is it a private bank do we even know
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:38.280]  and why not but I think again folks what would be the biggest enemy of a government that
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:43.720]  wants to control you and the money supply well it would be examples that communism or that
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:47.720]  system of government doesn't work and that the free market does which has been proven
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:51.840]  time and time again in real world activity so they don't want you to know this they want
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:58.240]  full control over you attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:02.760]  solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up this will
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:06.480]  be the most important message you'll ever hear bill hide here I want to tell you about
[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:11.120]  a huge sale with historically low prices on our ppx microgrid system that's going to
[2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:15.840]  let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:19.600]  of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi
[2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:23.800]  because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:23.800 --> 2:29:27.560]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:32.120]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory so here's
[2:29:32.120 --> 2:29:36.760]  what you should do right now check out the ppx microgrid system at my own power grid
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:42.440]  dot com that's my own power grid dot com over a thousand dollars in great off the grid gear
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:45.840]  and a ton of bonuses too and the best part you're not going to pay seven hundred fifty
[2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:50.120]  or five hundred dollars three hundred even two hundred go to my own power grid dot com
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:57.840]  to learn more that's my own power grid dot com you have to look really hard at mainstream
[2:29:57.840 --> 2:30:04.920]  television news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it
[2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:10.600]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines I did a bunch of research looking
[2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:16.440]  at different tv archives and I couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local news
[2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:23.960]  stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc zinc zinc the element on the periodic
[2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:32.000]  table that is essential to life and that is the most antiviral natural compound out there
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:37.760]  in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities including big
[2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:47.280]  studies on the coronavirus family so do yourself a favor search engine zinc and antiviral three
[2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:59.560]  words zinc antiviral zinc antiviral do yourself a favor zinc antiviral listen there's a show
[2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:06.280]  from pbs called it's okay to be smart so everyone who's been smart and has been put down for
[2:31:06.280 --> 2:31:13.720]  it and persecuted it's okay to finally be smart that's right there's not two sexes and
[2:31:13.720 --> 2:31:17.800]  families are bad and the right thing to do is to sterilize your son so he knows we got
[2:31:17.800 --> 2:31:21.240]  an evil warm hunger I mean a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government passed
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:26.360]  laws that mail embryos are count but what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian
[2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:29.840]  is just to convince them when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:34.120]  off and again global warming is real we got to pay lord Rothschild all of our money and
[2:31:34.120 --> 2:31:38.200]  the pandemic's over we've got to be locked up in our houses we've got to use the language
[2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:44.640]  the universities say we're not a culture anything oh no no we're not we're good people we're
[2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:50.520]  good people that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us no no they enlightened
[2:31:50.520 --> 2:31:58.440]  us how to censor and how to rule and out of control bio pqq research that look into it
[2:31:58.440 --> 2:32:03.640]  for yourself big brother and the globalists don't want you to help you can oh you probably
[2:32:03.640 --> 2:32:09.960]  want to spend some time researching coq 10 and then research dna force plus and the types
[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:17.080]  that we have in here the very best forms of the bqq and coq 10 and then a whole bunch
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:24.200]  of other natural ingredients from other nature that are known to supercharge it all this
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:30.120]  is our best selling overall formula and I've told listeners at the end of last year that
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:37.400]  we can't sell products anymore because there's not enough markup in them to find our operations
[2:32:37.400 --> 2:32:42.680]  but because of what's happening and going on in the world right now I really want everybody
[2:32:42.680 --> 2:32:48.600]  who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of the n a force plus to have the n a force
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:59.800]  plus yourself and your family the n a force plus now 50% off you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:32:59.800 --> 2:33:22.440]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your
[2:33:22.440 --> 2:33:32.200]  host owen treuer with g edward griffin from red pill expo red pill expo dot org is where he can
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:41.240]  follow his work i want to ask g edward griffin two questions here and let's hear his take on this
[2:33:42.040 --> 2:33:48.680]  one fractional reserve banking this is the system that the federal reserve goes with
[2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:54.600]  most people have no idea how it even works they probably couldn't even tell you what fractional
[2:33:54.600 --> 2:34:01.800]  reserve banking is or that's the system the fed goes with and then beyond that you've obviously
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:08.360]  seen it before they say it's a conspiracy theory that the federal reserve is a private bank well
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:15.320]  there's been no conclusion on that as far as my studies are concerned but your studies are obviously
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:20.920]  much deeper than mine so g edward griffin from red pill expo dot com what do you think about the
[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:26.600]  fractional reserve banking system why don't americans know about it and then is the federal
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:34.600]  reserve indeed a private institution okay well let's start with the last one first because that's
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:41.800]  the easiest one to handle the federal reserve system as i said before is really a cartel
[2:34:41.800 --> 2:34:48.280]  and can you remember that that's answers so many questions a cartel what is a cartel it's not one
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:54.680]  thing it's an association of many organizations that on the surface appear to be in competition
[2:34:54.680 --> 2:35:01.560]  with each other uh oil cartel for example that could be made up of many oil companies uh within a
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:06.360]  region or a nation or around the world they're in competition with each other but they come together
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:11.480]  because they want to reduce competition to improve their profit margins and so they come to agreements
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:16.600]  with each other okay we won't we won't compete on price we'll all charge the same price we'll divide
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:21.080]  up markets you get north america i get south america and so forth and they they figure out
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:28.200]  ways to avoid competition so that the consumer has no place else to go so that the consumer
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:34.040]  inevitably has to pay more for the same product or service then they would have paid if there
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:39.320]  was real competition in the market free enterprise capitalism as you so well described it that is
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:46.120]  another way of saying the free market so a cartel is a group of organizations it's not an entity
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:53.960]  it's not a private bank it's a cartel of private banks and it's just like a labor union you might
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:59.960]  say a labor union is not a person it's made up of many people who join the union and they may
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:05.400]  have officers and so forth but the labor union is not a person it's made up of many people
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:11.080]  and the federal reserve is not a bank it's made up of the major banks in the united states
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:17.720]  who've come together to form a cartel okay having said that then there's the answer it is neither a
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:24.600]  private bank and nor a government agency it is a cartel and it's a cartel which has gone into
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:29.400]  partnership with the federal government because they took their cartel agreement and they convinced
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:36.360]  the members of congress back in 1910 to pass that agreement into law they took that mentally you
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:40.600]  could take see that they took an eraser and erased the the heading of the paper they said
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:46.200]  federal reserve act they erased that or excuse me they got it wrong they said cartel agreement
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:50.280]  they erased that and then they wrote in federal reserve act and then they took it to congress
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:57.720]  congress voted for it and now this private cartel agreement becomes a a law it's it's the force of
[2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:03.640]  government but that's where the government and the cartel came together is when the private cartel
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:08.760]  got the government to convert their agreement into law so there you have it that's what it is it's
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:13.720]  it's a hybrid organization it's not there aren't many like it in the world but wherever you have
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:20.360]  a large cartel like we see in the health field right now or a large cartel in the utilities
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:26.200]  industry in the banking of course wherever you look we see cartels that's pretty much the same
[2:37:26.200 --> 2:37:31.320]  agreement that they have and they get the government involved so that the people have to obey the
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:37.560]  private agreement it's a weird and very dangerous and i think a very unhealthy arrangement in to
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:43.640]  heaven certainly you can't have it in a free world now that's it that's the short answer the more
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:50.120]  interesting question probably is this thing called fractional reserve banking well that's a little
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:54.440]  bit of a history lesson there because let's start off with the words what does that mean
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:38:00.280]  fractional reserve banking well we know what banking is that's that's an institution where
[2:38:00.280 --> 2:38:05.400]  they handle all your money and they control the money supply and they clear checks and
[2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:10.680]  that's the the group of people that takes care of your money that's banking now what's reserve
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:15.800]  banking well reserve banking is the is the concept that historically has always been attached to
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:21.960]  this thing called banking is that when you take your money to a bank you put it on deposit
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:29.480]  it's your money historically at least that's not that way today by the way but originally and we
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:33.080]  think of it still that way it's your money you took it to the bank and you are making the
[2:38:33.080 --> 2:38:39.160]  deposit of your money into the bank and they give you a receipt for it and it says basically this
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:47.080]  is a you have a an account which is you know the balance on demand a deposit on demand withdrawal
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:52.200]  on demand is called a demand deposit meaning that it's your money you can go in and say i want my
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:58.840]  money back now as long as it's you know Monday through Friday between eight and five o'clock
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:04.120]  you can demand your money because it's your money all right so the idea is that the bank has to keep
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:08.280]  that money somewhere in case you come in and you want it and they give it to you and the only way
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:13.400]  a bank can make sure that they have all of the money for all of the depositors is to have a reserve
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:18.760]  they call that a reserve in the bank usually in the vault either on their premises or someplace
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:25.560]  the money is there on reserve to protect your deposit that's the concept the pure concept of
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:33.160]  banking now comes the concept of fractional reserve banking that means that the banking system has
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:39.480]  evolved the practice and they considered to be the accepted practice now today that they don't have
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:45.720]  all of your money in a vault somewhere so that you can demand it they they learn from experience
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:51.480]  that not all people want all of their money at the same time so how silly it is to keep it all stacked
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:58.120]  up in the vaults and they never have to hand it out completely so they've learned that maybe only
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:04.840]  seven or eight percent of the people at one time really want their money so they'll say let's pass
[2:40:04.840 --> 2:40:10.760]  regulation in the bank and get congress to approve it it says we only need seven or eight percent
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:18.200]  reserve in the bank in case people want their money that's fractional reserve banking now
[2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:22.360]  you might say well what's wrong with that well what is wrong with that is that historically we
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.480]  know what's wrong with it because every once in a while the whatever happens there's something
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:32.120]  that happens in the economy or maybe there's a war maybe there's a disease that comes along
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:39.880]  an unemployment occurs some kind of civil disorder and people get nervous that they want their money
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:44.520]  and all of a sudden it's not just six or seven or eight percent but 20 percent and 30 percent of
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:49.640]  the people want their money and they go to the bank and the bank says oops we don't have it and
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:55.640]  they close their doors it's called a bank run it happens periodically in history it's very embarrassing
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:59.800]  and people want their money and the banks don't have it and they can't get it back from the
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:05.400]  those that they've loaned it to and the banks go belly up and many people who have trusted the
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:11.720]  banks lose their deposits the economy goes belly up and they they're wiped out it's a very bad
[2:41:11.720 --> 2:41:18.280]  situation in history it happens over and over again because of fractional reserve banking and
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:24.680]  by the way have we not though with the coronavirus thing have we not gone to a no reserve banking
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:30.280]  system now because they've changed their monetary policy that's exactly where i was going next we've
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:35.320]  evolved to the point where the banks really don't have any reserve at all because reserve of what
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:41.080]  that's the thing you see you talk about digital currency the national currencies of the world
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:47.560]  are already digital i mean how much money do you spend in cash or the and not you or i because i
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:53.640]  i like cash but most people rely totally on their credit cards don't they and that's not money in
[2:41:53.640 --> 2:41:57.960]  their pockets it's a piece of plastic it's electronically connected to a computer somewhere
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:02.920]  a big bank of computers and digits go whizzing around there's no money and even if you get to
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:08.520]  the cash the paper pieces of receipts called Federal Reserve notes what's behind that just
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:13.640]  more paper what's this thing called money it used to be that money was gold or silver something
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:18.280]  with intrinsic value so if you had it you had it for some purpose other than money which is what
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:24.440]  gave it value now even if you have the paper instead of the plastic it's still just a piece of paper
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:30.760]  all the way but you ever griffin i'm sure it's just a coincidence that during this virus outbreak
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:35.320]  and then they go to no reserve banking and then they want to roll out a digital currency worldwide
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:39.160]  i'm sure that's all just a coincidence not for a total control over the money supply
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:44.760]  oh you're so right these good honest people in banking and and politics would never dream
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:51.400]  of doing that would they redpillexpo.org i'm not sure if his sarcasm is always so witty but

[2:51:44.920 --> 2:51:55.960]  that's just called instinct against tyranny defiance against authoritarianism okay i am
[2:51:55.960 --> 2:52:02.600]  going to be handing over the platform to jale salenti who's going to be hosting the fourth hour
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:07.880]  in the next segment i mean it's crazy to believe we've already been through three hours so far
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:12.280]  here today folks uh Harrison Smith is going to be filling in for me on the war room today
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:19.720]  but let me just kind of highlight everything we've talked about here so far today now
[2:52:20.360 --> 2:52:25.320]  Ron Paul has said to trump it's time to end the shutdown it's time for resurrection well
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:29.400]  really next week's the perfect time with Easter Sunday coming up i mean you couldn't have scripted
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:33.560]  it better if you wanted if you wanted to so it really makes all the sense in the world but here's
[2:52:33.560 --> 2:52:40.440]  what i'm going to say and i think that this is really important right here folks the time for
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:48.520]  hedging is over all the cards are on the table no more cards can come out and so anybody who's in
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:54.280]  any position of influence or power whether that be in government at any level or the media at any
[2:52:54.280 --> 2:53:02.040]  level or any type of institution uh business industry whatever no more time for hedging this
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:07.640]  is the week we decide this is the week you pick your sides and you stake your claims if you want
[2:53:07.640 --> 2:53:13.080]  to continue the shutdown and the lockdown and the quarantine and all that stuff then you have to
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:17.240]  stake your claim in that issue and you have to own it and you have to say no we have to keep
[2:53:17.240 --> 2:53:22.520]  everything shut down and if you do stake that claim you have to commit to it and that means
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:29.880]  shut it all down folks now i want to be clear i'm not that side of the aisle i'ma reopen everything
[2:53:29.880 --> 2:53:34.280]  quit living in fear reopen the sports leagues reopen the gyms reopen the bars let's get back
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:38.840]  to life let's not live in fear let's let's see if we should really be scared of this virus or not
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:44.840]  or we should be maybe more afraid of the government media tyranny that we've seen forced upon us
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:53.160]  and so i have no qualms with that because that's the choice of freedom and that gives you the
[2:53:53.160 --> 2:53:57.640]  freedom to decide as well hey i want to be quarantined hey i want to vaccine hey i don't
[2:53:57.640 --> 2:54:01.080]  want to go to the bar i don't want to go to the game i don't want to go to the gym fine
[2:54:01.080 --> 2:54:05.720]  then you don't have to quit making the rest of us live in fear live in tyranny
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:12.280]  and so but those that do want to continue the shutdown they have to stake their claim
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:16.680]  they have to argue that everything has to be shut down no more time something is essential
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:20.280]  open at this time close this up no no no no no curfew no no no no you have to say it's all
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:26.600]  shut down 110 you have to go full bore folks you can't hedge no more middle ground this is causing
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:32.120]  confusion and it's not helping and really it's just these people are cowards and frauds that
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:37.880]  don't want to commit to anything because uh they just want to be liked or they you know whatever
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:43.320]  want to get along or something they really don't care they'll play they'll hedge no it's time to
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:49.240]  commit okay it's time to commit so put your money where your mouth is if you want people shut down
[2:54:49.240 --> 2:54:53.640]  and quarantine put your money where your mouth is and say it should all be shut down and then
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:59.480]  then those in government media and an industry that do decide that then you all have to start
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:05.320]  coming up with some answers when can we reopen what how many deaths a day is is too many or how
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:09.800]  many deaths a day is enough to say we're reopening how many new cases a day when do we get to we
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:15.160]  reopen how much of the crashing of the economy is going to end up killing people in the long run
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:19.240]  versus the virus now you'll notice none of them will do that because they're all cowards and
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:26.680]  frauds folks now some of the news we've highlighted today the tyranny is here ladies and gentlemen
[2:55:26.680 --> 2:55:33.400]  you're seeing it the government wants to give you cash so that you stay home google is now admitting
[2:55:33.400 --> 2:55:39.240]  they're tracking and tracing your movements in real time the next thing's coming putting a tattoo
[2:55:39.240 --> 2:55:44.600]  on your arm or a microchip in your wrist or some paper you have to have oh i've been tested for
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:49.880]  corona i'm corona free or i've had corona but gotten over it or i haven't had corona yet but i could
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:56.120]  get it like oh yeah that's now your new marking you just publicly walk around like a barcode
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:56:00.440]  that can just be scanned you're no longer a human you're just a barcode and then that decides
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:08.280]  what activities you can or can't engage in so we've seen that we've seen now
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:16.600]  now them pushing all of the numbers saying see the u.s has the most cases well why is that
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:22.280]  because we test the most people and the media is using anything at a hospital and folks you
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:27.480]  gotta understand just like jesse smallett uh just like nathan philips just like the media
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:33.960]  even the lowest level trump haters are now fully involved in this civil war lying at every level
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:37.880]  making things up at every level so they can turn around and make trump look bad and now what are
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:43.320]  they saying trump needs to be held responsible for crimes against humanity no not china that created

[2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:09.480]  want to send trump to trial it's all happening right now and they're suspending elections
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:16.840]  they're giving you government stimulus they're deciding who and who can't operate when and
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:22.360]  where no no no no that's not how america works ladies and gentlemen by the way you just will
[2:57:22.360 --> 2:57:28.040]  watch strikes again though uh folks it's just it's it's game over as soon as president trump
[2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:33.720]  wants to win he can win all right i love president trump best president our lifetime but it's time
[2:57:33.720 --> 2:57:37.480]  for him to put quit playing the whole charades with the coronavirus quit having the daily press
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:41.240]  briefings on that let's hear about hillary clinton's emails let's hear about the treason of the
[2:57:41.240 --> 2:57:45.560]  obama administration we need press conferences on that one of the products that i'm very proud of
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:51.560]  i don't talk enough about because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:56.360]  it takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product a lot of the
[2:57:56.360 --> 2:58:02.040]  sprays you put in your mouth through your throat and lungs are really thin it's a little bit of
[2:58:02.040 --> 2:58:08.600]  alcohol if you wanted to essential oils not our lung cleanse it's got a long list of the highest
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:16.920]  quality essential oils and ingredients in it you take a few sprays in your mouth lightly inhaled

[2:59:50.280 --> 3:00:11.880]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he it's alex jones and now your host owin shroyer
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:23.080]  here's where we're at folks for centuries really for the entire history of human history but for
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:31.720]  modern history there's a criminal cabal a technocracy a kleptocrat technocracy looking
[3:00:31.720 --> 3:00:38.920]  to bring in a one world government communism as the system the chinese model as the rollout and so
[3:00:38.920 --> 3:00:44.840]  the reason why george washington and the founding fathers fought and created america is because
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:54.280]  they realized this back in the 1700s and they said no we're free men and so you're not going to roll
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:01:03.640]  this out on us and they created america a test of self-government a test of a trial of the human
[3:01:03.640 --> 3:01:11.080]  will and ability and what happened well it was the most successful political test in history and so
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:20.040]  yeah are there flaws of course but it's self-government it's the free market and it won and it dominated
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:26.840]  and it continues to so the enemies of freedom in the 1700s still exist today different names
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:33.320]  different faces same bloodlines in many cases and so now what do they do well they're free
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:38.840]  well they can't let you have america they can't let america be successful because the success of
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:47.000]  america the freedom of the american people and the higher standard of living that we have here
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:52.040]  is death to communism it's death to the one world government model it's death to the
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:56.120]  tyrannical government model so they have to lie about it and destroy it that's the only way to
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:05.720]  bring it about so now here we are what happens a bio weapon is created and released out of a lab
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:15.880]  in wuhan china china then covers it up and lies about it the democrats in america do the exact
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:22.200]  same thing saying nothing to worry about here fauci says nothing to worry about here don't
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:29.160]  shut down the borders at all don't stop traveling from china that's racist that goes on for two months
[3:02:29.720 --> 3:02:36.440]  then what happens major viral outbreak all around the world global pandemic well what happens then
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:43.080]  well the democrats change tune how dare trump let this pandemic outbreak well trump let this
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:47.880]  pandemic happen so now we have to take all your rights it's all trumps fault even though china
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:53.080]  lied about it and the democrats did their bidding in the west and said you know don't worry keep
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:58.440]  everything open for now and then it spread and then blame trump so that's what they did because
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:02.280]  they have to get trump out of office because he represents the last real american leader with any
[3:03:02.280 --> 3:03:11.800]  political power and so that's where we're at today and so now they put the media gun to trumps head
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:20.520]  and they say if you don't shut down everything and if you don't let america collapse into tyranny
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:27.800]  guess what we're going to tell everybody that you are responsible for all these deaths and then
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:34.200]  we're going to charge you in a world court for crimes against humanity and throw you in jail
[3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:45.800]  and that's now what they're doing now look president trump is not my enemy and i support
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:52.760]  him but let me tell you something right now and i know he realizes this but he needs to start
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:04:00.600]  acting like it he is in the final death rows for america and we can sit here and we can have
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:07.800]  coronavirus press briefings all day long with that coward and fraud anthony fauci but it's time for
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:12.360]  the president to make a radical decision and start having daily press briefings about the treason
[3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:16.920]  committed by obama start having daily press briefings about how we've had our intellectual
[3:04:16.920 --> 3:04:26.520]  property stolen and being just financially raped by china talk about how china lied about these
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:31.800]  numbers how it was a bio weapon that came out of china let's have press briefings on that
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:36.680]  let's stop the fear mongering let's stop the panic let's stop the collapse of america and
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:47.640]  let's bring to light the realities of how and why we got here fauci is a fraud fauci is a fraud
[3:04:47.640 --> 3:04:57.080]  fauci is a fraud fauci is a fraud listen to me very carefully we have confirmed that california
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:03.480]  is set within days or weeks to announce a total stay-at-home order and will shut down grocery
[3:05:03.480 --> 3:05:09.480]  stores and yes even pharmacies ladies and gentlemen this is what they're announcing to
[3:05:09.480 --> 3:05:15.320]  create total panic to try to trigger a depression to blame on trump then when trump doesn't all
[3:05:15.320 --> 3:05:23.000]  assume they will blame every single death on president trump this is a psi op using a real
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:30.200]  deadly virus this is super dangerous and everyone needs to get supplies in now the food chain is
[3:05:30.200 --> 3:05:36.360]  getting low as well and you need to get the supplements just to be safe at info or store
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:40.920]  dot com and stock up because who knows the future it will even be able to operate we're ready to

[3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:10.040]  ladies and gentlemen america was flatlining on its deathbed and then donald trump came along and
[3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:15.800]  just shocked us back to life and so we're still kind of hazy opening our eyes getting our sensations
[3:06:15.800 --> 3:06:25.400]  back and then here comes the deep state globalist to say no you're sick lay back down get back in
[3:06:25.400 --> 3:06:32.360]  that hospital bed you're dead and america's believing it and president trump kind of just
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:36.520]  standing there watching the whole thing happened hoping that america will realize no we're not sick
[3:06:36.520 --> 3:06:43.000]  we're okay we can be free because that's the real power is that you take it and not rely on on
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:49.560]  donald trump so gerald solenti is about to take over from trends research dot com but gerald i have
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:06:56.440]  to ask you you know you're up there in new york you have to be so pleased with your leadership

[3:07:40.440 --> 3:07:47.320]  streets are empty and again you know now a magazine the trends journal i talked about wrote about it
[3:07:47.320 --> 3:07:54.280]  as it was happening with uh little andy qualmo the daddy's boy the daddy's boy that named the tap
[3:07:54.280 --> 3:08:02.600]  and z bridge the mario qualmo bridge like his father's better than mine you know that little boy

[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:45.640]  little lowlife scum did as this corona hysteria was breaking out in the media and hardly the numbers
[3:08:45.640 --> 3:08:50.920]  by the way the numbers add up to nothing as we're speaking i went what are we looking at about
[3:08:50.920 --> 3:09:01.720]  76 000 people dead on the global population of 7.7 billion people this is going on for three months
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:10.200]  so anyway lowlife qualmo who robbed us of our constitutional rights that the press media won't
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:17.320]  talk about as all these little lowlife scum politicians these little lowlife repulsive kids
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:25.320]  and demo craps around the country closing down about 80 percent of our nation he slipped in a bill
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:32.440]  on a bill that was going through he slipped in a clause a couple of weeks ago that would give him
[3:09:32.440 --> 3:09:42.120]  supreme power over all of us and then he took it he called the state of emergency what constitution
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:48.760]  i heard you speaking a little before what bill writes shove it they don't mean anything and it's
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:56.200]  not only america it's germany it's norway it's italy as an italian i'm ashamed of them but then
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:10:04.440]  again i thought back what's so different they marched to move saliti they hired hitler all
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:13.800]  right they followed off a lowlife piece of scum stupid so be another daddy's boy george

[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:51.400]  and a war the war based on lies said i'm who's saying had weapons of mass destruction the people
[3:10:52.120 --> 3:11:00.440]  are sheeple and they follow their leaders you name the country it's one after another
[3:11:00.440 --> 3:11:09.320]  and now hear this now hear this history is repeating itself go back to the 1930s
[3:11:10.760 --> 3:11:22.040]  markets crashed right currency war trade war great depression world war three now
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:29.720]  currency wars how much have we heard about the trade war we are entering the greatest
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:41.000]  oppression world war three if we don't fight for our freedom if we don't fight for our rights and
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:48.600]  i am a warrior of the prince of peace i fight for peace we are going to die in war you see how
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:55.000]  the imbeciles the morons the heil hitlers the march to musilines the salute stylings and it's all
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:12:04.600]  repeating itself even to the point welcome back stasi in germany it's everywhere hey my neighbor has
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:09.880]  three people out in the backyard and they're having a barbecue hey they're walking too close
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:19.160]  they're calling up the cops and ratting everybody out just like they did when the terrorists took
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:27.800]  over the country and that's what's going on now you know it's incredible too to be witnessing
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:33.320]  how they can do this in such a short period of time and and the one thing that i want to piggyback
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:37.880]  off of what you said and then jared solenti is taking over the rest of the way you know i think
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:43.400]  that the average american and this probably applies worldwide but i'll stick to our domestic issues
[3:12:43.400 --> 3:12:49.160]  here the average american couldn't even name their local politician they couldn't even probably name
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:53.160]  i mean most of them except for since trump or obama probably couldn't even tell you who the
[3:12:53.160 --> 3:12:59.320]  president was the vice president americans are politically ignorant okay mostly by choice but
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:05.640]  i but i know while most americans probably don't even know where to look to find where their local
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:11.080]  judges or who their local representative is in the house or the senate oh they know how to put the
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:17.080]  tv on though oh hell yeah they do they can put that tv on they can flip through channels faster

[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:04.360]  knew jailed and as you know we don't have any real leaders all we have is the tv the tv tells us
[3:14:04.360 --> 3:14:10.920]  what to do that's all it is as long as they control the tv they control all of us at the

[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:35.480]  when the iraq war broke out the numbers are all there they fired guys like that guy mike donnie
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:45.080]  you date an msnbc date date the people that they put on were pro war the numbers are right

[3:21:56.440 --> 3:22:07.400]  dying because of diabetes obesity lung disease they're chronically ill already but i instantly
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:13.800]  character low life governor over there in washington the state of washington closed down the state now
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:19.320]  he's bragging that the numbers are coming down you know yeah most of the people that died were
[3:22:19.320 --> 3:22:26.520]  from a nursing homes in kirkland washington it's the elderly in the ill chronically ill they're

[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:11.480]  of how many people died in san francisco when these are the first places they're closing down
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:17.160]  i believe it was around 12 or less to date
[3:24:19.800 --> 3:24:26.680]  or a couple of days no number out of a population one they got about 700 000 people a million people
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:34.120]  they're the ones that started this and then the prostitutes

[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:50.840]  the little geek freaks yeah the only thing that changes is the color of their t-shirts

[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:09.320]  the toilet where they began to be long just like when hurricanes start yeah there's a tough guy for

[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:36.680]  and i believe in them as i said to you what they do is they sell fear and hysteria and here's an
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:49.560]  example this is in today's wall street journal breaking story bronxu bronx i grew up right near
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:36:02.040]  the bronxu bronxu tiger tests positive for virus you mean a little miserable lion that they put
[3:36:02.040 --> 3:36:14.280]  in a cage tests positive for corona virus and that's news how about all the other diseases that
[3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:21.080]  these poor animals are dying from as they're taken out of the wilderness and locked up into
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:26.120]  jails called zoos i mean that's just the way i see it and you know the motto of the trends
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:34.200]  journalists think for yourself i won't go to the zoo but anyway that's the way they keep hyping this
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:43.240]  and it's hype after hype again today's front page of the wall street journal what does it say
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:54.840]  nation braces for brutal week as death toll nears 10 000 okay so this time already this year
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:37:03.320]  from the flu i believe from like october 2019 to march the numbers that i'm seeing are between
[3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:12.920]  33 000 and 55 000 people in that range have died of the flu that's a lot more than 10 000 i'm not
[3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:31.160]  good at math but 10 000 dead in a population of now it's 10 500 330 million adds up to 0.0035
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:39.800]  percent which is i asked my accountant to do it i couldn't figure out how so thank you neil pacifico
[3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:47.880]  pacifico you know i mean these numbers when you when you look at them the global population of
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:56.520]  7.7 billion people you know about 78 000 people died you know these are no numbers and let's not
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:38:02.520]  talk about the 10 million people that are starving in yemen and suffering from cholera
[3:38:02.520 --> 3:38:10.920]  and Ebola we won't talk about them they don't count so when we're looking at closing down
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:18.920]  now over half the global economy and 80 percent of america's economy we're going into the greatest
[3:38:18.920 --> 3:38:24.200]  depression like we've never seen before i just want to throw some numbers at you
[3:38:24.200 --> 3:38:32.920]  emerging market economies brace for hits again we've been writing about this in the journal
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:41.640]  the emerging markets were bracing for a hit before the coronavirus hysteria and they're not
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:46.440]  and people when you read the media they say you know they blame it on the coronavirus
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:52.520]  don't blame it on the coronavirus blame it on the politicians that are taking these police state
[3:38:52.520 --> 3:38:58.920]  actions to close down businesses and again no talk about our violation of the bill of
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:04.600]  rights of the constitution it were that fact any other country oh and speaking about other
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:11.400]  countries they're not locked down over there in sweden and that's not a third world place
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:20.040]  so going back to the emerging markets they were submerging before this
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:28.520]  this now you have the dollar going up not today a dollar down a bit gold prices as we speak today
[3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:38.040]  are over now over 1700 dollars an ounce you're up like 60 something bucks just today you know why
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:44.840]  because of all this cheap money that they're pumping in around the world to boost failing
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:51.960]  markets that were failing before this happened the u.s. growth rate this year was only projected
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:59.320]  to be like two percent that was the same since the great recession ended in 2009 last quarter in
[3:39:59.320 --> 3:40:03.720]  europe gerald salante alex jones here with an emergency bulletin i was in there having my
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:07.880]  lunch watching you and then they brought me in the documents and i just wanted to let you know
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:11.160]  you i never break into you and you're absolutely right that the markets were failing they wanted
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:17.560]  to pump in 15 16 17 trillion of themselves you're absolutely right we were watching our
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:21.720]  earlier day rob do was the new york briefing two hours ago he brought it to me so while i was
[3:40:21.720 --> 3:40:27.320]  watching you i i turned you down and watch what he had on the laptop or the ipad they admit all
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:32.600]  over the country that about april first or so making the april fools virus as someone called it
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:38.520]  it began to peak and there was quomo during his press conference showing the projection they wanted
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:43.400]  versus the projection they first claimed of you know all these millions dead the little bitty purple
[3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:50.920]  projection was where it was that showing it crested about six days ago so you finish up the show
[3:40:50.920 --> 3:40:56.680]  the war rooms start and i'm going to co-host it with oan schreuer and harris and smith today
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:01.320]  we're going to show that press conference from two hours ago where they hide it in plain view
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:06.360]  what the real numbers are versus what they hope to bring the curve down to versus what they said
[3:41:06.360 --> 3:41:10.680]  it would be if we didn't take action and then we have similar numbers all over the country showing
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:16.280]  it broke even before april first uh so this is amazing news and information and then we have
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:21.400]  trump saying the vaccine uh might have a horrible impact and that vaccines have been proven to be
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:26.440]  dangerous in many cases that's unprecedented and then steve bannon has come out and said henry
