[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:32.280]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:32.280 --> 00:40.960]  I am being threatened with jail by the criminal United States Department of Commerce occupied
[00:40.960 --> 00:48.240]  by foreign banks who via the RAND Corporation are publicly establishing a United Nations
[00:48.240 --> 00:55.080]  occupation force now I've covered this a few years ago and also covered it 15 years ago
[00:55.080 --> 01:00.000]  but I thought today I would explain to you why all of this is happening here's the actual
[01:00.000 --> 01:09.080]  plan for paramilitary police literally in your home running checkpoints reeducation centers
[01:09.080 --> 01:16.840]  everything it's from the RAND Corporation say 200 plus page stability police force for
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.600]  United States justification and options for creating US capabilities the first version
[01:22.600 --> 01:28.200]  of this I saw in 1998 and it's got a whole index of other accompanying papers this is
[01:28.200 --> 01:34.920]  how they're going to lock you and your family up at a forced labor camp so I'm going to
[01:34.920 --> 01:45.400]  integrate this in with internment and resettlement operations FM 3-3940 today now you wonder
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.280]  why all this unconstitutional stuff's going on it's because the lawless have taken over
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.040]  and they're breaking our will right now we're going to stick our hands down your pants at
[01:54.040 --> 01:57.760]  the airport now it's going to be on the side of the highway now we're going to go inside
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.480]  your body on the side of the highway randomly pulling you over now we're going to shove
[02:01.480 --> 02:09.200]  needles in your arms now we're going to question your kids about you and the so-called census
[02:09.200 --> 02:15.240]  is every 10 years to a portion the members of Congress how many members of the house
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.280]  you get two senators how many members of the house you get it goes back to the Bible the
[02:19.280 --> 02:29.160]  Leviticus and several other books to number the people and the general public maybe one
[02:29.160 --> 02:34.880]  out of 50 or so get the yearly survey now but businesses get the yearly and even monthly
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.200]  survey telling me to go get tens of thousands of dollars of accounting done under penalty
[02:40.200 --> 02:46.880]  of perjury and it says two months ago we requested that you participate we requested you participate
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.000]  in a mandatory see it's all written fraud wise this is fraud they don't care they're
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.760]  lawless crooks in a mandatory national survey by completing the 2012 annual services report
[02:57.760 --> 03:04.080]  stocks bonds officers licenses I mean when I said ten thousand dollars if I actually
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.560]  accounted and did this right it cost us a hundred thousand two hundred that we would
[03:08.560 --> 03:16.920]  shut down plus it says under penalty of perjury fill this out you can go to hell crooks okay
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.560]  how's that sound I'm going to write fifth amendment on this and I'm going to mail it
[03:20.560 --> 03:31.280]  back to you again just like the IRS charity head top IRS official invokes fifth amendment
[03:31.280 --> 03:36.000]  in congressional hearing about tea party targeting program by the way the tea party folks went
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.600]  out about the most law abiding group out there I've seen the statistics you've seen them
[03:40.600 --> 03:46.960]  as well went out to protest the IRS building and they had the federal police out there
[03:46.960 --> 03:51.800]  with their guns and their body language was sticking their chest out bugging their eyes
[03:51.800 --> 03:56.760]  out at them at the tea part ears that's what the two billion bullets are for that's what
[03:56.760 --> 04:02.080]  the paper targets of old ladies and little kids are for folks I've been to the urban warfare
[04:02.080 --> 04:07.240]  drills but it's all public in the army manual FM three dash three nine dot forty interment
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.760]  resettlement it's all public in the national international talks about UN forces in America
[04:13.760 --> 04:21.960]  how the UN and NATO have occupied and how they're going to do it they're imploding America
[04:21.960 --> 04:28.320]  and then they call themselves the stability force while they do it now the good news is
[04:28.320 --> 04:32.400]  I talked to feds I talked to police you name it most of them are awake but they're still
[04:32.400 --> 04:38.120]  got their job being ordered to do this but we're being converted into poverty that's
[04:38.120 --> 04:41.600]  the globalist management system so I thought I'd go through some of the police state news
[04:41.600 --> 04:46.880]  today by the way they just came this morning with this they were here last week to threatening
[04:46.880 --> 04:54.160]  us this is the example of what we live under but the fifth amendments only for the foreign

[08:24.000 --> 08:33.000]  this Wednesday the 22nd day of May 2013 no guest today so we can cover the news and obviously
[08:33.000 --> 08:42.600]  take your phone calls I got in here this morning and went over the news and it just absolutely
[08:42.600 --> 08:51.280]  mortified me because the criminal elements of government and corporations are in a pedal
[08:51.280 --> 09:05.280]  to the metal balls to the walls mocked in hair on fire bum rush counter offensive against
[09:05.280 --> 09:12.520]  common sense in humanity now they see us waking up and speaking out and acting like free people
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.520]  as a counter offensive we're just trying to survive and get some oxygen into our lungs
[09:17.520 --> 09:22.560]  we're just trying to build a civilization for our families and our children but the control
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.160]  freaks have all convinced themselves that they're better than us and that they deserve
[09:28.160 --> 09:36.200]  to rule over us and what's happening is the western world underage into 21 is publicly
[09:36.200 --> 09:45.120]  being shut down they are publicly collapsing the entire western world while trying to collapse
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.840]  the third world as well that came out almost four years ago in the Copenhagen documents
[09:49.840 --> 09:57.520]  where they were going to have right at double the carbon taxes on the third world they were
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.960]  going to have on the west and they had told the third world you we're going to shut down
[10:02.960 --> 10:10.480]  the wealthy west and give you all the money trying to use class envy and of course then
[10:10.480 --> 10:24.600]  the treaty came out and it was a anti-human manifesto of agenda 21 part two and this
[10:24.600 --> 10:30.640]  is what we're under and the frustration is for somebody that's read agenda 21 and somebody
[10:30.640 --> 10:37.400]  who's read the accompanying documents and someone who studies all of this then I read
[10:37.400 --> 10:44.880]  internment and resettlement operations FM 3-3940 and even more importantly the master document
[10:44.880 --> 10:50.640]  that's been reissued since about 1998 over and over again at the ran corporations own
[10:50.640 --> 10:57.280]  website that's thousands of pages long the latest edition is 200 plus pages a stability
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.000]  police force for the United States justification and options for creating us capabilities over
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.480]  the years I have read different versions of this scan over it last night I spent about
[11:10.480 --> 11:17.040]  an hour here at the office and about two hours at home rereading it and it made me physically
[11:17.040 --> 11:28.240]  ill physically ill I actually got nauseous probably so I was so exhausted and about
[11:28.240 --> 11:33.280]  two a.m. went in and almost threw up but it was psychologically being so obsessed with
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.160]  reality and knowing everything about the program and when I see cops and I see training and
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.520]  I see newscast I know it's just the latest incremental rollout and the cops in the media
[11:44.520 --> 11:51.480]  don't know this people don't go read all this this says you and directed occupied federal
[11:51.480 --> 11:57.160]  police under the Department of Defense via the rural affairs council which you now have
[11:57.160 --> 12:07.720]  under Obama in place though this was proposed in 98 literally calling it a stability force
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.040]  police force for the United States and talking about how it's the UN NATO model in all the
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.680]  countries they've occupied and how they're going to interrogate us how they're going
[12:16.680 --> 12:22.160]  to break us down how they're going to phase in banning protest by free speech zones and
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.200]  then saying protesting isn't safe and how they're going to phase out liberty but they
[12:27.200 --> 12:39.400]  they propose it as a service to humanity brought to you by the United Nations and Interpol
[12:39.400 --> 12:51.840]  and even the average constitutional lawyer is not going to read this and about 2 a.m.
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.480]  I just got on my knees in the living room and I said God did we have to go through this
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.800]  because I know what's going to unfold I know the whole program it's so horrible they're
[13:00.800 --> 13:05.640]  just going to keep turning all the industry off there's an article in there in the broadcast
[13:05.640 --> 13:09.480]  studio in the control room Austin American statesman we bring me the Austin American
[13:09.480 --> 13:16.960]  station from Monday or maybe it's Sunday the headline was Monday the headline was poor
[13:16.960 --> 13:23.840]  flood to Texas to Austin as the rest of the country collapses and it's going to be like
[13:23.840 --> 13:31.160]  this everywhere and people that still have jobs are going to be hunted by the criminals
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.400]  and hunted by the parasitic government and corporations and it's just trampling and being
[13:35.400 --> 13:42.760]  trampled on and they are imploding the world and then posing as the saviors of the stability
[13:42.760 --> 13:52.120]  force while they do it and I have a stack of news here today one of them is linked up
[13:52.120 --> 13:59.360]  on drugs report dot com on the left hand side armed homeland guards protect IRS from tea
[13:59.360 --> 14:09.880]  party protesters and I just look at this whole criminal class even the IRS is illegal threatening
[14:09.880 --> 14:13.520]  you with perjury if you don't fill out all these you know hundreds of forms that no one
[14:13.520 --> 14:17.160]  can get right because it's not meant to be gotten right so they can make you a criminal
[14:17.160 --> 14:22.240]  and take everything you've got and then most the politicians don't even pay taxes the big
[14:22.240 --> 14:28.120]  mega banks don't pay any taxes that's on record I mean it's just a total mafia now saying
[14:28.120 --> 14:33.920]  the answer is make us all poor so that we're not uppity and then posing as saviors while
[14:33.920 --> 14:40.160]  they implode at all and then Congress tries to reassert itself and says let us see all
[14:40.160 --> 14:43.360]  these documents and IRS says no we're not going to show them to you well they should
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.480]  all be arrested but they won't be and the head of the IRS division who's been caught
[14:48.480 --> 14:56.480]  running the persecution obviously ordered to do it I've seen MSNBC three years ago by
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.120]  the way we found the clips and then they in the last few days they've been saying of course
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.360]  we target the tea party they're racist and deserve to be arrested they deserve to be
[15:06.360 --> 15:12.800]  a spy at all without warrants and the thing is these idiot Democrat minions they're being
[15:12.800 --> 15:17.280]  chemtrailed they're being given deadly shots they're eating GMO their kids are mentally
[15:17.280 --> 15:23.040]  retarded their IQs are dropping I mean all over the US folks we lead the world the IQs
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.080]  have dropped I was saying 10 points that was like 15 year old dad it's like 20 points pretty
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.160]  sure it look look look you know the good news for all of you is this isn't going to go on
[15:32.160 --> 15:40.000]  much longer in the H1N1 vaccine and the rest of it are the quote stress vaccine and what
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.720]  it is is a virus that actually eats part of your brain and that's why the public most
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.040]  of them can't even do it anymore I mean it's already they're already killing everybody
[15:47.040 --> 15:52.480]  it's unbelievable and it's just going to get incrementally crazier and crazier and I mean
[15:52.480 --> 15:59.240]  I'm up at 2 a.m. reading how they're going to occupy us with UN troops and then knowing
[15:59.240 --> 16:05.600]  when I come on today and show you out of this document where they say all of it out of the
[16:05.600 --> 16:11.680]  Ram Corporation Arroyo Center that I've read every year's permutation I had looked at this
[16:11.680 --> 16:15.680]  in about a year so I pulled it up yesterday and it was even worse I mean it describes
[16:15.680 --> 16:21.920]  it all in there how they're going to occupy us and it even shows the blue and white trucks
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.440]  for the sustainability police force and by the way it was those same blue and white trucks
[16:28.440 --> 16:33.400]  confronting and getting in the face of the peaceful tea partiers going to the IRS and
[16:33.400 --> 16:37.600]  the feds are there with cameras videotaping them trying to intimidate them there's feds
[16:37.600 --> 16:42.280]  in black suits standing there bugging their eyes out at people as they walk by the parking
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.640]  lot and then and then people go over and try to talk to them and then the arrogance goes
[16:46.640 --> 16:53.720]  out of the face of the of the Fed and he touches the guy and says move along I mean just idiots
[16:53.720 --> 17:01.560]  idiots thinking they're on a winning team for a globalist soft killed incremental siege
[17:01.560 --> 17:07.040]  destruction system I mean we're going to see toll roads put everywhere everything bankrupted
[17:07.040 --> 17:15.440]  all the small businesses shut down by design and just the destruction of prosperity with
[17:15.440 --> 17:21.840]  the globalist exempt from everything buying everything up and everyone kissing their butts
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.720]  and then the crime is going to be so bad you're going to be glad to see security guards you're
[17:25.720 --> 17:31.520]  going to be glad to see cops in black uniforms you're going to be glad because the petty
[17:31.520 --> 17:36.600]  crime is going up all over the country not the violent crime is there afraid of that
[17:36.600 --> 17:42.240]  because I know people have guns but the petty crimes exploding but it won't matter you'll
[17:42.240 --> 17:47.080]  see it as protection but then meanwhile the system through a hundred other ways is going
[17:47.080 --> 17:52.000]  to absolutely drain you no matter how much money you make if you're not an insider you
[17:52.000 --> 18:04.800]  will pay 100% tax 100% Reuters reported France now has a 100% tax rate I tried to do the
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.920]  math last year when I saw the numbers 75% national tax on middle class and wealthy and
[18:10.920 --> 18:16.800]  another 75% on that but I couldn't add up all the local other taxes but Reuters reported
[18:16.800 --> 18:26.000]  that it's 100% there it is taxes on some wealthy French cops 100% what did Thomas Jefferson
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.680]  say the level of tyranny you'll be live under whatever level you put up with it is a maximum
[18:30.680 --> 18:40.600]  evil maximum and I just got another process server at the office from the Department of
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.800]  Commerce and they're now saying they're going to find me or arrest me if I don't spend it's
[18:45.800 --> 18:51.640]  got to be a hundred thousand dollars to tell them just every dime and they say if it isn't
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.000]  accurate I will be arrested for that and I have no Fifth Amendment the IRS folks was
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.800]  set up when they set up the private Federal Reserve all the money goes offshore none
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.480]  of it runs the country it's the Gestapo it's meant to shut down their competition all the
[19:06.480 --> 19:13.320]  elites are exempt they've written the laws Google 0% tax General Electric 0% tax JP Morgan
[19:13.320 --> 19:22.400]  0% tax and they've got the private security firms and they run the NSA the big banks they
[19:22.400 --> 19:29.840]  all run the NSA the telecommunications companies aren't jacked by the NSA they are the NSA
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.720]  I mean their meetings are all public they're the global government by the way they've announced
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.320]  they're not going to allow protest or is everybody still going to go to Goldberg they said well
[19:39.320 --> 19:45.160]  you might do something wrong so we're not allowing permits northwest of London for citizens

[24:05.080 --> 24:13.000]  into a plethora of video clips audio clips I'm going to break down one of the top IRS
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.800]  minions of the foreign banks one of the occupiers of this country she took the fifth she said
[24:19.800 --> 24:26.360]  that's the right of all innocent people to protect themselves from persecution the IRS
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.040]  is a government agency but it collects money for the private fellow reserve we built this country
[24:32.600 --> 24:39.960]  without the IRS and most IRS employees I know because you can't you can't you know take a
[24:39.960 --> 24:43.560]  swing in the dark without running into an IRS agent here in Austin it's one of the biggest
[24:43.560 --> 24:48.920]  IRS command bases in the country like just right where my office is there's IRS stuff all around
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.120]  here they all know it's a fraud they all know they can't go after billionaires and insiders and
[24:54.120 --> 24:59.880]  they're told who to go after who to not it's always been that way and America's just now going
[24:59.880 --> 25:10.200]  wait Google pays 0% tax and then domestically 3.4% and Obama pays 18% but Alex Jones pays 40% and
[25:10.200 --> 25:18.440]  anybody making over 125 thousand dollars a year knows you pay 40% now and that's just that tax
[25:18.440 --> 25:27.800]  then there's all the dozens and dozens of others but I just showed TV viewers 100% tax on anybody
[25:27.800 --> 25:34.840]  making over a million euros a year and that's about a million dollars now remember when you're
[25:34.840 --> 25:43.800]  paying 75 federal tax that's a quarter million euros then you pay all the local taxes and then
[25:43.800 --> 25:58.200]  they now have a tax on whatever's left federally is 100% 100% 100 and then it came out a few
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.320]  months ago that the entire Socialist Party all the leaders were paying no tax and the EU bureaucrats
[26:03.320 --> 26:10.520]  are tax exempt and the French actually rioted a bunch of cities got burned partially over the
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.320]  French rioting did you hear that in the news I mean it was a footnote in the French news
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.400]  you ready to pay 100% tax and by the way there's all these people that are you know making 20,000
[26:25.400 --> 26:29.400]  a year 30,000 and I hate everybody who makes more than them who do you think gives you a job
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.360]  who do you think comes in your restaurant who do you think buys a car from your car lot who do you
[26:34.360 --> 26:40.840]  think the more money there is in and the bigger the middle class and the more real wealthy you've
[26:40.840 --> 26:48.520]  got who build houses and buy cars and send kids to college and go on trips there and buy books and
[26:48.520 --> 26:55.320]  you get an economy a complex economy that isn't a one crop economy but America to use an economic
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.440]  term is going into a one crop economy and that's tyranny and oppression and monopoly
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.880]  and I'm going to try to calm down when we come back in the next segment is a longer segment and
[27:07.320 --> 27:10.360]  I'm going to get into the whole IRS thing I'm going to get into all the other news but you know
[27:11.960 --> 27:15.400]  I started reading again and I'm going to cover this in the third hour today
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.720]  a sustainability police force for the United States
[27:21.080 --> 27:25.560]  justification and options for creating US capabilities and the first time I read this
[27:25.560 --> 27:33.320]  the Austin American states for an article in 1998 this is a new version updated and it said oh there's
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.080]  going to be terror attacks in America soon and rank corporation says we need to get rid of our
[27:37.080 --> 27:41.320]  freedom and have troops on every corner and spies everywhere but this will be our new economy
[27:41.320 --> 27:47.320]  and it's going to be great and uh and so I went to the UT law library couldn't find it online at
[27:47.320 --> 27:54.040]  the time got a copy of it checked it out they acted like secret agents when I tried to get a copy of
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.080]  it from they had it back in the stacks that only phd's could get but somebody was a fan there so
[27:59.080 --> 28:04.840]  let me have it and I read the thing and it it was everything they've now set up you read the
[28:04.840 --> 28:11.800]  rank corporation documents on on federal police force sustainability force from 1998 folks it's
[28:11.800 --> 28:24.280]  all happened now now that's why I'm freaked out man you read the new one you know the reason it's
[28:24.280 --> 28:29.960]  it's it's a it's a cross between getting a chill getting tears in my eyes and also going into rage
[28:29.960 --> 28:35.880]  that what am I supposed to do to get the public and everybody to realize this is a criminal takeover
[28:35.880 --> 28:44.520]  admittedly and they talk about a stability program just like the british ministry of defense 2007

[33:17.960 --> 33:24.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:33.400 --> 33:38.920]  my friends i'm gonna get into the irs news i'm gonna get into all the latest developments but
[33:38.920 --> 33:47.400]  but people are up in arms about the irs harassing pro-life groups churches billy graham's son
[33:48.280 --> 33:55.400]  uh libertarian groups i mean of course they do adan salazar has got an article coming out
[33:55.400 --> 33:59.880]  where we've confirmed they're federalizing local police around the country it's all part of the
[33:59.880 --> 34:07.880]  rand corporation plan and where bizarre red armbands and they took part in helping arrest
[34:07.880 --> 34:12.440]  adam kokesh when he was on federal property local philadelphia police did
[34:14.920 --> 34:20.920]  but in there they list these local federal specialized police as anti-terror and anti-civil
[34:20.920 --> 34:27.080]  disobedience and they list protesting as civil disobedience protesting demonstrating as people
[34:27.080 --> 34:32.440]  getting together saying we don't like what you're doing this is our country but all over the us
[34:32.440 --> 34:39.880]  they will not issue protest permits to any type of libertarian or conservative group i
[34:39.880 --> 34:46.280]  don't get permits i go on the capital and i protest i go into the capital and get in people's face
[34:48.520 --> 34:54.840]  and the police stood down and did their job because they a didn't don't like what's happening i
[34:54.840 --> 34:59.960]  happened to have talked to some of the top people and b they understood hey you get a permit if you
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.720]  want the steps all to yourself just like you get a permit to block a road for your parade then you've
[35:05.720 --> 35:11.320]  got to get a permit because you're blocking everybody else but see that's why gun permits
[35:11.320 --> 35:16.200]  sure you get a permit to be specially trained to have it concealed because common law says
[35:16.200 --> 35:21.640]  you can't have concealed weapons because bad guys carry concealed weapons so now we can because
[35:21.640 --> 35:25.720]  it's illegal to have concealed weapons under common law we can give you a license to have one
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.800]  because it can also scare the bad guys but see then it turns
[35:34.120 --> 35:38.520]  the idea of owning guns into a permit period kind of like oh you want a church now you gotta
[35:38.520 --> 35:42.600]  have a permit for that well congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[35:42.600 --> 35:48.280]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof oh well we you're not really a church technically you're a
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.920]  charity now and that's what we passed the law on because congress can make a law on a charity
[35:52.920 --> 36:00.040]  and you've opted in to be a charity see it's all contract fraud and so the IRS people have been
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.440]  caught and the whole administration's clamming up and they're taking the fifth just like on Fast and
[36:04.440 --> 36:11.160]  Furious and it's gone all the way up to the top person right under the director and the head of
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.320]  the IRS is resigning right when they were already retiring it's all smoke and mirrors it's all
[36:15.320 --> 36:21.320]  cynical jokes and she says I'm taking the Fifth Amendment which doesn't mean I'm guilty it's to
[36:21.320 --> 36:30.040]  protect innocent people from persecution you bet it is baby cakes but I know what the IRS does
[36:30.040 --> 36:35.080]  I've experienced it and other constitutionalists I know have experienced it I don't make a big
[36:35.080 --> 36:40.120]  deal out of it because I'm busy fighting the new world order I'm not you know when dirty tricks
[36:40.120 --> 36:47.800]  go on all sorts of stuff I just know I'm over the target but of course they persecute people
[36:47.800 --> 36:54.120]  I mean I've had them federal and state and local police let's not exaggerate
[36:56.440 --> 37:02.360]  30 plus times conservatively over the years come up and go hey Alex let's blow some stuff up let's
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.880]  kill some cops and when that didn't work I'm out covering an urban warfare drill and a commando
[37:07.880 --> 37:12.120]  rolls out of the bushes in front of me in my cancer to start lighting fires going you shouldn't
[37:12.120 --> 37:16.760]  have done this and then the guy was surprised when we jumped on him I'm not gonna brag about what
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.600]  went on but the point is is it's all what's your go you're with the government so you're
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.240]  you're real tough I'm supposed to be scared of you you know what somebody in the wrong cannot
[37:25.240 --> 37:30.360]  stand up against somebody who's in the right who keeps on it coming and the point is I know what
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.560]  I'm talking about okay I mean you know what it's like to go over a 200 page document like I did
[37:35.560 --> 37:40.600]  last night scanning through it probably right half of it again and to have the memories of all
[37:40.600 --> 37:44.840]  their other reports that they've now gotten done and then this means I'll be sitting here if I'm
[37:44.840 --> 37:51.640]  lucky in 10 years reading and the next report and all of this would have been done the UN model
[37:51.640 --> 37:59.720]  occupation of a federal mercenary force the overthrow of due process spy networks and and
[37:59.720 --> 38:08.280]  what's crazy is it is a UN implosion model just like the Soviets would take over a country cut
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.160]  off the resources to bankrupt everybody for a couple years to then break their will and then
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.920]  reorganize things under insiders control it's a criminal instinct and just like Mao did that with
[38:18.920 --> 38:25.240]  a great leap forward cultural revolution and just like the EU's doing with its high taxes that the
[38:25.240 --> 38:29.800]  insiders are exempt from this is a criminal monopoly takeover it is like robbing a bank
[38:31.960 --> 38:39.480]  I mean it is totally 100% from every angle inside and out a criminal takeover and this is nothing
[38:39.480 --> 38:44.440]  the physical occupation is at least something people are going to be able to see and the
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.160]  stage domestic terror attacks they say are going to start which you saw at Boston by the way one
[38:49.160 --> 38:52.680]  of the roommates one of the witnesses said the FBI wants to come talk to me I know they're
[38:52.680 --> 38:58.600]  going to kill me they got him in custody and shot him in the head you know oh FBI wants to talk to
[38:58.600 --> 39:05.560]  Alex Jones and he died during questioning I mean that that's the headline here that could happen to
[39:05.560 --> 39:13.320]  anybody that's how it works in the third world oh he he it said the FBI agent didn't need to go to
[39:13.320 --> 39:20.120]  the hospital they're not going to say what it was but he may have pulled his hand away so we shot
[39:20.120 --> 39:31.080]  him a couple times in the head FBI kills Tamerlin acquaintance told friends he thought the FBI
[39:31.080 --> 39:35.000]  was coming to kill him and they said no this is America the friends are quoted as saying
[39:35.000 --> 39:44.520]  you'll be fine I like the kids at Waco the babies when they the Delta Force put that mine
[39:44.520 --> 39:49.560]  that anti-personnel shape charge on top the church records building the only uh concrete structure
[39:49.560 --> 39:57.640]  inside the compound and then they and then the army posed with the skulls including children's
[39:57.640 --> 40:06.840]  skulls because nothing's more manly than a skull uh really I thought it was manly to raise a family
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.720]  and train people in the ways of being good and strong and building a civilization I didn't know
[40:11.720 --> 40:18.840]  it was only manly to kill children but don't worry you're all going to be killed too so drink your
[40:18.840 --> 40:25.960]  fluoride and take all your vaccines and kiss your life goodbye because I've looked at the actuaries
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.960]  the death rate and the increase in cancer and autism and neurological disorders and it's
[40:31.960 --> 40:38.760]  increasing close to a hundred percent every seven years or so depending that's a guesstimation
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.640]  but you think a couple thousand percentage point diabetes is bad now in the last 20 30 years
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.920]  even higher if you go back to the 1950s cancer rates same thing all these other oh don't worry
[40:52.920 --> 40:59.240]  oh the you wore you're an environmentalist you think humans are the problem you think you
[40:59.240 --> 41:05.560]  think carbon dioxide we excel the problem don't you worry your little your little mind your little
[41:05.560 --> 41:14.760]  heart bless your little heart bless you bless all the fools that serve this and that's the only
[41:14.760 --> 41:22.040]  sick consolation I've got is the new world order goes after its own people because they
[41:22.040 --> 41:30.520]  know it's a spiritual rule they go after their own people about three times more often they
[41:30.520 --> 41:37.800]  go after people that resist them so all I can tell the government is double down take your
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.920]  kids in for the full regimen of over a hundred vaccines now they're trying to make 57 of a
[41:42.920 --> 41:53.320]  mandatory roll up the sleeve have the convulsion and hail Satan kill your child for the government
[41:54.120 --> 41:59.880]  kill it so the Rockefellers can have the whole world do it commit to it but don't be lukewarm
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.960]  you either come in and get recruited to the side of light or you join darkness you understand
[42:07.960 --> 42:11.240]  because those of you that think you're going to stand the middle of the road and be safe
[42:11.240 --> 42:15.000]  I got news for you you're in the worst possible position
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.800]  now we are hitting the event horizon and everything we do on this show as the public
[42:23.800 --> 42:28.840]  realizes that what we're telling them is true and I don't know what they're going to do to me at
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.960]  this event horizon if we go through this event horizon and they don't kill me or set me up
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.040]  all they got to do folks is pull me over beat me up and say I attack them and kill me
[42:38.040 --> 42:43.560]  but if that happens I don't want that to happen but it's a victory against the enemy of it does
[42:44.280 --> 42:49.560]  don't don't let them spin it that it wasn't a victory if they kill me that shows we're really
[42:49.560 --> 42:53.560]  hurting them bad and just remember ladies and gentlemen none of us are going to make it out
[42:53.560 --> 42:59.960]  of this alive unless we resist these people and the only thing I understand is the danger
[42:59.960 --> 43:09.480]  is in not speaking out against these people because their plan is so over the top so manifestly evil
[43:09.560 --> 43:16.120]  that they count on you not being able to deal with the magnitude and I get that that's why when
[43:16.120 --> 43:22.200]  I was reading this ran corporation document going back over fm 3-3940 all 300 pages of it scanning
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.680]  through it uh tournament resettlement operations and it talks about the reeducation of you and
[43:26.680 --> 43:32.520]  your family processing your social security numbers uh you know the the it links to the
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.600]  executive orders where they put you in forced labor camps the civilian inmate labor camp
[43:36.600 --> 43:41.320]  program the emergency centers establishment act the model states health emergency powers act
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.440]  the rural affairs commission under homeland security and department of defense in regard
[43:46.440 --> 43:53.480]  clergy response teams you know if you work for the system boy you better go read all this
[43:53.480 --> 43:56.600]  you'll be like oh that's why they're doing that yeah you need to go look they think
[43:56.600 --> 44:02.200]  they think again it's not that you're so dumb they have to hide this in plain view because
[44:02.200 --> 44:06.520]  then the people implementing it think well it must be okay it's hidden in plain view
[44:06.520 --> 44:11.080]  kind of like crucifying christ was done in plain view kind of like aztecs cutting people's hearts
[44:11.080 --> 44:18.600]  out was done in plain view cops came to jeffrey jammer's house repeatedly there'd be drugged out
[44:18.600 --> 44:23.000]  people you know that acid injection into their brains looking like zombies stumbling around
[44:23.000 --> 44:30.040]  with their heads shaved and incisions and you just say oh uh these are my lovers it was like oh
[44:30.040 --> 44:37.560]  political correctness okay hurry up get them in that plastic drum can i help you i mean if it's a
[44:37.560 --> 44:43.080]  liberal gay thing i mean you know yeah yeah yeah i mean you know maybe jeffrey dommer can run the
[44:43.080 --> 44:47.560]  boy scouts or something i don't know so so so coming you can't discriminate against jeffrey
[44:47.560 --> 44:53.240]  dommer the whole point here ladies and gentlemen is they play all these games with you and i see
[44:53.240 --> 45:00.120]  the average adults when i do see hard serious men they're worried about getting their own money and
[45:00.120 --> 45:05.160]  running their own life and keeping their head down so that the system doesn't come after them oh
[45:05.160 --> 45:12.440]  you're the first they're going to come after this thing doesn't like competition but i look at the
[45:12.440 --> 45:17.240]  general public they are children and they're not even so much stupid even though their IQs have
[45:17.240 --> 45:25.080]  been reduced as they are just totally naive and then and then that's what the propaganda
[45:25.080 --> 45:32.120]  pointed at him is is is designed to do is oh don't don't listen to those people that's crazy
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.520]  the government's putting stuff in the water oh the government's shooting people up with syphilis
[45:36.520 --> 45:44.280]  oh the new york times attacked me yesterday and said you know jones claims they're they're putting
[45:44.280 --> 45:50.840]  stuff in the water there's a couple makeshift articles i think that was the one yeah and sure
[45:50.840 --> 45:56.600]  people tend to listen because of this to ski experiment but you know i mean you can even
[45:56.600 --> 46:02.040]  kind of see the new york times person going huh this guy's a cook but wait there's a whole hundreds
[46:02.040 --> 46:07.320]  and hundreds of actually thousands of big programs with thousands of people in particular programs i
[46:07.320 --> 46:11.560]  mean i just you don't get into the new world order unless you see everybody else's dumb animals
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.120]  you want to kill and then you want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy where you dumb everybody
[46:16.120 --> 46:27.800]  down so you can dance on their grave i mean i wouldn't be happy now and plus they wouldn't let me
[46:28.680 --> 46:33.400]  trying to go and join the system and then hope my family was going to be protected being part of
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.400]  the prison system they're setting up even for the establishment where you basically live in a prison
[46:37.400 --> 46:43.320]  of controlled compartmentalized knowing we just be wiped out later in a higher level exterminism
[46:43.320 --> 46:49.240]  program and then just sitting there and watching them dumb people down and use the psychotronics
[46:49.240 --> 46:54.840]  and everything on them i mean i just don't want to have any part of this i just this is insanity

[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:30.360]  that's a six-year-old program in england uh which which follows and references this
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:37.160]  they've been putting this out since the early 90s but i first read it in 1998 it's been updated again
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:44.600]  adan solazar's doing an article on it right now uh the rand corporation this is who really if you
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:49.480]  want to say one group advises the cfr belterberg group trilateral commission this is the people
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:54.200]  and i've interviewed some of their insiders before i'm going to add that to the article
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:00.040]  a sustainable police force for the united states justification options for creating us capabilities
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:07.240]  again a stability police force for the united states justification and options for creating
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:11.800]  us capabilities that sounds real reasonable and you read it and everything and you get into it
[1:11:11.800 --> 1:11:17.640]  and it's how they're going to federalize all the police and how it's a un model of occupation of the
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:24.120]  country and it describes how they've occupied iraq and kosovo and other areas and how that's the
[1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:29.640]  model for doing this and getting rid of local police and they'll still be local police but
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:34.360]  even how to pick out select ones and make it like really cool to be a federal minion
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:39.400]  and more money and then pretty soon everybody wants to be in it kind of like first it was only
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:44.200]  select swat teams in la that was rand corporation two in the 60s and then now everybody's got to
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:50.680]  be a swat team and so you know you you've got a police force of five people saying some tiny town
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:54.680]  but when they pull your son or daughter are you over you're like bill why are you wearing a helmet

[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:58.200]  way it's not just there cops trained that cell phones could be guns papers please tsa style
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:04.200]  checkpoints at uk bus train stations and it shows them grabbing people searching them searching kids
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:08.600]  i mean this is going on everywhere and they say it's for your safety and to make your traveling
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:13.880]  better what for police fear possible crime and disorder bill deberg so now after they
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:19.240]  pumped all the local activist groups that we're going to have you know peaceful little kind of
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:24.200]  like their own conference now the cops are like oh now it's not allowed oh we're actually not your
[1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:28.600]  friends i told them all that was what was going to happen i'm like you made a play along with us
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:35.640]  they're just pumping you with info to create a relationship and so they can then spin it saying
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:40.360]  we were going to let you have something but you didn't it's all about protecting the criminals
[1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:45.880]  at bill deberg from exposure but by us all going in protesting and then acting like thugs
[1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:51.000]  it will then only put it out in the press that much more so we got to engage him
[1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:57.000]  in media coverage oh how evil can you imagine why maybe we'll have to be arrested for filming
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.920]  in the middle of the of the british countryside why there's nothing more extreme
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:08.840]  people in bagdad can all own ak-47s our government tried to confiscate them and failed
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:11.000]  and everybody has video cameras
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.560]  we're occupied folks by a bunch they've gone and found people and because here's the
[1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:20.920]  old this ran corporation document this is the same worldwide
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:29.880]  this is it when you read this australia has done this germany's done this uh it's the best
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:33.880]  technology of tyranny so russia's copying a lot of us actually borrowed from russia
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:40.280]  so it's kind of back and forth you're both sharing uh all the they hired the pentagon did
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:45.800]  to implement this marcus wolf the former head of the stasi that's why people go this is like
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:52.120]  the stasi oh it's not like the stasi you're going to a major trade show to sell the most expensive
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:57.480]  italian shotguns in the country you're the co-owner son of the grandson of the founder
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:05.960]  you've got seven ornate shotguns and the cops come and arrest you even though it's totally
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:12.520]  legal because they had to worship the mindless tattling and and and it was on the news terrorism
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:18.520]  Denver cops arrest italian shotgun manufacturer as a terrorist that the news says that
[1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:26.920]  it's terrorism to legally go to show seven models you're trying to sell the distributors
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:34.920]  you see they're doing it by force of will force of pimping it's totally illegal when the tsa
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:38.360]  tries to drag your wife off and stick their hands down her pants or even grab them through the
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:43.880]  pants they just do it though and then they organize it it's illegal when tsa because you have six
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:50.840]  silver coins uh you're going to a coin show just confiscate them but the courts don't care because
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:56.360]  mega evil is now upon us with all these weird little totes who never get tired of shoving
[1:18:56.360 --> 1:19:00.840]  you up against a wall and again it's not even so much the old the old fashioned cops are being
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:08.440]  phased out as bad as they've been and it's this new toady wimp model like on the in a rena cop
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:14.760]  type vein but now with the gun and it's just like when erin dykes and rob jakemston were up in

[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:33.400]  start going to some of the testimony of lowest learner the irs director of the nonprofit
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:39.320]  auditing division that's very high level and it's on record i mean everybody we know who's pro
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:45.000]  live for runs a church is harassed they're now telling churches you've got to speak half the
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.800]  time against christianity i'm not joking you've got to speak half the time against abortion
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:55.960]  when you speak for abortion uh it's just total violation of the first amendment and it's all
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:01.800]  just over the top because why not americans put up with it and she got there and she said i declare
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:07.320]  the fifth amendment of course uh you try to declare the fifth amendment when you wave your rights
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:13.720]  under penalty of perjury they say we'll arrest you if you don't fill all this out and again money's
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:20.760]  done it fortunes done it it's a perennial article you've all seen it if you read business publications
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:26.200]  that they'll do 10 different cpa's 30 different 50 different i even saw once where a company got
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:33.000]  like 100 different cpa's uh i think it was bloomberg i can't remember and they all gave
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:39.240]  different answers on on the same set of documents because it's written where it's impossible to follow
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:44.600]  oh you you claim you're working out of your home office some of the time who doesn't
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.000]  we're going to disallow that now and about seven years ago they made it were cpa's
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.280]  an old thing's a fraud to begin with so it's putting perfume on a pig trying to polish a
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:27:00.840]  turd as they say excuse my french is just true um but they sit there and they say well
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:07.640]  uh you know what we're just going to not let you take all these deductions anymore and you say
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:14.120]  why well because we are liable for the irs's interpretation of what we do so basically cpa's
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:18.280]  now do not even they will not even give you any of the deductions they just go you're going to
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:23.640]  pay extra and you're going to pay me to do it and then you don't get audited as much if you've had
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:31.000]  them certify at all that they've raped you double hard for them and so that's how this works and
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:38.760]  again uh roiders reports people making over a million euros a year have a 100 tax rate in france
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:47.480]  tax i'm not joking that's not satire taxes on some wealthy french top 100 percent
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:55.080]  roiders okay uh let let's start getting to this clip uh as she claims the fifth but then puts out
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:28:02.680]  her statement which is also unprecedented uh and uh again she's been told just do this don't let it
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:08.440]  go any higher of course she was ordered to do it and that's now coming out and they all
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:13.160]  need to go to jail this nightmare could end folks if we arrested the globalist but instead
[1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:18.840]  the police in wattford england are like you you're not even allowed to protest uh we're a
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:24.200]  free country but we just think that something bad might happen basically the cps says we're
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.640]  going to take everybody's kids now if we can because something bad might happen yeah but
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:30.840]  you're five to seven times more dangerous than any other group i'm going to come back and play the
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:40.840]  clip they're like that doesn't matter we are the government and it just gets crazier and crazier

[1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:59.240]  minions and i've read university papers a few years ago out of canada where they have this big
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:04.840]  political professors saying it's true there's an authoritarian world government being formed and
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:09.960]  it's true most terror attacks are manufactured or staged and it's true all this is happening like
[1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:14.920]  the conspiracy theorists are saying that means people that are informed and aren't total idiots
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:21.000]  of trance but the government's good and could do good and it'll bring the whole government down
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:27.800]  if we don't you know go ahead and just go along with this and that's what they teach now
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:32.200]  the collectivists who are now going wow this really is authoritarian it's not
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:37.240]  some utopia we're building well we better just go with it and hope we can work on the inside to make
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:43.640]  it better ladies and gentlemen this is a global corporate government that is going to collapse

[1:34:55.080 --> 1:35:00.520]  and the rest of us are in deep trouble and i saw a youtube comment from one of my videos
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:06.920]  that were going he just saw the trailer for the new matt daemon movie no folks the writers and people
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:11.640]  out there for the establishment are throwing it in your face to prepare your subconscious mind to
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:17.240]  accept all of this and a lot of people in hollywood are actually awake and are allowed to put stuff
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:24.360]  out but only if it's done in pure fiction and they don't even know why that is i do because the
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:30.600]  establishment believes that simply prepares the mind we're very inventive and very adaptable
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:37.000]  and if the subconscious has been prepared for a cybernetic genetic engineering nightmare
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:43.800]  and a stratified tyrannical society it will then accept it when it then unfolds it's called a
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:51.640]  self-fulfilling prophecy and club of rome i've found documents where they talk about that in the
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:55.880]  60s it's like anything i've already reverse engineered i can then i've done this many times
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:00.440]  on air find stuff they've written i didn't know about that's word for word what i've said
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:06.120]  because all i was doing was watching their engineering and had enough pieces of it to
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:13.000]  already know the plan and now i mean here's the deal what you're hearing from me is the closest
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:19.320]  to the truth you're ever going to get okay and i'm not bragging i want you to understand folks
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:24.600]  i'm not saying all this to shock people and ooh that shows crazy okay in fact it's a lot
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:30.520]  worse than what i'm saying and i quite frankly hold back from you a lot of stuff i'm just gonna
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:39.880]  be honest and i just don't think people are ready for it told you there didn't it be in a drill told
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:45.720]  you they see cia fbi handled turned out they were cia fbi handled told you they'd kill all their
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:51.240]  roommates that's now happening told you there'd be a drill with guys with backpacks all around
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:57.160]  their work you're like how did you know that because they have an exact handbook it'd be
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:02.920]  like if they put out you know Raiders of the Lost Ark over and over again just with different
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:11.800]  actors i'd say uh next he uses the whip you know to uh you know get the idol or next he just pulls
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:15.480]  out his gun and shoots the guy with the sword i mean i just like and next he's gonna do this and
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:19.240]  next this is gonna happen and next that's gonna happen and you know next this i mean it's just
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:28.840]  like i mean i'm sitting here watching all this unfold and i'll tell you the goodness i believe
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:33.640]  these are real scandals right now the irs the hacking gate all the people are really upset
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:38.360]  and they're ready for that they they talk in ran corporation about people will resist we'll use that
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:46.200]  to change our war games and you know gradually then learn to adapt they use us resisting to get
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:52.920]  stronger the only thing that will defeat them is breaking compartmentalization with the people at
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:57.000]  the ran corporation in fact i have this journalist on it was allowed to be in the ran corporation
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:03.720]  write a book about it um i forget his name we call it on solazar in here he pointed out i had
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:09.160]  the guy on he's putting his article is a alex something abeya yeah alex abeyas you know top
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:13.480]  best-selling author history author they let him in he goes yes it's a world government
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:18.280]  basically nazi takeover plan to end humanity as we know it and merge with machines well of course
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:23.000]  it is i mean i i think i had like a number one new york times this seller on world war two
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:31.240]  they liked him the only guy they ever let in there out in la but i don't need to be let in
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:35.880]  there man i mean their own public stuff is like hit larry into the max
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:46.360]  and i mean they're talking about a un occupation control during the collapse of america and even
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:51.560]  down to what colored the armored vehicles would be and how there'll be ied attacks and black armored
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:57.400]  vehicles are needed and this was in 1998 and now it's all here and let me tell you if they convert
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:03.880]  and get the rest of this done again they're gearing up for a total collapse of society
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:09.400]  bigger than just a money devaluation they're gonna they're gonna release bio weapons the
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:17.000]  more i read this it's bio weapons and and even those of you that survive it will still serve it
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:23.480]  you'll just be glad to be alive i just can't believe it and once it starts it's going to be
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:29.640]  really horrible they're going to kill billions of people i just i just it's so horrible and the
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:33.480]  only way to stop it is for the idiots that are even within the system you're not going to be
[1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:41.320]  protected see that's what world war z is all about the book and they've done some rewrites and
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:46.280]  changes wrote i've been told about some hollywood insiders since our criticism and others criticisms
[1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:51.640]  i don't know what the final product's going to be but in it they say marxism is what saved us
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.200]  and our problem was american libertarians and conservatives and the zombies helped us kill them
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:04.440]  we can handle a robinson caruso but not the patriots and it's the voice of mark hamill also
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:10.680]  listened to the book on tape and uh and it's like yeah you know the un took over the world the
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:17.160]  zombies helped us build this utopia thank god for the zombies wiping out the general public there
[1:40:17.160 --> 1:40:22.760]  were too many of us and but all the elitist all the tacticians they got to stay on the ships
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:27.080]  which they're actually they were going to go with underground bunkers the movies it's always
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:30.920]  space stations that's the allegory they were going to go with underground bunkers and that's part of
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:39.080]  it but the main thing is ships and when you see world war z that's it they fly you know the guy
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:45.160]  that's the insider out you know him and his family he he he works with them and this movie is pointed
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:50.760]  at everybody to get us ready for martial law but it's pointed at doctor scientist special forces
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:57.960]  people like that you know my dad they were recruiting a bunch of top dentists and he'd
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:05.800]  been a teacher you know at baler dental school and a unnamed u.s agency came in and was recruiting
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:11.720]  the professors and he said well they want us to move to maryland and it literally is a black
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:16.280]  site and that's all i'm allowed to say and i'll be paid about double even though he had a dental
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:24.200]  practice and was you know middle class new marish and he said it is cybernetics and of course he
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:28.920]  was you know this around the dinner table telling his wife and you know son i was about 10 years old
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:34.120]  he said they wouldn't give me the details but it's basically cyborgs and it's a giant program
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:38.200]  they're hiring hundreds of top dentists in dallas alone but they did say they're recruiting heavily
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:45.080]  from texas and my dad was like and because we've had family and intelligence you know uh that's
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:49.000]  also why they're trying to recruit me and he and my mom's like no i don't want to live in maryland
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.600]  and i don't want you to work in you know black projects i mean folks they were hiring hundreds
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:42:01.720]  of dentists in the dfw area that had you know four or five million people then in it there's thousands
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:09.880]  of dentists there i mean god knows what they've built my cousin who's been in the army for 24 years
[1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:15.640]  apologized to me six years ago and said they were putting microchips in them now he won't talk to me
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:22.360]  barely i mean he'll drink a margarita with me that's about it he's like oh i just you don't even want
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:26.760]  to know i mean it's just so far gone ladies and gentlemen do you imagine that they must have hired
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:33.240]  thousands of dentists and oral surgeons you ask why do they ignorant people i've seen on youtube
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:37.640]  on how about they go why a dentist why not a surgeon folks dentists are the experts in
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:44.840]  implanting things in jaws and skulls they've done the most procedures and oral surgeons
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:52.040]  not just false teeth and stuff folks there are cyborgs out there already walking around
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:57.400]  they had clones 30 years ago i don't know if they brought them to term but the documents were in the
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:04.360]  bbc 17 years ago that well they're not technically we didn't bring them to terms so it's not and we
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:10.360]  changed some of the dna now there's the new american us military seeking implantable microchips
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:17.560]  and soldiers folks they ain't seeking it they're not seeking it and it's not just tracker chips
[1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:24.360]  that's all i'm going to say and again
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:30.040]  i said i'd go to your calls i said i'd play this it's just i mean what is the point of all of this
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:34.840]  what is the point of getting into the iris of course they're harassing people that's all they do
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:40.600]  is intimidate i call their bluff i mean this is crazy i'm not going to sit here and watch my kids
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:46.920]  go into a future of absolute hell on earth and i want people to know who's going to set the new
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:51.240]  cough to bring in marshal law i want people to know who's going to release the bio weapon
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:55.560]  so when they do it uncompartmentalize people see it and the truth gets out
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:59.480]  but the good news is people are getting upset about this iris thing
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:06.120]  you know i physically get angry at the austin mayor who laughs at scientists and doctors we
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:12.120]  bring in from harvard and cornell and you name it the city council gets up and walks off and laughs
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:21.080]  except for one member in austin where i live they put high levels of hydrofluorosilic acid 1.6 in
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:27.720]  there you're talking 20 point IQ reduction at that level even after the epa was forced two years ago
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:33.480]  to say cut it in half it's it's it is it's making cancer and fluoridation uh all this other stuff
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:41.000]  of the teeth they laugh at us and they get up and go you have your citizens communication i'm going i'm
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:46.680]  going in my chambers and they'll say i don't mean you disrespect by this and they'll laugh you know
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:51.480]  what and then i and then i i know from channels those people only eat organic food they they
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:59.880]  they have their own purified water and they love it it's like a sacrament it's a it's an enjoyment
[1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:05.320]  even them even the city council of austin knows the fluoride's killing everybody and they think
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:10.760]  it's funny and you know what else the fluoride they buy has in it at least five different radio

[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:14.680]  calls and then break down the un occupation plan for the us it's all official these ran
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:20.680]  corporation blueprints that are put out have been fully adopted so far by the occupied federal
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:25.400]  government and i don't just say occupied federal government they call it that i mean this is all
[1:54:25.400 --> 1:54:31.800]  public the pentagon is caught i mean there's professors on record like barnett and others
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:35.000]  that say oh no we work for foreign banks now you know we're part of this global corporate
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  combine this is all official and if we can never get the word out on this it's over for the globalist
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:47.800]  they go on uh questioning her and they say were you the person over the division for tax exemption
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:52.120]  which is publicly that's her title and she says i'm not going to answer that we're going to play
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:59.080]  more of that in the next hour after we take phone calls um as you know the committee and the senate
[1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:03.800]  passed the amnesty bill and the government's already amnesty by fiat they already give the
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:07.400]  illegals all the free stuff it's all part of bankrupt in the country and the illegals then
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:12.360]  have fealty towards the democrats and when the republicans are the authors of this as well
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:17.160]  they all want things you know taking control up at the highest levels and it's all part of
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:22.040]  the breakdown of this society it's an economic warfare to drive down the wages and bankrupt the
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:28.680]  country and again all this is very sad news but it's a big deal that it's on air it's a big deal
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:34.440]  that somebody in some group did the research to tell you what the establishment's doing because
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:38.760]  most people don't think like a think tank most people don't spend their time researching history
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:43.320]  most people uh you know just say i go get my job i try to have a house here i try to have a good
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:48.840]  time well see living isn't just about having a good time i've had periods in my life back in
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:53.000]  high school and summer college where i went out and had a good time you know what it wasn't a good
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:56:00.440]  time anymore wasn't a good time anymore and anybody that's been lived like that you know what i'm
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:08.360]  talking about one night stands aren't a good time getting drunk every night it's not a good time it
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:14.200]  all gets real old real fast and it's the same thing being politically involved you either get
[1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:18.040]  involved and run your life or somebody else is going to run your life for you and they're really
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:22.440]  bad people and i always hear about fist fights over and people killing each other over dogs
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:26.360]  going to the bathroom in somebody's yard i saw that yesterday again why why don't you get upset
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:30.840]  about global tyranny and people putting poison in your water and laughing about it when it's all
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:35.720]  admitted that they're assaulting you with a toxic waste and if we ever turn things around with the
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:40.760]  fluoride in our water they know everything else will turn around so they just got a stone wall
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:48.520]  so hundreds of counties across the country banned fluoride in the water
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:53.400]  so the feds came in and lobbied states like arkansas new jersey and others to make state
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:58.040]  laws you've got to drink it so you sue them over the fact that it's not just calcium fluoride
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:03.880]  it's hydrofluorosalicylic acid that's had the electrons change to be deadly even more deadly
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:09.400]  and psychoactive as an adjuvant an accelerant the other chemicals and that there are hundreds of
[1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:15.000]  other things in there they might that's the stuff they can't use in uranium purification
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:22.760]  and it phosphate mining did you know that it's deadly poison you can't put it legally on
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:28.200]  food crops it's in the fertilizer though that they sell you to put on your yard that if you
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:32.680]  remember one time i had a dog i uh when i was growing up my parents they said fertilize the

[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:07.080]  today i'm proud that i got that done but i got a ton of other economic news and this big breakdown
[2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:13.720]  of the rand corporation and their plan to federalize and globalize the police and actually says
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:20.040]  it is a un stabilization occupation program and how they're going to even get rid of the feds it's
[2:09:20.040 --> 2:09:25.000]  all just going to be run by the pentagon and that's brigade homeland but it's all right here the new
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:28.440]  version they put a new one out every year is here you want to know what else they're planning they've
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:35.640]  gotten most of it done and the u.s military prisoner policies and reeducation for you and your
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:40.280]  family it's uh i don't know mainstream media i don't think you're going to go read this though
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:46.760]  it's too much fun to laugh at us you're not going to look at the uh london guardian reporting on it
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:51.800]  or maybe interment resettlement operations now they're going to process you and your family with
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:57.640]  your social security numbers domestically and suspend the bill of rights and bottom line this
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:02.760]  is it the globalists have taken over the central government they are bankrupting you as a way to
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:08.200]  transfer the wealth but also to make you so poor you're dependent on them we are being conquered
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:14.840]  right now and the united states is under sustained attack while they collapse the country they then
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:21.160]  pose as the stability force and the cops and the bureaucrats and all them actually follow a blueprint
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:26.280]  in their mind of where they're here to stabilize things and they wonder why everything starts falling
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:36.200]  apart three years ago when they quote bailed out gm that was all staged it was in there in the
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:42.120]  agreement to move uh most of the factories that are left out of detroit out of texas out of a
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:50.840]  bunch of other areas ohio to brazil uh eastern europe and china and then it was big news as you
[2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:58.440]  know two weeks ago that uh that's now officially been done catalogue vault uh escalate uh bunch
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:09.320]  other stuff that's just in china and again though it's all actuary where it doesn't help the brazilians
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:14.680]  same thing with the chinese it's suicide nets and stuff you know a lot of the factories
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:21.800]  it's to drive everything down to two they don't want a beautiful rising society they want a
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:28.680]  rotting destructive society because if it's not rotting you might run your own life and they want
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:37.320]  you destitute so again you notice as we embrace globalism all the liberty all the prosperity
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:42.440]  goes out the window like a submarine with screen doors let's go to your phone calls
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:48.760]  shan in canada you're on the air welcome hi how are you doing nice to speak with you i'm doing pretty
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:55.160]  good despite everything everything is just wonderful it's fun to read 230 page plans for
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:59.960]  total u in occupation and if i don't do what i'm told i'll be sent to the reeducation center
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:05.400]  i mean i shouldn't be upset that's a that's a nice government it's just it's just so scary i
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:10.360]  remember pastor lindsay william saying that from his elite friends he thinks it's all
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:14.520]  going to hit the fan pretty much this summer which is really scary and it sounds like everything is
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:19.000]  ramping up for just such a scenario um i think i think what they've done to adam co-cash in
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.600]  washington is clearly a tactic meant to uh scuttle his planned march i was going to
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:29.000]  buzz planning on trying to attend and just at least witness it yeah no no for those that don't
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.800]  know for those that haven't seen off seen all the video now every angle he's giving a speech
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:38.840]  they come up they grab him they throw him on the ground with his hands up and now they're
[2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:45.480]  charging him with resisting arrest and a bunch of other stuff now now again how do they grab you
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:48.920]  and throw you on the ground and then you're arrested for resisting arrest why did they put
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:53.400]  their hands on him to begin with it doesn't matter they have kept juries that would beat
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:12:58.840]  their own children's brains out with a baseball bat sycophantically if the if the federal prosecutor
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:05.320]  told him to i mean this is a sick sick country man and and again i'll be honest about co-cash i
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:10.520]  think he's a smart guy uh he's got a lot of violence in his eyes and and comes off a little
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:16.280]  bit you know scary i met and by scary i mean you know uh i don't think he's a bad guy but i
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:21.720]  think he's he's kind of in a crazed mode so i worry about him being destroyed and i told him
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:27.800]  that i don't think he's a bad guy but now that they've done this to him uh you know you you you
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:33.160]  you've got to support him even more and again as i said i'll either send a reporter or go to the
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:39.160]  march myself to cover it the problem is the media is already saying i'm promoting it i have to
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:43.640]  admire the courage i have to know the supreme court has ruled five years ago that you can have
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:50.040]  loaded uh rifles on the streets of dc but they still illegally block that and so i get the civil
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:55.640]  disobedience you know the the police chief is like i may allow civil disobedience in a protest see
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:14:03.000]  to her protesting is now illegal let me tell you the dc police are the worst in the country
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.800]  after new york and it's a very i mean you see the articles where a family pulls over and goes
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:12.760]  hi officer do you know the direction of the highway and the cop says none of your business
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:17.560]  and they said okay sir this is this is like abc news reported this so they pull them over and
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:23.240]  take them to jail and say you were in a drug neighborhood i don't like how you talk to me
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:27.880]  i'm going to take you to jail and i've got videos here today that i can't even air there's so many
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:35.000]  cuss words in it uh where where the police just for no reason Durham police constable threatens
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:40.120]  to beat up man and plant cocaine on him and the man does nothing and the cop just freaks out for
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:49.400]  like 10 minutes cussing and screaming and trotting like the ns uh the tsa a guy uh who went crazy
[2:14:49.400 --> 2:14:55.400]  well they had two of them do it and stripped down naked and announced i'm god you're like why would
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:15:00.680]  you do that because the type of person that wants to grope your wife's breast all day i mean you know
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:05.640]  people that want to force stuff on people uh who don't get it's all about somebody else you know
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:12.200]  being into it they're they they like to force it on you i mean i had a tsa guy do a pat down
[2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:16.760]  because i was tired when we get out of there uh in um los vegas i'm not going to tell the story
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:21.160]  again but i mean you know it was it was amazing i mean i knew what was going on he was definitely
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:26.440]  i mean this was this was amazing uh and uh main was sir i'm sorry i interrupted you you sent me off
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:31.640]  from jag no problem no problem but i just wanted to say uh last time i spoke with you you told me
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:37.160]  to go and buy uh some stuff from before as i got i got one of those the great second amendment t-shirts
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:42.760]  you know i love it i wear it everywhere i've gotten a few dirty looks and uh less quizzical looks
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:47.560]  around canada wearing that people do not understand the second amendment well yeah people are so stupid
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:52.280]  if you have a shirt with hitler scowling and mal saying mass murderers agree gun control works
[2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:59.320]  they think you like hitler it's like my wife walked in this morning and i was looking at a
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:05.000]  nazi website and she said what are you doing looking at a nazi website and i looked at her and i said
[2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:10.760]  i said you're smart no no no what's wrong with what you just said and she goes well no i was
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:16.600]  just wondering and i went well why do you think i saw a link they're attacking me i'm just looking
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:24.360]  for a second of what they said but but i mean you know if you buy rise and fall the third rike
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:29.320]  in a bookstore they'll look at you weird that's how not even dumb the public is i was at martin
[2:16:29.320 --> 2:16:34.600]  springs this weekend and a guy goes hey i want to go get chinese food after this and it was a
[2:16:34.600 --> 2:16:40.680]  hispanic guy and two white guys it was hispanic guy said that and the two white guys go you're not
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:45.880]  supposed to say chinese and they were serious and i was just like these people are so out of their
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:51.080]  minds like saying every people say don't say we're going to get mexican food it's racist i mean it's
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:56.600]  like meanwhile they're like i'm sorry sir go ahead no i remember one of my favorite authors
[2:16:56.600 --> 2:17:02.360]  science fiction authors liam gibson wrote political correctness is cultural marxism it is and i think
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:08.280]  that's exactly it you know everyone's censoring themselves and and eventually truth goes down
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:14.120]  the sinkhole with your fear of being judged and ostracized by these simple minded people
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:19.000]  i did last thing i want to say was eric holder absolutely hilarious listening to him testify
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:22.920]  saying over and over i don't know i don't know about knowing and i don't know and it reminded
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:27.800]  me of rebuttal gonzalez uh his testimony years ago about the torture scandal when he was saying
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:33.160]  i don't recall i don't recall recalling i don't remember recalling and they sent people to prison
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:38.760]  who followed orders and then they didn't get in trouble and then they wrote books bush and others
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:45.320]  admitting they authorized it again he said yeah right bush said he would do it again i mean incredible
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:50.120]  gall in audacity and i really hope i hope it doesn't all hit the fan this summer as uh
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:54.440]  lindsay williams said he's heard is going to be in and i what do you have any suggestions for people
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:58.680]  up in canada how do you think it's going to percolate up into canada uh if and when well you've
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:02.520]  already been so you've already been so taken over by the globalist you mean you're totally
[2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:07.400]  on by the queen of england on record she owns like half the real estate um of course she has no power
[2:18:07.400 --> 2:18:12.280]  the tv said so that you're just going to be soft killed with fluoride the water vaccines and all
[2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:16.840]  that uh your canada is that's why it's hard to get in it's one of the safer places in the world
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:21.960]  for my research um but when they release the bio weapons it'll be a lot you know that's why
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:25.800]  remember a couple years ago with the winter olympics they had us troops there uh running
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:30.840]  checkpoints on your highways how'd you like that yeah no i mean yeah total police state total
[2:18:30.840 --> 2:18:37.400]  the yeah but yeah but u.s troops were in your country under north com you're already part of
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:42.360]  the u.s see how that works the s s gp na the security prosperity partnership right oh you're
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:49.080]  so evil you're informed i remember i took political science i what's really ridiculous to me about
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:53.480]  the queen is they tell us the queen has no power the queen has no power yet all of our laws receive
[2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:58.360]  royal ascent from our governor general the queen and then they say it's ceremonial but three times
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:03.720]  in the last 20 years the governor general has dismissed parliament and overridden everything
[2:19:04.280 --> 2:19:09.080]  just like they say australia uh is free but they've had the governor general override them
[2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:17.960]  governor generals governor generals i'm sorry go ahead what no they were they're the queens
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:22.680]  representative and they give final assent to our laws our laws do not pass and become law until they
[2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:28.840]  give it to your governor general uh it's what twice the last 10 years they they've they've
[2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:33.480]  they've dismissed parliament and then there's always toronto article toronto star articles
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:40.200]  jones says the queen runs it oh how funny sure the governor general runs things but still alex is wrong
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:49.240]  oh man good to talk to you that's a good caller right there dean and then uh julio and dean and
[2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:59.560]  then we got a couple deans double dean double beam double the scene or the queen it's a dream

[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:29.080]  anything right now until we say no and as we wake up they're freaking out trying to dominate us now
[2:25:29.080 --> 2:25:34.600]  let's go back to your calls i'm gonna give you an update on the latest uh on the hearings in

[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:44.200]  i do not know i do not recall i take the fifth amendment but right now let's go to dean in
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:51.480]  virginia here on the air extremist well this is one of the uh keys of the double d's and it seems
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.360]  like congress this is one point i'll make my main point but that they're using the constitution now
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:02.920]  when it's convenient for them other than that they will shred it but i want to talk to all the
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:08.360]  listeners out there as far as you're always asking what can i do what can i do well what i have done
[2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:14.040]  i'm on disability income but i've gone out and bought a couple memberships i got out and bought
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:20.920]  t-shirts the one with obama as a tyrant i go out there with the purpose of soliciting comments
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:27.320]  soliciting looks like i go to a grocery store and a black guy would come up for me and say why you
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:33.160]  want that shirt and i will explain it to him i said do you believe what martin loser king said
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:39.720]  so it gets you into conversation with somebody to eventually tell them about info wars use the
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:44.200]  bumper stickers every bumper sticker i have as far as thank you for putting them in the um
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:50.600]  newsletter because i take them off put them on my car and rotate them around when i see an obama
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:56.760]  sticker i will pull in front of them i will slow down wow watch them watch them slow down
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:27:03.240]  to about a hundred yards away they don't want to read facts i will take the magazine leave them in
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:08.440]  doctor's offices i will take them and leave them in gyms i will leave them in lobbies so everybody
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:14.520]  listen to my voice that says what can i do what can i do you must be proactive because liberty
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:19.400]  is not free absolutely you're like the johnny apple see we need to recruit for liberty they recruit
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:23.800]  for tyranny and i'm telling you we are really starting to wake people up but getting back to if
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:28.520]  people don't want to wear a really provocative shirt like obama as a demon uh or as the joker
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:33.080]  it's really a demon uh or you know hitlers for gun control people are so stupid they go why is
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:41.960]  hitler on your shirt it's like no come on uh but but the whole issue is is that the whole issue is
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:47.720]  is that you know people take it personal because of msnbc you don't like obama you must be a racist
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:52.280]  uh i mean i tell you somebody that to me i get pretty angry i'd be like you know you know what
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:56.840]  you know obama's slaughtered everybody in africa blah blah blah i mean how many times does that
[2:27:56.840 --> 2:27:59.880]  happen where black guys come over to you like i guess like they're mad you're wearing an obama
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:06.440]  shirt with him as a joker i had somebody pull up to me in the car with my family in it and i had a
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:11.960]  picture of obama on a bumper sticker and it says does this ass make my car look too big i love that
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:17.640]  i'm sorry he pulls up beside me and starts screaming at me screaming at me and when he
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:23.720]  stops screaming i go mine's harley so he expected an interaction with me because you know when
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:30.440]  somebody is locked into their own sick reality they will not hear any truth it's just like the
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:35.800]  zombies out there the kool-aid drinking zombies will not listen to the fact sure what is going on
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:40.440]  to her but what's going on in virginia that wouldn't go too well in places like texas period
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:47.160]  driving up and yelling at somebody um i mean but but that's what they've done on msnbc it is like
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:54.120]  they're telling them the tea party deserves to be their all racist total lies i mean they really
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:29:00.200]  are trying to balkanize this country i will let them talk like that then i'll ask them
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:04.440]  simply quick do you believe in what martin luther king said the content of character not the color
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:09.800]  of skin i go you have to understand that we look basically in a two-party dictatorship
[2:29:10.440 --> 2:29:15.400]  look at that look at hillary hillary is on a lawyer board for 24 seven trying to get nixon
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:19.960]  impeached and her biggest statement was what what did he know and when did he know it who was

[2:40:26.040 --> 2:40:34.360]  been in protest me magna card is dead federalized police helped arrest adam co-cage we've been working
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:38.600]  on this story for about two days and and people wonder why were there local
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:46.200]  philadelphia police on the federal park with the feds helping arrest co-cash for resisting
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:49.240]  they come and grab you throw you on the ground and that's then you're arrested for resisting you're
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:56.200]  like well why were you arrested you were resistive you why were why was he shot in the head well he
[2:40:56.200 --> 2:40:59.640]  we're not going to say he may have pulled his hand back so he killed him oh of course by all
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:03.560]  means i mean he had a crooked toenail i mean why'd you why'd you take all the people's bank
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:12.120]  accounts in uh you know these countries well it's just yeah well yeah and let's scroll down a federal
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:17.960]  local police a federalized local police helped arrest adam co-cash police list demonstrators
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:23.880]  alongside terrorist and yeah they officially uh in this unit uh it says protesting and civil
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:30.760]  disobedience is terrorism and uh show of course he was taken in charge because well he didn't
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:36.600]  resist us and we grabbed him first and juris prudence and common law and the president says
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:42.040]  he'll get off but he won't because we got a kept federal jury that would indict a ham sandwich
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:51.960]  and convict it it's like msnbc says the tea party deserves to be audited and shut down they're racist
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:42:00.360]  and again a lot of people say hey they leave you on the air alex because you're scaring everybody
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:04.600]  well if that's what it is then we're already done i don't think like that i don't think you
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:10.200]  think like that you got a bunch of out of control crooks at every level acting like we're total
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:18.920]  slaves the only answer is to resist every means necessary peaceably and and and those you that
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:23.320]  want violence you're the people that actually won't get violent if you have to defend yourself
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:28.840]  i've seen it over and over again the people that talk the tall talk that's why as much as i don't
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:33.000]  particularly like what co-cash is doing at this time i think you know people didn't like me yelling
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:38.120]  at pierce morgan we've gotten too timid and he has every right to be armed and march into dc
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:43.560]  as civil disobedience because it's the constitution bell of rights now the law said blacks couldn't
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:48.760]  you know be free but common law said they were and people are like how dare these blacks say
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:55.320]  they're humans and walk off the plantations and so i can only admire the courage and he's finding
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:43:00.280]  out now why i admire the courage because let me tell you he's lucky they don't kill him in federal
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:12.440]  custody they've still got him aren't saying when they're releasing him okay freedom of assembly
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:19.720]  is in the magna card in 1215 hundreds of thousands died over a thousand year war thousands over a
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:23.640]  thousand year of conflict as lord bonkton said a few weeks ago and he was on is about a thousand
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:28.760]  year conflict for magna carder that became the bell of rights constitution and now the police
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:33.480]  if they can intimidate everybody and convince them they don't have rights or like oh we we
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:38.520]  recommended you be in this field and and and rent it from somebody but now now the mayor and others
[2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:43.880]  feel like you know they're you might be violent so all of you are suspects because you don't like
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:49.400]  a criminal group of world rulers who took over by fraud meeting here in secret you want to come
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:55.160]  embarrass the mainstream media into covering it so you're not allowed to to protest but notice
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:44:00.280]  they're doing a trick they're saying you can't protest now and rent a field for an official event
[2:44:00.280 --> 2:44:04.920]  imagine you can't go and by the way it was the classic liberal thing in fact i thought that could
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:10.200]  have even been staged oh we're going to have live music and uh you know speeches and oh come speak
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:14.440]  at it and i said look they're like lawson's like they want you to confirm you're coming to it and
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:18.760]  the police you know the head of the police actually one of them is the police chief wants to talk to
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:23.880]  you and another captain wants to talk to you i said just wait they're going to now announce that
[2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:29.720]  that is banned to create the illusion i told watch in two weeks ago i said you're going to get a call
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:33.640]  by this person and they're going to want you to meet with the police and watches like
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:40.120]  calls them he goes how did you know that i go man come on come on come on i was born in the dark
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:45.320]  it wasn't last night they just follow exact scripts because their people are all robots folks
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:51.560]  their people are robots man i know the play i supposed so frustrating about it i read the
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:56.200]  ran corporation documents i know everything they're going to do you could know everything they're
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:45:00.760]  going to do you've got to know the us code you've got a red you know 50 of their pass reports you've
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:06.680]  got to know about other military i mean the problem is not a lot of people have done this research
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:11.720]  i've made four films on a police state i've been at the urban drills i know how they couch all this
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:18.040]  stuff i know their program and it is a paramilitary takeover in slow motion red dawn in slow motion
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:24.440]  but it's not north koreans doing it it's foreign banks oh and by the way they're just using economics
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:30.440]  to get control of the resources so they can turn the food off under PDD presidential directives and
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:32.120]  state department of random
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:37.080]  i'm one of those moments state department of random
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:40.920]  200
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:47.560]  guys look up henry kissinger state department of random on population reduction
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:52.920]  i think it's been random 200 but i'm not sure this is one of my memory fails was being mentally
[2:45:52.920 --> 2:46:02.360]  tired i'll uh irs internal investigation ended six months before the 2012 election dim warns of
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:08.120]  special prosecutor administration clams up top official takes the fifth i will not answer any
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:13.320]  questions are testified today i have not done anything wrong i'm not a crook as richard nixon
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:22.680]  said takes the fifth after trampling the first absolutely yeah it's memorandum 200 i was correct
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:38.920]  okay memorandum 200 is from 74 but the cia document was actually uh 73 absolutely she
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:43.400]  tramples everybody's first amendment and then she takes the fifth because it's only for them it's
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:52.360]  only escape hatches for them it's now confirmed scandals not only low-level employees of course
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:58.440]  claims are falling apart and their whole program is falling apart right now that's some of the news
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:04.040]  of a drudge report dot com it's also up at info wars dot com armed homeland security guards protect
[2:47:04.040 --> 2:47:08.920]  irs from tea party protesters that's an info wars dot com story linked on the left hand side of the
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:17.000]  mighty drudge report dot com and again if we can wake america up to the secret army now going
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:22.200]  public against us the military itself will stand down that's why rand corporation says you've got
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:27.720]  to get select people out of the military psychologically test them and have a mercenary force
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:33.800]  that has corporate and government power and it talks about local police not going along with it
[2:47:33.800 --> 2:47:41.560]  and so how do you you get a federalized cadre in the local police and then you make it real sexy
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:45.880]  to be part of it and everybody else will clamor to be in it i mean this is all just treason
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:49.320]  beyond treason and they've got most of police chiefs now it's federal totes
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:54.600]  and i hope it's worth it to all those police chiefs you know because
[2:47:58.200 --> 2:48:02.920]  you didn't get a memo not to drink fluoride did you ardee saveta in austin you didn't get a memo
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:09.240]  not to eat gmo no you didn't buddy they hate your guts they hate and fear anybody who's armed
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:16.360]  but you're not going to listen to me i know so uh let's go ahead and talk to blake in virginia
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:26.440]  blake you're on the air alex the smell of fear is heavy in virginia today i think the establishment
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:34.360]  is working as hard as they can to get this uh irs deal out in the open so they can hide the uh
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:41.960]  big ozzie deal well i think that that that that was the media's hope but the tornado the you know
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:45.800]  the irs stuff it's not distracting them the the reason the irs is getting people so mad
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:52.600]  is because everybody's been persecuted by these people i mean there are people that have their
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:58.360]  withholding taken out that get audited and the irs takes more money out i mean i mean more suicides
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:02.760]  more divorce they've done national studies the irs is one of the number one causes of suicide
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:09.880]  and it's not due process it's a criminal group but i hear you i hear you yeah and i've been noticing
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:15.080]  something here lately you're talking about food shortages lots of empty spots in the shelves in
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:20.520]  the grocery stores you know i travel around the country and i make a point to hit grocery stores
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:29.480]  when i can and i'm seeing lots of empty spots in the shelves not you know being 75 south of dc
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:34.200]  i'm kind of wondering what's going to happen when you turn off the uh food stamp cards
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:41.000]  that's all part of the plan and again when it all collapses you'll beg for military marshal law
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.640]  just remember it was all set up just like when al-qaeda attacks you'll beg to have your liberties
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:50.360]  taken but the globalists run al-qaeda it's all hiding in plain view by the way abc news
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:56.680]  is now reporting that that the fb agent felt threatened first it was he was hurt but not

[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:32.040]  and uh yeah i don't know if they're going to get away with all this but you know it's just like
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:36.520]  the only way to to defeat this is to wake up is just how bad it is dean in california thanks
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:43.080]  for holding her on the air and uh thank you for the work you're doing i had a couple of
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:49.320]  hopefully very quick points i wanted to uh make you talk about how difficult it is to wake people up
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:55.880]  and what i found in my own journey into becoming awake is it's a pretty unpleasant experience a
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:02.120]  lot of the time it's very difficult you first have to realize that things are not as rosy as
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:08.280]  you thought they were and then you have to go through you know a period of you know arguing
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:12.200]  with your friends who don't want to believe it then there's a period depending on how far you
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:17.000]  want to go if it were in our case my wife and i have gotten completely out the gmo foods and
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:23.320]  for me that was just really difficult because you know i'm the first to admit i love a good
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:29.320]  cheeseburger and you know unfortunately all the fast food outlets you're barely even getting real
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:37.960]  food anymore but um over the last couple of months i dropped 30 pounds i had some long-term
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:47.000]  weird minor skin rash irritations those went away but the biggest thing is my mental state has
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:52.200]  it's i don't even know how to describe it it's like somebody turned off a noise switch in my head
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:59.080]  it's like yeah oh yeah did you see mit uh saying you know we're trying to block your brain and
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:04.360]  make you stupid well that's what it felt like it felt like almost as if it's somewhere between a
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:09.160]  buzzsaw and you know the stadium crowd noise constantly in the back of your head really
[3:04:09.160 --> 3:04:14.600]  just interrupting your ability to you know focus on well sir mainline fast food doesn't just have
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:22.200]  gmo most of it has silicone in it they're killing you uh i mean you know bill gates is on the board
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:30.040]  of mcdonald's well it wasn't surprised and monsanto walk i walk around and i almost feel like in
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:34.520]  those movies where the scene where everything freezes and the character's in motion but everything
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:38.920]  else is frozen in 3d space no no it's what was that movie where the guy takes the drug that makes
[3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:42.760]  him a lot smarter that's what it's like now that'll burn you out too but no no no that's what i'm
[3:04:42.760 --> 3:04:46.920]  saying read look if you get off everything which i've not even been able to do i still run the gmo
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:52.360]  i still you know drink too much coffee and yeah limitless i mean it's like limitless that that's
[3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:57.720]  what being human is that's why they're scared of you being smart sir real humans are beautiful
[3:04:57.720 --> 3:05:03.640]  powerful and magical
