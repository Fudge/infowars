[00:00.000 --> 00:09.120]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:09.120 --> 00:18.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18.960 --> 00:24.240]  I'm not saying this because I support Donald Trump.
[00:24.240 --> 00:32.240]  I support Donald Trump, quite frankly, at certain levels, holding my nose.
[00:32.240 --> 00:34.520]  I say this because it's the truth.
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.080]  Ted Cruz and the people running him are awful, horrible people.
[00:39.080 --> 00:48.000]  I think Ted Cruz is very smart, very eloquent, but don't they say the last psychopaths are?
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.120]  The things he's doing, the things he's saying are so deceptive.
[00:52.120 --> 00:59.160]  If you go to my Twitter, from two days ago, I have a screenshot of the Drudge Report
[00:59.160 --> 01:07.160]  where it says election canceled, no primary, no voters needed.
[01:07.160 --> 01:14.680]  That is such an over-the-top bombshell event in Colorado and now other states that the Republicans are announcing
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.720]  aren't going to have elections in the primary.
[01:19.720 --> 01:21.880]  I mean, that's what happened.
[01:21.880 --> 01:25.000]  Fury is Colorado has no primary or caucuses.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.200]  Cruz celebrates voterless victory.
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.920]  Cruz came out, there's two different clips, and made fun of everybody and said,
[01:32.920 --> 01:36.760]  silly people, this is democracy.
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.560]  I'm going to play the clip.
[01:41.560 --> 01:48.440]  And he then came out and said that Matt Drudge is an attack site for Donald Trump
[01:48.440 --> 01:54.280]  and that basically is commanded around by Roger Stone.
[01:54.280 --> 01:59.800]  Those two don't even talk to each other.
[01:59.800 --> 02:05.800]  No, when Matt Drudge sees the Republicans say they're going to take delegates away from the winner
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.200]  and then just cancel elections, it's a big deal.
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.400]  And they can sit up there with their arrogance like they're a corrupt homeowners association or something
[02:15.400 --> 02:21.560]  announcing that they own your house because you had a bottle cap in your yard or something.
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.600]  These are people who are delusional and think because they quote make the rules
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.440]  that they can make the rules that they're permanent rulers of the country
[02:32.440 --> 02:35.560]  who appoint who can run for president.
[02:35.560 --> 02:41.560]  If the two parties appoint who can run for president, then you have a two-party dictatorship.
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.240]  That's why you suddenly see Obama on Fox News for the first time in eight years.
[02:45.240 --> 02:48.840]  That's why you see the merger Fox News announcing a few months ago.
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.920]  They're going to be nice to Hillary now.
[02:50.920 --> 03:00.680]  This is the two parties merging to take down populist movements in America and complete their takeover.
[03:00.680 --> 03:09.160]  Now, a few months ago, back when Drudge was saying nice things and linking nice things
[03:09.160 --> 03:15.080]  that Ted Cruz was doing, Cruz came out and said that Drudge had killed the mainstream media
[03:15.080 --> 03:17.880]  and that he was the future and that he was so wonderful.
[03:17.880 --> 03:23.320]  I've got the clip, we're going to play it, but that's because Cruz wasn't doing bad things then
[03:24.280 --> 03:31.320]  and hadn't revealed himself. That was right before he robbed Carson in Iowa.
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.960]  That was right before all the other dirty tricks.
[03:33.960 --> 03:43.160]  That was before Jeb Bush endorsed him. That was before in Louisiana and Tennessee and all these other
[03:43.160 --> 03:49.960]  states, Trump wins and they take the delegates and say, well, we're allowed to because we made
[03:49.960 --> 03:54.680]  superdelegates. We voted for this 40 years ago, but we didn't implement it till now.
[03:57.880 --> 04:03.000]  Well, maybe they'll just vote at the RNC to merge with the Democrats and then they'll just vote on
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.240]  who the president is because that's what this is one step away from, is a pure central committee
[04:09.240 --> 04:16.680]  slash Politburo. He praised the Drudge report for, quote, taking the GOP message directly to the
[04:16.680 --> 04:22.440]  people, almost without exception, professionalism, journalists are partisan liberal Democrats.
[04:23.800 --> 04:28.280]  And he said more. We've got more clips. He says, they've got the mainstream media, we've got Drudge.
[04:28.280 --> 04:33.880]  Now, here's what's going on. They're bullying everybody in talk radio. They've been taking
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.240]  me off stations all over the place for this. They tried to hijack and take over Eagle Forum
[04:39.240 --> 04:46.600]  and take over the bank account of the organization Phyllis Schlafly runs. So the Cruz worshipers are
[04:46.600 --> 04:55.400]  now mugging old ladies and the oldest living Patriot conservative in America. I mean, are we
[04:55.400 --> 05:01.080]  going to like drain her blood and give it to Cruz the vampire? Lawmakers are calling on the White
[05:01.080 --> 05:07.160]  House to declassify more than two dozen pages in the 9 11 commission report that they say outlines
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.440]  evidence for possible support from the Saudi government for two hijackers who settled in Southern
[05:12.440 --> 05:19.480]  California. A CBS News 60 minutes report quoted officials familiar with the 2003 report as saying
[05:19.480 --> 05:25.000]  that 28 pages of redacted information raises questions over whether Saudi officials were
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.240]  involved in assisting two hijackers upon their arrival in Los Angeles in January 2000. Former
[05:31.240 --> 05:37.160]  Democratic Congressman and U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Romer told 60 minutes, the two Saudi
[05:37.160 --> 05:42.680]  nationals found a way to gain access to housing and flight lessons upon their arrival despite
[05:42.680 --> 05:48.920]  extremely limited language skills and no experience with Western culture. Also, former U.S. Senator
[05:48.920 --> 05:53.480]  Bob Kerry, who has read the redacted pages, believes that they should be declassified.
[05:53.480 --> 06:02.040]  You can find more reports on infowars.com. Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out

[07:01.880 --> 07:08.040]  of it. Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did.
[07:08.040 --> 07:13.400]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 830.
[07:13.400 --> 07:17.160]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really
[07:17.160 --> 07:21.000]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brainforce right there. I popped two
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.280]  of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up. Got four
[07:26.280 --> 07:30.840]  and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.640]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[07:35.640 --> 07:39.800]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a
[07:39.800 --> 07:44.120]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce. I went home about 645 this
[07:44.120 --> 07:49.400]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in. You will find
[07:49.400 --> 08:16.600]  brainforce and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[08:16.600 --> 08:23.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:23.080 --> 08:32.440]  It's Alex Jones. Needless to say, my friends, I was chomping at the bit last night. And this
[08:32.440 --> 08:42.680]  morning I voted out of bed at seven o'clock this morning to get prepared and get down here to the
[08:42.680 --> 08:49.320]  studio. A lot of folks noticed that I was more focused and pretty calm yesterday for most of the
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.920]  three plus hours than I broadcast. The more hardcore things get, the more focused I get.
[08:57.240 --> 09:03.320]  Our analysis of the globalist takeover was very accurate. We're now inside the takeover.
[09:03.320 --> 09:11.880]  It's only going to get more intense. They are mortal enemies of Christians, veterans, patriots,
[09:11.880 --> 09:18.840]  gun owners, capitalists, libertarians, free marketers, free souls, free minds, people of
[09:18.840 --> 09:26.280]  justice. They are coming for us. We are being conquered. And I'm here as a modern Paul Revere
[09:26.280 --> 09:37.080]  raising the alarm bell. Every day now, crazier over the top forms of corruption and open naked
[09:37.080 --> 09:47.240]  brazen bravada filled hubris is just spraying out. Every day now more happens in the previous week.
[09:47.240 --> 09:56.200]  It's like a corruption singularity is taking place. And while we're busy and while I'm busy,
[09:56.200 --> 10:07.160]  covering the theft of the election, the cancellation of the 2016 election by both parties and the
[10:07.160 --> 10:16.360]  installation of the new president, the federal government came out two days ago and openly
[10:16.360 --> 10:25.880]  announced it was in major tech publications. I mentioned it that, yes, the goal is to get humans
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.280]  completely out of cars within 10 years and to retrofit everything because, quote, it's going
[10:30.280 --> 10:37.400]  to be safer. And there are open announcements of global carbon taxes and world government and
[10:37.400 --> 10:50.680]  unelected bodies and 50, 60 hour work weeks and all these new compulsory taxes. This way comes
[10:50.680 --> 11:03.320]  something wicked. And the New York Times, the Providence Journal, every day they have articles
[11:03.320 --> 11:10.280]  saying arrest people that say manmade global warming or climate change isn't real and arrest
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.960]  people who aren't politically correct. That's in the news today. Climate change deniers us
[11:15.960 --> 11:26.600]  our punishment and rampant accelerated censorship and just open borders and 5 million jihadis pouring
[11:26.600 --> 11:34.760]  in as part of a military invasion out of Syria into Turkey into Europe and the United States.
[11:35.320 --> 11:44.200]  A planned invasion. NATO didn't just invade Syria with millions of jihadis and their families,
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.080]  their camp followers. This is ancient war like the Visigoths or the Vandals or the Huns or the
[11:53.080 --> 11:59.800]  Mongols would come in and conquer you and then bring in their families behind them,
[11:59.800 --> 12:07.320]  shut up an outpost, have kids and 20 years later roll out with the next invasion force.
[12:09.160 --> 12:13.080]  That's how the Vikings took over what is Russia today more than a thousand years ago.
[12:13.080 --> 12:23.640]  They kicked the Mongols and the Huns out, killed them, killed them all.
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.640]  I sit here and I just look at all of this and it is mind blowing.
[12:35.800 --> 12:41.800]  The economic issues in the backdrop as the elites the last five years, we told you about it before
[12:41.800 --> 12:46.200]  it was in the news but the last five years it's in the New York Times, London Guardian, armored
[12:46.200 --> 12:56.280]  redoubts, huge fortresses all over the mountains of Colorado and Idaho and Utah and Arkansas and
[12:56.280 --> 13:04.200]  Missouri in the Ozarks. I mean some of them 30, 40,000 square feet with five foot thick
[13:04.200 --> 13:12.200]  concrete walls, machine gun nests, helicopter pads and underground bases. That's in the news and
[13:12.200 --> 13:17.000]  armored fortresses all over the Caribbean and all over the Pacific and all over the Cook Islands
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.520]  and all over Australia and New Zealand. I was told by Hollywood folks seven years ago there was an
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.400]  exodus to New Zealand and then you started seeing it in the news and now they admit they didn't go
[13:27.400 --> 13:37.400]  there to set up production companies they went there to escape. Economic collapse, World War III,
[13:38.840 --> 13:47.560]  it's all in the cards. Race war, it's all in the cards. It's a death defiant stunt for me to stay in
[13:47.560 --> 13:57.880]  this country but it's worth it for humanity and I'm not backing down. Fortune favors the bold,
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.280]  the fortune I'm looking for is liberty in our time but let me tell you, these are the times that
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.720]  try men's souls and to sit here and to watch the general public still in a trance having no idea
[14:07.720 --> 14:16.280]  what's about to hit them is like watching a two-year-old toddler run out into a major highway
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.800]  and there's cars coming going 80 miles an hour and that toddler ain't gonna know what hit him.
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.520]  I've seen like a five-year-old run over dead in the road something you never forget.
[14:31.640 --> 14:36.440]  Saw Corvette flip and flop the highway one time on about 150 and saw the people in the air as I
[14:36.440 --> 14:41.720]  was driving about 75 up as they were flipping to the air and arms and legs and body parts being
[14:41.720 --> 14:49.000]  chopped off a pulled over blood spring everywhere kind of stuff you don't forget. It was like in
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.280]  slow motion watching that Corvette fly through the guardrail and spin on its nose and spin into
[14:54.280 --> 15:00.200]  pieces with people flying out like a like a tornado. Shoots past me, goes in front of a bunch of cars,
[15:00.200 --> 15:06.840]  has a blow out it looks like, flips and then just explodes and that's what it's like right now.
[15:06.840 --> 15:14.040]  The Corvette is starting to flip it's starting to go nose up and I'm just going oh man oh we were
[15:14.040 --> 15:23.240]  right about everything oh no oh they built reeducation camps it's in the news oh no oh I talked
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.520]  to a bunch of special forces they're training to cordon cities and run security when they round
[15:28.520 --> 15:36.440]  up all the patriots oh man oh man oh they tried to do a coup on Phyllis Schlafly and take over her
[15:36.440 --> 15:42.440]  whole operation and seize her bank account oh they're talking about shutting drudge down and they're
[15:43.240 --> 15:50.520]  starting to arrest filmmakers oh no oh they're in the news calling for Roger Stone's arrest and
[15:50.520 --> 15:55.400]  they're now discussing my arrest for saying we dare protest peacefully the stealing of the delegates.
[15:58.360 --> 16:01.960]  But if you look at history this is just the way it works this is the way it goes down this is the
[16:01.960 --> 16:10.760]  way it happens look at these headlines worried IMF cuts world growth forecast warns of Brexit
[16:10.760 --> 16:19.160]  Britain leaving the euro. Here's another one this is MSNBC and CNBC Soros European Union
[16:19.160 --> 16:25.640]  in mortal danger don't worry a huge multi-trillion dollar bailout to him and others will fix it
[16:25.640 --> 16:36.600]  for a few years. Oliver Blanchard eyes ugly in game for Japan on debt spiral it's all coming
[16:36.600 --> 16:43.400]  down the bubble they created. In Wyoming hard times return as energy prices slump.
[16:43.400 --> 16:49.000]  Elephacacic always claims he made Ohio so successful it was the fracking industry
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.200]  and it was oil boom that did that for so many states and now that's about to hit
[16:54.200 --> 16:58.440]  it and it's going to make the subprime mortgage look like a walk in the park
[16:58.440 --> 17:03.400]  many analysts agree and Obama's been setting it up where people with no money or credit can get
[17:03.400 --> 17:09.160]  houses again so get ready for that and it's that's not really what's the problem is giving people
[17:09.160 --> 17:12.760]  that don't have a lot of money a house because generally they end up paying the bill they kind
[17:12.760 --> 17:18.680]  of blame it on that it's that they're selling those mortgages up to a hundred times a piece
[17:18.680 --> 17:25.800]  they always admit you that the issue isn't that going belly up that just causes the chain reaction
[17:25.800 --> 17:31.880]  that's 10 20 30 40 50 a hundred times bigger and then there's little juicies like this
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.000]  gun owners are terrorist Hillary nods in agreement
[17:40.440 --> 17:44.200]  yeah we've got that video gun owners are terrorists that's a quote
[17:44.200 --> 17:53.000]  video black lives matter spits in trump pro supporters face i mean this is all on info
[17:53.000 --> 18:00.280]  wars dot com but but i want to stop here for just a minute it was uh george arwell that said in a
[18:00.280 --> 18:05.160]  time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.160]  he also wrote that the ability to say two plus two equals four
[18:11.160 --> 18:16.920]  four is all that you need for freedom to operate which is true common sense and natural law
[18:19.080 --> 18:24.200]  and i've always said i'm no hero doing my job and telling the truth because i understand history
[18:24.200 --> 18:30.840]  and how the world works and read the globalist on white papers but in a world of cowards i guess
[18:30.840 --> 18:35.640]  doing your duty does make you a hero but let me tell you who a real hero is and it's not because
[18:35.640 --> 18:41.720]  he links to our stories uh drudge is about this is a second largest referred our site number one's
[18:41.720 --> 18:49.160]  facebook but in the aggregate it's just the listeners and our radio stations and and our
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.800]  supporters but i do relish you know putting stories out and then drudge links to them and they go
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.680]  super viral and become major talking points in congress and laws get passed based on our research
[18:59.960 --> 19:03.480]  it's fulfilling it's not about being in competition with other media but i want to say
[19:03.480 --> 19:10.280]  something about matt drudge matt drudge is a hero matt drudge is a true trailblazer
[19:10.280 --> 19:15.560]  and matt drudge is not a coward and matt drudge early on was pretty much a ted cruz supporter
[19:17.240 --> 19:22.760]  but when he saw ted cruz do horrible things the last six months he simply linked to it
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.440]  hey look they just canceled voting in four states and are giving ted cruz all the delegates
[19:28.440 --> 19:34.760]  hey look in louisiana and tennessee and all these other states they're just giving and now arkansas
[19:34.760 --> 19:43.800]  the votes to ted cruz of trump voters all he does is link to it and now he's got glenbeck bullying
[19:43.800 --> 19:50.280]  him saying he's bad he's got crews coming out doing it and believe me folks the power structure is

[24:49.320 --> 24:56.840]  and ted cruise is officially a rockefeller republican globalist sleeper cell operative
[24:59.240 --> 25:00.120]  there's no doubt
[25:00.120 --> 25:14.040]  he is now run by marvin and neil bush the snl kingpence the snl scam i mean these people are
[25:14.040 --> 25:21.480]  hard core criminals and the bushes were rejected and clinton was rejected so they're force feeding
[25:21.480 --> 25:30.200]  clinton over sanders and they're force-feeding crews and they even say they're going to dump him
[25:31.240 --> 25:37.720]  and go with a paul ryan who is meeting with donors as we speak that's in the news they're
[25:37.720 --> 25:43.320]  going to vote and install paul ryan that's what they're looking at right now he's the top choice

[26:01.240 --> 26:06.680]  this is going to be the biggest news ever and you notice his chief of staff
[26:11.800 --> 26:17.640]  his business partner is the guy running the trump campaign there's my tweet roger stone the man the

[26:42.600 --> 26:47.640]  for real and is a patriot sleeper cell cruises a globalist sleeper cell
[26:49.400 --> 26:53.800]  trump is a patriot sleeper cell and reportedly knows more than i do about the new world order
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.200]  and has been playing dumb the entire time that's why they've got surveillance on trump they know who
[26:58.200 --> 27:02.920]  he is they've got files on him and they are sometimes even though it's a family show i have
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.040]  to use the word they are crap in their pants ladies and gentlemen they believe he's a patriot
[27:08.040 --> 27:15.160]  sleeper cell and they are absolutely having heart attacks over it and you're seeing the evidence of
[27:15.160 --> 27:20.200]  that right now i want to start going to some of these clips after the break but i want to have
[27:20.200 --> 27:27.640]  plenty of time to go over them here are some of the news pieces cruises drudge is an attack site
[27:27.640 --> 27:38.520]  for trump's campaign no drudge cannot support you cruise and i can't either and i supported you over
[27:38.520 --> 27:45.960]  trump just six seven months ago because you're working with the party insiders to cancel elections
[27:45.960 --> 27:57.000]  okay we can't be part of that ted cruise quite frankly there's some of the ads on the network
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.040]  i'm such a purist that i'm not endorsing and i'm hard of that i'm looking at radical changes i'll
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.560]  just be honest with this radio show so i don't have to have ads on my show i don't agree with
[28:06.200 --> 28:13.000]  so just messages to some of the people out there i can't be part of ballooning i can't be associated
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.240]  with it and it's not because people even notice it's because i won't be involved i'm superstitious
[28:19.240 --> 28:26.440]  i'm god fearing i don't screw people over i don't come after people that didn't have a comment to
[28:26.440 --> 28:37.160]  them to quote tonia montana even though my enemies are attacking me if i'm not cornered i don't even
[28:37.160 --> 28:46.680]  respond you go after my kids obviously i'm coming after you i tell you what's weird about all these
[28:46.680 --> 28:52.680]  punks and people that mess with me through my life i've never lost i've got provenance and i'm not
[28:52.680 --> 29:00.360]  by the way bragging about that it is humbling to my knees and i look at these dishonorable people
[29:00.360 --> 29:06.280]  who laugh at those that have some honor you know phyllis swathley is the original person
[29:06.280 --> 29:10.680]  with berry go water that launched what is the tea party today and all that's left of this country
[29:12.440 --> 29:15.800]  she was right 50 years ago about the new world order everything
[29:15.800 --> 29:24.040]  all right cruise supporters in the eagle forum tried to hijack and take her bank accounts and
[29:24.040 --> 29:29.480]  shut it down and take it away from her to support cruise why not you're going to steal colorado and
[29:29.480 --> 29:34.760]  all these other states why not just take over the eagle forum see when they start installing
[29:34.760 --> 29:42.040]  presidents when they start stealing elections your bank account your house your kids are next
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.640]  Do people get that?
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.440]  They want authoritarianism to make us slaves.
[29:48.340 --> 29:49.740]  We're on the march.
[29:49.740 --> 29:52.240]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.240 --> 30:17.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:17.240 --> 30:25.740]  The newspaper, which obtained a massive stash of 11.5 million documents from the company that is sending shockwaves around the globe.
[30:25.740 --> 30:29.040]  Agents have open shell companies to conceal their activities.
[30:29.040 --> 30:33.240]  Among them are close intermediaries of the CIA, the newspaper reported.
[30:33.240 --> 30:42.740]  The report from Yahoo News states that the Munich-based newspaper said Fonseca's clients included several players in the 1980s Iran-Contra scandal,
[30:42.740 --> 30:46.940]  which saw senior U.S. officials facilitate arm sales to Iran.
[30:46.940 --> 30:56.940]  In a bid to secure the release of American hostages and fund Nicaragua's Contra Rebels, you can find more reports on infowars.com.

[32:59.940 --> 33:04.940]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:04.940 --> 33:12.940]  And you can see that we're on the front lines of the Information War.
[33:13.940 --> 33:25.940]  White House, Run, Media Matters, and other combines, programming, CNN, MSNBC, and other platforms openly attack us every single day.
[33:25.940 --> 33:39.940]  I was watching Fox News as I do every morning on the elliptical warming up to work out, and I watched a good 30 minutes of it.
[33:43.940 --> 33:47.940]  And they would say, it's ridiculous. Have you heard?
[33:47.940 --> 33:53.940]  Donald Trump's claiming he got cheated, and they play like five seconds of him going, it's rigged, it's bad.
[33:53.940 --> 34:00.940]  And then they cut back Himmer, the guy that looks like he could play American Psycho.
[34:00.940 --> 34:08.940]  He cuts back reading off the teleprompter, and they say, funny then, why are you in the lead?
[34:11.940 --> 34:14.940]  Thinking their audience are idiots. They're stealing the new states.
[34:14.940 --> 34:21.940]  They're canceling elections, giving all the delegates a cruise, so he comes up and meets Trump or beats Trump.
[34:21.940 --> 34:25.940]  And then they play this game, going, what, did you get cheated in the other states?
[34:25.940 --> 34:28.940]  No, they just started massively cheating a few months ago.
[34:31.940 --> 34:34.940]  And then they're laughing him and the girl giggling.
[34:38.940 --> 34:42.940]  And they go, this system's actually benefiting him, and then show no proof.
[34:42.940 --> 34:50.940]  It's like MSNBC going, Alex Jones doesn't like Obamacare, because the Boston bombers are his fans, and he's deeply racist.
[34:50.940 --> 34:59.940]  That's a quote. No proof, Boston bombing, no racist clip, just Donald Trump wants to kill Mexicans.
[35:01.940 --> 35:07.940]  And now it's not just the onion that puts out fake headlines, it's the Boston Globe and other publications.
[35:10.940 --> 35:14.940]  Putting up fake headlines of what Trump supports and what Trump has done.
[35:14.940 --> 35:21.940]  So it's all reached a new level, and let me boil down what's happening here.
[35:21.940 --> 35:25.940]  I've really looked at this carefully, across the world.
[35:27.940 --> 35:37.940]  Davos, that is the public arm of the Bilderberg group, the Davos meeting for the last four or five years has come out and just said, look, there's a new form of government.
[35:37.940 --> 35:42.940]  It's called technocracy. We're going to start appointing prime ministers and presidents.
[35:42.940 --> 35:51.940]  We're going to bring countries into bankruptcy receivership, and then we're going to have their parliaments or legislatures start appointing Goldman Sachs heads.
[35:51.940 --> 35:54.940]  It's always a Goldman Sachs head. I mean, look it up.
[35:54.940 --> 36:01.940]  Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, I mean, it's crazy the last five years.
[36:04.940 --> 36:07.940]  And then the media just goes, wonderful, we now have appointed presidents.
[36:07.940 --> 36:15.940]  And oh, we're under these Pacific Treaty and Asian Pacific Treaty and EU Treaty and Atlantic and EU Treaty.
[36:15.940 --> 36:19.940]  This is all official. And they go, oh, but sorry, the full text is secret.
[36:22.940 --> 36:34.940]  And then we get the text from the 2007 meeting to my film, In Game, and they had over 100 corporate heads in a roundtable event in Banff, Canada.
[36:34.940 --> 36:53.940]  They voted on the next six year plan, and then they had the prime ministers and presidents all there outside of them, lower level, who then pledged with their State Department heads and other heads of state to implement.
[36:53.940 --> 37:03.940]  They go vote in secret councils, and then they come down and then both parties, or in the case of England, all three parties implement it.
[37:03.940 --> 37:13.940]  Just like the Central Committee in China, or in Cuba, or in Venezuela.
[37:13.940 --> 37:21.940]  And then they have a polling bureau that they appoint from themselves that goes and elects the president.
[37:21.940 --> 37:25.940]  And that's what the two parties are doing.
[37:25.940 --> 37:33.940]  So if we're going to be ruled by foreign secret committees, why not have it be the parties? And the arrogance is so great.
[37:33.940 --> 37:44.940]  They have Prevus and Curly Hewlin and the rest of them go on TV, and they just calmly go.
[37:44.940 --> 37:52.940]  Of course we now appoint. It was never about your vote and the reporters go, even the established reporters go, why are you having an election?
[37:52.940 --> 37:57.940]  And they go, good point, we may just get rid of those.
[37:57.940 --> 38:14.940]  And these are unelected just party officials, party hacks appointed by somebody else, stealing the public interest, false advertising, racketeering fraud in your face.
[38:14.940 --> 38:32.940]  CNBC, we choose the nominee, not the voter, senior GOP official. That was back in the 16th of March, basically a little less than a month ago, 38 days ago, 37, or 27 days ago.
[38:32.940 --> 38:39.940]  It makes the head spin.
[38:39.940 --> 38:45.940]  And so what's happening is the head of the Republican Party in Colorado, I have the article right here.
[38:45.940 --> 38:50.940]  He said in tweets and he said the statements to Republicans there that are about to protest this Friday.
[38:50.940 --> 38:54.940]  We're going to have Joe Biggs and others there covering it in Denver.
[38:54.940 --> 38:59.940]  Colorado GOP leader to this incredible Trump supporter, go ahead and burn the party down.
[38:59.940 --> 39:09.940]  These are the same people that put out the tweet five minutes on the official party website, never Trump, we did it.
[39:09.940 --> 39:17.940]  And they said, oh, that was wrong. Sorry, we shouldn't brag. See, the bragging is what's wrong, not the stealing.
[39:17.940 --> 39:21.940]  They're not supposed to act like they just did something and got something over on the voters.
[39:21.940 --> 39:29.940]  They're establishing their own little party dictatorship saying millions and millions of registered voters in Colorado can't vote.
[39:29.940 --> 39:34.940]  And now other states are announcing it.
[39:34.940 --> 39:41.940]  And now they're announcing, oh, sorry, those Arkansas Trump votes, they're going to Cruz. That's being announced.
[39:41.940 --> 39:44.940]  It's a confidence game.
[39:44.940 --> 39:51.940]  Walsing in and taking everything. And I've noticed a lot of people aren't that smart. They just do a confidence game.
[39:51.940 --> 39:57.940]  They act cool, act like they're in charge and that works on other dumbed down people, but you can't fool everybody all the time.
[39:57.940 --> 40:04.940]  And there's a large minority of people that are really sharp and they know you're running a confidence game.
[40:04.940 --> 40:13.940]  And they're really getting ready to get off the bench and come into the game.
[40:13.940 --> 40:17.940]  Colorado GOP deletes Never Trump tweet after Cruz's victory.
[40:17.940 --> 40:23.940]  Colorado GOP on deleted hashtag Never Trump tweet from their account.
[40:23.940 --> 40:32.940]  And they said in the tweet, we did it, show TV viewers a shot of it.
[40:32.940 --> 40:36.940]  We did it, hashtag Never Trump. We did it.
[40:36.940 --> 40:44.940]  We did it. Just like the silly Simpsons piece where they're in the secret Bilderberg meeting going, you know, who rigged the elections?
[40:44.940 --> 40:52.940]  We did. We did. I mean, they're now channeling the Simpsons. We did. We did. We did it. We vote.
[40:52.940 --> 41:04.940]  We decided who goes for president. We do. We do. And then you have to chastise Drudge and chastise Alex Jones and chastise Roger Stone.
[41:04.940 --> 41:15.940]  And just, oh, he should be arrested when we played those clips yesterday. He's coming on in about 20 minutes.
[41:15.940 --> 41:26.940]  And now, Willis Schiafley, the 91-year-old constitutional lawyer, still super sharp, routine guest on this show.
[41:26.940 --> 41:29.940]  They're coming on my show for 20 years.
[41:29.940 --> 41:36.940]  She was on when I'd only been on radio about six months. She's been coming on more than 20 years.
[41:36.940 --> 41:43.940]  And she says, Trump isn't perfect, but he's a nationalist. He doesn't want unfair trade deals. He wants us to have basic sovereignty.
[41:43.940 --> 41:50.940]  He is why the globalists are so upset. She rightfully is for him. She says they're going to try to destroy him like Barry Goldwater.
[41:50.940 --> 42:00.940]  Single-cause nuclear war. Same stories going again to get LBJ in. And folks, they had the inner board that she heads up, try to hijack it and grab the bank accounts,
[42:00.940 --> 42:06.940]  and the bank said no and stopped it. There needs to be a criminal investigation.
[42:06.940 --> 42:15.940]  And it was a bunch of cruise supporters on the board that even convinced her daughter to do it.
[42:15.940 --> 42:21.940]  Willis Schiafley, my board plotted to fire me over Trump. Jerome, of course, he talked to her at the interview.
[42:21.940 --> 42:28.940]  He's coming on in the third hour. We're going to get her on as well, maybe even today.
[42:28.940 --> 42:33.940]  Hey, why not steal her organization? I mean, you're going to steal other states.
[42:33.940 --> 42:41.940]  You're going to tell folks, Ben Carson quit.
[42:41.940 --> 42:51.940]  And how else is Ted Cruz going to rule the world? Like he said he wanted to do when he was a college student and a teenager.
[42:51.940 --> 42:58.940]  Cruz drudges an attack site for Trump campaign. We're going to play this clip in a moment.
[42:58.940 --> 43:10.940]  And then, of course, I never played it, but two weeks ago, the cult leader, Glenn Beck, I mean, he is now a official religious cult leader in this.
[43:10.940 --> 43:13.940]  He's the false prophet and his Messiah is Ted Cruz.
[43:13.940 --> 43:21.940]  You know, he comes out and says that drudges anti-Christian now and I'm crazy.
[43:21.940 --> 43:36.940]  And then I've diseased Drudge's mind as if I have any influence and that he's not a good source of information anymore because Glenn Beck said so.
[43:36.940 --> 43:46.940]  Aspartame admittedly makes you go blind. It's in Diet Coke and thousands of other products. It's been proven. It's admitted.
[43:46.940 --> 43:51.940]  It turns into wood alcohol. And Beck said he was going blind.
[43:51.940 --> 43:59.940]  So I wrote a story and all the medical links to it with Paul Watson a few years ago and sent it to Beck and sent it to Drudge.
[43:59.940 --> 44:09.940]  And Drudge linked to it. I'm the story about Beck going blind, trying to help him and Glenn Beck made fun of it on air and said we were idiots the next day.
[44:09.940 --> 44:13.940]  That's the type of cynical, twisted, weirdo.
[44:13.940 --> 44:17.940]  This curtain demo wrote it that we're dealing with here.
[44:17.940 --> 44:21.940]  I know the inside baseball and Beck, I'm not going to get into it, but he'll end up destroying himself.
[44:21.940 --> 44:28.940]  I mean, he is a egomaniac, super narcissist, probably psychotic in my view.
[44:28.940 --> 44:35.940]  And he's insane and wants to be a cult leader.
[44:35.940 --> 44:43.940]  And Drudge has shown that. And so now he's anti-Christian. See, if you don't support the prophet, Moses' return, you didn't know.
[44:43.940 --> 44:47.940]  In fact, the two prophets of revelation. It's Ted Cruz and Glenn Beck, you didn't know.
[44:47.940 --> 44:52.940]  He says he's a priesthood. He's starting. Oh, oh, yeah.
[44:52.940 --> 45:03.940]  Oh, really? The liberal hardcore shock jock that was hired right before 9-11 and gotten ready to come out to be the synthetic Alex Jones.
[45:03.940 --> 45:11.940]  I mean, I've been told that by the executives involved where they sat and he's an actor and watched weeks of my videos and shows and said to take this and mix it with Oprah.
[45:11.940 --> 45:14.940]  That's what I was told by the executives that used to run his operation.
[45:14.940 --> 45:27.940]  He's a mixture of Oprah Winfrey and Alex Jones, all in a big, weird, Doughboy's body. A cult leader.
[45:27.940 --> 45:40.940]  A Nelly high priest. Scared to death, by the way. Dozens of security people.
[45:40.940 --> 45:50.940]  And he thinks he can dictate what happens and who operates. And now Ted Cruz comes out and demonizes the drugs report.
[45:50.940 --> 45:59.940]  And the Washington Post gets it right. Since Ted Cruz's war with Matt Drudge could become a huge problem for his campaign.
[45:59.940 --> 46:07.940]  You're the one with the bushes running your campaign, stealing delegates, stealing states and getting elections canceled. Ted Cruz, you're the one.
[46:07.940 --> 46:16.940]  Let's make a joke. In fact, let's play this first. Ted Cruz mocks Trump, calls Colorado voterless win democracy on Fox News. Here it is.
[46:16.940 --> 46:32.940]  The latest thing he seized upon is when people vote against him, they're stealing the election. It's a really odd notion. What is this democracy of which you speak?
[46:32.940 --> 46:41.940]  And then he goes on, there's a transcript up on him, full wars.com. He's speaking of Colorado, where no one was allowed to vote.
[46:41.940 --> 46:55.940]  Oh, but the super delegates decide, oh, they decided to cancel it and give it 3040. Oh, oh, it's a vote of the inner, like China has votes by the Central Committee and the Politburo.
[46:55.940 --> 47:12.940]  They do have voting in Cuba, too. You know what? You just taught me, Ted. I mean, this guy has uncloaked and is worse than Hillary Clinton, who said that the Iran is behind ISIS when there are genemies.
[47:12.940 --> 47:22.940]  Okay, so let's go to the next clip. Ted Cruz says the Drudge report is an attack site for Donald Trump campaign on the Mike Slater show.
[47:22.940 --> 47:29.940]  And again, they've got all the clear channel people basically in the pike.
[47:29.940 --> 47:36.940]  And I've been told by the clear channel shows, hey, we like to have you on Alex, but you know until the election over, you're not supposed to be on now because you're a Trump supporter.
[47:36.940 --> 47:44.940]  Roger Stone, the Washington Post asked, why has he been banned from every TV network? Why would you not want one of the top analysts for the campaign on?
[47:44.940 --> 47:53.940]  He's on like 15 minutes because he's too effective, folks. I mean, this, this is happening. I'm restricted. I'm taking off XM.
[47:53.940 --> 48:00.940]  They have people come into our affiliates and they'll tell them hospital districts, federal government funded stuff will give you $300,000.
[48:00.940 --> 48:07.940]  Just take Alex Jones off. It's happening. Folks, they are taking the country over.
[48:07.940 --> 48:16.940]  And people are still so foolish in the conservative movement. You think Ted Cruz, because he says the right things is good.
[48:16.940 --> 48:21.940]  So here it is. Drudge report is an attack site for Donald Trump.
[48:21.940 --> 48:29.940]  No, the drugs report isn't for suspending elections, which you call is a vote.
[48:29.940 --> 48:35.940]  And then your crowd giggles and laughs. Let's play the clip.
[48:35.940 --> 48:42.940]  Drudge report lately. Not even, right? Not even about Trump, but their anti-Christian headlines.
[48:42.940 --> 48:45.940]  One of my favorites was a couple of weeks ago, and it was in red, right?
[48:45.940 --> 48:51.940]  Pastor calls for execution of gays, then introduces Ted Cruz.
[48:51.940 --> 48:58.940]  And I said, hold on, right? And I clicked it. And of course, he just listed a bunch of sins and talked about spiritual death, not execution.
[48:58.940 --> 49:03.940]  And then there are all these headlines about people laying hands on you to make you seem like a crazy weirdo.
[49:03.940 --> 49:08.940]  I feel like we have enough people attacking Christianity. We don't need Drudge's help. What do you think of that?
[49:08.940 --> 49:16.940]  Well, Drudge report over the years has done a good job highlighting the excesses of the left and the excesses of liberalism.
[49:16.940 --> 49:22.940]  And in about the past month, the Drudge report has basically become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign.
[49:22.940 --> 49:26.940]  And so every day they have the latest Trump attack. They're directed at me.
[49:26.940 --> 49:34.940]  By all appearances, Roger Stone now decides what's on Drudge. And most days they have a six month old article that is some attack on me.
[49:34.940 --> 49:39.940]  And it's whatever the Trump campaign is pushing that day will be the banner headline on Drudge.
[49:39.940 --> 49:46.940]  By the way, they no longer cover news. Remember they used to have things like election results? They don't put those on Drudge anymore.
[49:46.940 --> 49:50.940]  When we win a state, suddenly the state doesn't matter.
[49:50.940 --> 49:57.940]  Good pause. Good pause. Folks, this is lying that is at a new level beyond Obama or Hillary.
[49:57.940 --> 50:03.940]  I didn't know lies of this magnitude existed. He says that it was democracy in Colorado.
[50:03.940 --> 50:08.940]  He says Drudge is posting old, multi weeks old news.
[50:08.940 --> 50:18.940]  He was posting Saturday and Sunday and Monday as it happened when they canceled the election in Colorado.
[50:18.940 --> 50:30.940]  And then he says when we win a state, they don't report it like Colorado. You didn't win the state.
[50:30.940 --> 50:38.940]  And I want to be clear. I liked Ted Cruz, even though people said don't trust him. He's a Bush background, CFR, Goldman Sachs.
[50:38.940 --> 50:42.940]  Man, I don't support Hillary, Robin Bernie Sanders.
[50:42.940 --> 50:46.940]  Bernie has been ahead the whole time. He'll have 50,000. She has a thousand.
[50:46.940 --> 50:51.940]  All over the country, he'd win New Hampshire, you name it. They'd give the votes. He won Wyoming, on and on and on.
[50:51.940 --> 50:59.940]  I can't stand Bernie Sanders, but man, that's wrong.
[50:59.940 --> 51:04.940]  And Trump, I've got issues. He's shooting his mouth off about waterboarding again.
[51:04.940 --> 51:09.940]  He hates ISIS. He doesn't get why if they break the rules, why can't we? Because we're the good guys.
[51:09.940 --> 51:12.940]  Believe me, I like to torture some ISIS people.
[51:12.940 --> 51:17.940]  But by the way, but I'm not going to support it and I'm not going to push it.
[51:17.940 --> 51:24.940]  But it's Hillary and it's the Republican Party leadership launching the attacks in Syria and Libya with the hundreds of thousands of dead Christians.
[51:24.940 --> 51:30.940]  It's Drudge showing the war on Christians worldwide and making it a top issue, leaking the CNN news,
[51:30.940 --> 51:36.940]  info wars all the time on the war on Christianity and the war on crosses and the war on Christmas.
[51:36.940 --> 51:40.940]  I don't think there's any site out there that's defended Christianity more than Matt Drudge.
[51:40.940 --> 51:48.940]  And I'm going to say it right now. It's a backhanded anti-Semitic remark because Matt Drudge is Jewish.
[51:48.940 --> 51:58.940]  And I don't think of Matt Drudge as white or black or Jewish or anything. He's a patriot and really a constitutional populist, a libertarian.
[51:58.940 --> 52:04.940]  And I know Matt Drudge. He's been here and I've had dinner with him and I've talked to him some and I have people that know him.
[52:04.940 --> 52:10.940]  And he's, I get a really good feeling around him and he does good work and he just gets better and better.
[52:10.940 --> 52:14.940]  And they can't stand the fact that world governments here, I've been proven right.
[52:14.940 --> 52:21.940]  So yeah, Matt Drudge listens to this show every day. He listens to other ones. He's got four or five on it all times.
[52:21.940 --> 52:28.940]  I know his crew as well. They're good people. They're freaked out about the future.
[52:28.940 --> 52:35.940]  But they want to save America. They don't want to have to evacuate.
[52:35.940 --> 52:40.940]  There's a takeover, folks. The president ignores the borders. They're wide open.
[52:40.940 --> 52:48.940]  And then Ted Cruz gets up there and it's hard to have every word you say be a lie or a twisted.
[52:48.940 --> 52:54.940]  It's easy to tell the truth and be passionate and be oratory and skillful because it's out of the heart. It's easy.
[52:54.940 --> 52:59.940]  It's hard to sit there and memorize twisted lies in lifetime.
[52:59.940 --> 53:06.940]  Cruz is dangerous. He's probably got 170 IQ. But a lot of psychos have the highest IQs.
[53:06.940 --> 53:10.940]  I think Ted Cruz is a psychopath. I really do because he's very convincing.
[53:10.940 --> 53:14.940]  But the facts is he's a liar and a thief.
[53:14.940 --> 53:22.940]  And he's got his operatives trying to steal Eagle Forum and shut it down.
[53:22.940 --> 53:30.940]  Trying to mug the oldest living conservative and mug the voters of Colorado and South Dakota and other areas.
[53:30.940 --> 53:36.940]  And mug the voters of Texas. So he lost here.
[53:36.940 --> 53:43.940]  I talked to folks that were down there, delegates. They say it was like five to one Trump and Travis County, other areas, two, three to one.
[53:43.940 --> 53:48.940]  Cruz has a thousand. Trump has 50,000. Same story.
[53:48.940 --> 53:53.940]  The establishment's attacking Trump because he's for real and they got a dossier on him.
[53:53.940 --> 53:59.940]  And I've talked to a bunch of insiders that I kind of just didn't register it before Trump even ran.
[53:59.940 --> 54:02.940]  I'd be talking to people and they go, you know Donald Trump? I thought I had him on sometime.
[54:02.940 --> 54:05.940]  Like, what do you mean? Like, you know, he likes you.
[54:05.940 --> 54:08.940]  And I'm like, what are you talking about? I'm talking to some movie star.
[54:08.940 --> 54:14.940]  I'm talking to a TV host or something. They're like, yeah, no, you're not hanging out with Donald Trump.
[54:14.940 --> 54:19.940]  I'm on Trump. All of a sudden, Roger Stone comes to me.
[54:19.940 --> 54:22.940]  Donald Trump comes to me.
[54:22.940 --> 54:25.940]  And then, of course, he's on the show a month ago and he goes, you didn't know.
[54:25.940 --> 54:29.940]  Trump knows more than we do.
[54:29.940 --> 54:34.940]  And of course, he's a famous deep cover operative for you name it.
[54:34.940 --> 54:39.940]  And they're old line people that really are for this country. These are nationalists you see defending this country.
[54:39.940 --> 54:45.940]  And Trump has been approached by people. They were they gave him briefings on everything that's going on.
[54:45.940 --> 54:48.940]  And he basically is on a suicide mission.
[54:48.940 --> 54:54.940]  And you know what, even though Trump's got problems, he's an old fashioned guy, you know, right wing populist at his heart.
[54:54.940 --> 54:59.940]  Played Patty cake with the left to do business on the East Coast.
[54:59.940 --> 55:03.940]  I'm proud to be on this mission with Trump and I'm proud to be on it with Matt Drudge.
[55:03.940 --> 55:08.940]  That's the kind of company I want to keep not not with these other people.
[55:08.940 --> 55:13.940]  I got the Bush family backing Cruz. Let's go back to Cruz. Here it is.
[55:13.940 --> 55:17.940]  When when we win a state suddenly the state doesn't matter, you know, Colorado.
[55:17.940 --> 55:25.940]  There was no red siren on Drudge when we won all 34 delegates in Colorado.
[55:25.940 --> 55:34.940]  That wasn't news because that's fine. If people want to hit pause, hit pause, put up what he put up Saturday and Sunday.
[55:34.940 --> 55:39.940]  And Monday. Drudge has never run the same headline for three days. That's the ultimate siren in red.
[55:39.940 --> 55:44.940]  Put put it up from my tweet. I screenshotted it that they canceled the election.
[55:44.940 --> 55:53.940]  He says that put my tweet up guys, please. He says that no one is reporting it.
[55:53.940 --> 55:57.940]  When all Drudge was doing was reporting that he stole it.
[55:57.940 --> 56:06.940]  And then he spins it and says Drudge won't report I won Colorado to the audience of that radio show like their fools.
[56:06.940 --> 56:14.940]  They accused Drudge of lying to his readers and telling him that he didn't win Colorado in a democracy.
[56:14.940 --> 56:21.940]  I played that clip. And then Cruz goes, I guess it's okay if he didn't want to tell his readers.
[56:21.940 --> 56:30.940]  Did you hear that? Because he doesn't want to say Drudge is mad at me because we didn't let people vote.
[56:30.940 --> 56:42.940]  We canceled the election. He says Drudge won't tell you that the voters in a democracy gave me the vote and I won all 34.
[56:42.940 --> 56:51.940]  I mean that is a new level of horse crap. This guy's a shift lord or something.
[56:51.940 --> 56:58.940]  I mean I don't even know what to say anymore people. I got to stop right there.
[56:58.940 --> 57:11.940]  Our crew is going Joe Biggs and Rob doing others are going to speak you name it at the demonstration in Portland where the leftist say you're not allowed to have a demonstration even though they're going to be speakers there.
[57:11.940 --> 57:18.940]  They attack the Trump supporters. They're going to that. That's Saturday. The day before that they're going to be, I'll tell you about this next hour,
[57:18.940 --> 57:22.940]  they're going to be in Denver where they've stolen, the RNC's stolen the votes.
[57:22.940 --> 57:26.940]  And so we're going to have live feeds covering it all, you name it, Friday and Saturday.
[57:26.940 --> 57:32.940]  We need funding obviously. We sell the very best Hillary for present t-shirts, the very best nutraceuticals, DNA force,
[57:32.940 --> 57:41.940]  supermail vitality, female vitality, nation eye and the good halogen X tube. We've got bone support formula. We've got joint support formulas.
[57:41.940 --> 57:52.940]  We've got just the best of everything, the best lung cleanse, essential oil spray out there, DNA forces back in stock, cell fusion, other great products.
[57:52.940 --> 57:58.940]  We've got the product there on the site. Also the occupier that's got a lot of the same great stuff in as well,
[57:58.940 --> 58:07.940]  but it's a lot less expensive deep cleanses back in the brain force. I think Anthroplex is sold out infowarslifes.com, infowarsstore.com.
[58:07.940 --> 58:15.940]  And listen, go there, buy the books, buy the videos, buy the non GMO heirloom seeds, buy the Molon Lombay t-shirts, shop with the good guys,

[58:20.940 --> 58:25.940]  We're able to fight on multi fronts. Right now we're still understaffed. We're growing in the face of the enemy.
[58:25.940 --> 58:33.940]  We're putting the funds that come in back into the operation. We're putting on all sale in the fight to go to attack speed, ramming speed,
[58:33.940 --> 58:40.940]  and beyond infowarslifes.com. Go there, support the info war, buy the war bonds, defeat the globalist, history's happening.

[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:49.940]  That's what separates the good guys from the bad guys.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:01:18.940]  That's what separates the men from the boys as well. That's part of the song.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:26.940]  I like Elvis. I like Jim Morrison.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:50.940]  Somebody else has a voice like that.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:02:00.940]  The sun is setting behind the mountains. The sun is setting behind you. This song is playing. You have the sun and the moon at the same time up.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:07.940]  And you're just blasting on the highway. And you know there's a God above and you know there's all these mysteries.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:19.940]  And you know it goes on and on. On and on and on. You're not afraid anymore. You transcend these parasites and these globalists.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:27.940]  You've got to keep on riding, riding. You've got to keep on being real, being genuine, being strong.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:35.940]  Because all you know is you feel that honor of your ancestors. You feel all those good people before they stood up for what was right and you want to keep that line going.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:41.940]  You want to be one of those people, don't you? I know I do.
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:49.940]  But control freaks fear us. Because we're everything they wish they were and so much more.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:03:00.940]  Fear not my friends, this great evil comes upon us. Because this is the beginning of the great animating contest of liberty.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:10.940]  You're living it. You're living it right now.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.940]  Roger Stone is going to join us coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:22.940]  And as I tweeted earlier, he says it's the biggest news ever.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:28.940]  The Cruz campaign has gone completely into insane asylum power grab mode.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:36.940]  Cruz has uncloaked himself, creamily licking his lips, discussing weeks ago the Bush endorsement and the full Bush crime family behind him.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.940]  He finally has gotten their attention. They're finally nighting him and bringing him up.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.940]  Probably just throw him aside and put case it for Paul Ryan in.
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:04:04.940]  Because betrayal is the ether, the ocean, the atmosphere, the system, the world, the continuum, the reality
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.940]  in which traders swim.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:15.940]  We're going to come back and talk to Roger Stone and we are going to lay out where we're going.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:22.940]  But I got to tell you one thing. The fact that they're trying to openly bamboozle the public and act like it's no big deal
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.940]  and that Ted Cruz goes on all these radio and TV shows and says it's a democracy.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:36.940]  I won Colorado with the voters and Trump and other groups like Drudge don't want to admit I'm winning fair and square.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.940]  That's what he said earlier. We played the clip. This is a new level of spin.
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:46.940]  We don't think you're stupid here. We're giving you real complex analysis, not just dumbed down.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:53.940]  I win Colorado. Trump not tell you. Drugs not tell you. I win. My toy.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.940]  He like ran into a liquor store, grabbed a bottle of whiskey, ran out the door of the cops, pulled him over and he says he bought it.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:06.940]  Lawmakers are calling on the White House to declassify more than two dozen pages in the 9-11 commission report that they say outlines evidence
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:12.940]  for possible support from the Saudi government for two hijackers who settled in Southern California.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:21.940]  A CBS News 60 Minutes report quoted officials familiar with the 2003 report as saying that 28 pages of redacted information
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:30.940]  raises questions over whether Saudi officials were involved in assisting two hijackers upon their arrival in Los Angeles in January 2000.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:39.940]  Former Democratic Congressman and U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Romer told 60 Minutes the two Saudi nationals found a way to gain access to housing
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:46.940]  and flight lessons upon their arrival despite extremely limited language skills and no experience with Western culture.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:52.940]  Also, former U.S. Senator Bob Kerry, who has read redacted pages, believes that they should be declassified.

[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:08.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.940]  Paul Manafort is now all over international television.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:21.940]  We're going to be getting him on the broadcast soon, obviously.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.940]  He is the longtime business partner of Roger Stone.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:31.940]  You can Google Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, and you can see them way back in the Nixon days.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:36.940]  They're meeting with some of their other counterparts.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:42.940]  And for eight, nine months, Roger Stone's been warning of the big steal, the plan to steal the delegates.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.940]  Now Trump sees that's happening and is getting the right people in there.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:56.940]  And as Politico of the New York Times recognized that Roger Stone and his expert cohorts are trying to save our Republic in the popular vote,
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:02.940]  they are turning incredible vitriol from Meet the Press to Singin' In Against Stone.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.940]  And we played these clips Friday.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.940]  We played them yesterday.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:06.940]  There's five or six of them.
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.940]  I'm not going to play them again today.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.940]  Where they play clips of him on the show where he says,
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:16.940]  no violence, we need to go to the delegations, though, that are public at the hotels and speak to them and say,
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:20.940]  please, you know, go with what you pledge to do.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:29.940]  And there on screen is, of course, Mr. Stone, 45-year veteran of campaigns with Paul Manafort and others.
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.940]  We'll put that back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:38.940]  If you're a radio listener, infowars.com, forward slash show to find the feed so you can see a whole other dimension of this broadcast.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.940]  Now, and also he's there with Lee Atwater in that photo.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.940]  They were there where they tried to steal it from Reagan and help stop it then.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.940]  Manafort and Stone were the head guys that did it.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:51.940]  So they're back.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:57.940]  And whether you love Trump, hate Trump or in the middle, they're scared of him because he doesn't want unfair trade deals.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.940]  He doesn't want globalism.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.940]  He doesn't want open borders.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.940]  So they're running fake headlines in the Boston Globe.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:08.940]  They're lying and they're saying that Roger Stone wants violence.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:19.940]  And on a whole bunch of platforms, including the Washington Post, they've had Rick Tyler and others coming out and saying,
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:27.940]  we should look at indicting when he arrives in Cleveland, Ohio, Roger Stone.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:32.940]  So they're not just going to steal elections and cancel elections in Colorado and other states.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.940]  They're now talking about arresting and we'll put it back on screen.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.940]  I want to read this to radio listeners.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.940]  Could Donald Trump surrogate Roger Stone be charged with menacing GOP convention delegates?
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.940]  You go to the red state sites and others.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:49.940]  They're calling for his arrest and misrepresenting what he said on this show and others.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.940]  And then it goes further.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.940]  This isn't about Roger Stone.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:01.940]  It's about someone out there who was the head of the campaign who accurately warned Trump about what was going to happen.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]  It has happened.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:10.940]  Whose influence has now gone from strong to center stage with he and his business partner to save voting in this country.
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.940]  They're stealing from Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940]  He wins in Wyoming.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:14.940]  He wins in New Hampshire.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:15.940]  They take it.
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:22.940]  When he says he's going to go to his own delegates and try to get them to be honorable, the news says he's stealing it.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:27.940]  So if Bernie Sanders goes to his sworn delegates and tries to get them to do the right thing, he's stealing.
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.940]  That's in the New York Times today.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:36.940]  If Roger Stone says he's going to go to delegates, sworn to their voters to Trump, being stolen from Louisiana to Tennessee.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:40.940]  Even when Trump wins and they have the election, they steal it after.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:41.940]  That's criminal.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.940]  That's intimidation.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:50.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, once you go over the edge of canceling elections and installing puppets, the next stage is arresting people.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:51.940]  You go over an edge.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.940]  Now, we're going to make big announcement series with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:59.940]  Roger Stone has been, you know, deep on the inside now of what's happening battling for these delegates.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:05.940]  He's going to give you the absolute, not five minute, you know, blurb on CNN where he's banned.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:06.940]  MSNBC where he's banned.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.940]  He's now not really on Fox anymore.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.940]  The Washington Post asked, why is he banned?
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.940]  He's one of the most articulate, accurate people, even they understand.
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:21.940]  Because we're seeing political warfare of this country's never seen since Lincoln, quite frankly, in my view.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:22.940]  We have a new level.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.940]  We're going to cover it as well.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.940]  A lot of stations just joined us in the second hour.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:33.940]  Ted Cruz has come out and said, Drudge is an attack dog run by Roger Stone and Donald Trump.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.940]  And I won Colorado and I won the democracy there.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:38.940]  I won the votes.
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.940]  I have the clips coming up.
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.940]  Those are quotes.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:45.940]  And Roger Stone and Drudge lied and said, I didn't win.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.940]  That is the new level of spin.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:55.940]  They canceled the election, had the super delegates ignore the delegates, pledged it all 34 to him and they're spinning it like, Drudge is a liar.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:56.940]  And then it gets worse.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.940]  Phyllis Schlafly, the oldest living true patriot conservative of this country.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:09.940]  Becoming on my show 20 years, she had them try to take over her bank account and her old organization Eagle Forum.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.940]  They get true patriots elected and shut her down.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:17.940]  And it was reportedly a bunch of Cruz operatives, including our own daughter.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.940]  But the bank wouldn't go along with it.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.940]  And now reportedly there's criminal investigations.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.940]  Folks, this is a new level.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.940]  We've never seen theft like this of an election.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.940]  Roger Stone joins us to announce a new website, a new move.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.940]  He announced two weeks ago here first that he was going to lead.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:36.940]  And as for my support, he has it.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:37.940]  He has your support.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.940]  Obviously everybody else who stands for elections.
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.940]  There are people in my office didn't support Trump after this happened.
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.940]  They bought Trumppats and are now wearing them.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:50.940]  Everyone basically is now for Trump in the office because they understand folks.
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.940]  He is a figurehead for liberty and against globalism.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.940]  And this man's life is in danger.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.940]  We should pray for him.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.940]  I am so honored to be associated with Matt Drudge with Roger Stone with Donald Trump.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:02.940]  Real patriots.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.940]  This is the attempted takeover of America.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.940]  You're witnessing.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.940]  That's not hype.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.940]  When they're taking over grassroots organizations that have been around 50 years, covertly cruise.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.940]  When they're canceling elections and then saying he won the popular vote.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940]  We have the clips.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.940]  It is a new level.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:25.940]  So big announcements, big inside baseball with one of the top generals in the Trump campaign outside the campaign,
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:31.940]  which the enemies figured out is central to campaign is now attacking him more than they're almost attacking Trump.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.940]  And that's because they want to take him out folks.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.940]  Well, you're about to get to hearing for the next 45 minutes.
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:36.940]  Roger Stone.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:37.940]  That's my intro.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.940]  And you've got big website, a big move you're about to announce.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.940]  This is just epic.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.940]  I'm on the edge of my seat.
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.940]  I've never been more excited to be on air.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.940]  Well, Alex, it is.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:55.940]  I'm wearing this hat as a homage to Matt Drudge because he's a guy who really did wreck the Internet.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:04.940]  He's broken into as a pioneer becoming a mass communicator who wasn't owned by a multinational corporation.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.940]  And the idea that anyone controls Matt Drudge is offensive.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:18.940]  He does a public service by picking up some of the best alternative and conservative media out there and spreading it to the masses.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.940]  And by the way, for folks that don't know, Drudge, you're absolutely right.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.940]  The way to not get something on Drudge is to tell him what to do.
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:31.940]  Not only that, but I would be honored if he posted everything of mine he ever sees, but I'm not that privileged.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:36.940]  You know, Ted Cruz, you know, he has a problem with the First Amendment quite obviously.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:41.940]  And this wild punch at either me or Matt Drudge is senseless.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:49.940]  Look, there was a media uproar last week when I suggested that Trump supporters visit the hotels of delegates.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.940]  Let me be a little more specific.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:16:00.940]  From the beginning, the problem here has been one of Trojan delegates, Trojan horse delegates.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:14.940]  These Trojan horse delegates are very specifically holding seats in delegate positions who are elected to Donald Trump, but not loyal to Trump.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:22.940]  The party machines are seeking to insert these hacks, these loyalists into delegations,
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:31.940]  which gives them a majority on the question of rules, credentials and platform,
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:36.940]  all of which must come before the first ballot for president.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:46.940]  So even if Donald Trump has 1,237 votes, which under the capable leadership of Paul Manafort
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:57.940]  and the incredible talents as a candidate and a communicator of Donald Trump, I think they will have the establishment plans to steal this anyway.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:03.940]  It is these Trojan horse delegates who will be central to the steal.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:10.940]  What I suggest, quite frankly, is that each one of them be required to sign a loyalty pledge.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:20.940]  It's voluntary, of course, agreeing to stick with Donald Trump, the choice of the voters, the voters who elected that delegate.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.940]  They should pledge to stand with the popular vote or move to North Korea.
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:33.940]  Correct. Now, you're not forced to sign, but if you won't sign, it will identify for the media who the quizlings are.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:39.940]  That's right. If you're going to steal an election in America and cancel America, you better put your John Hancock on it.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:45.940]  Right. So it exposes the bosses who are subverting the democratic process.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:51.940]  Donald Trump is winning these primaries big. This just in. He won Arkansas.
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:18:00.940]  Now there is a Cruz-Rubio alliance planning to block Donald Trump in Arkansas from getting his rightful majority.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:05.940]  We've seen the strong arm tactics that were utilized in Colorado.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:18.940]  We have seen a rare victory where Donald Trump and the forces loyal to John Kasich team together to block Ted Cruz out in Michigan.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:23.940]  So two can play this game and I expect it's going to be hard fought right to the end.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:29.940]  We are going to march on Cleveland. Delegations.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:37.940]  We're going to ask every Trump delegate to sign the voluntary pledge. Are you with the voters or are you with the bosses?
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:43.940]  It's only elementary that Trump delegates should vote for Donald Trump and not against his interests.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:50.940]  Let me stop you right there. Paul Manafort, your longtime partner that now basically, according to Politico, runs the campaign.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:57.940]  I don't want to brag about it, but hopefully saving the campaign came out as you know and meet the press and said,
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.940]  look, they're breaking the rules. They've gone too far. We're going to file complaints.
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:06.940]  Look, it's one thing if there's close elections, I've looked at the rules and then there's a brokered situation.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:14.940]  But it's another thing when you just cancel elections altogether and then just have the party insiders tell you that Cruz won everything.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:20.940]  For me, we need to get out and educate the public that why do we get rid of Jim Crow and poll taxes?
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:25.940]  I mean, we have election laws for popular votes. There's public interest here.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.940]  It's racketeering for the party to say now popular votes don't count.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.940]  This is unprecedented. And I think that Trump should press this.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.940]  The problem is watching mainstream TV, they won't show the full clip.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.940]  They just show Trump saying it's rigged and then make a joke and say, well, he's just mad.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:47.940]  He didn't win Colorado and they don't even tell people now in some of these shows.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.940]  I know you don't want to bash Fox because you're on there some, but I was watching Fox this morning.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:52.940]  They wouldn't even say that there was no vote.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:59.940]  So they've reached a new level and that's the talking point from Cruz is he's running around saying it's a democracy.
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:06.940]  I have the clip played at last hour. I won Colorado and Drudge won't report that I won Colorado.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.940]  What he reported you stole it.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:16.940]  So from your expert understanding and of course, Paul's understanding of this and he hinted at this on national television.
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:22.940]  Is this not illegal? What's going on? Or is this not a violation of the court rules to just cancel things?
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:29.940]  Well, first of all, let me make very, very clear yet again that I have no formal nor informal role in the Donald Trump campaign.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:36.940]  Paul Manafort is his own man. He's a skilled professional. I'm proud to say that we're partners for 15 years.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:43.940]  I would point out that my other partner who I hold in very high regard, Charlie Black, a very skilled operative,
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:48.940]  as shrewd as they come now working for John Kasich, which is his constitutional right.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:53.940]  He's not to be underestimated. He's a very clever guy who knows the rules.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:21:01.940]  But I want to be very clear that Paul Manafort works for Donald Trump and Donald Trump runs Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:12.940]  I Alex, I'm going to be outside the convention hall with you with some bullhorns and hopefully with thousands at the stop the steal march and rally.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:18.940]  Now, this is to be very clear, a nonviolent, peaceful protest.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:32.940]  I was in the 1968 campaign for Richard Nixon. I understand that violence in Cleveland of any kind would be detrimental to Donald Trump's capability to win.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:37.940]  You should not have to provide so this. You never said this. They're running fake headlines. How do we counter them lying?
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:43.940]  Everybody must come to Cleveland. Everybody must go to Denver this Friday to protest at the RNC as well. The big steal.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:48.940]  Yeah. So when they say, why do you want to visit the hotel rooms of delegates? It's very simple.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:54.940]  I want them to sign the pledge. I respect if they don't want to sign the pledge. That's their right.
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:59.940]  But the voters elected them to vote for Donald Trump. That's our democracy.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:11.940]  So if the bosses have put them into a Trump seat, Texas, for example, where the delegation does not include a single actual Trump supporter, not one.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:22.940]  Because George P. Bush and Rick Perry and Ted Cruz have ganged up to ensure that they control the Texas delegation on questions of rules and credentials.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:25.940]  That's where the big steal will take place.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.940]  Unprecedented. You talked about breaking some of the biggest news ever today. I put it out on Twitter.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:38.940]  Roger Stone, the man that the Republicans establishment once arrested is going to break some of the biggest news ever on the broadcast.
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:47.940]  I know that you're launching a trumpballotsecurity.org. Tell us about trumpballotsecurity.org. We're going to tweak that out and some of the other plans.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:54.940]  And then you always know weeks and months ahead of time what's going to happen. Tell us the next shoe to drop.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:23:02.940]  Well, here Alex is the is the breaking news before we talk about some of the important projects that will help Donald Trump.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:10.940]  Ted Cruz has continually given the impression that he has some kind of inside track with the Rubio delegates.
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:19.940]  As you know, Marco Rubio requested that his delegates not be released. He has an excess of 100 delegates.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:29.940]  Those delegates are obviously going to play a very large role as well as the 230 delegates who are unpledged.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:37.940]  This is where I think all sides will be wooing those delegates. They're going to be hearing from Donald Trump Jr.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:42.940]  I imagine they'll hear from Ivanka. Some of them may hear directly from Donald Trump.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:49.940]  The Trump family is Donald Trump's greatest asset. They have a special tonight with Anderson Cooper,
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:54.940]  where you'll be able to see the Trump family in an interview, I believe it is.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:02.940]  So it is an important part of this strategy to focus on those that vary delegates.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.940]  Now, Ted Cruz has maintained that he somehow has an inside track on those delegates,
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:16.940]  that those delegates would never vote for Donald Trump. I can tell you definitively that Senator Rubio did not ask
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:24.940]  for the non-release of those delegates as a favor to Ted Cruz, that those delegates based on a survey of them that has been done
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:29.940]  by experienced people indicates that they're loyal to Senator Marco Rubio.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:38.940]  They have no great high regard for Ted Cruz. They're not Trump supporters, but they are also not Trump supporters.
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:45.940]  So the idea that Rubio has a corner here is a falsehood that his agents continue to spread.
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:49.940]  I don't know where these important votes will ultimately end up.
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:25:01.940]  I was encouraged to see that the senator decided to hold his delegation. He did not receive the endorsement of Jeb Bush.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:10.940]  There is bad blood between Marco and Bush because he had the audacity to pursue his constitutional right to run for office.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:16.940]  Alex, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the credit belongs to the man who gets in the arena,
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:20.940]  not the man who stands on the side and points out where the strong man stumbles.
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:29.940]  I give Marco credit for just running the gauntlet, for trying. He wasn't successful, but he at least deserves our respect for the effort.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:34.940]  So some of the big breaking news here is, and I know you've been in these meetings the last few days.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:42.940]  I mean, you've been eyes on the ball in person, if I can go that far, that Rubio is not pledged to Cruz.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:47.940]  He's lying and that Rubio's huge amount of delegates are up for grabs.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:55.940]  And hey, Donald Trump and his crew and Paul Manafort and others have a lot of tricks up their sleeves that aren't dirty,
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:01.940]  but are going to be able to block some of the establishment punches being thrown at this free and open election.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:07.940]  If this was a normal election, Trump would already be, obviously, the nominee and people would be getting behind him.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.940]  But the Republicans have said, the head of the Republican Party in Colorado has said in a tweet,
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:20.940]  I'm ready to burn down the party. Let's do it. I mean, for me, this is just incredible that these individuals are clearly operatives
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:23.940]  wanting to make a one-party system and basically globalize things.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:28.940]  They've already moved on wanting jobs at the UN or jobs at the IMF World Bank.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.940]  And these people are just open traders. I think this is sedition.
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.940]  This is private parties working together to create an oligarchy.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:43.940]  And I don't say this for rhetoric. You're the one they're wanting to arrest for saying we should, you know, exercise our first amendment and demonstrate.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.940]  I think this is criminal. I mean, this is an attempt to take the country over.
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:52.940]  This is a racketeering. This makes Jim Crow look like a blessing.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:58.940]  I mean, I know that I don't have rhetoric strong enough is what I'm saying, Roger, to describe the climate these people have entered into.
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:04.940]  I mean, what can we really say about Ted Cruz? I liked Ted Cruz six months ago, but this guy is just a monster.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:10.940]  A fellow Schlafly. I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:18.940]  And his Skype just paused. We'll get him to load back up here in just a moment. I mean, people, this is crazy.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:27.940]  And then Cruz going out with these talking points that he won and why is, you know, why is Trump mad?
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.940]  And then he won't say it's because they stole the election.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.940]  You know, in not just Colorado, another ounce in four other states, it's in the Washington Post.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.940]  Oh, that's just the new thing we use. You know, we don't have votes.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:43.940]  We're getting the Skype reconnected.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:57.940]  And look, it's crazy. Matt Drudge is being attacked because he links to the local paper, the Denver Post saying that the election was canceled in the state and voters don't get to vote.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:04.940]  I mean, how is Matt Drudge not supposed to link to that? That's sensational news.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:10.940]  That's a seismic event in American politics. Your Skype's back, sir. At least it looks like it's somewhat stabilizing.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.940]  We may have to go to phone. Roger, can you hear me?
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:21.940]  Yeah, we're having so much distortion here. I think the NSA is probably monitoring this.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.940]  Oh, you think they might be messing with the election? I think that's probably the case.
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:27.940]  But seriously, Roger Stone, we're going to break it in a moment. What would you call this?
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.940]  Because I think it's a criminal takeover. I think it's unprecedented.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:35.940]  What they're doing with spin machine, the deception level, where Cruz is saying it's a democracy.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:40.940]  I got the popular vote. We have the clip in Colorado. I mean, this is a new level of lying.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:51.940]  Well, also, let's realize that there are some interpretations of the law that indicate that because this is a race for party office and not public office,
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:57.940]  that actual buying of delegates for cash would not necessarily be illegal.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:04.940]  Now, in the 30s and 40s, this was very common. I've not heard of anything like this in recent conventions,
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:11.940]  but I put nothing behind the oil and gas interests to our funding Ted Cruz's campaign.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:21.940]  This guy is a hold the own subsidiary of the energy industry with a Bush lineage. And when I've exposed his key role in the election
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:30.940]  and the policies of George W. Bush and his wife's ties to the CFR, Goldman Sachs and the insiders,
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:35.940]  and that judge chooses to put them up, he goes out of his mind.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:41.940]  That's right, because he's a total sleeper agent of the Rockefeller East Coast Republicans that we've been trying to get rid of for 40 years.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.940]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:47.940]  TrumpBallotSecurity.org, StopTheSteal.org.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:30:05.940]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:25.940]  Which obtained a massive stash of 11.5 million documents from the company that is sending shockwaves around the globe.
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:32.940]  Agents have opened shell companies to conceal their activities. Among them are close intermediaries of the CIA, the newspaper reported.
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:42.940]  The report from Yahoo News states that the Munich-based newspaper said Fonseca's clients included several players in the 1980s Iran-Contra scandal,
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:52.940]  and saw senior U.S. officials facilitate arm sales to Iran in a bid to secure the release of American hostages and fund Nicaragua's Contra Rebels.

[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.940]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio-FX, Mason, and I.

[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:31.940]  The Trump confidant, longtime buddy, wingman, you name it.
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:38.940]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:40.940]  Really just Trump's 40-something-year buddy.
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:46.940]  Another one of his friends of 40 years, not as close, but knew him in construction and banking.
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:51.940]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, a big heavy hitter, three-time, number one New York Times bestseller.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:57.940]  A guy that deep-six John Kerry. He knows Trump, but he says Trump knows more than he and I do,
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:03.940]  combined about the New World Order, and that Trump basically has been playing possum with the establishment.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.940]  That's why they're freaking out.
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:07.940]  He said that last time he was on three weeks ago, and I was like, wow,
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:11.940]  I had other people tell me this years ago that Donald Trump was this big patriot.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:16.940]  And I was like, what? Donald Trump? That's the casino owner, the hotel owner, the developer.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:20.940]  You know, flashy stuff on TV, kind of pop stuff.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.940]  Well, I learned he gave hundreds of thousands over the years against NAFTA and GATT,
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.940]  against unfair deals for America.
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:29.940]  Even though he wasn't in those businesses, it really made him mad.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.940]  He just loves America. He's not perfect.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.940]  He didn't want to screw us over under globalism and have Chinese 35% tariffs.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.940]  That's why we got to get behind Trump.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:44.940]  The whole system we say we hate, he's melting down, pulling out the stops, cancelling elections.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:51.940]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.940]  And we're also going to give you those websites again so you can get involved and stop the steal.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.940]  Trumpballotsecurity.org, we're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:07.940]  Phyllis Schlafly having the cruise stoats and ferrets and rats and weasels get into her operation,
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:10.940]  trying to take it over yesterday. I mean, that's in world net daily.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:15.940]  Of course, he talked to her. My board plotted to fire me over Trump.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:19.940]  I mean, folks, they're getting us thrown off radio stations over this,
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.940]  even though the station managers like Trump, we're getting good ratings.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.940]  They are moving for the takeover and create a one-party system. This is it.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:30.940]  And Trump is just a manifestation of how they're going to counter populism.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:35.940]  Briefly, you need to understand the Bushes. People have read this book that are experts on the Bushes,
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940]  other authors, and it's a new level. Jeb Bush and the Bush crime family,
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:45.940]  the inside story of American dynasty, Roger Stone and St. John Hunt,
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:50.940]  and a four by congressman, John Libutolero, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.940]  The point is that I've read it. It's over the top.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.940]  Powerful understanding, the whole power structure and the Clinton's war on women.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:01.940]  New national polls out show Trump in a dead heat with Hillary or a head over.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.940]  He brings this out. It's over.
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:09.940]  So both these books available in fullwarstore.com and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:14.940]  Separately, we have DNA force that is the strongest, most powerful nutraceutical out there.
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:20.940]  It has the true naturally produced bio, PQQ, CoQ10, resveratrol.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940]  The list goes on and on.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:27.940]  Souped up with the key patented amino acids to have your body upload it
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:29.940]  directly to the mitochondrial DNA.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:35.940]  This is the stuff they've got, you know, in German labs that people pay $600 a bottle for.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.940]  It is the true game changer is why it's such a best seller.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:43.940]  It's back in stock, very hard to procure these California purity levels, but we do it.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:47.940]  It's very hard to have a multi system like this with this many things in it that's completely pure
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.940]  and non detectable or down to California levels.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:55.940]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.940]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:03.940]  And we're going to have our crew in Denver Friday for the demonstration at the RNC for the big steal.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:07.940]  We're going to have them in Portland where the left has said no firsts of them and allowed.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:11.940]  We're going to be battling hard, Rob do and Joe Biggs and others.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:13.940]  Everybody should wear their Hillary for prison shirts.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:20.940]  They're Molan Lobby shirts. You hear the leftist fascist go and infowars and just foam and fear.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:26.940]  And after they attacked the six people that were Oregon State, they're in Portland.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:29.940]  They said, no, you don't come back with the faculty doing a thing.
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:30.940]  There's no free speech here.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:31.940]  Well, we need a bunch of people to go.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:33.940]  They're going to be speakers that are listed.
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.940]  I'm sure we'll try to ban them and the schools say no first amendment.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:37.940]  You need to be wearing your Molan Lobby shirts.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:42.940]  You need to be there to stand for the first amendment and really expose the the tyranny of these anti free speech people.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.940]  We're about to go back to Roger Stone right now.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:50.940]  But don't forget infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:51.940]  Don't forget your purchases.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:56.940]  Make it all possible for this platform to fight for tyranny and support our local affiliates.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.940]  All right.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.940]  Also, you can visit Roger Stone's own personal website.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:03.940]  That's excellent with news updates and videos.
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:07.940]  The latest Trump inside info, stonesone.com.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:13.940]  Now, going back to Mr. Stone, while his Skype holds there from sunny Florida,
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:18.940]  we still haven't covered a laundry list, the Phyllis Schlafly attack, other dirty tricks.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.940]  What's coming next?
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:28.940]  And then I want to also get into some calls and call for people again to get ready to get your apartment rented or whatever or nearby town.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.940]  Be in Cleveland, book it now, commit.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:32.940]  This is history.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.940]  I'm going to be there.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.940]  Roger Stone.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:45.940]  Well, Alex, first, I really must address the question of those advocating that I be either arrested or banned from the convention.
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:52.940]  So the establishment wants to take away my right of free speech, my constitutional right of free assembly and free association.
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:56.940]  On the basis of what evidence I never called for violence.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:05.940]  If CNN and Megyn Kelly were honest, they would play the very next sentence in which I talk about the importance of a dialogue with the delegates.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.940]  But of course, they don't do that.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.940]  So it is something you would expect from the Nazis.
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:14.940]  First, we're banning people, then we're banning books, then we're banning movies.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.940]  Next, you know, we're burning books.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.940]  This is a very slippery slope.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.940]  Then we're burning people.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.940]  It's entirely anti free speech.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:31.940]  Look, I above all know that any violence in Cleveland is detrimental to my ultimate goal, the election of Donald Trump and the takedown.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:35.940]  The Soros and the Democrats and the Republican operatives attacking Trump rallies.
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.940]  We're not the ones that are violent.
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:38.940]  Exactly.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.940]  So I think it's important that we touch on that.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:46.940]  Look, Alex, I think you really expressed the importance and that is the march on Cleveland.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.940]  Details to come, the marching rally.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:52.940]  You can go to stopthesteel.org.
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:55.940]  This will be information central on all the details.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:01.940]  We are seeking to raise enough money to run buses from all over the United States.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:07.940]  We are in negotiations with a couple of colleges that are out of session for dormitory space.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:14.940]  We're trying to access some other inexpensive housing for the marshals for the organizers.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:21.940]  We've had tremendous reception from the Trump supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania and Delaware.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.940]  They're already committed to carloads of bodies.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:33.940]  So as I've said previously, whether you have to walk, hitchhike, bus, take a train, or if you can afford to fly, come to Cleveland.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.940]  It's important that we stand up.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:36.940]  And you are a guy that gets results.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:42.940]  You stopped Reagan getting robbed with your partner, Paul, now heading up the campaign at many levels.
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940]  You helped stop Al Gore getting in.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:47.940]  You could say Bush stole it and you turned against Bush later because he's corrupt.
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:48.940]  They're both corrupt.
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:49.940]  Whatever.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.940]  Point is, you know what you're doing.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.940]  This is the plan.
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:54.940]  This is the place people need to put their time, their energy, and their money.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.940]  Commit now.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.940]  You're going to Cleveland, folks.
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.940]  It's a march on tyranny.
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940]  It's a march against the people that want to steal this country.
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:07.940]  It's a march on the state apparatus, the would-be Republican Party Politburo.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:19.940]  And again, I say if you're coming and you're a Trump supporter, the Soros-funded agents provocateur, the agate prop, the demonstrators with the full protest,
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:24.940]  who are sometimes wearing Bernie Sanders t-shirts but aren't Bernie supporters.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.940]  They are going to try to incite violence.
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:29.940]  And we're going to digital photo them into a Google image scan.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:31.940]  We always blow their cover.
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:32.940]  This will backfire.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:33.940]  Yes.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:35.940]  And it's essential that you ignore their taunts.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.940]  They want violence so they can blame it on us.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:39.940]  Ignore them.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.940]  Find your delegates.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:44.940]  Ask them respectfully to sign the pledge.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:49.940]  If you are elected as a Trump delegate, you should be required to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:56.940]  If you're not required by the rules, you should be required by your own conscience in the fact that you represent the voters.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:00.940]  You are so extreme to say that we should demonstrate on behalf of voting rights.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.940]  You're probably one of those guys that wanted black people to be able to vote.
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.940]  I mean, you know, how dare you?
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:11.940]  We have to stop what is in fact the hijacking of the Republican Party.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:16.940]  Now, again, the best news today is not that Cruz claimed the Rubio delegates.
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:17.940]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:23.940]  Not that Ted Cruz claimed the endorsement of Marco Rubio or the formal support of his delegates.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:28.940]  But what he's spitting is that he has the majority of them and that is not accurate.
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:32.940]  I think those delegates are loyal to Marco Rubio.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.940]  And there's many fine people in that delegation.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:40.940]  So let's see, you know, when we get to Cleveland, but this is typical of Cruz.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:44.940]  This is why, of course, Donald calls him lie and Ted.
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:52.940]  He continues to lie about me on Fox, on CNN claiming that I planted the National Enquirer stories.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:59.940]  Sadly, those outlets, Fox gave me an opportunity to respond, but CNN has never allowed me to respond.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.940]  So he can attack me, but I can't respond.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:09.940]  Fortunately, I can come here to infowars.com and reach four times as many people as it would see me on MSNBC.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:12.940]  So I'm blessed. I'm really blessed.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:13.940]  Well, that's another question.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:22.940]  This moment in media where the Republican Democratic Party leadership's together, where the big channels are merging, where Obama's now on Fox News, Hillary's now great on Fox News,
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.940]  all this craziness is going on, all those systems powers against it.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.940]  MSNBC's biggest shows have like 300, 400,000 viewers.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:30.940]  They're a joke.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:35.940]  They're lying, thinking they're in a vacuum and no one knows they're lying, but everyone knows.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:43.940]  In your next breath, you said, go to Cleveland, go knock on their doors, talk to the delegates, and try to get them to follow their pledge, but don't be violent.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.940]  Everyone knows they're lying.
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.940]  Don't they understand that?
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:52.940]  And now they're announcing billionaires with a bigger double down against Trump with ads.
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.940]  I mean, I've never seen them throw all their power against somebody.
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:57.940]  What about the arrogance of the media?
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:00.940]  Do they realize how bad they're damaging themselves?
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:15.940]  I think they will do anything to stop an outsider. The entire establishment fear, and this includes the multinational corporation-owned media, the Washington insiders, particularly the lobbyists, the lobbyists who work for the donor class.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.940]  That's exactly who the plotters are here.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:34.940]  And they're petrified by the idea of a nationalist who opposes their international trade deals. They get them cheap labor and make our streets unsafe, who opposes their fiscal hokery in which we're broke and they're always poking the books.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.940]  We go deeper and deeper in debt.
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:42.940]  Trump is a believer in American sovereignty. He's not for the global game plan.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:43.940]  And that's a sin.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.940]  And that is his sin. And they will stop at nothing.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:54.940]  I mean, all honesty, Alex, California is the big enchilada.
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:05.940]  California could be as important to the nomination of Donald Trump as it was to the nomination of Barry Goldwater, the last outsider they nominated for president.
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:09.940]  Is the establishment crazy enough to change some rule and try to cancel that election?
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:13.940]  Well, I would say this. I think California will go forward.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:17.940]  But this is one of the most expensive states in the nation to compete.
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:24.940]  The corporately funded Ted Cruz Super PACs will funnel 25, 30 million in.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:31.940]  He is actively on the ground, but you also see a major push from John Kasich.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:40.940]  Again, I am one disagreeing with Donald Trump, who thinks that is beneficial to have the opposition to Trump split.
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:43.940]  John Kasich has every right to stay in this race.
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:46.940]  He got in the arena. He worked very hard.
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:59.940]  He won some delegates is better than Mitt Romney, who is in the dressing room all made up right now in the bullpen, looking for a way to get in and praying that the party bosses call him at the 11th hour.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:04.940]  Sure, I want to play a clip, though, and then I want to talk about some of those issues.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:13.940]  The dirty trickster, the real dirty trickster, Rick Taylor, who got kicked off the campaign for the stuff he was playing is still on the campaign, obviously.
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:19.940]  He's gone on these programs, CNN, MSNBC, you name it, and basically called for your arrest, called for your indictment.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:26.940]  So what new listeners know, Mr. Stone wasn't just saying that a moment ago, this is really going on. Let's play part of that clip.
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:31.940]  What concerns me is Paul Manafort, of course, was a business partner with Roger Stone.
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:49.940]  And Roger Stone just threatened delegates attending the convention in Cleveland, saying that he would publicize delegates' hotel rooms and hotel room numbers if they felt, if the Trump campaign felt like they were part of stealing delegates from Donald Trump.
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:59.940]  Now, he said that after he called on Trump supporters to come to Cleveland and somehow protest the process if Donald Trump were denied a nomination.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:06.940]  I think that is dangerous. We are a free society in America. We're not a third-world country. We don't threaten violence against delegates.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:15.940]  And I think that Ryan's previous and the RNC should move to ban Roger Stone from the convention because we cannot tolerate threats and threats of violence in the process.
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:19.940]  Additionally, Donald Trump should repudiate those events, his remarks.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:28.940]  And then he goes on another statement to say again, there should be a criminal investigation for intimidation, all the rest of it, and that's in the Washington Post as well.
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:36.940]  Notice he says it's like a third-world country that you'd want to protest to not have the elections canceled or the delegates taken or the popular vote taken.
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:44.940]  The third-world thing is what Cruz is doing. I played it last hour because of the time I'm not going to play it, but did you see all the clips of Cruz?
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:51.940]  Roger running around saying he won the Democratic vote in Colorado and that you won't talk about it and Trump won't.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:57.940]  And Drudge is lying and won't show that he won. I mean, that is a total inversion of reality.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:04.940]  Yeah, there's only one thing that Weiler guy was right about when he said we're a free society and therefore we have the right to peaceful protest.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:11.940]  We have the right to mass in Cleveland. We have the right to find individual delegates and ask them to take the pledge.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:18.940]  That if you were elected as a Trump delegate, you'll stick with Trump on every ballot and you'll stick with Trump on all important questions.
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:27.940]  This is how they intend to hijack this nomination. So it is the foaming of the mouth of the establishment, not us.
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:32.940]  We have said from the beginning that our protest will be peaceful.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:48.940]  Meanwhile, as you know, over at the Trump ballot security project, we continue to collect affidavits from voters in states like Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma and Utah, particularly.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:59.940]  We're prepared to collect affidavits in California or Pennsylvania that prove an inordinate number of irregularities and the pattern of fraud.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:12.940]  Now, the Trump forces may or may not or any individual Trump delegate may or may not choose to challenge the seeding of those delegates based on election fraud.
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:20.940]  This is historically precisely what the Eisenhower people did to Senator Robert Taft in 1952.
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:24.940]  Taft arrived in Chicago with 1237 votes.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:34.940]  The Texas and Louisiana delegates were unseeded based on a case that Eisenhower supporters had not been allowed to vote in the caucuses.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:42.940]  A case that doesn't need to be proven in a court of law because the Republican convention is governed by its own rules and bodies.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:46.940]  So this is a potential real problem for the Cruz campaign.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:58.940]  And if you want to support this important work, you can go to the new website for the Trump security ballot security project, which these guys can supply for you.
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:02.940]  We're going to break and I want to come back and take a few calls, but you sent me a text this morning.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.940]  You were really upset about the fellow Slafly Eagle Forum founder.
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:17.940]  The Cruz people, I guess their operatives in Eagle Forum tried to take it over and she said that she was told because she supports Trump.
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  I mean, this is unprecedented activity of basically espionage.
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:19.940]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:27.940]  It is the mugging of a 90-year-old woman, a conservative icon, somebody there at the birth of the conservative movement.
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:40.940]  It's a hijacking by a gang of goons and as will be proven very shortly, this plot to get Phyllis reaches all the way to the top levels of the Cruz campaign.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:41.940]  Oh my gosh.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.940]  That is huge breaking news.
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:43.940]  Stay there.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:44.940]  Oh my gosh.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:46.940]  Roger Stone, he literally, I'm not kidding.
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:52.940]  This guy, everything he says turns out to be true and everything he says is like the most gold inside baseball stuff.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:58.940]  Stonezone.com, I'm Alex Jones with ImFullWars.com, stay with us back in three minutes with some of your calls.

[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:27.940]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:33.940]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:34.940]  Why do this?
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:38.940]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:39.940]  The answer is simple.
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:43.940]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:49.940]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,

[01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:02.940]  We've got the geopolitical analyst, expert on global banking, and on politics,
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:05.940]  Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us for the balance of the hour.
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.940]  I've got loaded phone lines here, speaking of Jerome.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:11.940]  I've got a Jerome from New York, Ali in Illinois, Chad in Michigan.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:12.940]  I want to go to everybody.
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:18.940]  We've got five minutes now, six minutes, and then five minutes later,
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:25.940]  the next hour, Mr. Stone's got to go, stonezone.com.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:26.940]  Get both his books.
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:30.940]  Get an infowarstore.com and support his work and my work at the same time,
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:32.940]  because we're all in this together.
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:36.940]  There's another story by Wayne Madsen up on infowars.com right now.
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:39.940]  Carl Rove, backing Cruz and Clinton at the same time.
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:42.940]  I mean, the Republicans and Democrats are merging in front of everyone.
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:43.940]  This is crazy.
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:45.940]  Another article on infowars.com.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:50.940]  University bans golf team from using Trump course site social justice.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:54.940]  Catholic University has banned its teams from ever playing on the courses.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.940]  I mean, this is economic warfare, folks.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:00.940]  This is all these foreign interest in groups from the Communist Chinese,
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.940]  the Pope attacking our election process.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:07.940]  This is globalism, American ganged up on being taken over by traders.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.940]  And I just got to tell you, Cruz is now right up there with Hillary Clinton
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:11.940]  as an enemy of the Republic.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:16.940]  I'm sorry, I'll just say it. I don't like doing that.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:20.940]  I don't get a lot of listeners that are into Cruz, not many, but some, and it's sick.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:25.940]  Getting back to Roger Stone, please flush that out for a minute or two that we're going to call, sir.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.940]  I got Dr. Corsi on Skype.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.940]  He's the one, hey, that's my headline for tomorrow.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:30.940]  That's big.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:31.940]  Yeah, we're all over this.
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:34.940]  This is the type of thing that can capture the public's understanding of Cruz,
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.940]  that he, if he's behind his campaign, a takeover, a bank accounts,
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:43.940]  and a patriot organization fellow Schlafly from within, that if it's being investigated,
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:44.940]  I think could be criminal.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:45.940]  She defeated the coup.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:47.940]  Wow, this is amazing.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.940]  Roger Stone, tell us the intel.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:51.940]  I know you can't tell specifics yet because you're working on that.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:54.940]  I mean, you have the facts, but this is going to be a big story.
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:55.940]  Tell us what you know.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:57.940]  Well, I'm just, I want to leave it at this.
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:01.940]  This reaches all the way to the top of the Ted Cruz campaign, and it's not surprising.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:04.940]  We've seen these tactics from the Cruz bots before.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:11.940]  Who can forget the way they planted a story on CNN that Dr. Ben Carson was getting out
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:18.940]  of the race, and then they contacted a pre-identified list of Carson voters, thousands of them,
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:21.940]  and told them CNN just reported Ben Carson's getting out.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:24.940]  Don't throw away your vote, vote for Ted Cruz.
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:27.940]  Now, when they got caught, Ted Cruz reminded me of Dick Nixon.
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:31.940]  He was out there saying, well, I knew nothing about this.
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:33.940]  No, he knew everything about it.
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:40.940]  And the, the robo calls into South Carolina saying Donald Trump supports the gay and lesbian
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:47.940]  agenda and the robo calls into South Carolina telling pro-life voters that Donald Trump
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:50.940]  and his wife supported abortion on demand.
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:52.940]  So he complains about dirty tricks.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:56.940]  He whines about dirty tricks, but he's the master of dirty tricks.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.940]  This is why I call him tricky Ted.
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:01.940]  He's not what he says he is folks.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:07.940]  He is a Bush family retainer, largely responsible for the election of George Bush.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:11.940]  He wrote the legal arguments for Bush v. Gore.
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:17.940]  He recruited John Roberts to that legal team and pushed him for the Supreme Court where
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:19.940]  he approved Obamacare.
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:21.940]  That's the real Ted Cruz.
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:22.940]  All right.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:23.940]  We're public.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:24.940]  Let's go to a call before we go to break.
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:30.940]  Al in Illinois, we're, this is Colorado delegate, vote fraud committee.
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:31.940]  Now you're on the air.
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:33.940]  Quick question or comment from Roger Stone.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:35.940]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:41.940]  Roger Stone, I just wanted to know because of this Colorado incident where they set it
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:42.940]  up.
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:46.940]  So it's rigged with no voters allowed.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:48.940]  How many more states are coming up?
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:53.940]  And then I also have a YouTube video that most people have not caught onto, but it does
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:56.940]  have a ton of YouTube videos.
[01:57:56.940 --> 01:58:01.940]  The name of the YouTube video, if you want to search on YouTube is Colorado Trump delegate
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:03.940]  removed and replaced.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:05.940]  And he basically goes on record.
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:09.940]  He does a Facebook mention mentions in his video or YouTube video.
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:11.940]  I'm not really sure how he did it.
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:15.940]  But he's basically saying that he waited in line for hours to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:16.940]  Yes.
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:17.940]  Yes.
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:18.940]  I've seen the video.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:19.940]  We should do a story on it.
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:20.940]  They had thousands of these calls.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:24.940]  They take the real delegates, replace them with operatives, powerful info.
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:25.940]  Roger, that's what you're talking about.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:26.940]  This is crazy.
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:27.940]  Yeah.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:33.940]  This is part and parcel of the kind of Gestapo tactics that Paul Manafort spoke about on
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940]  Meet the Press.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:37.940]  What they're doing to finish Laughley.
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:38.940]  Another example.
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:39.940]  It's incredible.
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:40.940]  Stay there.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:41.940]  I mean, imagine what you do as president.
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:42.940]  This is unbelievable.
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:43.940]  70 seconds.
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:44.940]  We're back.
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:45.940]  Take a few more calls.
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.940]  Thank you, Ellen Illinois.
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:47.940]  I'm Alex Jones, folks.
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:48.940]  Spread the word in FullWars.com.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:49.940]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:50.940]  I'm good, brother.
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:55.940]  I started using your products, everything you said and it sounds correct, I and my wife
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:59.940]  both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:00.940]  Well thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.940]  But doing that I know I'm going to have the highest quality.
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:09.640]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.940]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:14.860]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:15.940]  Big change is a lot of energy.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:19.940]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shot, saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:47.780]  money there.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:53.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:03.940]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:21.940]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:25.940]  Man, I tell you, it is such an epic time to be alive. It is so incredible.
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:29.940]  And I knew I was right to get behind Trump like eight months ago.
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:34.940]  But now, I mean, I'm sure he's the guy. Absolutely sure. Wow.
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:38.940]  Boy, the system is shooting its wad trying to block him.
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.940]  So anyway, you cut it as long as we're politically involved.
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:42.940]  This is a win. Roger Stones with us. Five more minutes.
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.940]  We're taking phone calls. Crystal in North Carolina.
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:48.940]  You're on the air with Roger Stone. Go ahead.
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:53.940]  Hey, Roger. Hey, Alex. I had a question for you guys.
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:58.940]  What about these supporters who cannot make it out to the convention?
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:02.940]  What can we do here at home to help support you guys out in the field?
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:06.940]  Tell everybody else to go there, donate money, be involved,
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:09.940]  call and talk radio, send out our news articles. Just get aggressive
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.940]  because you're being robbed. You're being attacked.
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:15.940]  It's like a mugger's attacking you. You got to get pissed and just engage
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:18.940]  and run their butt over. I'm sorry. Roger, go ahead.
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:22.940]  Look, if you can't make it to Cleveland, that's fine.
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:27.940]  Send us 10 bucks. Send us $25, $35, 50, whatever you can afford.
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:32.940]  I want to run buses, air-conditioned buses from major centers
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:35.940]  across the country, certainly across the Midwest.
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:38.940]  The more money we raise, the more buses we can get.
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:41.940]  People need some place to bunk. We're looking for low-cost housing.
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:44.940]  This is a war. This is a war. It costs money.
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:47.940]  Commit or lose everything. They're going to rob you of everything, folks,
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:49.940]  unless you commit.
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:54.940]  We want to buy internet ads telling people where they need to be.
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:59.940]  We want to build the largest outdoor rally in Cleveland history.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.940]  And notice how scared the mainstream media is.
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:04.940]  They know there's millions of Trump supporters in that area.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:06.940]  They are scared.
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:11.940]  The response from the local Trump supporters in northeastern Ohio has been amazing,
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.940]  but I know people who are coming all the way from Florida.
[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:16.940]  I know people who are coming all the way from Utah.
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:18.940]  This is going to be the place to be.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:21.940]  We've invited Pat Buchanan to speak.
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:26.940]  We will invite Ron Paul at least to speak about the question of the tactics of the steal.
[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:33.940]  He's not a Trump supporter, but he has been a victim of this same kind of establishment.
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:35.940]  I love Ron Paul, but he should speak out against the theft,
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:37.940]  because it happened to him. This is even better, though.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.940]  And as you know, Trump has called for the audit of the Fed,
[02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:44.940]  which I think libertarian voters need to recognize that, unfortunately,
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:49.940]  Ted Cruz missed that vote because his puppet masters wouldn't let him vote for it.
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:52.940]  They liked the Fed just as it is.
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:54.940]  Let's take another call.
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:57.940]  Let's go ahead and go to Eve in Texas.
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.940]  Eve here on the air. Real quick question. Thank you.
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:03.940]  Hello, Alex and Roger. I have a question to both of you.
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:08.940]  If Donald Trump, and I am a Trump supporter, if Donald Trump is not the nominee,
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:14.940]  and they decide to go with Ted Cruz, and if Ted Cruz wins the presidency,
[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:20.940]  do you all think that they will choose Jeb Bush to run as VP,
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:23.940]  and then we would have a short-term presidency?
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:29.940]  I think that Jeb gave a very interesting review to Politico just before he dropped out of the race,
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:36.940]  in which he mused that he could actually get nominated without winning a certain primary state.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:39.940]  In other words, he blurted out the truth.
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:43.940]  This is why I'm asking people to read Jeb and the Bush crime family.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:48.940]  Remember when Neil Bush was moved into a crucial position in Ted Cruz's campaign?
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:54.940]  Neil Bush being George W. Bush's brother, a man who's defrauding of an SNL,
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:59.940]  cost U.S. taxpayers $1.5 billion.
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:03.940]  But because he's a child of privilege and a member of the Bush crime family,
[02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:05.940]  he spent not a day in jail.
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:08.940]  Sure. Also in closing, Roger, what about Paul Ryan?
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:10.940]  They admit he is getting ready to run.
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:15.940]  When he says he's not, it means he is meeting with donors, having secret meetings.
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:17.940]  He's shooting up.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:19.940]  I think that there's no question.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:23.940]  He's going about this the same way he went about his campaign to be speaker.
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:27.940]  By first acting like Caesar and saying, I don't want it, I'm not interested.
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:31.940]  Obviously, he would take it if it were available.
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:34.940]  Mitt Romney is irked that he didn't run.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:40.940]  Remember, he didn't run this year because he was convinced that Jeb's nomination was inevitable.
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:43.940]  Roger, incredible info. Thanks for all the breaking news.
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:45.940]  Thanks for your courage.
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:48.940]  Trumpballotsecurity.org, stopthesteel.org.
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.940]  Please stay in contact. Thank you for your daily updates.
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:51.940]  Thank you for sending me. God bless you.
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:54.940]  He's talking to my writers. The guy's working so hard, folks.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:56.940]  Thank you so much. You're a tiger. God bless you.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:58.940]  We'll be back with your room coursing.
[02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:05.940]  Lawmakers are calling on the White House to declassify more than two dozen pages in the 9-11 commission report
[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:09.940]  that they say outlines evidence for possible support from the Saudi government
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:12.940]  for two hijackers who settled in Southern California.
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:18.940]  A CBS News 60-minute report quoted officials familiar with the 2003 report
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:22.940]  as saying that 28 pages of redacted information raises questions
[02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:29.940]  over whether Saudi officials were involved in assisting two hijackers upon their arrival in Los Angeles in January 2000.
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:35.940]  Former Democratic congressman and U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Romer told 60 Minutes
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:41.940]  the two Saudi nationals found a way to gain access to housing and flight lessons upon their arrival
[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:46.940]  despite extremely limited language skills and no experience with Western culture.
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:52.940]  Also, former U.S. Senator Bob Kerry, who has read the redacted pages, believes that they should be declassified.

[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:28.940]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:34.940]  to extract the ultra-pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:40.940]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield,
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:50.940]  Nathan Iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:08:17.940]  It is exclusive to infowarsleif.com and the infowarsleif family of incredible products.
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:30.940]  Well, I gotta say it, I ignored the Bush pedigree, the TPP connections, the CFR connections, the Goldman Sachs connections.
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:38.940]  Because I know people that have come out of Goldman Sachs like Nomi Primms that expose them. I know people that have been in the CFR like Steve Puchenek who resigned from it.
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:43.940]  I mean, just because you've been in the establishment doesn't mean you're bad overall.
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:55.940]  But Ted Cruz, who I really liked in the Senate and work he did on these very eloquent, smart guy, he's flipped a switch the last few months where, I mean, it's like Bill Clinton's up there on steroids.
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:03.940]  He's worse than Obama or Hillary. I mean, he goes, I played the clips in the first hour. He said, it's a democracy.
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:17.940]  He won the vote in Colorado and Matt Drudge is operative as the quote of Trump and gets his orders from Roger Stone.
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:27.940]  A lot to know from fact, Stone and him aren't even talking. I mean, it's a story when the Republicans start canceling state elections and just have the super delegates ignore the delegates.
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:31.940]  The delegates are coming out saying that they were for Trump and then they were just switched out. Then they had a vote of that.
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:36.940]  This is the suspension of our election. And they're doing to Bernie Sanders too.
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:46.940]  But Trump's way ahead of Sanders in his lead. His leads much bigger over Cruz than Sanders over Hillary, but they're stealing it there too.
[02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:52.940]  Both parties are openly merging against the populist movement.
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:10:05.940]  And then I played the clip of Cruz on the radio going, yeah, it's crazy. Drudge just does all this horrible stuff. And when I win states like Colorado, he won't even report that I won the votes.
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:11.940]  And Drudge reported that there weren't votes and said no election, no voters needed.
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:19.940]  So we've hit a new level. Obama says two plus two equals five. He says, you didn't build your business.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:24.940]  And I thought that was the top, that Obamacare is free and then you can keep your doctor.
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:34.940]  I thought it couldn't go any further. And Ted Cruz is like unclote and it's weird when you've liked somebody before because I never liked Bill Clinton or Hillary.
[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:37.940]  I always disliked him. So now I'm just reviled him.
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:43.940]  But it's weird that I actually hope Ted Cruz was real. We interviewed him. He was running for Senate in Texas.
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:50.940]  It might he was, you know, a guy from Canada or whatever. At least he claimed he was conservative. I tried to ignore the Bush connections.
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:58.940]  And man, I feel like I got chumped. And it's a weird creepy feeling now. I'm like scared of Ted Cruz.
[02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:04.940]  Not like, oh, I'm freezing to get me. I'm like scared for the country. I'm, I feel really betrayed. I feel really dirty.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:11.940]  I feel like a failure. I've never felt like this because I've never supported somebody that turned out to be pure evil.
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:15.940]  I've seen folks make mistakes or not be perfect. I'm completely freaked out right now.
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:20.940]  And we got open world government being announced. The socialist communist pope telling us what to do.
[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:26.940]  Catholic churches saying, you know, in school saying you can't be on Trump golf courses.
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:30.940]  Drudge being demonized. Phyllis Schlafly, he broke it. It's now all over mainstream news.
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:41.940]  WorldNet Daily, WND.com, Dr. Jerome Corsi broke the news. Phyllis Schlafly, my board plotted to fire me over Trump, tried to take the bank accounts,
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:47.940]  tried to vote with a coup d'etat, even though the rules, the corporation said they couldn't.
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:50.940]  And she stopped them. The bank stopped them. And they said, no, this is improper.
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:57.940]  And now you heard the stone and stone wouldn't say this. Everything that guy said has turned out to be accurate.
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:02.940]  I read him 10 years ago on JFK book. He was right and didn't realize how big a political he was.
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:06.940]  I knew he had been, but I tell you, he says it's coming out soon.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:09.940]  He told us a little bit more, but I'm not allowed to talk about it.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:18.940]  That specifically this is from the campaign that they were running the attempted takeover of the oldest true conservative organization in America
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:26.940]  that is the proto-progenitor of the libertarian Tea Party Republican movement that both the Democrat and Republican establishment hate.
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:35.940]  Now, we've got Dr. Jerome Corsi, who is really known for banking and business and hostage negotiations.
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:39.940]  He's also better known by the public, but that's what he really does.
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:46.940]  For what, two, three, four of them, number one, New York Times bestselling books that have game changed two elections at least.
[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:56.940]  And he joins us until 45 after them and head other news. And then we've got a guest host coming on to host things. David Knight in the fourth hour today.
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:18.940]  JeromeCorsiWND.com, twitter.com forward slash Jerome underscore Corsi, PhD from Harvard University, political science 72, currently senior staff reporter, worldnetdaily.com where he works as an investigative reporter.
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:27.940]  Well, 25 years beginning in 81, of course, he developed and worked with banks throughout the United States and around the world to develop financial services, marketing companies that assist banks and establishing broker dealers
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:33.940]  and insurance subsidiaries to provide financial planning products and services to their retail customers. That's why he knows Donald Trump for 40 plus years.
[02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:38.940]  He is a noted financial services speaker. That's where he's the big rock star, folks, is banking and what's happening.
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:49.940]  He published three books and numerous articles and professional financial services journals and magazines. And he's the guy that last time connected the dots where all these other insiders had told me years ago, no, Trump's a patriot.
[02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:55.940]  He knows what's going on. He's a nationalist. What do you think of Donald Trump? And I'm just like Donald Trump, you know, the real estate guy.
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:14:01.940]  And he told us last time, no, Trump knows as much as we do or more, Alex, he's a patriot, a nationalist. It's why they hate him.
[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:08.940]  And clearly they do. This isn't some shell-op to make us think they hate him so we go for him. They're stealing it openly.
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:18.940]  So do we start with Shafiq? Phyllis Lapley, an eagle form? Do we start with the big steal? Do we start with the IMF admitting the world's going into a depression?
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:24.940]  I mean, there's so many time bombs here. The Russians pulled out. Saudi Arabia and the Jihadis attacked again.
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:33.940]  Well, the Russians have had to go back in because Aleppo has got 100,000 ISIS people attacking it. I mean, the world is teetering on the edge in my view.
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:44.940]  Dr. Corsi, what do you want to tackle first? I mean, there's just so much. Am I right in saying that we've probably never been in a point in modern times more dangerous on so many fronts?
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:46.940]  I mean, what would you call the state of the world right now?
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:54.940]  I agree with entirely, Alex. I mean, this is a precarious state entirely, not just in politics, but in economics.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:15:10.940]  The world is closer, I think, to a combination of a new depression, which will make the last depression in the 30s look like a picnic, and a new world war, which will make the last world war look like a picnic.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:19.940]  I mean, we're at the collapse of the financial systems. This mountain of debt on social welfare cannot sustain. It's going to collapse. It's starting to collapse in Europe.
[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:30.940]  European banks are going to negative interest rates. The European Union is stretched beyond being efficient. The European Union is breaking apart with refugees.
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:43.940]  It's a complete shambles in terms of the dream of a united Europe. I think in the Middle East, we're closer to war, nuclear war than we've ever been.
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:51.940]  I now envision nuclear war, including in the next 20 years within the Middle East, starting a regional nuclear war.
[02:15:51.940 --> 02:16:05.940]  I think Iran is pushing towards a nuclear weapon. I would not be surprised to see Israel calculating a preemptive attack on Iran, perhaps even before the election.
[02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:17.940]  I mean, this is, I think, the most critical time in world history, and we're on the verge of a major financial collapse and a World War III event.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:23.940]  And the globalists will be happy. I mean, you know, kill five or six billion people. They're not going to miss them. That's the problem.
[02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:32.940]  I've been interviewing you for probably 14 years, and you've never talked like this, this grave, and other even mainline analysts are saying, hit the panic button.
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:40.940]  And then the politicians, not just here, but all over the Western world, act like they don't care, bringing five million, mainly jihadis, put sleeper cells in,
[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:47.940]  fly them in and don't check their IDs. Donald Trump says we should stop this till we check them. There's a war on common sense. What's happening?
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:53.940]  Because I always thought the leftists were run by big, you know, combines, which they are, and that they didn't believe their ideology.
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:58.940]  That it was just a way to hamstring young people and turn them into jellyfish and dependence.
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:07.940]  But now I go back to what you would say 14 years ago or others. No, Alex, they really believe it. They really want to take over and screw everything up to build their utopia.
[02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:18.940]  And so now I realize we really have power mad pseudo communist run by weirdo war criminals like George Soros going completely insane.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:29.940]  I mean, it's crazy. I don't think they even know what they're doing now. They just hate freedom, hate free market, hate Christians, hate America and just want to screw everything up.
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:31.940]  I mean, what do we do?
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:40.940]  Well, I mean, the left and the right, I think we're right back to where we were in the 1930s that the communists want to have state control.
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:48.940]  They want to have state control of all private property, but they want social welfare system. They want a totalitarian government.
[02:17:48.940 --> 02:18:00.940]  I've said for the beginning that the Nazis, which in a sense I think we've adopted the fascist ideology, we've become state controlled business, but also with a strong social welfare system.
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:11.940]  You make a mistake to think that the left and the right don't agree on government spending. Paul Ryan would be happy to spend the United States into oblivion.
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:16.940]  He's not going to stop spending in social welfare. It doesn't want small government.
[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:31.940]  And we're seeing the difference I think for the 30s is in the 30s, the United States was a more of a capitalist country. We had more individual freedom and we still had a God fearing society.
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:33.940]  We were less domesticated.
[02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:49.940]  And today that's gone. We've lost a lot of the religious basis of America. This is what's so tragic about Phyllis Schillathley. And the political parties are acting as if they're completely an elite who have the right to control everything.
[02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:59.940]  I mean, the GOP and the Democrats alike are saying, you know, this would be a good party, a good political party, the GOP or the Democratic Party, except for the voters.
[02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:02.940]  That's why they can't stand voters.
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:09.940]  Do they really believe their spin that they count and voters don't and they're really drinking their own Kool-Aid because are we seeing true megalomania here, Dr. Corsi?
[02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:14.940]  Yes, they really believe it. They believe that they know the best for everybody.
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:31.940]  Carol Rove and Paul Ryan and the few who are making millions in Washington, you know, the gravy train of the consultants and all the special interests, don't want to give up their power, don't want to give up their money either in the GOP or in the Democratic Party.
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:39.940]  There's a fundamental agreement in Washington. Keep the power in Washington and the rest of the country forget it. Put them on welfare.
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:44.940]  If they're not useful, they can be eliminated in the next global war. It doesn't matter.
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:51.940]  90 million people in the United States that the economy doesn't need any more to work. What are you going to do with these 90 million?
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:58.940]  What if one of the 90 million gets to be 120 million? You know, do you think the GOP or the Democrats have a plan for that? No, they don't.
[02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:09.940]  They need a way to deal with the baby boomers and you show your sophistication as a top financial analyst for the biggest corporations out there and a guy that's worked in all sorts of, you know, highest level ops.
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:14.940]  The elite literally look at it like a ballot sheet and look at all these excess people and want to get rid of them.
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:20.940]  And that's why they're pushing war, famine and globalism. That's a Gen 21 that you've written books on, been in films on.
[02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:31.940]  This is really where they flipped out and believe collapse and austerity and war is going to cleanse the earth. And it's really just an excuse for them to have total power and control.
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:37.940]  Right. Well, the globalists never want to eliminate themselves. I mean, that's always the irony of it, but everybody else is worthless to them.
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:42.940]  There's no fundamental respect for human life or human beings.
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:51.940]  And, you know, you're seeing right now in the Republican Party, Ted Cruz someday is going to wake up and realize he's just being used.
[02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:57.940]  Carl Rowe, they have no intention, the GOP establishment of allowing Ted Cruz to be the candidate.
[02:20:57.940 --> 02:21:00.940]  They've got Ryan and Kasich and all of them shooting up.
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:08.940]  Jeff Bush, the whole bunch of them. I mean, though, they're likely to pick a Jeb Bush, Ryan or, you know, run Mitt Romney and Ryan again.
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:14.940]  They don't really care. The GOP does not mind losing the presidency to Hillary Clinton.
[02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:19.940]  I said this repeatedly. They're happy with the Clinton presidency. They're happy with an Obama.
[02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:21.940]  We can't survive that.
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:30.940]  Well, it's a nice pack because everybody, you know, remains fat and happy in Washington and the people get told in election what they want to hear.
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:35.940]  Tea Party sends conservatives, they think, to Washington.
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:42.940]  Well, Hillary go for it all. I mean, that's what the criminology shows. If she gets in, people think she's dangerous now. My God.
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:49.940]  Oh, I mean, the Clintons are going to take the Clinton Foundation scam to, you know, to the billion dollar level.
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:54.940]  They've already had the hundreds of millions. Now they're going to start selling government favors for billions of dollars.
[02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:59.940]  I mean, we might as well become like Argentina. We're going to become a banana republic.
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:02.940]  Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and the elite will get rich.
[02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:06.940]  They'll fly around their jet airplanes. They'll go to their Lolita Islands.
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:10.940]  They'll have all their sex affairs. They'll have all the drugs they want.
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:17.940]  And everybody else will be losing their pension money, struggling desperately to work, not able to afford a house.
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:25.940]  And here's the problem, though. They think the military and the police don't know now they're actually woken up big time and aren't going to go along with this.
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:28.940]  Well, they fly around and jet set while we kill each other in the streets.
[02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:34.940]  Well, and the problem is to look at the border. The border patrol is already saying this is insane.
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:40.940]  The border patrol is not being permitted to do their job. And, you know, the economic structure is not going to support this.
[02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:53.940]  We're already at the point where the social welfare systems, the debt levels in the United States and in Europe and around the world are at such extreme levels that these debt-written societies are going to collapse.
[02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:58.940]  Dr. Corsi, I want, when we come back from break, to really focus in on the economy, the IMF.
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:01.940]  They're all saying what you said five years ago, a month ago.
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:04.940]  We're now approaching the big event that Ron Paul and you have talked about.
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:10.940]  But shifting gears into fellow Schlappley to kind of show up a zoomed-in micro of what's happening.
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:15.940]  You heard Stone earlier. In my experience, he doesn't make stuff up. It just keeps coming true.
[02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:21.940]  He says he has the sources. It's confirmed to the highest levels that they attempted to take our organization over.
[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:29.940]  That is very influential, very powerful, very successful, with a huge list and a bunch of money and to flip it into cruise.
[02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:35.940]  If he has the goods and this comes out, this could be devastating, mugging an old lady.
[02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:40.940]  Well, I'll be working on this all afternoon. It'll be my lead story tomorrow.
[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:47.940]  I'm going to start off with what Roger Stone just said on your program, that it's orchestrated at the highest levels of the cruise campaign.
[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:55.940]  I mean, there's literally millions of dollars. I'm not even sure how much in the endowments of ego forum that this renegade group,
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:24:04.940]  all of which have pledged to cruise. Every one of these six women who are in the renegade board group,
[02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:11.940]  have pledged their support to cruise. They can control ego forum and depose Schlappley.
[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:19.940]  They can change the mission of the society. They can grab all the money that's there and they're not going to succeed.
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:25.940]  Isn't this a bellwether of the thuggery, the spirit of theft going on? I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:30.940]  Well, you're exactly right. I mean, it's appalling to me.
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:34.940]  I mean, here is a woman who is one of the most respected conservatives in America.
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:42.940]  Well, I've known for decades and was fundamentally fought to preserve the values of family,
[02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:48.940]  God, religion, and our culture, to have conservative values, small government,
[02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:51.940]  and she has brought these women into politics.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:53.940]  She's a real feminist.
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:58.940]  Yes, she truly is because she has always championed women,
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:04.940]  but championed women with dignity and respect and honoring the woman's ability to procreate,
[02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:10.940]  bring children into the world. These are fundamental values that Phyllis has elevated.
[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:15.940]  These women were brought into would be nothing if it hadn't been for Phyllis Schlappley.
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:21.940]  And now even one of them, her daughter, is in this group trying to take over the organization.
[02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:28.940]  You know, I quoted yesterday, Kathy Adams gave this interview with the Dallas Morning News.
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:33.940]  She's one of the six board members trying to take over Phyllis Schlappley's organization.
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:38.940]  And basically said that Phyllis supporting Trump was senile.
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:40.940]  She'd been manipulated.
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:48.940]  I mean, it was an absolutely appalling interview for a woman to whom Kathy Adams for 23 years
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:51.940]  has been head of Eagle Forum, I believe in California.
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:54.940]  And here she's turned on Phyllis.
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:59.940]  I mean, it's disgraceful. Phyllis will not roll over and let this happen.
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:02.940]  She's a constitutional lawyer of the highest order.
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:04.940]  She's got a great group behind her.
[02:26:04.940 --> 02:26:07.940]  I think there should be a serious investigation of this.
[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:08.940]  Well, I think there should too.
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:16.940]  And I think, you know, again, it's what price people are paying to back Trump, even within the GOP.
[02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:20.940]  You know, anybody who's backing Trump is going to get turned on.
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:21.940]  Certainly the actor.
[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:23.940]  Buddy, I've never had the pressure I've got on me right now.
[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:24.940]  It's it's bad.
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:29.940]  I mean, they are going to come after anybody who supports Trump to destroy you in the process
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:35.940]  or me in the process of, you know, WND and Joseph Farah and everything else to try to,
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:39.940]  you know, promote Cruz, not so Cruz will win.
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:45.940]  And this is where the Cruz supporters have to understand they're being used as dupes.
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:49.940]  The Republican leadership is in the news admitting that they're going to not have Cruz.
[02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:50.940]  Right.
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:53.940]  And the rules of the Republican convention are not going to be fair.
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:27:01.940]  I think, you know, Roger Stone is saying with votes being stolen, how can you basically have a primary
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:04.940]  in a state like Colorado and no one votes?
[02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:08.940]  The GOP is saying it's being great party except for the voters.
[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:10.940]  We really don't need the voters.
[02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:16.940]  There are nuisance and Ted Cruz who should have said, I don't want to win this way.
[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:18.940]  That would have been the honorable thing.
[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:24.940]  He's so desperate to get what 30 some have you heard the clips where he goes and says,
[02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:25.940]  I got the vote.
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:30.940]  It's a democracy and Drudge won't say that I won Colorado.
[02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:31.940]  Drudge is lying.
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:33.940]  Well, that's inverted reality.
[02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:34.940]  That's like crazy town.
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:40.940]  And you're seeing now the Ted Cruz, who is the establishment Ted Cruz, who was a product
[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:45.940]  who was aspiring to be a bushy, wanted to be an insider.
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:49.940]  He wasn't insider for years working federal trade commission.
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:54.940]  He wasn't liked enough to be given a post as prestigious as his wife had in the White House.
[02:27:54.940 --> 02:28:01.940]  And when Carl Rove would not give Ted Cruz the blessing to be a nominee for the party,
[02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:06.940]  that's when Ted Cruz decided he was going to become an evangelist and embrace the Tea Party.
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:09.940]  And it's all been fundamentally a lie.
[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:13.940]  It isn't, you know, he was for the, I pointed this out.
[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:18.940]  He came down to Texas to get his big hat and his cowboy boots and went from being an establishment
[02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:20.940]  guy to I'm the evangelist.
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:21.940]  I'm the greatest patriot ever.
[02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:23.940]  And now he's going back to what he really was.
[02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:24.940]  Right.
[02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:26.940]  And this is this all was an act.
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:29.940]  That's the problem is all an act.
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:33.940]  He fundamentally supported the Trans Pacific partnership,
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:39.940]  wrote with Ryan an article on, you know, in the Wall Street Journal to give it the fast track authority.
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:41.940]  Whereas Trump has never been phony.
[02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:45.940]  He's a nationalist right wing in some areas, liberal in others, but he's real.
[02:28:45.940 --> 02:28:47.940]  And that's why they're scared.
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:50.940]  Well, and Trump is going to have a fundamental voter realignment.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:55.940]  You're going to find the people from the Democratic Party who are equally tired of being lied to.
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:29:03.940]  I mean, how many years are the African Americans going to vote for Democrats who you abuse the African Americans,
[02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:08.940]  destroy their families, reduce their economic value the same way with Hispanics.
[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:10.940]  Democratic Party is going to exploit everybody's votes.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:17.940]  And finally, you're going to see a big crossover of workers across America wanting to preserve.
[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:18.940]  That's already happening.
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:20.940]  He's got double the black votes.
[02:29:20.940 --> 02:29:24.940]  All these Reagan Democrats are coming over blue collar, but they keep saying you can't meet Hillary,
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:26.940]  but the polls show he will.
[02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:27.940]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:31.940]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, WND.com, senior staff writer, investigative journalist,
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:35.940]  Patri, we're going to come back, get more into this, more into what he says is coming up.
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:37.940]  And then really, how bad is the economy?
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:39.940]  What's the next big trigger?
[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:43.940]  Because we're sitting on top of volcano and it's rumbling.
[02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:45.940]  There's rock and gravel coming down the side of it.
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:47.940]  It's smoking.
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:49.940]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:51.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:58.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:25.940]  From the company that is sending shock waves around the globe,
[02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:28.940]  agents have open shell companies to conceal their activities.
[02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:32.940]  Among them are close intermediaries of the CIA, the newspaper reported.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:35.940]  The report from Yahoo News states that,
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:37.940]  the Munich based newspapers said,
[02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:43.660]  His clients included several players in the 1980s Iran Contra scandal, which saw senior
[02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:49.300]  U.S. officials facilitate arms sales to Iran in a bid to secure the release of American
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:52.940]  hostages and fund Nicaragua's Contra Rebels.
[02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:56.940]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:31:02.580]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:07.660]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:10.940]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:16.220]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:18.740]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:13.500]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[02:32:13.500 --> 02:32:15.100]  at infowarshore.com.

[02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:23.060]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:28.300]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of about $50.
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:32.380]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:34.180]  the products that you need each month.

[02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:48.620]  this is a sure win.
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:50.180]  10% off on auto-ship.
[02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:54.580]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:32:54.580 --> 02:33:12.900]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:27.860]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:32.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are times in history when more happens in a couple years than that
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:34.540]  when the previous 50 or even 100.
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:39.300]  It's not just me saying that now, it's mainline historians, political analysts, anthropologists,
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:47.940]  sociologists, top PhD psychologists, folks like Dr. Corsi, and there's got doctorates
[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:53.020]  on the economy, you name it, from Harvard, it's happening.
[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:57.460]  And the elite are almost more corrupt now because they know it's collapsing, so they're
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:34:04.300]  just scrambling to loot whatever they can, which makes the collapse that's coming be
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:05.300]  even more dangerous.
[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:10.380]  They go to him in a moment, finish up with the politics and get into the economy with
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:16.540]  Dr. Corsi, but understand something, I don't get up here and talk about scary things because
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:19.580]  who were fear porn like the New York Times says.
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:23.420]  I've studied history and let me tell you, I am really concerned.
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:25.460]  I know I'm right.
[02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:29.820]  I said two months ago, they're going to start canceling caucuses altogether and put articles
[02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:33.620]  out and people said, oh, you're full of it when I had the Republicans leadership saying
[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:36.220]  they were looking at it.
[02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:40.940]  Now Ted Cruz and other people have a talking point where they won't even talk about the
[02:34:40.940 --> 02:34:45.900]  fact that it was new superdelegates that did this in Colorado and other states.
[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:50.220]  So again, it's just a total con game where they don't even recognize what's going on,
[02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:54.700]  kind of like Gibbs famously said, I was told, you know, don't admit there's a drone program
[02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:58.300]  even though it existed publicly for years, it's like saying, don't admit Times Square
[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:03.300]  existed in New York or Central Park, you're like, but it's right there.
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:05.020]  Don't admit that the Atlantic Ocean is there.
[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:07.060]  Like don't admit death panels are in Obamacare.
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:11.060]  Don't admit there's a don't treat list of the VA, but it's right there.
[02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:17.620]  28 pages, Saudi involvement, criminal elements, the government standing down, I'm vindicated.
[02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:18.620]  I'm not vindicated.
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:23.380]  The FBI said that at the time, the media then spun what I said about 9 11 to fantastical
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:27.740]  space beams and stuff that their own operatives put out to discredit it.
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:30.060]  They said I said the firemen blew up the towers.
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.060]  No, I didn't.
[02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:35.460]  It was the firemen, the police that exposed what happened wasn't our government did it,
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:39.540]  but criminal elements that news Saudi Arabia was running and that's now in 60 minutes
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:40.540]  last Sunday.
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:42.900]  See, see, the truth will always come out.
[02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:49.060]  We're going back to Dr. Corsi in a moment, wnd.com to find his books, his writings, his
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:50.060]  information.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:51.060]  WND.com.
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:55.580]  Also, we've got Hillary for present t shirts that everybody should be wearing because
[02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:59.740]  they're trying to censor people trying to say you can't criticize Hillary until comedy
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:04.020]  places, you know, with their actual campaign threatening them, don't criticize her.
[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:07.420]  We've got to criticize her and call for the FBI to call for indictment.
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:10.100]  We have a new limited edition shirt very similar to the last one.
[02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:15.900]  Hillary for present 2016 to the end of time on the back, legalizefreedominfowars.com and
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:18.200]  your purchase makes it all possible here.
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:23.340]  We have our flagship product that's at 175 studies behind it on knowing for regrowing
[02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:28.700]  nerves and what it does to the mitochondrial DNA, just the bio PQQ alone in it.
[02:36:28.700 --> 02:36:34.780]  DNA force is the best interstitial we could come up with and it's just simply amazing.
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:39.100]  Supermell, vitality, lung cleanse, the other products are just the very best concentrated

[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:45.100]  possible.
[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:48.380]  So many of the products that were out of stock are back in stock like brain force.
[02:36:48.380 --> 02:36:50.700]  It's a true new tropic.
[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:55.180]  Read the reviews, check out the products from liver shield to deep cleanse to the different
[02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:57.500]  parasite cleanse products we have.
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:01.460]  These are the very best interstitials when I go to the top labs in the country and say
[02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:07.220]  I want the magic product that your top scientists would want because most people in interstitials
[02:37:07.220 --> 02:37:11.380]  put out some decent stuff but cheap stuff, have a lot of pills in the bottle so you think
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:15.320]  you're getting a good deal, put a bunch of marketing into it and there's $3 a product
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.820]  in it and it's $30.
[02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:21.740]  If we're selling something for $30, there's like $18 a product in it, nobody we know of
[02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:23.540]  does this.
[02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:31.020]  These are the very best products, infowarslife.com, infowarshore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:35.500]  We have free shipping on all orders, $50 and up and 10% off for everybody that signs up

[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:47.780]  Okay, going back to Dr. Corsi of WND.com, Dr. Corsi, finishing up with the election, what
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:52.900]  you expect to happen and where this is going, do you think the establishment has miscalculated
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:55.260]  the convention, is it showing they're hubris?
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:38:00.260]  Do they realize how upset people are and where do you think all this is going?
[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:07.940]  Well, I think the establishment has clearly miscalculated, GOP leaders are in fantasy
[02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:14.340]  land thinking that they can rig the delegates so that they can throw the convention into
[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:15.340]  chaos.
[02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:20.260]  The American people know the difference, the American people want voting in Colorado.
[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:29.180]  We have a primary without voting, by the time we get to that point, the absurdity, the complete
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:36.020]  moral hollowness, the duplicity of the mainstream media is so obvious, of course, Drudge is
[02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:41.260]  pounding it and Drudge and you and Alex, we're all trying to get to this point of saying
[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:46.460]  this is ridiculous, this is not democracy, this is an elite rigging and stealing.
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:52.820]  And then Cruz in the media, Fox News, I watched this morning, acted like that Trump was crazy,
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:56.260]  but they just showed him saying it's rigged and then wouldn't say it was rigged.
[02:38:56.260 --> 02:39:00.020]  They go, hey, Trump, why are you mad, the voters have spoken, I've never seen Fox lie
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:01.020]  like that.
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:06.900]  Well, Fox is also anti-Trump, they're also, you know, supporting Megan Kelly who Trump
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:13.700]  is exposed, Trump has really made it clear that, you know, Fox is increasingly part
[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:18.580]  of the establishment, look at how many Democratic analysts they have on Fox anymore, compared
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:20.180]  to what they had 10 years ago.
[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:25.540]  I mean, the point is, I think the American people are tired of this, and I think Donald
[02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:30.380]  Trump is the real deal, I've known Donald Trump for years, Donald Trump takes his own
[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:37.420]  advice, he has his own thinking, he is truly someone who can negotiate and will be tough,
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:42.500]  the establishment is afraid of him because he won't follow their rules.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:47.100]  They know Ted Cruz will, you know, they put a biscuit in front of Ted Cruz, they stand,
[02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:51.420]  you know, put, get your hind legs, you know, put your paws up and bark, and Ted Cruz can't
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:52.420]  be to do it.
[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:58.620]  He's doing it right now, I mean, you know, for the idea that he's going to gain 30 delegates
[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:01.140]  in Colorado, he'll sell his soul.
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:07.740]  He has no more chance of winning, you know, the GOP nomination than Herbert Hoover does.
[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:12.980]  What do you make of all his operatives going on shows and saying, arrest Roger Stone and
[02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:14.820]  don't let people demonstrate in Cleveland?
[02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:18.060]  I mean, did I wake up in Romania under Chalcescu?
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:23.980]  Well, you know, the operatives, this is one of the other problems in the Cruz campaign.
[02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:30.140]  His operatives, including Rick Tyler, who you had on, was discredited and fired.
[02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:35.340]  These are the kinds of dirty tricks the Cruz campaign has played, and if it's such an honest
[02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:43.700]  and tea party and, you know, for the people, populist campaign, why are there so many operatives
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:49.140]  in it that will, you know, do what they did to Ben Carson and continue to do it in Colorado?
[02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:53.260]  There's no, Ted Cruz should have said, I'm ashamed of what happened in Colorado, I won't
[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:58.300]  take any of those delegates, you know, vote, and then we'll take the delegates, but do
[02:40:58.300 --> 02:41:00.220]  it this way, I won't take them.
[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:01.740]  Ted Cruz is not going to do that.
[02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:06.220]  He's going to, you know, scramble after 20 delegates as if it makes any difference.
[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:10.180]  I think the, you're going to see in New York, you're going to see in Pennsylvania, massive
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:13.380]  voting for Trump, it's going to backfire.
[02:41:13.380 --> 02:41:18.340]  Everything attempted on Trump has backfired, but Trump is in the fight of his life.
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:19.620]  And Roger Stone knows it.
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:25.020]  Roger Stone is doing everything he can to alert people to the theft that's going on
[02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:30.560]  of the election by the GOP establishment, and what's going to come down the pike is Hillary
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:35.300]  Clinton is as guilty as any criminal has ever been.
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:39.140]  And she is going to have to be indicted or the American people aren't going to tolerate
[02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:40.140]  it.
[02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:44.100]  I mean, I'm, you know, I'll have a book coming out in the summer about it as well, but I'm
[02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:46.500]  I've been sensed about the Clinton Foundation.
[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:49.700]  I've never seen such a naked corruption and somebody not getting in trouble.
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:55.540]  I mean, the elite are crazy trying to install her when, in a way, it's good because it's
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:58.500]  going to blow up in their face, but she may just, you know, start war with the Russians
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:41:59.500]  who knows.
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:05.940]  And I think everybody should get your Hillary, you know, for, for prison's t-shirts.
[02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:07.900]  These are, I mean, you're right on.
[02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:12.220]  This is exactly what's going on is that, you know, the Clinton Foundation is a criminal
[02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:16.460]  enterprise that has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:21.180]  It has done it at the expense of poor people, the expense of people who suffered tragedies
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:23.940]  like in Haiti or in India, earthquakes.
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:25.580]  They're horrible, nasty people.
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:26.580]  The worst, the worst.
[02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:32.060]  Here's Ted Cruz on Trump yesterday calling Colorado voterless win democracy and then
[02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:37.700]  I've got a longer clip where he says it three times, Drudge won't report I won.
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:38.700]  Well no, Drudge is reporting.
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:39.700]  There was no vote.
[02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:40.700]  It's insane.
[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:42.460]  Well, Drudge is reporting what you're reporting.
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:50.380]  Drudge is, is seen through the hypocrisy, he's seen through the duplicity, the lie,
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:51.860]  and he's exposing the lie.
[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:52.940]  Well, how could he not?
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:54.380]  They're canceling elections.
[02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:57.820]  I mean, look, this shows how morally bankrupt the Republican leadership is.
[02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:58.820]  Let's play the short clip.
[02:42:58.820 --> 02:42:59.820]  That was her own course.
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:00.820]  He's with us.
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:01.820]  Here's Ted Cruz.
[02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:10.660]  The latest thing he sees upon is when people vote against him, they're stealing the election.
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:12.940]  It's a really odd notion.
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:15.500]  What is this democracy of which you speak?
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:19.580]  By the way, our computer malfunctioned and sped that up, but I'm kind of glad it did.
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:20.580]  It was pretty funny.
[02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:27.860]  It showed a whole new dimension to Ted Cruz that, look, Ted Cruz is going to say anything
[02:43:27.860 --> 02:43:32.420]  he can at this point and he doesn't, you know, he's just going to be used to block Donald
[02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:33.420]  Trump.
[02:43:33.420 --> 02:43:35.300]  Ted Cruz will never get the nomination.
[02:43:35.300 --> 02:43:36.300]  He's a pawn.
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:41.580]  He's being used as a pawn, he'll be thrown away by the establishment GOP as fast as they
[02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:42.580]  use them.
[02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:43.580]  Sure.
[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:46.100]  Do you think they're arrogant enough like Carl Robes said on TV that they are just going
[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:48.580]  to maybe put a fresh face in with no votes?
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:52.660]  Yes, I think it's very possible, and look at the money.
[02:43:52.660 --> 02:43:59.340]  Look at the GOP money that's gone to Mark Levin, for instance, they bought something
[02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:05.180]  like, you know, they have $400,000 of Mark Levin's book, The Cruz Campaign, People Supporting
[02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:06.700]  Cruz did.
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:10.340]  That's all engineered by Carl Robes.
[02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:18.020]  Carl Robes knows that he can buy Glenn Beck, he can buy the Mark Levin's, he can buy all
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:19.540]  these pundits to attack.
[02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:24.380]  By the way, I don't want to dislike Mark Levin or Glenn Beck, but man, they are really showing
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:25.380]  themselves.
[02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:26.540]  I mean, it's scary.
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:30.260]  I'm really ashamed of the conservative movement.
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:35.220]  And I'm appalled, you know, I've done everything I can starting yesterday to support Phyllis
[02:44:35.220 --> 02:44:39.660]  because Phyllis is the kind of person who's really built the conservative movement.
[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:44.260]  And now you've got a set of Cruz operatives who have taken over the organization, want
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:48.020]  to throw Phyllis out, grab the money and run it their way.
[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:52.660]  I mean, it's intolerable that, you know, a 91-year-old woman who's built this organization
[02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:58.500]  could have to face a coup from the very people whose careers she built by Eagle Forum.
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:02.300]  None of these women would have done anything in politics had it not been...
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:07.900]  Matt, Cruz is really treacherous, and I guess he feels like he's got the backing of establishment
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:09.660]  now and thinks he's invincible.
[02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:14.380]  Well, he, for, you know, Carl Obama and the others will make him feel this way, and they'll
[02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:15.380]  play to his ego.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:20.820]  But as I said, he is really showing his true colors, who he is.
[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:23.580]  You know, you're fine right below the surface.
[02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:29.740]  You've got the guy who is down at the border handing out teddy bears to, you know, supposedly
[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:32.140]  the unaccompanied minors who are flooding across...
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:34.580]  Sickening stunts, you see, out of Obama.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:35.580]  Right.
[02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:38.220]  And constant hypocrisy from Cruz.
[02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:42.460]  That's the part of it as I researched it deeper, because, you know, like you, Alex, when he
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:46.300]  first came on the scene as a senator, we're all inclined to think, hey, this is a Tea
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:47.860]  Party conservative.
[02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:52.420]  The more you look at his background, you find Goldman Sachs all over the place, loans that
[02:45:52.420 --> 02:45:54.100]  he didn't disclose.
[02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:58.220]  You find the globalism and support of free trade, open borders.
[02:45:58.220 --> 02:46:05.380]  This has every been as much Ted Cruz a globalist as is Carl Rove and the other GOP establishment.
[02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:07.180]  He is a Washington insider.
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:12.020]  That's where his career came from, is a George W. Bush loyalist.
[02:46:12.020 --> 02:46:20.220]  He worked in the Bush recount in Florida that a lot of the engineering for that was disliked
[02:46:20.220 --> 02:46:21.220]  by the Bush people.
[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:23.420]  Nobody seems to like Ted Cruz.
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:28.380]  And so he did a job in the FTC, parked in the FTC, where he spent years in Washington
[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:30.420]  as a Washington insider.
[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:36.540]  His wife was put onto the Condi Rice's staff, and she did the Council on Foreign Relations
[02:46:36.540 --> 02:46:41.620]  report with Robert Pastor on tour to North American community that was the architecture
[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:42.620]  for the North American Union.
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:46.980]  She is a key super gopher for the ultra top.
[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:48.700]  And that's exactly what the Cruzes are.
[02:46:48.700 --> 02:46:54.380]  If they got into power, which they're not going to get, they're just going to be the
[02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:57.380]  spoil Trump movement.
[02:46:57.380 --> 02:46:59.380]  And I think that Trump is doing a good job.
[02:46:59.380 --> 02:47:02.340]  Roger Stone is fighting every day to expose it.
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:04.340]  And of course, Roger's going to take a lot of heat from it.
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:06.340]  He's going to take an enormous amount of heat.
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:09.060]  You know, Stone is working, I know for a fact, 18 hours a day.
[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:10.260]  The guy is a maniac.
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:14.580]  I get texts at 6 a.m. in the morning and at 1 a.m. and phone calls.
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:16.380]  And he also knows what he's doing.
[02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:18.980]  He goes back in politics decades.
[02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:19.980]  He was there.
[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:20.980]  Very cold water.
[02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:21.980]  Six.
[02:47:21.980 --> 02:47:22.980]  He saw the convention.
[02:47:22.980 --> 02:47:27.540]  He knew Richard Nixon, worked with Nixon, worked in the Reagan administration.
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:28.540]  He's been there.
[02:47:28.540 --> 02:47:30.180]  He knows what he's talking about.
[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:36.060]  And when Stone says that by the rules, they're going to, you know, in Washington, a few lawyers
[02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:38.940]  are going to try to steal the convention.
[02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:39.940]  It's something to pay attention to.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:42.660]  Well, he said it eight months ago, and now it's materializing.
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:44.540]  But they're doing it now at the state level.
[02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:47.140]  In the few minutes we've got left, we're going to break and you're gone in three minutes.
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:48.140]  Sure.
[02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:51.780]  You're the expert on the economy for folks that, you know, a doctor of economics, banking,
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:54.980]  you know, advised Donald Trump, you name it, involved at the highest levels.
[02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:55.980]  Where are we really?
[02:47:55.980 --> 02:47:56.980]  What's the next big shooter up?
[02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:01.780]  We're talking about corporate defaults, state defaults, the shale oil boom, crash in North
[02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:04.540]  America, the situation with the Saudis.
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:11.380]  I mean, it's time bombing, worried IMF cuts, world growth forecast, warns over bricks exit
[02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:12.380]  from EU.
[02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:16.660]  They're hitting the panic button saying they're going to zero or negative interest rates.
[02:48:16.660 --> 02:48:17.660]  What is all this signifying?
[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:18.660]  Two minutes.
[02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:19.660]  Dr. Corsi.
[02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:23.980]  Well, I think, first of all, you're going to see the Federal Reserve, which is, by the
[02:48:23.980 --> 02:48:28.420]  way, privately owned, is not a government institution is going to do everything it can
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:33.580]  to keep pumping money in, to keep the stock market up, at least through the election.
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:37.580]  They don't want to have the establishment exposed by the crash that we're going to have.
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:40.420]  The crash is going to start in Europe, it's going to start in the EU.
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:43.580]  EU is going to begin falling apart.
[02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:48.340]  That's flooded with Muslim terrorists, these refugees are going to, you're going to see
[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:52.380]  more Brussels attacks, more taxes in France.
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:57.380]  The Islamic radicals who are coming into Europe are not going to assimilate into the European
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:58.380]  society.
[02:48:58.380 --> 02:49:01.540]  They're going to try to destroy European society.
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:05.940]  I suspect the EU is going to start breaking up this year, and the financial collapse is
[02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:07.860]  going to begin in Europe.
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:13.340]  Again, in Greece, I think Greece and Great Britain could both pull out from the EU this
[02:49:13.340 --> 02:49:14.340]  year.
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:16.620]  By the way, while you're saying this, there's a giant thunderstorm overhead, it made me
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:18.020]  get chills at my back.
[02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:19.020]  I mean, why?
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:22.020]  I know the left captured us, the globalists run us.
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:25.020]  Why do they want to bring 5 million jihadis in to kill us?
[02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:26.020]  Why?
[02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:28.700]  Why do they hate prosperity and nice stuff?
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:34.660]  We're going to have basically a structure where the world economy collapses.
[02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:39.340]  And in the collapse, again, remember these crises, they'll have this collapse occurring
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:43.580]  at the same time the Middle East is moving towards a nuclear war.
[02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:45.700]  And the only forces are going to be able to stop it.
[02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:51.380]  I mean, once the United States, we've lost our moral compass, we've lost our economic
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:56.500]  strength, our military is being dramatically depleted, the levels that hasn't been in modern
[02:49:56.500 --> 02:49:57.500]  times.
[02:49:57.500 --> 02:49:59.100]  The United States has done this intentionally.
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:03.740]  We're run by Acolytes of the heirs, communists, I mean, what elite would put those people
[02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:04.740]  in?
[02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:08.180]  And don't think that the left and right aren't in cooperation with this.
[02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:15.500]  At the highest level, the GOP Republicans would be happy to have Hillary Clinton win.
[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:21.300]  And Hillary and her people are stealing the election and the GOP on the Democratic side,
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:23.660]  just as Carl Rowe and the others are trying to.
[02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:29.100]  So this is really the attempted full takeover by multinationals and crime syndicates.
[02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:33.380]  We're saying just regarding just regarding the middle class, just regarding the average
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:37.100]  person throwing God out of the country and having no has.
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:40.100]  Is this really the fall of America if they succeed right now?
[02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:41.100]  Yes.
[02:50:41.100 --> 02:50:47.660]  This this is the last chapter, unless we have an opportunity to take back the fundamental
[02:50:47.660 --> 02:50:48.820]  values of the country.
[02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:52.460]  And that's what Donald Trump is fighting for, and it's going to be the fight of his life.
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:56.180]  Now God bless you, Dr. Corsi, look forward to talking to you a lot more Godspeed.
[02:50:56.180 --> 02:50:57.780]  This is the final chapter of America.
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:58.780]  This is it.
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:50:59.780]  This is it.
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:04.420]  Are you concerned about the power grid, about the new war on the power grid?
[02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:10.100]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:11.100]  Here's why.
[02:51:11.100 --> 02:51:15.620]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just
[02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:16.620]  been written.
[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:21.780]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only for a limited
[02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:23.940]  time to GCN listeners.
[02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:28.740]  He simply asked that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:33.700]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:34.700]  to you.
[02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:35.700]  Why do this?
[02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:39.220]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:40.820]  The answer is simple.
[02:51:40.820 --> 02:51:44.860]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.
[02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:49.180]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author
[02:51:49.180 --> 02:51:51.540]  gets is, do you fear for your life?
[02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:58.540]  Go to waronthegrid.com, that's waronthegrid.com, don't wait, waronthegrid.com.
[02:51:58.540 --> 02:52:07.420]  Hey, I wrote the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors, I just want
[02:52:07.420 --> 02:52:11.740]  to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:17.060]  all your personal information, your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.
[02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:20.540]  So your identity is now my identity.
[02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:22.540]  Coming up, so am I.
[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:28.260]  For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID blocking wallets and ID badge holders
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:32.780]  for consumers, the U.S. military, and even the executive office of the president.
[02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:34.900]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:39.260]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra
[02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:40.260]  protection.
[02:52:40.260 --> 02:52:43.260]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[02:52:43.260 --> 02:52:45.460]  Don't be a victim of electronic pickpocketing.
[02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:48.900]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves,
[02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:49.900]  and purses.
[02:52:49.900 --> 02:52:55.900]  Go to IDStronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallets and badge holders.
[02:52:55.900 --> 02:53:08.540]  IDStronghold.com December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.
[02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:14.460]  75 years ago, America suffered one of the worst moments in American history.
[02:53:14.460 --> 02:53:16.900]  The attack on Pearl Harbor.
[02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:24.180]  Now you can remember December 7, 1941, with the purchase of the first ever 75th anniversary
[02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:29.020]  Pearl Harbor legal tender solid gold coin from the U.S. Money Reserve.

[02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:40.860]  gold coin from the U.S. Money Reserve.

[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:57.860]  Remember Pearl Harbor with this limited official gold release 1-800-490-3200 or online at USMoneyReserve.com.
[02:54:16.860 --> 02:54:30.340]  Big John, Big Bad John, Big Bad John, Big Bad John, Big Bad John.
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:33.020]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[02:54:33.020 --> 02:54:35.940]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:41.620]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but if he spoke it all, he just said hi to Big
[02:54:41.620 --> 02:54:44.620]  John.
[02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:49.980]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen and I
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:55.460]  crashed and blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land.
[02:54:55.460 --> 02:55:04.420]  Big John, Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big Bad John.
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:09.580]  We gotta shut that off, that's some good stuff right there.
[02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:13.100]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when a timber cracked.
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:16.140]  We got David Knight coming up and I'm going to have him kick off right at the start of
[02:55:16.140 --> 02:55:17.140]  the fourth hour.
[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:20.700]  He'll have obviously tons of new breaking news and information.
[02:55:20.700 --> 02:55:25.020]  Rob Dew and Joe Biggs and crew are going out to the Friday demonstrations, the RNC
[02:55:25.020 --> 02:55:30.620]  and Denver to protest that they canceled the popular vote there and just gave it to his
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:31.620]  lordship.
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:39.940]  There's been chicanery and hanky-panky and dirty tricks before, but nothing of this
[02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:46.340]  magnitude and nothing so naked where they then deny they did it and act like Roger Stone,
[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:49.420]  Matt Drudge, myself and others are lying.
[02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:56.780]  The bullying that goes on behind the scenes to get behind Ted Cruz is truly sickening.
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:56:01.260]  I've been experiencing stuff and I'm not going to even get into it because when you work
[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:05.300]  with people and you do things and stuff's off record, it's off record.
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:11.100]  That's just the way it is, but America's seen as weak.
[02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:14.940]  You got a bunch of TV heads, you got a bunch of dumb down young people and I'm pretty
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:15.940]  young myself.
[02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:19.420]  There's a lot of awake young people too, but I mean, really, you look at the college students
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:22.340]  and high school students, I mean, they're either totally awake and really alive or
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:28.140]  they look like they're dead, zombos and the system thinks we're a bunch of chumps.
[02:56:28.140 --> 02:56:29.300]  They think that we're done.
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:33.540]  They think it's over and that's why they're just announcing, hey, we're getting rid of
[02:56:33.540 --> 02:56:36.580]  cash, hey, we're going to take money right out of your bank account, hey, foreign banks
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:40.500]  front America, hey, we're getting ready for a collapse, new banker bailouts, hey, we're
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:44.900]  going to raise taxes on the poor and exempt the rich and we're going to arrest whoever
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:45.900]  we want.
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:49.140]  We're going to give you forced inoculations and world governments here and you're going
[02:56:49.140 --> 02:56:51.620]  to let 10,000 Chinese women fly in a week.
[02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:56.780]  It was a month and get free healthcare and free babies and Mexico can have a wall and
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:57:01.060]  torture people that come across, but we can't have any security and Donald Trump's evil.
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:07.220]  That's just this fad driven, idiot based society.
[02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:11.100]  And there's articles yesterday and today in four different papers.
[02:57:11.100 --> 02:57:12.180]  Today it's in what?
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:16.020]  The New York Times and the Providence Journal.
[02:57:16.020 --> 02:57:19.340]  Climate change deniers deserve punishment.
[02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:21.340]  I thought it was manmade global warming deniers.
[02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:25.620]  Oh, now if I deny climate change, I don't deny climate change, you jackasses.
[02:57:25.620 --> 02:57:31.740]  The Russians broke into your emails globally at the UN East Anglia managing it where hundreds
[02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:40.260]  of universities were coordinating what five years ago, hiding the decline in temperature
[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:44.100]  globally.
[02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:49.020]  We've caught you with your filthy hands in the cookie jar over and over again.
[02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:54.220]  So you want to arrest us.
[02:57:54.220 --> 02:57:59.700]  All these traders with a scheme to hijack the West economies, turn our coal power plants
[02:57:59.700 --> 02:58:00.700]  off.
[02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:03.020]  They were like 70% of our power a decade ago.
[02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:05.580]  Now it's like 40-something.
[02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:09.060]  You want to know why your electricity is so high, why the jobs are leaving?
[02:58:09.060 --> 02:58:12.060]  Number one, our power is expensive.
[02:58:12.060 --> 02:58:14.980]  It's why I'm obsessed on it.
[02:58:14.980 --> 02:58:16.300]  Nobody talks about it.
[02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:17.460]  You can build a coal plant.
[02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:21.980]  We will bankrupt you.
[02:58:21.980 --> 02:58:22.980]  That means bankrupt America.
[02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:26.100]  What's the first thing a foreign enemy does?
[02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:27.100]  Destroy the generator.
[02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:28.540]  Let me use a Star Wars analogy.
[02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:29.540]  Empire strikes back.
[02:58:29.540 --> 02:58:30.540]  The Imperial Walker.
[02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:31.740]  You may start your landing.
[02:58:31.740 --> 02:58:33.220]  We've reached the shield generator.
[02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:35.100]  Target, shield generator.
[02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:36.100]  Maximum firepower.
[02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:37.100]  They've blown our generators.
[02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:38.100]  Our generators are down.
[02:58:38.100 --> 02:58:39.100]  We're down.
[02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:40.100]  We're under enemy attack.
[02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:41.100]  They want to bankrupt you to control you.
[02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:42.100]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:43.100]  Fight these people.
[02:58:43.100 --> 02:58:44.100]  Now they're taking your votes.
[02:58:44.100 --> 02:58:45.100]  David Nye's coming off.
[02:58:45.100 --> 02:59:07.060]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:08.060]  products.
[02:59:08.060 --> 02:59:09.060]  Welcome to the Infowar.
[02:59:09.060 --> 02:59:14.420]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Infowar
[02:59:14.420 --> 02:59:15.420]  at the same time.
[02:59:15.420 --> 02:59:16.420]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:19.420]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, aquafx, nascent, iodine.
[02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:20.420]  Right.
[02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:21.420]  God, let me ask you a question.
[02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:22.420]  Have they worked for you?
[02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:25.100]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:59:25.100 --> 02:59:26.100]  What products are you taking?
[02:59:26.100 --> 02:59:27.100]  Are you taking?
[02:59:27.100 --> 02:59:34.420]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Winterson, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[02:59:34.420 --> 02:59:38.140]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[02:59:51.740 --> 03:00:06.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.740 --> 03:00:16.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:27.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:42.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:42.340 --> 03:00:44.460]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:00:44.460 --> 03:00:48.980]  You know, when I was listening to Alex Jones interview Roger Stone earlier and they were
[03:00:48.980 --> 03:00:53.980]  talking about how people were mis-portraying the call for us to get involved, saying that's
[03:00:53.980 --> 03:00:55.860]  a call for violence.
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:00:58.980]  Just like they said when Donald Trump said, hey, if you try to steal this, there's gonna
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:00:59.980]  be riots.
[03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:00.980]  Okay.
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:01.980]  No, you're threatening people.
[03:01:01.980 --> 03:01:08.900]  Listen, isn't it interesting that Cruz can go to these states like Colorado?
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:09.900]  He can twist arms.
[03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:13.340]  He can lobby delegates and it's just politics.
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:20.140]  But if we the people want to twist arms and lobby the delegates, that's a call to violence.
[03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:22.300]  You understand how that works?
[03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:25.240]  Because you see, we're not stakeholders.
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:28.260]  We don't have a voice.
[03:01:28.260 --> 03:01:30.340]  Vox Populite doesn't exist anymore.
[03:01:30.340 --> 03:01:31.340]  Okay.
[03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:32.740]  Shut up and sit down.
[03:01:32.740 --> 03:01:35.140]  This isn't your party.
[03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:36.660]  This is their party.
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:38.540]  And they'll burn it down if they want to.
[03:01:38.540 --> 03:01:40.980]  Remember that link that was on Drudge yesterday?
[03:01:40.980 --> 03:01:42.380]  I don't know if you saw that or not.
[03:01:42.380 --> 03:01:43.740]  Alex may have talked about it today.
[03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:47.940]  There was an angry letter from somebody in Colorado saying, you're gonna do this.
[03:01:47.940 --> 03:01:51.260]  I am going to abandon the GOP.
[03:01:51.260 --> 03:01:53.620]  You're gonna lose people for a generation.
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:57.220]  He wrote that to the Colorado GOP chair.
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:01:59.540]  And the guy said, okay, fine, burn down the party.
[03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:00.540]  He didn't care.
[03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:01.540]  It's his party.
[03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:02.620]  He'll cry if he wants to.
[03:02:02.620 --> 03:02:04.340]  If he doesn't want to, he won't.
[03:02:04.340 --> 03:02:09.060]  Because really, they don't care if the party burns down.
[03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:10.540]  They want to burn this country down.
[03:02:10.540 --> 03:02:14.980]  It's what I've seen all over this country when I go and talk to the people, the loggers
[03:02:14.980 --> 03:02:20.260]  who've had their economy shut down by the federal government, the ranchers, the miners,
[03:02:20.260 --> 03:02:21.260]  everyone across this country.
[03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:29.500]  They are willing to literally burn down areas of Oregon so that they can take over everything.
[03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:36.380]  The only thing that's being built in John Day, Oregon are federal facilities for bureaucracies.
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:40.780]  They have allowed the fuel to set there on the ground, literally burning this industry
[03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:41.780]  down.
[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:45.100]  And you know, in this logger, when we interviewed him, we went out there after what happened
[03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:46.100]  in Oregon.
[03:02:46.100 --> 03:02:52.180]  At that time, talking to the people that Lavoie Fennecum and the others were on their way
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:53.180]  to talk to them.
[03:02:53.180 --> 03:02:54.860]  They had 400 people there.
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:56.300]  They were gaining traction.
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:57.900]  That's why they had to arrest those people.
[03:02:57.900 --> 03:02:59.700]  That's why they had to kill Lavoie Fennecum.
[03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:02.340]  So we wanted to talk to them and understand what they were doing.
[03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:04.220]  So we talked to the guy who organized that rally.
[03:03:04.220 --> 03:03:07.740]  He was someone who had worked all his life in that area as a logger.
[03:03:07.740 --> 03:03:09.420]  He didn't want to destroy the forest.
[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:11.300]  He wanted to manage the forest.
[03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:12.980]  It's the government that wants to destroy it.
[03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:18.620]  And he accused the government of deliberately destroying all of this.
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:21.100]  And you know, I was listening to the Pentagon's brain.
[03:03:21.100 --> 03:03:25.020]  I do that once in a while when I really get fired up on my way in.
[03:03:25.020 --> 03:03:29.900]  I listened to that book we interviewed the author, Annie Jacobson, an excellent book
[03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:33.180]  going back, talking about DARPA's history.
[03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:34.660]  They were talking about Vietnam.
[03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:39.300]  They were talking about Agent Orange and how they wanted to try to deforest, go through
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:45.420]  a policy of deforestation there to try to remove the cover that the Viet Cong had.
[03:03:45.420 --> 03:03:48.980]  So they came up with Agent Orange, but they really couldn't get it done with that.
[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:51.140]  They wanted to try to set fires, but they said, you know what?
[03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:55.660]  We can't set fires unless we can get sufficient fuel on the ground.
[03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:58.460]  We've got to have a lot of underbrush and things to do.
[03:03:58.460 --> 03:03:59.940]  They understood that.
[03:03:59.940 --> 03:04:02.100]  Every forester understands that.
[03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:03.220]  Forestry departments understand that.
[03:04:03.220 --> 03:04:07.540]  My uncle was head of the forestry department at the University of Missouri.
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:08.980]  He understood that.
[03:04:08.980 --> 03:04:14.140]  He was complaining 40 years ago about how the government was following a policy that
[03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:15.380]  was going to burn our forests down.
[03:04:15.380 --> 03:04:16.540]  What have we seen now?
[03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:22.420]  Here where I live in Texas, just south of Austin, Bastrop Community, I think it was
[03:04:22.420 --> 03:04:27.340]  like 97% of the place burned down before I moved here to Austin.
[03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:28.340]  Why?
[03:04:28.340 --> 03:04:29.340]  Because of fuel on the ground.
[03:04:29.340 --> 03:04:30.340]  What did they do afterwards?
[03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:34.340]  They came back and told people, clear up dead wood on the ground, but said the government
[03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:35.940]  doesn't do that.
[03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:40.300]  The government pursues at the top, understand there's two different levels of government.
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:43.540]  The people who are setting the policy want to burn this place down.
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:46.620]  I'm not saying the people who are living there don't want to do it.
[03:04:46.620 --> 03:04:50.340]  The forestry people at that level don't want to see it, but they've been brainwashed by
[03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:52.180]  the people at the top who know what they're doing.
[03:04:52.180 --> 03:04:53.180]  They want to burn it down.
[03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:54.180]  That's what they're doing.
[03:04:54.180 --> 03:04:57.580]  They're burning down this economy, and we're not supposed to say anything about it.
[03:04:57.580 --> 03:04:59.180]  Stay with us and be right back.
[03:04:59.180 --> 03:05:04.060]  Lawmakers are calling on the White House to declassify more than two dozen pages in the
[03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:09.220]  9-11 commission report that they say outlines evidence for possible support from the Saudi
[03:05:09.220 --> 03:05:10.220]  government.
[03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:15.980]  For two hijackers who settled in Southern California, a CBS News 60 Minutes report quoted
[03:05:15.980 --> 03:05:21.980]  officials familiar with the 2003 report as saying that 28 pages of redacted information
[03:05:21.980 --> 03:05:27.300]  raises questions over whether Saudi officials were involved in assisting two hijackers upon
[03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:30.980]  their arrival in Los Angeles in January 2000.
[03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:36.420]  Former Democratic Congressman and U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Romer told 60 Minutes, the two
[03:05:36.420 --> 03:05:41.780]  Saudi nationals found a way to gain access to housing and flight lessons upon their arrival
[03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:46.980]  despite extremely limited language skills and no experience with Western culture.
[03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:51.860]  Also, former U.S. Senator Bob Kerry, who has read the redacted pages, believes that they
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:53.420]  should be declassified.

[03:08:16.660 --> 03:08:29.140]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and as I was just saying as we were
[03:08:29.140 --> 03:08:34.900]  in the break when I was listening to Roger Stone talk to Alex Jones about the mis-patrial
[03:08:34.900 --> 03:08:38.500]  of what the two of them had been talking about in terms of trying to get activists to the
[03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:44.500]  convention in Cleveland to lobby the delegates to find out where these delegates are and
[03:08:44.500 --> 03:08:48.780]  then they portray that as violence. I was saying, you know, crews can go to Colorado
[03:08:48.780 --> 03:08:55.140]  or these caucuses or these non-election events. He can twist arms, he can lobby delegates,
[03:08:55.140 --> 03:08:59.820]  okay, and it's just politics, he's just winning, okay?
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:04.740]  But if you or I were to do that, if we the people were to go to these delegates, if we
[03:09:04.740 --> 03:09:10.980]  were to twist their arms and lobby them, then we would be threatening them with violence.
[03:09:10.980 --> 03:09:17.820]  You see the double standard there? You see, the corrupt criminal insiders can hatch their
[03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:22.500]  conspiracies and smoke filled rooms and it's not racketeering. But if you or I want to get
[03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:28.020]  involved in the political process, we are dangerous, okay? You want to really get dangerous?
[03:09:28.020 --> 03:09:34.020]  Have a protest and carry some weapons with you legally. So you have a legal free speech
[03:09:34.020 --> 03:09:39.220]  protest and you carry some weapons with you. Now we've done that. As a matter of fact, my
[03:09:39.220 --> 03:09:44.220]  sons who went and filmed a couple of those early on said, you know, the only time we
[03:09:44.220 --> 03:09:50.540]  haven't been hassled is when it's an demonstration with armed people. It's the only time the
[03:09:50.540 --> 03:09:56.420]  cops have left us alone. That's what the Second Amendment is about. That is a picture of the
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:10:02.340]  Second Amendment. It's like the mutual assured destruction that we had during the Cold War.
[03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:08.500]  It's like neither side wants to kick this off. So back off, buddy, I'll defend myself,
[03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:12.860]  okay? That's what the Second Amendment is about. It's about the government respecting
[03:10:12.860 --> 03:10:13.860]  people.
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:19.460]  And a good example of this was in San Antonio about two and a half, three years ago. It
[03:10:19.460 --> 03:10:25.220]  was in October of 2013. There was an open carry rally there. And the reason that open
[03:10:25.220 --> 03:10:32.780]  carry rally had been called was because we had people who were exercising their Second
[03:10:32.780 --> 03:10:38.180]  Amendment rights to open carry, trying to get the people of even Texas to not freak out
[03:10:38.180 --> 03:10:43.460]  if they see somebody with a gun and no uniform. Because that's scary. Okay, people with guns
[03:10:43.460 --> 03:10:46.660]  with uniforms, right? They can be armed to the teeth. They can have all kinds of riot
[03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:51.900]  gear. And that's okay. That's fine. They can be riding around fully militarized vehicles
[03:10:51.900 --> 03:10:55.500]  like they're in Fallujah or something. No problem. I've got no problem with that. But
[03:10:55.500 --> 03:11:01.260]  a citizen has a gun. Whoa, that's scary. See, it's exactly the opposite of the way it ought
[03:11:01.260 --> 03:11:02.260]  to be.
[03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:07.260]  We even have to have a toy story. We have to have Woody, Sheriff Woody, without a gun.
[03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:12.100]  And the Sheriff has no gun in his holster because, you know, he's not dressed in riot
[03:11:12.100 --> 03:11:17.140]  gear. I guess if they had set up Woody in riot gear, that would be okay. I remember
[03:11:17.140 --> 03:11:21.020]  when my sons were young, I wanted to give them some guns so they could play some real
[03:11:21.020 --> 03:11:26.060]  stuff, okay? And I went down to Toys R Us. I should have known better. It's nothing but
[03:11:26.060 --> 03:11:32.460]  a bunch of marketing gimmicks, you know, they're tied to TV shows and movies. I wanted to get
[03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:37.380]  them something I couldn't find any Western guns for them to play with. All I could find
[03:11:37.380 --> 03:11:42.140]  was riot police gear. Yeah, you could buy that. You could have your children pretend
[03:11:42.140 --> 03:11:46.380]  they're riot police, but, you know, you don't want them to pretend they're John Wayne. That
[03:11:46.380 --> 03:11:52.220]  would be bad. That'd be scary. That'd be dangerous, okay? Or Davey Crockett. Heaven forbid.
[03:11:52.220 --> 03:11:59.140]  Okay, so I don't want to preface this. I'm going to tell you that since that rally in
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:07.620]  2013, my family has referred to Ted Cruz as Mrs. Nesbitt from Toy Story. I'll show you
[03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:11.140]  the clip so you understand the context in just a moment. First, let's play this short
[03:12:11.140 --> 03:12:17.060]  clip from Hillary Clinton. That's how gun owners are really terrorists. Citizens are
[03:12:17.060 --> 03:12:21.580]  the terrorists, right? We're so worried about terrorism, but we have terrorism on our own
[03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:28.540]  soil. Our gun manufacturers, our ammunition manufacturers are making terrorists out of
[03:12:28.540 --> 03:12:34.100]  our citizens, a sobering fact. Yeah, see, the citizens are terrorists. She even says
[03:12:34.100 --> 03:12:37.660]  it. This lady there with hill rings, they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's absolutely
[03:12:37.660 --> 03:12:43.940]  true. Absolutely true. Well, so we had this situation in San Antonio. I think it's open
[03:12:43.940 --> 03:12:48.100]  carry Texas put it together. They realized that people who are walking around legally
[03:12:48.100 --> 03:12:53.300]  carrying firearms openly and at the time it was a long arm so they could sling over their
[03:12:53.300 --> 03:12:58.260]  shoulder. They were getting harassed by the police. So we said, all right, let's go down
[03:12:58.260 --> 03:13:01.740]  there. They said, let's have a big rally. So we got behind it. We support it. We had
[03:13:01.740 --> 03:13:09.300]  over 1000 people show up all carrying firearms in a peaceful rally to demonstrate that, hey,
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:13.220]  we have a right to legally carry these arms and we're going to do it. And we're going
[03:13:13.220 --> 03:13:18.820]  to do it at the birthplace of freedom in Texas, the Alamo. And so that's what we did. We
[03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:26.580]  had a big rally there. We had the Texas, I think his land state commissioner was there.
[03:13:26.580 --> 03:13:31.180]  He has control over the monuments. He allowed that to happen. We had a lot of political
[03:13:31.180 --> 03:13:36.460]  speakers there. Alex Jones spoke there. You've probably seen the iconic shot of him in front
[03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:42.740]  of the Alamo. And I was really surprised after that was over. My wife said, Ted Cruz is here.
[03:13:42.740 --> 03:13:46.260]  I was like, really, I didn't hear him speak. I didn't see him anywhere. No, no, no, no.
[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:51.900]  He's across the street in the Hyatt. It's like, what? You know, having this, this is
[03:13:51.900 --> 03:13:56.860]  the guy who is telling us how he's this Mr. Constitution and he's all about the Second
[03:13:56.860 --> 03:14:01.700]  Amendment. Well, that's the top of his issues if you go to his website, Second Amendment.
[03:14:01.700 --> 03:14:08.100]  And he can't even bother to show up and speak at the Alamo. Wow, that's really strange.
[03:14:08.100 --> 03:14:13.340]  This guy really is a phony because I've not trusted him since he ran for Senate. You got
[03:14:13.340 --> 03:14:17.700]  a wife who's a member of Goldman Sachs. You got a wife who's part of the Council on Foreign
[03:14:17.700 --> 03:14:22.340]  Relations. You got a wife who works with Robert Zellick in terms of talking about how they
[03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:27.020]  want to have a common border around Mexico, the United States and Canada, you know, because
[03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:31.180]  he's Mr. North American Union President. He's from Canada. Oh, so what? It's the same country,
[03:14:31.180 --> 03:14:36.740]  right? So he is a natural born citizen, I guess, right? So you got a wife who's into
[03:14:36.740 --> 03:14:42.100]  all of that. I didn't know about the secret loans from Goldman Sachs that he got when
[03:14:42.100 --> 03:14:44.940]  he was running. He didn't want to tell anybody about that because he was trying to distance
[03:14:44.940 --> 03:14:49.500]  himself from Goldman Sachs, from the Council on Foreign Relations, calling them a pit of
[03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:54.060]  vipers. That was a dog whistle, by the way, again, to his Christian community. Speaking
[03:14:54.060 --> 03:14:58.340]  the language, always doing the dog whistle. So it's like, oh, yeah, this guy's authentic.
[03:14:58.340 --> 03:15:03.020]  Okay, you saw what he did to Ben Carson. He's not authentic. Okay, before the Ben Carson
[03:15:03.020 --> 03:15:08.860]  episode, I had a lot of suspicion about him because of that. And then it was, I guess
[03:15:08.860 --> 03:15:12.500]  it was about a year. Yeah, it was a year after he had been elected. He got elected in 2012
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:17.860]  and then October 13, 2013, where they're at the Alamo. We have an open carry rally, massive
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:22.340]  rally about the Second Amendment. Everybody has pumped up, but not Ted Cruz, Mr. Second
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:27.980]  Amendment. He is across the street, speaking to the Tea Party, literally the Tea Party,
[03:15:27.980 --> 03:15:33.660]  a bunch of blue-haired GOP women donors. Okay, and here's the article from the San Antonio,
[03:15:33.660 --> 03:15:37.460]  my San Antonio at the time. He was speaking to the Texas Federation of Republican Women
[03:15:37.460 --> 03:15:43.100]  at the Grand Hyatt, okay? So here he is. He can't even, you know, poke his head out the
[03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:47.460]  window and wave to us like royalty. He's not passionate about the Second Amendment. This
[03:15:47.460 --> 03:15:52.020]  guy is phony about everything. He's phony about the Constitution. He won't tell us why
[03:15:52.020 --> 03:15:55.900]  he thinks he's qualified. He won't defend the case that he's a natural born citizen because
[03:15:55.900 --> 03:16:01.900]  he's not, okay? He's simply a slick lawyer. And so when I heard that, we said, oh, he's
[03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:07.140]  like Mrs. Nesbitt. Let's play this. Remember when you had, but let me set this up before
[03:16:07.140 --> 03:16:13.020]  you guys roll this. Okay, toy story. You have Buzz Lightyear walking and he finds, I'd
[03:16:13.020 --> 03:16:18.980]  rather, Woody walks in, finds Buzz Lightyear kind of delusional. And he's dressed for those
[03:16:18.980 --> 03:16:23.740]  of you who are listening on the radio. He's dressed in a hat with an apron and he's having
[03:16:23.740 --> 03:16:28.980]  a Tea Party. And he says, I'm Mrs. Nesbitt. Let's roll that clip.
[03:16:28.980 --> 03:16:29.980]  What happened to you?
[03:16:29.980 --> 03:16:35.620]  One minute, you're defending the whole galaxy. And suddenly, you find yourself sucking down
[03:16:35.620 --> 03:16:37.620]  Darjeeling with
[03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:41.820]  Maria Tonech-Tancher, little sister.
[03:16:41.820 --> 03:16:46.180]  I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
[03:16:46.180 --> 03:16:54.980]  Just you get it. You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbitt. Snap out of it, Buzz.
[03:16:54.980 --> 03:17:02.420]  Yeah, that's Ted Cruz. He's Mrs. Nesbitt. And he's been Mrs. Nesbitt in my book and
[03:17:02.420 --> 03:17:08.220]  my household ever since he went to a Tea Party with a bunch of GOP women donors instead of
[03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:09.660]  going to the open carry rally.
[03:17:09.660 --> 03:17:13.700]  The guy is a phony. And let me go to the issues on their website. Let's talk about a couple
[03:17:13.700 --> 03:17:17.780]  of issues here, okay? When you go to Ted Cruz's website and you look at the issues, here's
[03:17:17.780 --> 03:17:19.180]  the ones that he has here.
[03:17:19.180 --> 03:17:22.940]  Restore the Constitution. Second Amendment rights. Secure the border. Defend our nation.
[03:17:22.940 --> 03:17:29.100]  Stand with Israel. Stand with Israel. Why single? Okay. Religious liberty, life, marriage,
[03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:32.580]  education, family, jobs and opportunity, and reign in Washington, okay?
[03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:37.740]  You go to Donald Trump. Here's his issues. Pay for the wall. Healthcare reform, U.S.
[03:17:37.740 --> 03:17:43.140]  China trade reform, Veterans Administration reforms, tax reform, Second Amendment rights,
[03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:44.140]  immigration reform.
[03:17:44.140 --> 03:17:50.020]  Now, he doesn't have as many issues, but Donald Trump has very detailed. I've never seen
[03:17:50.020 --> 03:17:54.260]  as detailed a policy statements from any candidate in all the policy statements I've been looking
[03:17:54.260 --> 03:17:58.900]  at. We're gonna look at some of these things, but notice what is missing off of Ted Cruz?
[03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:02.660]  There's nothing about Obamacare. You see, the reason he was speaking to the Republican
[03:18:02.660 --> 03:18:06.260]  women, well, he know the reason he was speaking to them at their Tea Party, he wanted their
[03:18:06.260 --> 03:18:07.260]  money, okay?
[03:18:07.260 --> 03:18:13.100]  But what he was talking to them about was Obamacare. He's gonna do something about Obamacare.
[03:18:13.100 --> 03:18:17.580]  Here he is. He's been running for a long time, and there's absolutely nothing I see on his
[03:18:17.580 --> 03:18:21.060]  issues, and I've looked at several of these. I thought, well, maybe he's got it under Restore
[03:18:21.060 --> 03:18:25.100]  the Constitution or reign in Washington or what? I haven't seen anything about Obamacare.
[03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:29.100]  You know what? He doesn't have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. I talked about this before. How
[03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:32.460]  many times have we been lied to by the GOP establishment saying they're gonna get rid
[03:18:32.460 --> 03:18:36.420]  of Obamacare and they don't have a plan to get rid of it? They don't have a plan to replace
[03:18:36.420 --> 03:18:41.340]  it? They don't have a plan because they don't plan to do anything about it. They wave this
[03:18:41.340 --> 03:18:48.100]  in front of you. Again, it's another dog whistle for their loyal pack of followers to get you
[03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:51.660]  to vote for them, and they have absolutely no intention of doing anything about it. If
[03:18:51.660 --> 03:18:55.860]  you go to Donald Trump's site, yeah, healthcare reform is one of the big things up there.
[03:18:55.860 --> 03:19:00.540]  Why? Because he knows, like immigration reform, he knows that healthcare reform was what
[03:19:00.540 --> 03:19:05.100]  Republicans wanted, and it's what the Republican politicians like Ted Cruz won't do anything
[03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:09.360]  about. Won't do anything about it. They don't have a plan. They don't plan to do anything
[03:19:09.360 --> 03:19:12.980]  about it. If you look at, and we've mentioned this before, if you look at Donald Trump,
[03:19:12.980 --> 03:19:17.620]  he's got a very detailed healthcare plan. He's got seven detailed points. First one, eliminate
[03:19:17.620 --> 03:19:23.380]  the mandate. Second one, let's get rid of the laws that prohibit competition across
[03:19:23.380 --> 03:19:29.100]  state lines. Do you understand how upside down that is? We have the globalists like
[03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:34.540]  Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan who want to have free trade, they say. So we need to turn over the
[03:19:34.540 --> 03:19:39.480]  management of our economy to a foreign international commission that's going to dictate to us what
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:43.500]  trades and taxes and tariffs and what our industries are going to be allowed to have.
[03:19:43.500 --> 03:19:47.420]  But then within the United States, Ted Cruz, the Republican Party, don't even talk about
[03:19:47.420 --> 03:19:51.860]  the fact that we aren't allowed to have competition between insurance companies within the United
[03:19:51.860 --> 03:19:56.620]  States. So they don't even support free trade in the United States, and yet they're exporting
[03:19:56.620 --> 03:20:00.380]  our jobs, folks. That's the point. They don't want free trade. It's not about that. Stay
[03:20:00.380 --> 03:20:02.380]  with us, we'll be right back.

[03:20:06.740 --> 03:20:12.100]  to bat for you by term life insurance. A while back, a man called me who had had prostate
[03:20:12.100 --> 03:20:17.100]  cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given
[03:20:17.100 --> 03:20:23.260]  him. I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated
[03:20:23.260 --> 03:20:28.140]  price competitive companies we represent, and found one who preapproved him for a premium
[03:20:28.140 --> 03:20:33.780]  way below what he had been quoted. When it comes to term life insurance, no other company

[03:22:32.100 --> 03:22:36.420]  past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad. But boy
[03:22:36.420 --> 03:22:41.900]  was he stubborn. He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't
[03:22:41.900 --> 03:22:47.500]  afford it. He wasn't a rich man by any means. At less than $107 per month LibertyOnCall.org

[03:22:58.860 --> 03:23:03.140]  When Dr. Lane Sebring appeared on Fox News and claimed that he could give seniors a second
[03:23:03.140 --> 03:23:08.340]  shot at youth, viewers were highly skeptical. But then they saw the proof. Despite being
[03:23:08.340 --> 03:23:12.700]  61 years old, Dr. Sebring is still competing in martial arts competitions against guys
[03:23:12.700 --> 03:23:17.660]  half his age and winning. But what's even more remarkable are his lab tests that back
[03:23:17.660 --> 03:23:22.860]  it all up. His blood pressure checks in at a healthy 110 or 78 and his blood sugar never
[03:23:22.860 --> 03:23:27.660]  jumps above 70. So what's his secret? Sebring has been using a powerful green drink that
[03:23:27.660 --> 03:23:32.260]  he personally formulated called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens was originally
[03:23:32.260 --> 03:23:36.100]  created to help older guys in the military who were dealing with achy joints and stiff
[03:23:36.100 --> 03:23:41.860]  muscles. And for a limited time, Dr. Sebring's letting you try the drink absolutely free.
[03:23:41.860 --> 03:23:45.620]  All he asks is that you chip in a few bucks to help cover shipping. To claim your free
[03:23:45.620 --> 03:23:57.060]  samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com. Greens75.com. Greens75.com.
[03:07:34.480 --> 03:24:34.460]  now back in stock. Of course, DNA Force has been sold out for quite some
[03:24:34.460 --> 03:24:39.460]  time. It's one of our best selling nutraceuticals. It has been out of stock for quite some time.
[03:24:39.460 --> 03:24:46.340]  It's now back in stock and it is now DNA Force Plus. It has a new special ingredient, very
[03:24:46.340 --> 03:24:51.140]  powerful ingredient for the same price, however, as the original DNA Force has been sold out
[03:24:51.140 --> 03:24:56.420]  for months now back in stock. And of course, DNA Force is loaded with the patented BiopQQ
[03:24:56.420 --> 03:25:03.220]  compound backed by 175 clinical studies, extremely hard to secure, very expensive ingredient
[03:25:03.220 --> 03:25:10.340]  there, but also it contains a lot of other very powerful ingredients to support your health.
[03:25:10.340 --> 03:25:17.140]  Besides BiopQQ, it also has a patented form of antioxidant CoQ10. It has digestive enzymes,
[03:25:17.140 --> 03:25:25.180]  immune boosting supplements, things like pomegranate extract and plant-based Reservatrol. It's extremely
[03:25:25.180 --> 03:25:29.580]  hard to produce. We run out of it very often and we're out of it when we do for months
[03:25:29.580 --> 03:25:35.500]  because it is so difficult to produce and so expensive to produce in each batch right
[03:25:35.500 --> 03:25:41.700]  now. DNA Force is back and it's DNA Force Plus, same price as the original DNA Force,
[03:25:41.700 --> 03:25:47.380]  but with a new powerful ingredient, you can find that at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:25:47.380 --> 03:25:53.380]  Just before the break, we were talking about Ted Cruz, who did not want to show up to the
[03:25:53.380 --> 03:25:58.740]  Second Amendment rally, the giant open carry rally that we had at the Alamo back in 2013.
[03:25:58.740 --> 03:26:03.980]  He was speaking to Republican women, Republican donors at a Tea Party meeting to get money
[03:26:03.980 --> 03:26:08.660]  to say that it was all about Obamacare, but you look at his website and I don't see what
[03:26:08.660 --> 03:26:12.740]  he wants to do about Obamacare. I know he's again it, but I don't know what he's planning
[03:26:12.740 --> 03:26:18.100]  to do again it, okay? He's never come up with a plan. He doesn't have a plan. If you have
[03:26:18.100 --> 03:26:22.180]  no plan, if you fail to plan, you're planning to fail and that's what they've been planning
[03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:28.860]  to do. They want that issue to hang around just like abortion has hung around for decades.
[03:26:28.860 --> 03:26:33.220]  It's a useful thing for them and for the Democrats, okay? Except the Republicans are losing on
[03:26:33.220 --> 03:26:34.220]  that issue.
[03:26:34.220 --> 03:26:37.900]  So that's an important issue for them to keep hanging around. But let's take a look at Donald
[03:26:37.900 --> 03:26:41.860]  Trump because that is actually one of his issues. And as I was just starting to go down
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:45.780]  his plan, I think it's worthwhile to take a look at it. He's got seven points. First
[03:26:45.780 --> 03:26:50.180]  one is to repeal the mandate, the individual mandate. Yeah, listen, instead of having a
[03:26:50.180 --> 03:26:55.780]  mandate, instead of holding a gun to somebody's head, let's have voluntary incentives, okay?
[03:26:55.780 --> 03:27:00.820]  And then he allows things like, you can deduct this from your income tax. See, there's an
[03:27:00.820 --> 03:27:03.660]  incentive. It's a voluntary thing. You can decide to do it or not, but he gives you
[03:27:03.660 --> 03:27:04.820]  an incentive to do it.
[03:27:04.820 --> 03:27:10.500]  You know, if healthcare is so important, and it is, why can't the government let us deduct
[03:27:10.500 --> 03:27:16.260]  more of it from our taxes? We pay taxes, okay? They don't. They have very high threshold
[03:27:16.260 --> 03:27:19.900]  before you're allowed to deduct anything. But of course, what he's saying is, you'd
[03:27:19.900 --> 03:27:23.620]  be able to deduct your health insurance premiums from your tax returns. You would also be able
[03:27:23.620 --> 03:27:28.940]  to set up help savings accounts, okay? Contributions, and then that would also be tax-free. You
[03:27:28.940 --> 03:27:35.780]  would also own that. You could even pass it on in your estate to your family if you saved
[03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:39.460]  money. So you want to give people incentives to save money. Oh, and you want to give them
[03:27:39.460 --> 03:27:46.260]  the mechanism. You want to give them an ability to know and shop the prices by providers,
[03:27:46.260 --> 03:27:52.580]  by healthcare providers and hospitals. That's in here as well. Require price transparency.
[03:27:52.580 --> 03:27:56.340]  Open up a free market. See, you can't have insurance companies competing across state
[03:27:56.340 --> 03:28:00.980]  lines right now. That's prohibited. Wait a minute. I thought these Republicans and Democrats
[03:28:00.980 --> 03:28:05.860]  who are pushing these transatlantic and trans-specific partnerships, they're all about free trade,
[03:28:05.860 --> 03:28:12.140]  aren't they? Not in America. Not in America. You don't want competition amongst the insurance
[03:28:12.140 --> 03:28:17.740]  providers. Why? Because they're the ones who wrote Obamacare to increase their profits.
[03:28:17.740 --> 03:28:22.820]  Competition hurts their profits, so they don't want that competition. So basically what you
[03:28:22.820 --> 03:28:27.900]  do is you open the marketplace up. You give people ownership. You give them the information
[03:28:27.900 --> 03:28:33.140]  and the ability to shop and save. You give them an incentive because they have ownership
[03:28:33.140 --> 03:28:37.780]  in it. And then he does things like remove barriers to entry into the free market by
[03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:43.340]  drug providers that offer safe and cheaper products, okay? We need to have more competition.
[03:28:43.340 --> 03:28:48.740]  The FDA is a large component of the price costs here and the pharmaceutical industry
[03:28:48.740 --> 03:28:53.420]  loves that. We need to open up some of that in terms of generics, but that's what they're
[03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:58.820]  doing the exact opposite of with the trans-specific and the transatlantic partnership. So there
[03:28:58.820 --> 03:29:03.620]  are some real things that we could do. And you know, nobody talks about Donald Trump's
[03:29:03.620 --> 03:29:09.540]  healthcare program. It's a very detailed program. It's all free market stuff. It's all really
[03:29:09.540 --> 03:29:15.100]  stuff. He didn't dream this up. It's not some crazy wacko idea. This is all stuff I've
[03:29:15.100 --> 03:29:19.940]  been seeing in conservative and libertarian think tanks and free market think tanks.
[03:29:19.940 --> 03:29:25.260]  I've been seeing this for 25 years because you know, it's 25 years ago that Hillary Clinton
[03:29:25.260 --> 03:29:29.900]  wanted to take over healthcare. And at that point, there were a lot of think tanks that
[03:29:29.900 --> 03:29:33.780]  started coming up with what can we do to make healthcare more affordable, to control the
[03:29:33.780 --> 03:29:37.220]  cost, to do all these things. So they've been working on this for a long time. He put it
[03:29:37.220 --> 03:29:41.380]  all together. Nobody wants to talk about that. They want to say Donald Trump, you know, they
[03:29:41.380 --> 03:29:44.980]  don't want to talk about his issues. They want to say he has issues. No, he's got real
[03:29:44.980 --> 03:29:48.700]  issues to talk about. They just won't talk about that. They try to talk about this personality.
[03:29:48.700 --> 03:29:49.820]  Stay with us. We'll come back.
[03:29:49.820 --> 03:29:59.500]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.500 --> 03:30:04.780]  Secret agents from several countries, including intermediaries of the CIA, have used services
[03:30:04.780 --> 03:30:10.580]  of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca in order to conceal their activities. A German newspaper
[03:30:10.580 --> 03:30:15.580]  has reported on Tuesday. Secret agents and their informants have made wide use of the
[03:30:15.580 --> 03:30:21.340]  company's services, wrote the newspaper, which obtained a massive stash of 11.5 million
[03:30:21.340 --> 03:30:26.500]  documents from the company that is sending shockwaves around the globe. Agents have opened
[03:30:26.500 --> 03:30:31.140]  shell companies to conceal their activities. Among them are close intermediaries of the
[03:30:31.140 --> 03:30:36.820]  CIA, the newspaper reported. The report from Yahoo News states that the Munich-based newspaper
[03:30:36.820 --> 03:30:42.860]  said Fonseca's clients included several players in the 1980s Iran-Contra scandal, which saw
[03:30:42.860 --> 03:30:49.220]  senior U.S. officials facilitate arms sales to Iran in a bid to secure the release of American
[03:30:49.220 --> 03:30:56.220]  hostages and fund Nicaragua's Contra Rebels. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[03:30:56.220 --> 03:31:03.460]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[03:31:03.460 --> 03:31:07.980]  called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[03:31:07.980 --> 03:31:12.900]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government, knowingly, started
[03:31:12.900 --> 03:31:17.580]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family,
[03:31:17.580 --> 03:31:22.380]  into the water. They took the good halogen M and put the deadly halogen M. And when the
[03:31:22.380 --> 03:31:27.180]  Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how
[03:31:27.180 --> 03:31:32.980]  to prepare yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[03:31:32.980 --> 03:31:38.380]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying
[03:31:38.380 --> 03:31:43.100]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for
[03:31:43.100 --> 03:31:47.460]  yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in
[03:31:47.460 --> 03:31:54.340]  my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com

[03:32:44.260 --> 03:32:47.900]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autoville.

[03:33:22.980 --> 03:33:26.940]  I'm David Knight, your host and of course, as we look at this election, one of the things
[03:33:26.940 --> 03:33:32.420]  that we, even we, who've been looking at this for a very long time and I've been involved
[03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:37.060]  in the past in third-party politics, I've watched how they rigged this to the benefit,
[03:33:37.060 --> 03:33:42.540]  the exclusive benefit of the Republican and Democrat Party and I've watched the mainstream
[03:33:42.540 --> 03:33:47.940]  Democrats and Republican voters believe that this is some kind of an open, honest process.
[03:33:47.940 --> 03:33:49.180]  I know that it's very rigged.
[03:33:49.180 --> 03:33:52.740]  I've seen how many different ways they rigged and of course the voting, the counting of
[03:33:52.740 --> 03:33:54.660]  the votes itself is very easily rigged.
[03:33:54.660 --> 03:33:56.660]  We've talked about that in the past.
[03:33:56.660 --> 03:34:02.020]  We've talked about the connections with the voting machine company Smartmatic connected
[03:34:02.020 --> 03:34:08.860]  to George Soros via the guy who runs Smartmatic now is a guy who is vice chair of George Soros'
[03:34:08.860 --> 03:34:12.940]  Open Foundations Society.
[03:34:12.940 --> 03:34:17.140]  Also former vice president of the World Bank or the IMF fund.
[03:34:17.140 --> 03:34:18.140]  I think it was World Bank.
[03:34:18.140 --> 03:34:19.140]  I can't remember now.
[03:34:19.140 --> 03:34:23.140]  Nevertheless, this is a guy who is thoroughly connected with a globalist agenda and the
[03:34:23.140 --> 03:34:27.380]  company itself began in Venezuela by Hugo Chavez.
[03:34:27.380 --> 03:34:29.500]  Hugo Chavez used it to rig his elections.
[03:34:29.500 --> 03:34:34.300]  It's been involved in multiple rigging of elections throughout Central and South America,
[03:34:34.300 --> 03:34:39.140]  especially in Brazil where the socialist president who won in spite of the fact that
[03:34:39.140 --> 03:34:43.940]  she was roundly booed by 60,000 people at a World Cup event down by 10 points and then
[03:34:43.940 --> 03:34:49.700]  all of a sudden she wins with the Smartmatic machines and there was no exit polling.
[03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:55.340]  And the company that normally would do exit polling took a powder and then took a lot
[03:34:55.340 --> 03:35:00.740]  millions of dollars of subsidies from the government after she won that election.
[03:35:00.740 --> 03:35:03.060]  That's one of the things we need to be concerned about.
[03:35:03.060 --> 03:35:07.540]  You know here in the United States when we look at these polls and I see Ted Cruz and
[03:35:07.540 --> 03:35:13.900]  the popular opinion polls is down by 10 and then wins by 10 or he's up by five and wins
[03:35:13.900 --> 03:35:16.340]  by 20 points the next day.
[03:35:16.340 --> 03:35:21.820]  It's like, really, do these polls, are these polls just totally meaningless or is there
[03:35:21.820 --> 03:35:25.860]  some kind of a rigging going on at the election polls?
[03:35:25.860 --> 03:35:29.340]  We should have some exit polling and you can go back and most of these elections if you
[03:35:29.340 --> 03:35:34.620]  look at the polling organizations that go back in and do what they call exit polling,
[03:35:34.620 --> 03:35:38.340]  they're not doing exit polling to see if the elections were honest or not.
[03:35:38.340 --> 03:35:41.220]  They're coming back and saying, well the people who said that they voted for this candidate
[03:35:41.220 --> 03:35:45.060]  said they voted for them because of this and people who voted for that candidate said this
[03:35:45.060 --> 03:35:46.780]  was the thing they were looking for.
[03:35:46.780 --> 03:35:51.300]  How many people who were evangelicals voted for candidate A and how many voted for candidate
[03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:52.300]  B?
[03:35:52.300 --> 03:35:55.820]  They don't ever go back in and say, well you know, our exit polls said that candidate
[03:35:55.820 --> 03:35:58.860]  A got this percent and candidate B got that percent.
[03:35:58.860 --> 03:36:03.420]  That's very different from what we actually got from the actual election, isn't that interesting?
[03:36:03.420 --> 03:36:04.780]  That would be very interesting.
[03:36:04.780 --> 03:36:10.900]  But you would never in America ever question the integrity of the electoral system or would
[03:36:10.900 --> 03:36:12.300]  you?
[03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:15.700]  Maybe you should, maybe you will beginning now.
[03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:20.180]  And if nothing else happens, that's a major takeaway.
[03:36:20.180 --> 03:36:23.300]  As part of the wake up process, folks, let's wake up America.
[03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:27.660]  And of course we sell that coffee at infowords.com, I'm not giving a commercial for that.
[03:36:27.660 --> 03:36:30.980]  I'm telling you, you do need to wake up America.
[03:36:30.980 --> 03:36:31.980]  You need to look at this.
[03:36:31.980 --> 03:36:36.220]  This is being portrayed to us as this is the headline from Bloomberg, Cruz campaign out
[03:36:36.220 --> 03:36:41.900]  muscles Trump and the Colorado sweep and then we've got Rush Limbaugh saying Ted Cruz isn't
[03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:42.900]  cheating.
[03:36:42.900 --> 03:36:43.900]  He's winning.
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:47.420]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:36:47.420 --> 03:36:48.740]  We're talking about out muscling.
[03:36:48.740 --> 03:36:53.420]  I mean, this really is a mafia racketeered organization.
[03:36:53.420 --> 03:36:59.380]  And when you talk about whether he's winning or whether he's cheating, is this just politics?
[03:36:59.380 --> 03:37:05.540]  As I pointed out before, when he goes and he twists the arms of delegates and he lobbies
[03:37:05.540 --> 03:37:06.700]  them, that's just politics.
[03:37:06.700 --> 03:37:07.700]  But we do that.
[03:37:07.700 --> 03:37:08.700]  We're threatening people.
[03:37:08.700 --> 03:37:13.420]  If we call for that, we're threatening people, but hey, it's great when an insider lobbies
[03:37:13.420 --> 03:37:17.380]  other insiders, that's approved and that's okay because it's all part of their private
[03:37:17.380 --> 03:37:18.380]  party.
[03:37:18.380 --> 03:37:22.940]  And when Rush said that, I thought it was very interesting because not only do I disagree
[03:37:22.940 --> 03:37:25.060]  with him, I think it is cheating.
[03:37:25.060 --> 03:37:33.100]  I think that they need to replace the trust Ted background to cheat Ted because that's
[03:37:33.100 --> 03:37:36.380]  what he is, he's a lying thief.
[03:37:36.380 --> 03:37:37.380]  Rush said this.
[03:37:37.380 --> 03:37:40.940]  He said, you know, we could go into a little discussion if you want about insider versus
[03:37:40.940 --> 03:37:41.940]  outsider.
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:47.580]  And I've tried to tell people these insiders are not just going to let this stuff go, folks.
[03:37:47.580 --> 03:37:50.820]  They're not just going to sit idly by and let you take it away from them.
[03:37:50.820 --> 03:37:52.820]  No, that's right.
[03:37:52.820 --> 03:37:55.220]  Ted Cruz is an insider.
[03:37:55.220 --> 03:37:56.380]  Let's understand that.
[03:37:56.380 --> 03:37:58.660]  Let's understand how this system is rigged.
[03:37:58.660 --> 03:38:00.660]  Let's understand how it's racketeered.
[03:38:00.660 --> 03:38:04.340]  Let's understand who the insiders are and who the outsiders are.
[03:38:04.340 --> 03:38:09.260]  Let's understand this guy with his Goldman Sachs, Council on Foreign Relations, George
[03:38:09.260 --> 03:38:14.660]  W. Bush connections, is an insider, always was, always has been.
[03:38:14.660 --> 03:38:19.060]  He was there to take votes away from the libertarian campaign of Rand Paul.
[03:38:19.060 --> 03:38:24.140]  He was there to portray himself as an outsider, perhaps to unite the Republican Party under
[03:38:24.140 --> 03:38:25.940]  Jeb Bush as the insider.
[03:38:25.940 --> 03:38:30.500]  Well, let's bring in all the disaffected people who really want to see Washington change.
[03:38:30.500 --> 03:38:34.780]  I'll pull in Ted Cruz as my vice president, or if it went the other way, Ted Cruz wins
[03:38:34.780 --> 03:38:39.900]  and pulls in the Bush faction because we're going to unite the insiders and the outsiders.
[03:38:39.900 --> 03:38:42.140]  No, folks, he was an insider.
[03:38:42.140 --> 03:38:49.340]  And it makes me absolutely sick to see these conservative mouthpieces of the GOP establishment.
[03:38:49.340 --> 03:38:52.340]  Of course, Russia's been that his entire career.
[03:38:52.340 --> 03:38:58.580]  But to see these other people to like Levin and Glenn Beck and the red state, here's something
[03:38:58.580 --> 03:39:05.500]  from the red state bragging about the fact that Cruz is stealing delegates in North Carolina,
[03:39:05.500 --> 03:39:06.500]  where I came from.
[03:39:06.500 --> 03:39:11.980]  North Carolina delegate disaster brewing for Donald Trump, John Kasich leads Donald Trump
[03:39:11.980 --> 03:39:12.980]  and delegates.
[03:39:12.980 --> 03:39:13.980]  How about that?
[03:39:13.980 --> 03:39:14.980]  How did that work out?
[03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:19.620]  Well, when they actually had an election there, Donald Trump got 40% of the vote, Ted Cruz
[03:39:19.620 --> 03:39:27.020]  got 37% of the vote, John Kasich got 13, but John Kasich gets two delegates, Donald Trump
[03:39:27.020 --> 03:39:32.460]  gets one delegate, and Cruz gets 21 delegates.
[03:39:32.460 --> 03:39:37.620]  That's out of the 24 delegates that are being allocated so far, okay?
[03:39:37.620 --> 03:39:44.460]  And the way this works is there are 72 delegates in North Carolina, but only 33 of those are
[03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:45.660]  chosen by the state GOP.
[03:39:45.660 --> 03:39:47.140]  Do you see a problem with that?
[03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:53.300]  33 out of the 72 in North Carolina are chosen by the insiders to start with, to start with.
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:39:59.620]  Now, out of those remaining 39, Cruz is going in and getting most of them.
[03:39:59.620 --> 03:40:03.740]  Cruz has gotten out of the 24 of the 39 that have already been selected.
[03:40:03.740 --> 03:40:07.900]  Cruz has gotten 88% of those, even though he only got 37% of the vote.
[03:40:07.900 --> 03:40:12.860]  Trump has gotten only 4% of those, even though he got 40% of your vote.
[03:40:12.860 --> 03:40:16.580]  Now, I'm angry about this.
[03:40:16.580 --> 03:40:18.980]  Not because I'm a Trump supporter.
[03:40:18.980 --> 03:40:23.100]  I'm angry about the corruption, because I'm angry to see this happening on the Democrat
[03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:24.100]  side as well.
[03:40:24.100 --> 03:40:30.020]  When you look at Wisconsin, different candidate, different party.
[03:40:30.020 --> 03:40:31.460]  I don't support Bernie.
[03:40:31.460 --> 03:40:32.460]  He's a socialist.
[03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:33.460]  I don't like socialists.
[03:40:33.460 --> 03:40:38.220]  I've called him Bernie Sandernista, because he loved the Nicaraguan socialism.
[03:40:38.220 --> 03:40:41.940]  That kleptocracy, if you want to call it that, is really what it was.
[03:40:41.940 --> 03:40:43.660]  So I would never vote for Bernie.
[03:40:43.660 --> 03:40:50.260]  I don't support Bernie, but I don't like to see the election run like a mafia system.
[03:40:50.260 --> 03:40:53.500]  This is racketeering, folks, is racketeering.
[03:40:53.500 --> 03:40:57.020]  When he goes to a different state, different party, different individual, somebody that
[03:40:57.020 --> 03:41:04.100]  don't support, in Wyoming, he got 27% more of the vote than Hillary Clinton did.
[03:41:04.100 --> 03:41:05.100]  He beat her by 12 points.
[03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:07.220]  He got 27% more of the vote.
[03:41:07.220 --> 03:41:08.220]  Guess what?
[03:41:08.220 --> 03:41:11.020]  She got 57% more of the delegates.
[03:41:11.020 --> 03:41:13.140]  So he beats her by 30% in the popular vote.
[03:41:13.140 --> 03:41:16.060]  She gets 60% more delegates.
[03:41:16.060 --> 03:41:18.900]  That's the corrupt system that we have in this country.
[03:41:18.900 --> 03:41:24.140]  And that's both of the parties, which really is a single party.
[03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:28.100]  And let me go back to this North Carolina story, because this is the way they're bragging
[03:41:28.100 --> 03:41:29.620]  about it on Red State.
[03:41:29.620 --> 03:41:35.500]  They said the Donald Trump campaign is raising incompetence to previously unseen heights.
[03:41:35.500 --> 03:41:41.460]  His idea was that he goes out, gives speeches to big rallies, and then gets the nomination.
[03:41:41.460 --> 03:41:44.820]  Well, they left out an important step there, didn't they?
[03:41:44.820 --> 03:41:50.980]  There's an election in between the big speeches and big rallies and the nomination.
[03:41:50.980 --> 03:41:52.380]  There's an election that goes there.
[03:41:52.380 --> 03:41:56.500]  And they left that out of their little snotty comment.
[03:41:56.500 --> 03:42:02.420]  That's what's missing from the Red State narrative, voters, voters, you're the ones
[03:42:02.420 --> 03:42:03.860]  they're stealing this from.
[03:42:03.860 --> 03:42:05.660]  They're not stealing it from Bernie.
[03:42:05.660 --> 03:42:07.500]  They're not stealing it from Trump.
[03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:09.860]  They're stealing it from you.
[03:42:09.860 --> 03:42:11.660]  They're stealing it from you.
[03:42:11.660 --> 03:42:14.020]  These racketeers are stealing it from you.
[03:42:14.020 --> 03:42:19.140]  These Republican Democrats, the Demo Publicans, the publicrats, whatever you want to call
[03:42:19.140 --> 03:42:20.900]  them, they're stealing it from you.
[03:42:20.900 --> 03:42:25.500]  They're saying we can only have two parties, we're it, we'll decide who gets on the ballot,
[03:42:25.500 --> 03:42:28.860]  we'll set up all kinds of obstacles for third parties and independents.
[03:42:28.860 --> 03:42:30.740]  But for us, we're automatically on the ballot.
[03:42:30.740 --> 03:42:34.380]  I mean, even when they don't turn their paperwork in, like John Kasich and Pennsylvania didn't
[03:42:34.380 --> 03:42:38.340]  turn in, you had to turn in 2000 signatures that were verified.
[03:42:38.340 --> 03:42:39.340]  He didn't meet that.
[03:42:39.340 --> 03:42:42.100]  And they said, that's all right, we'll let him on the ballot anyway.
[03:42:42.100 --> 03:42:44.020]  They would never do that to a third party.
[03:42:44.020 --> 03:42:45.820]  They would never do that to an independent candidate.
[03:42:45.820 --> 03:42:46.820]  They waive the rules.
[03:42:46.820 --> 03:42:50.420]  They waive the rules for Bernie and Hillary because the Democrat Party didn't do the paperwork
[03:42:50.420 --> 03:42:51.420]  on time.
[03:42:51.420 --> 03:42:52.420]  Why bother?
[03:42:52.420 --> 03:42:53.580]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:42:53.580 --> 03:42:54.700]  The rules are for other people.
[03:42:54.700 --> 03:42:55.700]  They're not for us.
[03:42:55.700 --> 03:42:58.780]  It's the same thing you see happening with the emails.
[03:42:58.780 --> 03:43:05.220]  We just had Obama come out and say, well, there's top secret, and then there's top secret.
[03:43:05.220 --> 03:43:09.020]  It was like, yeah, yeah, okay.
[03:43:09.020 --> 03:43:11.100]  Whatever the meaning of it is, okay.
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:15.380]  Yeah, there's rules for her, and then there's rules for the rest of you.
[03:43:15.380 --> 03:43:20.260]  And we have set up this national security state that we worship and we sacrifice all
[03:43:20.260 --> 03:43:23.820]  of our freedoms and our rule of law and the Constitution on the altar of this national
[03:43:23.820 --> 03:43:24.820]  security state.
[03:43:24.820 --> 03:43:30.820]  But when she openly shows contempt for it and violates it and exposes all of this stuff
[03:43:30.820 --> 03:43:35.980]  that is above top secret, things that were born secret, confidential conversations between
[03:43:35.980 --> 03:43:41.180]  her and other heads of state, when all of this stuff that we're supposed to believe is vital
[03:43:41.180 --> 03:43:46.260]  to our safety, vital to our security, when all that's just put out on an open server
[03:43:46.260 --> 03:43:51.060]  or private server because it suits her to do that, she's given a free pass.
[03:43:51.060 --> 03:43:54.700]  And there's secret, and then there's secret.
[03:43:54.700 --> 03:43:58.820]  There's Hillary's secrets, and then there's national security secrets, and her secrets
[03:43:58.820 --> 03:44:01.620]  are more important, and she is too big to jail.
[03:44:01.620 --> 03:44:03.340]  So that's what we're seeing.
[03:44:03.340 --> 03:44:04.980]  We're seeing the double standard here.
[03:44:04.980 --> 03:44:10.820]  We're seeing the fact that it's the voters, not Donald Trump, not Bernie Sanders that
[03:44:10.820 --> 03:44:11.820]  are being cheated here.
[03:44:11.820 --> 03:44:16.940]  When I look at this New York Times article, they say, as the campaigns seek delegates,
[03:44:16.940 --> 03:44:18.500]  ordinary voters are feeling sidelined.
[03:44:18.500 --> 03:44:22.420]  It's like, yeah, don't feel like you're being left out, please, I don't want to hurt your
[03:44:22.420 --> 03:44:23.420]  feelings.
[03:44:23.420 --> 03:44:26.060]  We want you to just understand this is a private club.
[03:44:26.060 --> 03:44:30.100]  See, when they want it to be a private club, it's a private club.
[03:44:30.100 --> 03:44:33.540]  When they want it to be the government, then it's the government.
[03:44:33.540 --> 03:44:36.620]  And they come in and say, well, we're going to decide what's in the people's interest,
[03:44:36.620 --> 03:44:40.740]  and we're going to take over the debate process, and we're not going to let anybody into the
[03:44:40.740 --> 03:44:44.620]  presidential debates unless they're 15% in the polls, because that'd just be too confusing
[03:44:44.620 --> 03:44:47.540]  to have too many candidates up on the stage.
[03:44:47.540 --> 03:44:52.380]  Like all the Republican and Democrat debates that we covered for the last six months.
[03:44:52.380 --> 03:44:54.940]  Okay, we can't have more than two candidates on the stage, right.
[03:44:54.940 --> 03:44:59.140]  And we can't have anybody that's got less than 15% support, right.
[03:44:59.140 --> 03:45:00.140]  Okay, okay.
[03:45:00.140 --> 03:45:01.860]  It'd just be too confusing.
[03:45:01.860 --> 03:45:05.340]  Now they did that after Ross Perot got in, they didn't ever want that to happen again,
[03:45:05.340 --> 03:45:07.780]  so they set it up so they don't let anybody in there.
[03:45:07.780 --> 03:45:12.020]  But see, they're just a private party, it's just a private club.
[03:45:12.020 --> 03:45:13.220]  It's their party.
[03:45:13.220 --> 03:45:14.700]  They can do whatever they want to.
[03:45:14.700 --> 03:45:17.380]  It's a club, and like Carlin says, you're not in it.
[03:45:17.380 --> 03:45:21.580]  And they go on to say in the New York Times, if supporters of Trump and Sanders feel stymied
[03:45:21.580 --> 03:45:26.420]  by the delegation process, that's because it was designed years ago precisely to make
[03:45:26.420 --> 03:45:29.700]  it difficult for candidates like them to become the nominee.
[03:45:29.700 --> 03:45:31.220]  So, there you go.
[03:45:31.220 --> 03:45:37.940]  Yeah, it was designed to be corrupt and calcified and to shut out anybody who comes in with
[03:45:37.940 --> 03:45:38.940]  any new ideas.
[03:45:38.940 --> 03:45:42.500]  And we're going to ask the same questions from the mainstream media at all the debates
[03:45:42.500 --> 03:45:44.860]  that we ask at all the debates.
[03:45:44.860 --> 03:45:49.580]  They don't change it from election season to election season, they will get the same
[03:45:49.580 --> 03:45:51.380]  questions we got four years ago.
[03:45:51.380 --> 03:45:56.220]  Not only that, but within the election, they don't change from week to week.
[03:45:56.220 --> 03:46:00.700]  Whether it's CNN or whether it's Fox News, it's the same questions on the same narrow
[03:46:00.700 --> 03:46:03.100]  band of issues.
[03:46:03.100 --> 03:46:07.460]  You would think that they would even talk to them about pot legalization or something
[03:46:07.460 --> 03:46:10.420]  because that's got a lot of different aspects to it.
[03:46:10.420 --> 03:46:17.660]  It's happening, it's breaking out, it says states rights versus federal government issue.
[03:46:17.660 --> 03:46:20.300]  There's a lot of things I could talk about, they don't even want to bring that up.
[03:46:20.300 --> 03:46:21.420]  They don't want to talk about that.
[03:46:21.420 --> 03:46:24.700]  And then New York Times goes on and says, well, like any private members-only clubs,
[03:46:24.700 --> 03:46:28.980]  it's a private members-only club, political parties are not official government entities
[03:46:28.980 --> 03:46:31.700]  except when they want to be.
[03:46:31.700 --> 03:46:34.820]  They want to tell us that as businesses we don't have any rights, we don't even have
[03:46:34.820 --> 03:46:38.100]  religious rights in businesses because you're open to the public.
[03:46:38.100 --> 03:46:42.380]  And yet these are people who are running elections that are subsidized by the taxpayers,
[03:46:42.380 --> 03:46:45.860]  but no, they're private party members-only.
[03:46:45.860 --> 03:46:49.420]  They're trying to join us, as Reince Priebus says, okay?
[03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:53.580]  Party leaders exercise, according to New York Times, considerable control over which candidate
[03:46:53.580 --> 03:46:58.740]  gets their endorsement and the attendant privilege of using their political infrastructure.
[03:46:58.740 --> 03:47:03.260]  We want to get upset about privilege, we want to talk about white privilege, let's talk
[03:47:03.260 --> 03:47:09.860]  about political privilege, let's talk about crony socialism, that's the real political
[03:47:09.860 --> 03:47:10.860]  privilege.
[03:47:10.860 --> 03:47:15.100]  And let's take a look, because everybody was, oh, yeah, just a Trump supporter, whatever.
[03:47:15.100 --> 03:47:17.860]  Let's take a look at what they're saying on the Democrat side.
[03:47:17.860 --> 03:47:22.940]  Let's play this clip, you guys got this clip set up about Sanders wants to rig the system
[03:47:22.940 --> 03:47:25.540]  with super delegates, says Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:25.540 --> 03:47:26.540]  Let's play that clip.
[03:47:26.540 --> 03:47:28.980]  Is the system rigged in that way?
[03:47:28.980 --> 03:47:32.460]  And really, I think when you talk about rigging the system, that's what Senator Sanders is
[03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:33.460]  trying to do now.
[03:47:33.460 --> 03:47:38.020]  Hillary Clinton has won in a popular vote by a wide margin, she's got more than 2 million
[03:47:38.020 --> 03:47:42.460]  votes over Senator Sanders in all the contests when you add them all up.
[03:47:42.460 --> 03:47:45.100]  She's won more states, she's won more pledged delegates.
[03:47:45.100 --> 03:47:48.620]  So now that's forcing Senator Sanders to go out and talk about the idea that he wants
[03:47:48.620 --> 03:47:53.180]  to try to flip super delegates and get him to overturn the will of the people as expressed
[03:47:53.180 --> 03:47:54.860]  through who's won the most contests.
[03:47:54.860 --> 03:47:57.180]  Well, yeah, well, that would be the will of the people.
[03:47:57.180 --> 03:48:00.700]  See, she started out 15% ahead with all these super delegates.
[03:48:00.700 --> 03:48:05.020]  The super delegates said in New York when they were asked by a New York paper, well,
[03:48:05.020 --> 03:48:06.700]  what if Bernie were to win the popular vote?
[03:48:06.700 --> 03:48:08.100]  Would you still vote for Hillary Clinton?
[03:48:08.100 --> 03:48:09.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:48:09.100 --> 03:48:11.220]  There's nothing that could keep me from voting for Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:11.220 --> 03:48:12.460]  I make that decision.
[03:48:12.460 --> 03:48:14.580]  I am a party of one, okay?
[03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:19.540]  I'm not gonna pay any attention to the voters, it could care less about the voters.
[03:48:19.540 --> 03:48:23.780]  And clearly, I think she would have a case if he basically flipped all the, I get rid
[03:48:23.780 --> 03:48:27.060]  of the super delegates instead of people saying, well, I need the super delegates.
[03:48:27.060 --> 03:48:30.340]  No, you need the super delegates or get rid of them.
[03:48:30.340 --> 03:48:31.700]  Have the people vote.
[03:48:31.700 --> 03:48:35.100]  Make it a proportional election if you want to get rid of the winner, take all, but you
[03:48:35.100 --> 03:48:36.620]  know, let's, let's at least do that.
[03:48:36.620 --> 03:48:39.380]  And then of course we need to clean up the election so they can't rig all this stuff
[03:48:39.380 --> 03:48:41.060]  with their phony voting machines.
[03:48:41.060 --> 03:48:42.180]  That's the other part of the issue.
[03:48:42.180 --> 03:48:46.540]  But then they come back and they say this, let's play this other clip.
[03:48:46.540 --> 03:48:49.780]  The Democrat primary process was rigged to favor Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:49.780 --> 03:48:53.680]  Here's the other side of the issue that Democrats have set up this race in a way that
[03:48:53.680 --> 03:48:57.060]  favors the person who establishes a large lead from the outside.
[03:48:57.060 --> 03:49:01.860]  And it's hard to, when you're playing on those kinds of rules, it's hard to climb
[03:49:01.860 --> 03:49:07.380]  out of the hole because even if you win, if you don't win overwhelmingly, it's not enough.
[03:49:07.380 --> 03:49:11.380]  We saw that just yesterday where he wins in Wyoming, a great state for him, and they split
[03:49:11.380 --> 03:49:12.380]  delegates.
[03:49:12.380 --> 03:49:16.900]  Basically his team thinks, okay, maybe we come close in New York or we win by a little
[03:49:16.900 --> 03:49:17.900]  bit.
[03:49:17.900 --> 03:49:21.420]  Then they move into these North states that they don't think they have a chance for.
[03:49:21.420 --> 03:49:25.100]  They're looking for when the race moves back out west to Oregon, to California.
[03:49:25.100 --> 03:49:28.980]  They hope they can rack up big wins there and then make the case that he's more electable
[03:49:28.980 --> 03:49:32.660]  than her in a general election and have all these superdelegate switched sides.
[03:49:32.660 --> 03:49:38.260]  It's just hard to see that playing out given the institutional biases built into the process
[03:49:38.260 --> 03:49:41.620]  towards the person who, as you point out, establishes a big lead.
[03:49:41.620 --> 03:49:45.900]  Yeah, and of course I talked about that last night and I talked about it because I think
[03:49:45.900 --> 03:49:51.740]  really the corruption in the Republican Party is even more in your face.
[03:49:51.740 --> 03:49:54.420]  Because they just keep saying, hey, we're not cheating, we're winning, we're proud of
[03:49:54.420 --> 03:49:55.420]  what we're doing.
[03:49:55.420 --> 03:49:56.420]  It's a private party.
[03:49:56.420 --> 03:49:59.860]  They're trying to join us and we're happy with this process.
[03:49:59.860 --> 03:50:06.820]  I reported on that last night, you can find that video, RINOS GO RICO, because understand,
[03:50:06.820 --> 03:50:07.820]  they're not really Republicans.
[03:50:07.820 --> 03:50:11.300]  You've got one political party and it's a globalist multinational party.
[03:50:11.300 --> 03:50:13.180]  That's the people at the top who are running this thing.
[03:50:13.180 --> 03:50:17.580]  So you've got honest people, you've got some people within the party structure, even people
[03:50:17.580 --> 03:50:19.340]  who are elected officials.
[03:50:19.340 --> 03:50:24.540]  The people who really control the situation is a one party globalist system.
[03:50:24.540 --> 03:50:28.700]  One of the ways that they get through this, of course, I want to go back, I want to, I
[03:50:28.700 --> 03:50:31.820]  forgot to talk about this when I was talking about the issues.
[03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:40.140]  I compared Ted Cruz on Obamacare and Donald Trump, but it's the way they talk about it.
[03:50:40.140 --> 03:50:46.420]  He is attacking Donald Trump on waterboarding as torture and he's, I think, foolishly jumping
[03:50:46.420 --> 03:50:47.420]  into it.
[03:50:47.420 --> 03:50:50.180]  Ted Cruz does it in a much more nuanced way.
[03:50:50.180 --> 03:50:52.340]  When we come back, I'll tell you how he does that.
[03:50:52.340 --> 03:50:55.540]  The secrets of a lying, cheating lawyer.
[03:50:55.540 --> 03:51:00.300]  This is the way they do it, folks, so there's natural born citizen or there's torture.
[03:51:00.300 --> 03:51:05.900]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol or irregular
[03:51:05.900 --> 03:51:07.140]  heartbeat?
[03:51:07.140 --> 03:51:11.540]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:11.540 --> 03:51:17.220]  You hear the ads all the time, if this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[03:51:17.220 --> 03:51:18.220]  That's easy.
[03:51:18.220 --> 03:51:20.820]  There's more money in treating symptoms.
[03:51:20.820 --> 03:51:26.900]  Extendivite heart tonic does want you to be as healthy as you can be and it really works.
[03:51:26.900 --> 03:51:30.900]  Take Extendivite for six months and your doctor will say, I don't know what you're doing,
[03:51:30.900 --> 03:51:31.900]  but don't stop.

[03:54:06.140 --> 03:54:07.140]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:07.140 --> 03:54:11.060]  In this last segment, I want to tell you how Ted Cruz gets away with this.
[03:54:11.060 --> 03:54:14.660]  I want to give you a preview of what's happening tonight on The Nightly News.
[03:54:14.660 --> 03:54:19.740]  Before I do, real quickly, we have Supermail Vitality back in stock at infowarslife.com.
[03:54:19.740 --> 03:54:24.500]  We know our bodies are under a hormonal attack from estrogen mimickers in the food and water
[03:54:24.500 --> 03:54:25.500]  supply.
[03:54:25.500 --> 03:54:26.500]  We've documented this many times.
[03:54:26.500 --> 03:54:32.340]  You can see this with the fish, with the shrimp and the water, how the chemicals that are
[03:54:32.340 --> 03:54:36.780]  washing out of our systems, that we're flushing down our toilets, that are coming out of our
[03:54:36.780 --> 03:54:42.820]  urine and being put into the system are actually affecting sex changes in the shrimp.
[03:54:42.820 --> 03:54:44.620]  Yeah, it's not just us.
[03:54:44.620 --> 03:54:46.300]  Many people are talking about this.
[03:54:46.300 --> 03:54:47.300]  How do you fight this?
[03:54:47.300 --> 03:54:51.660]  Well, one of the things you can do is you can take something like Supermail Vitality.
[03:54:51.660 --> 03:54:57.900]  It helps to sort out and protect against this hormonal attack in your system.
[03:54:57.900 --> 03:55:02.260]  Supermail Vitality has hundreds of five-star reviews at infowarslife.com.

[03:55:06.060 --> 03:55:08.420]  It's something that I use on a regular basis.
[03:55:08.420 --> 03:55:14.780]  It is something that is formulated to help you to fight these estrogen mimickers that
[03:55:14.780 --> 03:55:17.260]  you find in the food and in the water supply.
[03:55:17.260 --> 03:55:20.140]  And right now, it is in stock at infowarslife.com.
[03:55:20.140 --> 03:55:26.700]  Check out, read the hundreds of five-star reviews that you'll find at infowarslife.com.
[03:55:26.700 --> 03:55:30.940]  Just before we went to the break, I said, I was going to tell you about how Ted Cruz
[03:55:30.940 --> 03:55:31.940]  spends the issue.
[03:55:31.940 --> 03:55:36.140]  But it's really one of the reasons why, even though I disagree with Donald Trump on many
[03:55:36.140 --> 03:55:40.460]  issues, I feel more comfortable with him than somebody like Ted Cruz, who will tell me what
[03:55:40.460 --> 03:55:41.460]  I want to hear sometimes.
[03:55:41.460 --> 03:55:44.180]  And then he'll go tell somebody else what they want to hear.
[03:55:44.180 --> 03:55:45.180]  Here's a good example of this.
[03:55:45.180 --> 03:55:49.060]  When they had the debates before New Hampshire, and they were talking about waterboarding,
[03:55:49.060 --> 03:55:50.060]  okay?
[03:55:50.060 --> 03:55:51.500]  Donald Trump says, yeah, I'm all for it.
[03:55:51.500 --> 03:55:52.500]  Let's bring it back.
[03:55:52.500 --> 03:55:53.500]  No, I disagree.
[03:55:53.500 --> 03:55:54.500]  And we've said that many times.
[03:55:54.500 --> 03:55:56.020]  Ted Cruz, however, says this.
[03:55:56.020 --> 03:56:00.940]  He says, torture is wrong, unambiguously wrong, period, the end.
[03:56:00.940 --> 03:56:05.860]  But then the guy who was with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush
[03:56:05.860 --> 03:56:09.380]  administration, who opposed waterboarding, said, well, you know, it's interesting.
[03:56:09.380 --> 03:56:14.100]  He says he opposes torture, but he doesn't say what constitutes torture.
[03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:15.100]  Guess what?
[03:56:15.100 --> 03:56:19.380]  It took about two weeks for Ted Cruz to come out and say, well, you know what?
[03:56:19.380 --> 03:56:21.100]  Waterboarding isn't torture.
[03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:24.540]  That was the whole thing they were talking about during the debate.
[03:56:24.540 --> 03:56:27.580]  That's the way he deceives people.
[03:56:27.580 --> 03:56:28.820]  He shuts down the debate.
[03:56:28.820 --> 03:56:30.220]  He shuts down the discussion.
[03:56:30.220 --> 03:56:32.060]  He makes people feel secure.
[03:56:32.060 --> 03:56:33.580]  He makes them feel like he's on their side.
[03:56:33.580 --> 03:56:39.460]  Remember, this is the guy who has used data mining to create personalized appeals to individual
[03:56:39.460 --> 03:56:43.220]  voters as they go door to door, as volunteers go door to door.
[03:56:43.220 --> 03:56:46.340]  He will tell you precisely what you want to hear.
[03:56:46.340 --> 03:56:48.460]  And then who knows what this guy will do.
[03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:52.740]  Now, they're talking about Paul Ryan as, we don't know what he's doing.
[03:56:52.740 --> 03:56:53.740]  He's going around.
[03:56:53.740 --> 03:56:55.300]  He's campaigning for something.
[03:56:55.300 --> 03:56:56.300]  Maybe it's this time.
[03:56:56.300 --> 03:56:57.300]  Maybe it's four years from now.
[03:56:57.300 --> 03:56:58.300]  We really don't know.
[03:56:58.300 --> 03:57:05.100]  But I want you to consider the guy that is now being looked at, the guy who was the longest
[03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:08.300]  serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, Dennis Hastert.
[03:57:08.300 --> 03:57:10.780]  There's a lot of news about Dennis Hastert.
[03:57:10.780 --> 03:57:15.380]  You think that they won't put corrupt people in office?
[03:57:15.380 --> 03:57:20.540]  You know, when you look at this DC Madame stuff, I had the DC Madame's lawyer on last
[03:57:20.540 --> 03:57:21.540]  Friday.
[03:57:21.540 --> 03:57:26.300]  It was Montgomery Blair Sibley, and he said, hey, I've got a lot of information on people.
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:27.940]  This is crucial to the election.
[03:57:27.940 --> 03:57:30.940]  People just need to have this information before they make their decisions.
[03:57:30.940 --> 03:57:32.700]  He said he was going to release some stuff this week.
[03:57:32.700 --> 03:57:36.460]  He's been blocked from releasing individual names, but he says, hey, there's somebody
[03:57:36.460 --> 03:57:38.380]  on there you need to know about.
[03:57:38.380 --> 03:57:42.140]  And he said, other people who have looked at this says, well, we know that it isn't names
[03:57:42.140 --> 03:57:43.740]  on the list or not.
[03:57:43.740 --> 03:57:50.420]  Trump, Casey, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, anyway, he did release some of the institutions
[03:57:50.420 --> 03:57:51.420]  that were involved in this.
[03:57:51.420 --> 03:57:54.300]  And these would be people who are high up in these institutions because he's not going
[03:57:54.300 --> 03:57:58.340]  to know who the lower level employees are, FBI, IRS, State Department, Department of
[03:57:58.340 --> 03:58:03.500]  Commerce, the Embassy of Japan, Lockheed Martin, Price, Waterhouse, Coopers, all those
[03:58:03.500 --> 03:58:04.500]  people were in there.
[03:58:04.500 --> 03:58:11.460]  We've got Dennis Hastert, and he is now, it was first three, then four, then five people
[03:58:11.460 --> 03:58:12.460]  that he had abused.
[03:58:12.460 --> 03:58:14.620]  Of course, they let the statute of limitations run out on that.
[03:58:14.620 --> 03:58:15.620]  They shouldn't have.
[03:58:15.620 --> 03:58:17.260]  There shouldn't be any statute of limitations of that.
[03:58:17.260 --> 03:58:19.220]  So they're coming at him with other charges.
[03:58:19.220 --> 03:58:23.380]  We got comedian Andy Richter, who works with Conan O'Brien, says, yeah, I went to that
[03:58:23.380 --> 03:58:24.380]  school.
[03:58:24.380 --> 03:58:28.980]  I remember he used to set up his lazy boy and watch the boys in the showers.
[03:58:28.980 --> 03:58:31.380]  That's who the GOP elevated.
[03:58:31.380 --> 03:58:34.220]  That's why they elevated to the hem of that position.
[03:58:34.220 --> 03:58:38.100]  Tonight on the Nightly News at 7 central, 8 p.m. Eastern, we're going to take a look
[03:58:38.100 --> 03:58:54.180]  at the 9-11 report.
