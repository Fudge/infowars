[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  We're live on this Thursday, September 17th, 2020 transmission, 46 days out from the election and Attorney General William Barr has come out and stated the facts.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  The coronavirus lockdown is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties and freedoms since slavery.
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.000]  Then President Trump, a two minute clip where he takes the prostitutes to the woodshed and then the CDC, its own rogue agency controlled by Bill Gates says life might return to normal in the third quarter of 2021.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  You knew that was coming.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Putting a national lockdown stay at home orders is like house arrest.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  It's other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  This is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.
[01:07.000 --> 01:30.000]  Because of the great job we've done, because of the great things we've done in other fields also, because of the fact that we created ventilators, we built ventilators by the thousands and now we're supplying to the world because of all of the incredible work we've done for governors who are on every call saying this is incredible, this is great, this is great.
[01:30.000 --> 01:39.000]  Sometimes they're not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it, but we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19 as they like to call it.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  I call it other things, but we have done a phenomenal job.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  I get calls from other people in other countries. They can't believe the job we've done.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  And then they'll say, is there any way that you could get us ventilators?
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  I say, how many do you need? 1,000 ventilators?
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  I said, we'll be able to take care of it.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  We're making thousands of ventilators, very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  We're making thousands a month. The cupboard was bare when I got here.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  And I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid and very, it's going to be all-encompassing.
[02:14.000 --> 02:24.000]  We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems, senior citizens, et cetera, but it's a very powerful, it's going to be a very powerful distribution.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  It's going to cover everybody and it's going to cover them rapidly.
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  I don't know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers, but I called him because I said, why did you say that long?
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  He wasn't that aware of it. And the other one was the mask. The vaccine is going to have tremendous power.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  It's going to be extremely strong. It's going to be extremely successful. We're not going to have a problem.
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  And the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag.
[02:55.000 --> 03:05.000]  There are some people, professionals, Scott, you would know a lot of them, but there are some people that don't like the mask because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you're touching everything else.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  They fail that masks have problems. So anyway, go ahead and about.
[03:09.000 --> 03:20.000]  Tell me when you think we'll have a vaccine, as best you can, ready to administer to the public.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  Dr. Rancho.
[03:21.000 --> 03:35.000]  Well, I think as Dr. Kallak said, I think there will be vaccine that initially be available sometime between November and December, but very limited supply and will have to be prioritized.
[03:35.000 --> 03:45.000]  If you're asking me, when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life?
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  I think we're probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter, 2021.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  And so you think by the late second and third quarter, we will have started to...
[03:59.000 --> 04:09.000]  All right, folks, I wanted to play these clips because I'm going to open the phones up today on the specific issue of Trump saying we have a powerful vaccine with no problems, and it's going to be great.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  That's just not true.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  And this is one of my points with Trump that I really disagree with him on, and it's very, very dangerous.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  And I know exactly what the president's doing.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  It is political black magic.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  It's very dangerous, and I don't like it.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  So we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  And so much more. Also, it's a big national story.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  Spotify CEO defends keeping transphobic Joe Rogan podcast online.
[04:36.000 --> 04:46.000]  And you learn what's really going on inside of that, the mutiny at Spotify and why it looks like we've seen different responses to turn on that podcast.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  This is a big deal because it deals with the next level of censorship.
[04:49.000 --> 04:59.000]  And I've got the inside baseball on that, but we've got the really big news on the Sedition Act and the Attorney General when we come back.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  I don't want to be writing about this prediction.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  It is a forecast.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  We continue down the economic road.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  We're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity.
[05:15.000 --> 05:23.000]  It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will start tens of millions of additional people in the third world
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper debt, which we're being maneuvered into.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  and prosecute the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  This really used to be a power grab.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storeable food
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their game, is to make us dependent on them.
[05:55.000 --> 06:10.000]  So get self-sufficient now, infowars.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide in defiance of the tyrants next to you.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  It is Thursday, September 17th. The year is 2020.
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  We are 46 short days out from the most important election in world history.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  And that's not hyped. Everybody knows it.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  All right, here's what's coming up today.
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  We have Nick Fuentes joining us in the third hour. Paul Joseph Watson always knocking out of the park in the fourth hour.
[06:55.000 --> 07:04.000]  And I also intend to open the phones up today on one specific issue because I want to gauge what the listeners and viewers think.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  And we'll play the clip of Trump here in just a moment.
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  He has come out and said we're going to have a very powerful, very effective vaccine that's going to work perfectly.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  Well, that's not true.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Can they get a vaccine out very, very quickly? Absolutely.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  Have the Chinese already rolled one out? Have the Russians already rolled one out? Have the Indians already rolled one out?
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  Have the South Africans already rolled one out? Have they already approved all these? Absolutely.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  Is Putin putting sugar water in people? Absolutely.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  To end the hysteria, he knows this thing is a giant scam.
[07:38.000 --> 07:46.000]  Yeah, there's a real virus that's very weak. If you don't have immunity problems or lowered absorption of vitamins and minerals, you just can't get it.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  And so I know what Trump's doing, and I'm not even defending it.
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.000]  Do I want Trump to win the election? Absolutely. Do I know exactly what Trump's doing? Absolutely.
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  Do I like it? No, I don't. I actually like the response.
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  I like on the first and second and third dimensional event horizon.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  It's doing what Trump thought it would do, and he's got them wrapped around his finger.
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.000]  He's got them playing like a fiddle in his hands, but it's still extremely dangerous.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  So I'm going to get the number out at the bottom of the hour on call specifically. What is your view?
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  What do you think? I'll lay out next segment. What's really going on?
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  And again, I was led in on this by the White House.
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  And I've said to my sources, I mean, is it okay if I say this? They say, yeah.
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.000]  Trump really wants the revelation of his method relayed to you, but I'm not a puppet of the president.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  I support him because I think he's a good guy and cares about the country and the globalistating, but I do not agree with this.
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.000]  So I'll just get that right out there, right out there out front.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  So that's coming up next segment. Okay, let me tell you about the other news we've got here.
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.000]  Look at these incredible headlines. A.G. William Barr, coronavirus lockdown, greatest intrusion on civil liberties since slavery.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  I mean, I really like Barr. He's got a very deep state pedigree, but man, he just comes off as good and congenial and honest.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I just, I have a good gut feeling about him when I see him speak and the things he says and all just makes sense to me.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  Other than when he pulls fast ones like, oh, Epstein really killed himself and the Easter Bunny's real.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  So he still pulls that type of crap. But my spidey sense does not give me the willies about him.
[09:37.000 --> 09:49.000]  That said, we've now seen top Republican senators come out like Lindsey Graham and say that Comey's going to get to testify and run his lion mouth again.
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  And it looks like Strock and Page and all the rest of them are not going to get in any trouble.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  And, you know, we knew that was coming for a while and Graham seems to have the inside baseball, the swamp on that.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  So that's just terrible news. So I give a compliment to Barr and then backhanded the other way, but he's got a bureaucracy there.
[10:07.000 --> 10:18.000]  And that's really the key to all of this. Remember, Trump ordered the federal agencies putting the CDC to stop teaching 13 week courses that white people are inherently evil and inherently bad.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  And the federal agencies said, piss up a rope. We're doing it and went forward with it.
[10:26.000 --> 10:36.000]  So I've got a great crew that puts up with me. If they didn't want to bend over backwards, this place would shut down in hours.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  When you get up above 80, 90 people, it's really hard to run a ship properly. But we're not above that.
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  Trump has millions under him. And so that's why I understand that he's already pulled off miracles to get done when he's done.
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  And that's why he's using shenanigans like what he's done endorsing the vaccines that I'll break down next segment to try to.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  Black magic is the word I'd use. And I don't mean that in a literal sense, but it's the same type system.
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.000]  I'll describe the next segment to defeat the left. Again, I would also use the ring of Mordor allegory.
[11:13.000 --> 11:22.000]  In fact, guys, get the intro to the first Lord of the Rings where they describe that the very start comes with the credits and it shows the dark lord and the rings and he hands them out and traps her.
[11:22.000 --> 11:32.000]  But that's an allegory of how Satan's spiritual control operates. And now it gives power to those on the earth, the powers, the principalities of the air to control them.
[11:32.000 --> 11:44.000]  Tolkien, you know, wrote books about his Christian allegories. It is a Christian allegory is what it's all about. And of course, the original Satan has been destroyed or cast another dimension.
[11:44.000 --> 11:56.000]  But his top servant is Surin and is seeking to destroy humanity and the other angels that have it basically gone along with his operation.
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  But that's again coming out next segment. Let's just continue. A.G. William Barr, coronavirus lockdown, greatest intrusion on civil liberties since slavery.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  What an amazing statement. We'll play that clip in a moment.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Stunning emails reveals on local Fox TV in Nashville.
[12:12.000 --> 12:27.000]  National mayor's office colluded with Metro health to hide actual code numbers from citizens, business owners, because they were so low and how they falsely went along with the CDC to inflate them.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  Oh, wait for it 15 times. We already broke that six months ago. But here it is. And then once you inflate it 15 times, you can inflate 15 15 15 15.
[12:34.000 --> 12:44.000]  That's why they're coming to your doors now with a swab test or blood test. And it turns out everybody that gets the blood test, they say has COVID because what they're looking for is the detritus of a viral infection.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  Well, everybody's had a viral infection. Unbelievable.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  Continuing lockdowns have permanently scarred the labor market.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  60% of businesses that have closed are never reopening the Labor Department fines.
[12:58.000 --> 13:07.000]  Big articles on informers.com. Meanwhile, police drag father out of school board meeting for refusing to wear a mask.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  Unbelievable. We've got so much COVID 19 news here that we're going to be getting into.
[13:13.000 --> 13:24.000]  It should now be obvious that Dr. Fauci is insane. Quack doctor says anonymous sex. Okay, but no movies until a year after the vaccine.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  And their plan has always been to keep things locked down another year, another year, another year until they just normalize it.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  They're never taking off the mask. They're never stopping the forced inoculations.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  And so that's why Trump's trying to take control of the process now to cattywomp is what they're doing, but we'll break all that down.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  Very powerful video will be playing coming up later. Australians chant freedom as market is shut down by COVID 19.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  Riot police. We're going to be airing that video. And then of course, President Trump says free vaccine for China virus.
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.000]  Why is he doing that? Well, to take control the process away from Billa Melinda Gates, the UN and the globalist.
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  So again, I know why he's doing it. It just be better to come out and expose the whole situation and the entire paradigm to the public.
[14:12.000 --> 14:22.000]  So they would get it and then reject the whole fraud. But Trump thinks the general public won't believe him and isn't sophisticated enough to understand a thought process like that.
[14:22.000 --> 14:33.000]  I think the president's wrong. In my experience, people given the actual complex facts, we'll suss it out and figure out what's really going on instead of just giving them.
[14:33.000 --> 14:43.000]  Paradigm shift type activities that defeat the enemy, but still engage in a deception. I don't think deception.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Is good.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  When it comes to politics in large movements, I mean, the military deceives people.
[14:49.000 --> 14:59.000]  The police lie and say no, we're, you know, they have undercover cops. I mean, there's obviously times where lying is not what the classical lying is, but I just have real problems with this.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  And I know exactly what Trump's doing and it's very effective. Again, I'm already digressing. I'll do that next segment.
[15:06.000 --> 15:23.000]  But then the really big news that I'm going to be hitting is all of the violent attacks on white people and Trump supporters being praised by the media and where all that is leading in the George Soros paradigm and how that ties in with the attorney general,
[15:23.000 --> 15:36.000]  telling prosecutors to consider charging violent protesters with sedition. And he actually used the sedition act back when he was attorney general previously in 1992.
[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  And he's got it warmed up and fired up and ready. And that's got the left really upset because they want to bring us into their own martial law to take control.
[15:44.000 --> 15:53.000]  They want a legal form of limited martial law in the sedition act to stop them. All of this is very dangerous, but that's what the globalists have taken this country.
[15:53.000 --> 16:18.000]  We are now in a soft civil war going on. Stay with us.
[16:18.000 --> 16:27.000]  The New World Order is taking its move and they are now going to weaponize the giant masses of foolish followers who believe they just follow orders.
[16:27.000 --> 16:35.000]  They'll get another little piece of green like when the chicken pecks at the lever that all that they're really going to get is the news tightening around their foolish neck.
[16:35.000 --> 16:43.000]  Those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the massive slaves. But remember, they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  And so we've got to save them to save ourselves. And to do that, we've got to expose the globalists.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  We've got to take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes that they've actually committed.
[16:54.000 --> 17:22.000]  Expose the enemy now.
[17:22.000 --> 17:29.000]  So from the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making humans obsolete.
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make your child's brain small.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  The same people that said, put babies in cribs separate from their mothers. The lower IQs about 20 points on average as well.
[17:40.000 --> 17:59.000]  These are hardcore eugenicists. Survival of the fittest. Social Darwinists. Grow up world. Admit the truth. Quit being soft as much. Letting these globalists run your lives. They are your mortal enemies. They want you dead. Do you understand that?
[17:59.000 --> 18:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, September 17 transmission. I under host Alex Jones.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  Roger Stone, by the way, is going to be joining us with exclusive information.
[18:37.000 --> 18:45.000]  And starting the media's top story the last week. It's been everywhere. Top story CNN, ABC News, London Guardian, New York Times.
[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  Roger Stone wants martial law. Roger Stone wants to steal the ballots. Roger Stone wants to arrest everybody.
[18:52.000 --> 19:03.000]  No, the Democrats have said they want martial law. They've said they want Trump arrested. They've said they want a military coup. And the answer to attempting that is military and police force.
[19:03.000 --> 19:12.000]  It's like when they come to burn down a federal courthouse and then the feds wait till they're breaking in and throwing firebombs to even arrest them. And it's called a police state.
[19:12.000 --> 19:20.000]  No, a police state is the globalist getting control of our constitutional republic. And then you're in a hellhole.
[19:20.000 --> 19:28.000]  So we better damn well see force out of the state and local governments and federal against this. I expect that.
[19:28.000 --> 19:38.000]  I'm Mr. Anti-Police State. I'm Mr. Republic. I don't want a democracy where 51% say white people are bad and then put me in a prison.
[19:38.000 --> 19:45.000]  In a republic, I'm protected whether I'm white or I'm black, whether I'm rich or whether I'm poor. Sorry, I'm digression.
[19:45.000 --> 19:53.000]  So what's really going on with President Trump? You notice Trump came out six months ago when they were first starting to push a vaccine.
[19:53.000 --> 20:03.000]  He said, you know, I think only old people are getting sick from this. Only old people should take it. And he said in those press conferences and two different ones, you know, kids get hurt the most by vaccines.
[20:03.000 --> 20:08.000]  They should probably skip it. And he said it shouldn't be mandatory.
[20:08.000 --> 20:19.000]  Then he watched the CDC controlled by Bill Gates and the big banks and China and the EU come out and say, oh, we got to keep a lockdown until we get the vaccine.
[20:19.000 --> 20:30.000]  We'll get the vaccine till the third quarter of 2021. And they've now officially said that again yesterday in hearings.
[20:30.000 --> 20:40.000]  Mr. Redfield. Now that's because they've got this new vaccine that actually goes in and changes the DNA of the cell that's so dangerous.
[20:40.000 --> 20:49.000]  And they want to slap down all the other vaccines, which actually take COVID and then inject it in the body and hope your body learns how to defeat it.
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  Still dangerous, still has problems. But by Trump coming out like Russia did, he's really following Russia's lead.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  They always say he's following the Russians. In this case, he is Putin. The word is it's sugar water.
[21:00.000 --> 21:09.000]  But the public's scared. They bought into the UN Hype. So he knows it's a regular cold. They've got ads running on Russian TV, you know, take your vitamins.
[21:09.000 --> 21:17.000]  That's what protects you. And so Putin comes out with, oh, we got a vaccine and it's a super watered down, attenuated.
[21:17.000 --> 21:25.000]  It's radiated, fried COVID-19 virus. And so it's probably still not good for you. It'll probably still have some deaths, have some problems.
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  But they're putting out a watered down version because they're not targeting their population. China is coming out with a very weak vaccine as well.
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  That's on record. They're very weak because it's not going to hurt people very bad. But Bill Gates is on TV going, oh, this is going to be the strongest vaccine ever.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  Old people need four to five young people to there's going to be 700,000 people get sick and die. You know, it'd be way worse than that.
[21:46.000 --> 22:01.000]  And so Trump looked at all that and was like, how do we take control of this? And in the lockdown, because Gates just people, these have been in decades getting into all the government positions, you know, 50 deep.
[22:01.000 --> 22:08.000]  They're going to hold us hostage with this until they have the vaccine he approves of the four companies he's putting out that isn't even a classic vaccine.
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  Again, it goes in and reprograms the cells. That's called cancer and creates these proteins that the studies actually say are dangerous and turn off chromosome number eight.
[22:17.000 --> 22:31.000]  You might want to look into what chromosome number eight does. Look up chromosome number eight being turned off. What happens if you don't have chromosome eight fully expressed low IQ sluggish stupid and you'd live about half as long.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  Oh, that's if it partially turned off. If it's turned off, you're lucky you never make it out of mama.
[22:38.000 --> 22:46.000]  It turns out the more vibrant you are, the more powerful you are, the more connected you are the stronger chromosome eight is.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  By the way, I had a full genetic background done four years ago. Very expensive one.
[22:50.000 --> 23:01.000]  Actually, two of them done. And let's just say my mitochondria and my chromosome eight are operating at mutant level strengths, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:01.000 --> 23:19.000]  And what they've also noticed is a lot of people are either having their chromosomes get weaker and are failing, but some people are now being born under all the radiation and toxic food and just like rats or roaches will become resistant to pesticide and stuff.
[23:19.000 --> 23:27.000]  We are mutants now folks, the radiation, the nuclear fallout, the reactors, all of it. We're all mutants.
[23:27.000 --> 23:37.000]  That's another thing worries the globalist is they know there's all these people that have, you know, there's always been humans with freakish powers, not like the movies with the mutants, but the real deal.
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  And now it's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:41.000 --> 23:57.000]  And so Gates has a vaccine that on record in all the studies I showed you last week attacks the eighth chromosome vaccines again have never gone in and change the DNA of a cell.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  They've never gone in and programmed a cell to do something.
[24:01.000 --> 24:13.000]  They have trained white blood cells, how to identify a pathogen in a weakened form to learn how to beat it. The next time it comes, but the autoimmune response to learning that fight can still kill you or mania.
[24:13.000 --> 24:25.000]  But as a real science, but I digress, there's the whole Trojan horse aspects, but let me just get back to Trump that I'll have Roger Stone on and give the number out and we'll take your calls on the subject at your view.
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  Trump takes control from Gates of the vaccine process. He's been able to get cleaner weaker vaccines for those that want it.
[24:31.000 --> 24:43.000]  He's been able to keep the economy going and try to break COVID hysteria and the frauds back before the election, which he's now doing through the CDC is taking control of.
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  So thank God he's contradicting Redfield. Thank God he's got a new task force of other scientists that are coming out and backing the real science.
[24:50.000 --> 25:04.000]  So Trump's doing everything real behind the scenes and out in the open. But by taking the wind out of their sales, he's got Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton saying, I would not trust anything.
[25:04.000 --> 25:15.000]  He says, do not take a vaccine from Trump. And now because Trump's in control of the CDC, he's getting control. Gates goes, trust my vaccine, but don't trust the CDC's vaccine.
[25:15.000 --> 25:26.000]  And then I went and looked up the ones that Trump's looking at. They're very weak, attenuated, classic viruses with a very low amount of adjuvant in it.
[25:26.000 --> 25:36.000]  And what is adjuvant? It makes your body have an autoimmune response because a lot of times if a vaccine's weak, which again doesn't hurt you as bad, you're not going to have the autoimmune response.
[25:36.000 --> 25:48.000]  You're not going to form antibodies. So they've got to give you the squalene or the mercury or the aluminum to trigger that. And so, yeah, Trump's looking at basically sugar water for folks.
[25:48.000 --> 25:59.000]  Can we take a little bit of a attenuated, you know, microwaves or radiated COVID deal? Absolutely. COVID's already everywhere anyways.
[25:59.000 --> 26:08.000]  And so I know what Trump's doing. I'd rather him just come out and expose Fauci and expose Bill Gates and expose the Wuhan lab and everything they did. And he's doing it through servants. We're doing it right now.
[26:08.000 --> 26:18.000]  But I just still think it is not the route I would take. But I guess I'm not the guy that never ran for office and ran in one and the guy that turned the whole country around, the guy that's been right about everything and done all this.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  But I remember getting a call from the White House and later like, hey, I heard you got a call from the White House.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  You know, the president just wants you to know we met with him a couple weeks ago that he's going to come out and say plus you can have whatever she wants to get her to admit she wants the guns.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  Don't announce it till she does it. But after you can tell folks how he set her up. Just understand it's not a betrayal. And I said, All right, everybody got so pissed. I said he set them up.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  He did it. They said they want to ban all the guns, blow up in their face, devastated their agenda. It's still black magic, folks.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  And again, black magic is like the ring of Mordor. It means it gets the effects you want now, but then has other bad side effects. That's all I'm saying is who knows how this could backfire.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  That's all I'm saying. It's dangerous.
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands.
[27:02.000 --> 27:10.000]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you think it was magic, you wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[27:14.000 --> 27:23.000]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  They're following magnetic lines. They have magnetic cells in their brains. We now know what's going on. There's even a lot more than that.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter. We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[27:36.000 --> 27:45.000]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system, that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people.
[27:45.000 --> 27:53.000]  And that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated in the space-time continuum.
[27:53.000 --> 28:08.000]  It is now confirmed every organization affiliated with President Trump and his campaign is being attacked out of Communist China in the biggest coordinated cyber attacks the planet has ever seen.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  Joe Biden has openly said China should run every facet of our lives.
[28:11.000 --> 28:28.000]  The Speaker of the House Pelosi has said that China wants Joe Biden. Infowars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day. Infowars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfowarsStore.com,
[28:28.000 --> 28:36.000]  and they're not even hiding that it's coming directly out of Communist China. America is fighting for its life.
[28:36.000 --> 28:45.000]  Everyone that votes for Joe Biden is a stooge of Communist China and an idiot trying to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[28:45.000 --> 28:53.000]  But no matter what happens to this election, the awakening and the chain reaction has begun and cannot be reversed.
[28:53.000 --> 29:00.000]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.000]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids, don't just track your location,
[29:13.000 --> 29:23.000]  but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases,
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  Get your protection privacy pockets at InfowarsStore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[29:50.000 --> 29:56.000]  InfowarsStore.com
[29:56.000 --> 30:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  All right, next hour I'm opening the phones up for collars, specifically on President Trump and him saying,
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  well, we'll have this great, wonderful, clean vaccine that's going to fix everything.
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  I know what he's doing.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  He's taking control of Gates, wants to keep things locked down for more than another year to kill the economy until their deadly vaccine comes out.
[30:43.000 --> 30:51.000]  Trump is pushing a bunch of sugar water, watered-down vaccines that are placebo to basically get people out of their fear and to get moving forward.
[30:51.000 --> 30:58.000]  I get what he's doing, but let's shift gears to the election now.
[30:58.000 --> 31:08.000]  You've got William Barr coming out and saying that we should use the Sedition Act against Antifa and the Democrats.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  I mean, they're trying to overthrow the government.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  They're saying we're going to challenge the election, have states secede.
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  That's what Abraham Lincoln did.
[31:15.000 --> 31:18.000]  And this attorney general, when he was attorney general previously in 1992, he did it before.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  So I'm against a police state.
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  A police state is the rule of law broken.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  People think of a police state as the police.
[31:25.000 --> 31:31.000]  That has nothing to do with a police state other than they're the enforcers at the lowest level.
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  And so I want our republic to be saved.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  And we have seen, usually I have to beg Roger to come on in such demand.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  He's so busy, but he called me last Saturday and he said, I better come on.
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  Have you paid attention to the news?
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  And I said, not really. And he goes, type in Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  Thousands of hits.
[31:51.000 --> 31:57.000]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, London Guardian, London Independent, LA Times, San Francisco, I mean, thousands.
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  ABC News, CNN, MSNBC.
[32:00.000 --> 32:03.000]  Roger Stone wants martial law.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  Roger Stone wants suspension of constitution.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  Roger Stone wants all the Democrats arrested.
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  He's Adolf Hitler.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  And the young turds and others are a great example of it.
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  I'm not going to play the whole piece.
[32:13.000 --> 32:14.000]  I'll play a minute or two here.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  They play eight minutes of it edited.
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  Never saying it's info wars.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Editing what Roger said to make it sound like this.
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  I was showing him mainline news saying, General Mattis wanted martial law.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  Democrats want martial law down.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  They plan with the Soros funded transition group to hold things up and have people burn down cities.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  Atlantic Monthly says that there's going to be riots and burning down cities if Trump wins.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  They're trying to hold us hostage.
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  And he said the constitutional response to fraudulent ballots,
[32:45.000 --> 32:49.000]  the constitutional response to Democrat precincts engage in fraud,
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  is a federal or state response, which is the law.
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  So they start the fight.
[32:55.000 --> 32:59.000]  And then they come to us when we say, okay, well, we'll meet that threat.
[32:59.000 --> 33:01.000]  But so they got a problem.
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  Now Barr, since Stone said this last Wednesday on the show,
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  they got huge natural news of the weekend.
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  And through still now, it's all over the news.
[33:08.000 --> 33:12.000]  It was in the local paper two days ago, front page.
[33:12.000 --> 33:15.000]  I want fascism and to put everybody in concentration camps.
[33:15.000 --> 33:17.000]  It's the left wants to burn down the cities.
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  It's the left wants to kill the cops.
[33:19.000 --> 33:22.000]  It's the left that I've got all these stacks of news that just says kill white people.
[33:22.000 --> 33:23.000]  This is crazy.
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.000]  So I'm glad Roger could come back to talk about this and some other subjects next segment,
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  but it all ties together.
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  Barr gets it.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  He's now saying sedition against Antifa Insurrection Act,
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  because that's what this is.
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  We didn't take us here.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  We're not the ones burning down cities, Roger.
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  We're not the ones saying we're going to have states secede like John Podesta,
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  the New York Times.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  I mean, they're the ones that brought us here, Roger.
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  And then when we respond to their threat escalation of force with equal response
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  that okay, we'll respond to you, they turn it around and say that you're doing
[33:51.000 --> 33:57.000]  and I'm doing what they're doing on record.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  Yeah, it's really quite extraordinary, Alex,
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  because we've seen this pattern really since Donald Trump was elected,
[34:04.000 --> 34:11.000]  where the left consistently accuses him of doing exactly what they are doing.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Let's take Russian collusion, for example.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  Hillary pays for a phony dossier that's created with the assistance of Russian intelligence
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  and launderers the payments through a West Coast law firm, the steel dossier,
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  yet they accuse us of Russian collusion, even though there is no evidence of that whatsoever.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  This is the same exact thing.
[34:31.000 --> 34:39.000]  So we have never had an election in America where we had the threat of violence by the left
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  as part of their strategy.
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  In other words, I have been very clear here and I'm really shocked
[34:46.000 --> 34:53.000]  at the way the mainstream media bastardized my comments, took them out of context,
[34:53.000 --> 35:01.000]  ignored that I said that the Insurrection Act and martial law could be used
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  only if there was blatant and slagrant evidence of fraud.
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  I did not say the president could invoke martial law if he lost an honest election.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  I never said anything of the kind, but it is, you know, we're in the funny season here
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  where Alas gets away with saying just about anything, the media,
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  I've been in this business for 40 years.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  It has always been a standard practice for a reporter, any reporter, any publication
[35:33.000 --> 35:41.000]  to call you when you are, you know, when they're writing about you, and that has not happened.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  We are, they write anything they want about you without giving you the opportunity to comment.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  What does this signify, though? They're worried about what you said.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  They really, media matters, sorrows, they're really worried because this is their game plan.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  You know, I think it's because we have exposed their game plan that they have come up
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  with this diabolical jujitsu.
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  I mean, that is precisely the plan, which is to have widespread fraud in certain swing states
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  and then have their street thugs trying to back up their threat,
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  that if you don't honor their crooked election, if you challenge it at all in the courts
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  or in the proper venues, you know, they'll burn down the country.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  It's precisely what they have in mind. I mean, I saw something on Twitter yesterday
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  because I do still read it about roving bands of white supremacists and proud boys
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  preventing people from, this is a hoax, this is a fantasy.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  There will be thugs at polling places, I suspect, preventing older people from voting
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  and trying to scare people out of voting.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  But they're not going to be there on behalf of the Trump Pence ticket.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  That I can assure you.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  Well, Soros is on record getting hundreds and hundreds of DA's elected,
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  and they're also on record saying they're going to challenge the results
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  with this group that he funds that's a consortium of Antifa, BLM,
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  and the Million Mom March and the Women's March, and they're saying that they're going to physically
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  take the country over.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  So there's this addition right there. I mean, this is incredible.
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.000]  It really is, and they don't even cloak their language in cautious terms.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  I mean, I've made it very clear that I think the president has a number of legal both options
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  and responsibilities in a post-election period if there is widespread blatant evidence
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  of fraud.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  But the whole meme of Trump is not going to leave the presidency after the election.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  They didn't wait until election time.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  They've been saying this for three years.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  Even though the president has said clearly that if he loses a fair election,
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  of course he'll leave.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  That's a great American tradition.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  But they have been spouting this fantasy for over two years.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  This isn't new, and it also isn't true.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  It is just as bogus, and I have a long piece up on this.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  It's still called truth.com, as this Atlantic magazine story in which four anonymous people
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  who don't really exist say they overheard the president denigrating our fallen soldiers.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  By the way, we've had private conversations.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  You don't want to talk about about Trump.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  Maybe I shouldn't say it, but you said his weakness four years ago to me when he was about to be elected
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  when he was, was his fetishizing brass, and that he would totally trust them
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  because he loves the military so much for all the reasons of his upbringing, his father, the rest of it,
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  and then you were proven right that Trump literally worships the military,
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  and that that was a weak spot.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  Now, you did tell me that.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  Well, he at least respects them.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  No, no, I agree.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  I'm just saying that it's the opposite of what they're saying.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  Roger, you've been concerned that his blind spot is the military.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  But here is the point, Alex.
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.000]  Notice how within minutes of this fake Atlantic magazine story, the Biden campaign has paid television spots
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  accusing the president of denigrating our military, which he never did,
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  which shows it was all pre-programmed and pre-prepared.
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.000]  Exactly.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  It's a low hit.
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  And this, this reporter, Jeff Goldberg, has a long, long history of fabrication.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  He is credited, as you know, with giving us the Iraq war and the fake WMDs.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  Exactly.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  And now, and now he's back to get another fake story, but that doesn't stop the Biden campaign
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  from almost immediately trying to benefit from an entirely false narrative.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  I mean, I've known Donald Trump 40 years.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  He has great reverence for our servicemen and women, particularly the people on the front,
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  the people in the lower levels of our military.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  You've told me that privately many times, and it's evident by how he fixed the VA almost completely.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  Wow, stay there.
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  Roger Stone will break this down on the other side and stay with us.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet,
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  and saw what they thought was a giant UFO.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  It was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  There were thousands of phone calls made in the police departments, newspapers, TV stations
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  thinking it was an alien craft when the public was told that it was a blimp.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  They didn't want to believe it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  You see, they had already told themselves it was a UFO, so they had cognitive distance.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu,
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  let people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in their houses.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Well, it happened again over New Jersey yesterday.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  The Goodyear blimp was out there with a big Jumbotron TV screen on the side of it,
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  that flashing lights on just like an airplane, and the public thought it was a UFO,
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  and now the public still believes it was a UFO, and now they were told it wasn't.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves in Germany, in Australia, in Canada.
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  And now, even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city,
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  This is a power grab.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.000]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S. for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans,
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  because they know the world's waiting to them. It's a very simple equation.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  It's illegal. We must resist it.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  Remember 15 days to flatten the curve because the hospitals were so full?
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  Of course, all that was a lie. All that was a fraud. The Rockefeller and Bill Gates documents from the beginning
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  on record, they said the mask wearing will never end.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  The social distancing will never end. The forced inoculations will never end.
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  The social tracking through your cell phones and the global social credit score will never end.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  If you put up with it, this is the rollout of the post-human world.
[42:17.000 --> 42:24.000]  I know you know that, but I've seen national Democrat Party statements that I've seen CNN and others point out
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  that Jones says that COVID is a hoax. What I'm saying is it's an overblown fraud. It's a scam.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  But he sells infowars.com masks.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  Yes, if you're going to be made to do it to fly to an airport or by the police on a train,
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  then fight back with information warfare. Have a walking billboard.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  That's hypocrisy to be able to hold two different ideas in your head at the same time.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  If you're going to be raped by these people, they're going to put the burqa over your head.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  Might as well advertise it with infowars.com.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. Fight back.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  There is a forced evolution taking place.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  The scientific ruling elite believe they are transcending to a silicon life form.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  While they are making this hypothetical, very dangerous transition that is guaranteed doom to fail
[43:09.000 --> 43:17.000]  and create nightmares that are almost unimaginable, their plan for us is extermination or spiking the canon.
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  Like after a major war is done, you don't want those weapons used again. You get rid of them.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  We are being rendered into scrap metal right now.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  So think about all your ancestors. Think about your grandparents. Think about your parents.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  Think about your children. Think about the future.
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.000]  And ask yourself, are you really going to let a bunch of crazy mad scientists steal the future destiny of everyone
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.000]  and basically use us like guinea pigs to experiment so they can try to find cures, the cancer and things,
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  not for us, but for them? Bill Gates is the leader of this organization.
[43:47.000 --> 44:15.000]  Bill Gates is the enemy of humanity. Decide what you're going to do, America. Decide what you're going to do, humanity.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  I came here looking for something.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, on this Thursday edition.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  Roger Stone's riding shotgun with us a few more minutes.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  But here's the article by Jamie White. It's up on infowars.com.
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.000]  Fox News panel melts down at where Gennrich exposes Soros, his financier of BLM and antivariates,
[44:36.000 --> 44:42.000]  when he's on record hundreds of millions this quarter to BLM and antifung.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  Now, why is that important? They had the founder of judicial watch on a few years ago,
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  and he exposed that Soros was giving $1,000 debit cards for free to everybody to invade the U.S.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  Soros was in Reuters bragging about it.
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.000]  And Fox News said the founder or the director of it was banned.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  Now, Tom Fitton's the spokesperson, but the director was banned off there because he, Lou Dobbs had him on.
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  It's like saying, you're banned because you said the sky is blue, and so that's who's behind all this.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  And then when the president starts talking about, well, we'll have to counter this.
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  And as Attorney General, days after Roger pointed this out, they go, oh, that's fascism.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  No, it's not fascism.
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  And people come to attack you or come to steal your rights.
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.000]  You say, no, here's a clip of what happened on Fox News with Newt Gennrich, the former Speaker of the House.
[45:28.000 --> 45:38.000]  Look, the number one problem in almost all these cities is George Soros elected left-wing anti-police pro-criminal
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  district attorneys who refused to keep people locked up.
[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  Just yesterday, they put somebody back on the street who's wanted for two different murders in New York City.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  You cannot solve this problem.
[45:52.000 --> 46:00.000]  And both Harris and Biden have talked very proudly about what they call progressive district attorneys.
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  Progressive district attorneys are anti-police pro-criminal and overwhelmingly elected with George Soros's money.
[46:07.000 --> 46:15.000]  And they're a major cause of the violence we're seeing as they keep putting the violent criminals back on the street.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  I'm not sure we need to bring George Soros into this.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  And they cut the interview off early, ladies and gentlemen.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  So here's the LA Times.
[46:27.000 --> 46:33.000]  Here's why George Soros liberal groups are spending big to help decide who your next DA is.
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.000]  And he just said he's putting in our DAs, he's funding BLM, he's funding Antifa, he's the main funder.
[46:39.000 --> 46:46.000]  He just gave like $500 billion to both groups in the last couple months.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  So there's Politico.
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  George Soros is quietly taking over the justice system.
[46:52.000 --> 47:00.000]  My God, ladies and gentlemen, he runs Leticia James trying to indict the whole Trump family in New York and trying to indict me.
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.000]  And if I told you, and I'm not at liberty to tell you what she's been doing, I mean, she is a criminal man.
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.000]  So Roger Stone, again, thank you for joining us here.
[47:10.000 --> 47:15.000]  This is just where we are with these tyrants and where they've taken us.
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  Let's get into Soros.
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  Let's get into Antifa.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  Let's get into the polls.
[47:19.000 --> 47:22.000]  Is Trump really neck and neck, is he ahead, is he behind?
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  You're kind of the master of knowing this.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  You were here last week and you said he's a little bit behind, but gaining.
[47:27.000 --> 47:28.000]  I sure hope you're wrong.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  I hope he's way ahead.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  What do you really think is going on, Roger?
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  I think the momentum is with the president.
[47:34.000 --> 47:47.000]  It's always important when you look at any poll to recognize that just based on time, any poll is absolutely almost the moment you read it because public opinion is always shifting.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  But the momentum is what's important.
[47:50.000 --> 47:58.000]  We saw this in the closing weeks of 2016 when I told you I thought he would win because the closing momentum was with Donald Trump.
[47:58.000 --> 48:08.000]  Mainly because he ran a daring, audacious seat of the pants, interesting campaign that captured the imagination of the American people.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  It's what he needs to do in the close here again, and I think he will do it.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  But will we have an honest election?
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  Will we get a fair count?
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  That, of course, is a completely different question.
[48:20.000 --> 48:30.000]  And I have written extensively about my concerns regarding the manipulation of electronic voting machines.
[48:30.000 --> 48:41.000]  But the Democrats have pointed to all of the controversy regarding mail-in ballots and then pointed out that only seven states are using mail-in ballots.
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.000]  And those seven states are all, with an exception perhaps two, safe states for Joe Biden, overwhelmingly Democratic states.
[48:50.000 --> 49:00.000]  So the distraction from the other forms of voter fraud is purposeful.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  In other words, double voting, voting of people who are not eligible, voting the dead or people who have moved.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.000]  These are all the traditional tricks of the urban Democratic Party machines, and they will be using all of them on election day.
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.000]  I expect the election in Florida, given the last election, to be a fiasco.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  It was last time.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  I think it will be this time, in the same counties.
[49:27.000 --> 49:36.000]  I talked to one of Trump's top people yesterday morning, he called me, and he said that they're optimistic and they believe that there's going to be fraud.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  The lawyers are going to try to block it, try to hold the election.
[49:39.000 --> 49:47.000]  But they said, maybe after a few days, they believe the Supreme Court is going to come in and veto these Democrats' sorrows attempts to drag this out for months.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Fraudulently, what do you think about that statement?
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  Is that show over-confidence by the White House?
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  First of all, I wouldn't count on this Supreme Court.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  We seem to have a Chief Justice who votes for the Liberal Block quite a bit.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  So that would give me a call.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  That's exactly what I said.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  I said, how many of these people are blackmailed?
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  At least two of them.
[50:04.000 --> 50:15.000]  I don't know about that, but I do know that we have people appointed by Republican presidents who are deciding wrongly on key issues and voting with the Liberal Block.
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  I would also point out to Alex that the Democrats are extraordinarily well-prepared for this.
[50:21.000 --> 50:32.000]  I mean, they have legions of lawyers under the leadership of this former Solicitor General, who happens also to be a giant Roger Stone critic, got my eye on him.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  They are prepared at all levels.
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  I think we can get prepared, but we are not legally prepared today.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  No, I totally agree, Roger.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  I don't want to get into fracas with you, but you're a smart little guy.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  I know more than I do about actual politics.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  I know about the general world, I would say, as much or more.
[50:48.000 --> 50:56.000]  But remember, it came out after the Obamacare votes and others that there was some dirt on two Republican members that were appointed by Bush.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  There was mainstream news asking, were they blackmailed?
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  That's fine.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I just don't have an opinion on it.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  Nogget, you're just saying their voting record is pretty damn liberal.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Well, let's get back to the case at hand.
[51:12.000 --> 51:22.000]  So when I go on with you last week and I say, look, we need to have Republican lawyers who have a legal right to monitor the voting as an official poll watcher.
[51:22.000 --> 51:32.000]  In all of these key precincts, that becomes that becomes bastardized to stone wants to send lawyers in to intimidate voters and close down polling places.
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  Not what I said, not what I said.
[51:35.000 --> 51:48.000]  But in the places in America where voter fraud takes place, they are usually places that have de facto one party rule, meaning the local Republican Party in these city counties.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  It usually exists on the crumbs of patronage from the Democrats.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  You don't really have an honest election day operation with full transparency.
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.000]  All I was making the point was we need transparency as guaranteed by the law.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  That gets bastardized to sending lawyers.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  Well, Roger, you're absolutely right.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  I understand.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  Look, look, here's the deal.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  They put out 80 million ballots to gum things up so they can string it out.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  They admit that's their policy.
[52:15.000 --> 52:21.000]  They admit they want the military to have a coup and martial law and civil war and states the seating.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  They're the ones saying it all.
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  I understand.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  But the media doesn't highlight that.
[52:27.000 --> 52:40.000]  And with the censorship going on at record levels on the internet, I mean, on the day that the president commuted my sentence as an act of both mercy and justice and literally saved my life.
[52:40.000 --> 52:56.000]  I had people who had posted on their Facebook pages one time something favorable about Roger Stone, who had had the same Facebook page since 2008 in one case, where they posted pictures of their dogs and their family and their children.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  Sure, they said it was all synthetic Russian garbage.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  That's what they do.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  And their platform.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  They lose it and they can never come back to Facebook.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  I honestly believe the first time you say Roger Stone's name on Facebook, you get shadow banned.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  The second time you say it in any post, you get the platform.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  Well, that's actually what they said to yours ago.
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.000]  They said, if you say a positive thing, you were on the blacklist, but so is Paul Watson, Laura Loomer.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  The big band was two and a half years ago.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  The next band was a year ago.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  Remember, he said, you can only say their names if it's negative.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  So you're absolutely right.
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  It's on record, Roger, that you can say your name or my name, but it must be negative.
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  It must be quote disparaging.
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  Yeah.
[53:35.000 --> 53:44.000]  I mean, again, if someone advocated clemency in my case, that's not a reason to close down their Facebook page.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  But I just use that as an example.
[53:46.000 --> 53:59.000]  I mean, you know, they're not even letting lawyers for Kyle Rittenhouse put a Fox News clip of them saying he's innocent on on Twitter or Facebook.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  Because Facebook says we say he's guilty.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  They actually said that the arrogance, Roger, it's dangerous.
[54:04.000 --> 54:10.000]  Well, we are in the election mode and therefore control of the information flow is crucial.
[54:10.000 --> 54:16.000]  It's not like we haven't been warning about this, you and I and others, for several years.
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  And now we're up against it with days to go.
[54:20.000 --> 54:28.000]  And it's very hard to counter the fake news narrative that we're the ones that are going to intimidate voters that we are.
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.000]  Exactly. Listen, five more minutes and you'll be gone. Stone cold truth.com. Then I'm going up the phones out. We got other guests coming up.
[54:34.000 --> 55:02.000]  Thank you about Trump and covid and that response to the vaccine at your take on that with Roger Stone back in.
[55:02.000 --> 55:15.000]  I'm trying to free civilization and have a post Renaissance stagnation or new dark age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the
[55:15.000 --> 55:30.000]  democratic post humanist. The magnitude of this is unfathomable, but you can see all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully every I dotted every T crossed a total societal vertical integration takeover medical tyranny total surveillance.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  The big tech heads on average have had their wealth cook up 35% in the last eight months.
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  Of course, Jeff Bezos is basically double this. Everyone is being forced onto their system.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  The post human robot takeover. You're being made obsolete.
[55:44.000 --> 55:59.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[55:59.000 --> 56:28.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective. The great awakening is here. Go to banned.video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[56:28.000 --> 56:39.000]  and never give up the fight.
[56:39.000 --> 56:46.000]  infowar.com
[56:46.000 --> 56:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  We are back live. I'm your host Alex Jones final single Roger Stone.
[57:02.000 --> 57:15.000]  Roger during the break we were talking about Trump and the vaccine and you're just like who knows what's really going on. Well, I mean, I was told by some folks on the NRA board that Trump was going to say go ahead, take the guns.
[57:15.000 --> 57:24.000]  Democrats tell us what you want. So they'd say ban all guns. So he could just stop the stop them there and it actually worked. And I was told Trump would do that. He did do that. It worked. He laughed at him.
[57:24.000 --> 57:35.000]  Same thing with the gates wants to keep the economy shut until like what happens vaccine third quarter next year will be in a great depression. The life switch never seemed way before then.
[57:35.000 --> 57:46.000]  And so Trump says, Oh, fine vaccine. And then because there are some that are now being developed by other companies to try to take things away from Gates and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. What do you make of that?
[57:46.000 --> 58:06.000]  I'm never going to second guess the president. He has outwitted his his opposition at every turn. He is beat back to unbelievably media back to attempts. I'm not a scientist or a doctor, but it is clear to me that the real numbers as put forward by the CDC
[58:06.000 --> 58:18.000]  showed that the president aired on the side of caution in the first close down because he had no way of knowing whether the projections from the doctors and the scientists were right. Thank God they were wrong.
[58:18.000 --> 58:29.000]  But there's clearly no appetite in the White House or in the country for another lockdown, nor is there any evidence that I've seen that one is necessary.
[58:29.000 --> 58:43.000]  On the other hand, there are more important issues regarding the 2020 campaign. The single most important one being the economy, which is linked to this issue, but it's not this issue alone.
[58:43.000 --> 59:02.000]  I mean, this is a very clear contrast. Who better to rebuild our economy now that it's in tatters because of COVID than a man who has already done it, that a president who got us record job creation, record wage growth, record levels of unemployment among all Americans, or the contrast.
[59:02.000 --> 59:07.000]  Bill Biden, a man who tells you right up front, I'm going to raise your taxes. I'm going to increase regulation.
[59:07.000 --> 59:17.000]  Well, that was my next question. Why do you think Kamala Harris and Biden have read off teleprompters and said in a Harris administration, even CNN a month ago said, oh, don't worry, Biden will step down.
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  I mean, I think they're getting everybody ready for that right now.
[59:20.000 --> 59:27.000]  You know, just having studied the personality of Joe Biden since he went to the Senate in age 29, I don't think he will ever step down.
[59:27.000 --> 59:37.000]  This is his life's dream. He's always wanted to be president. His earlier presidential campaigns fizzled based in based largely on the deficiencies in his own character.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  In fact, did he kept getting caught?
[59:39.000 --> 59:46.000]  No, no, I agree. He thinks he's going to be president. But I mean, they clearly have him in there because he isn't. I mean, he is cognitively gone.
[59:46.000 --> 59:53.000]  Well, let's remember how he got there. The party desperately needed somebody, anybody to stop Bernie Sanders.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Even they know that Sanders was another George McGovern, that he was an electoral disaster and that Trump would have slaughtered him.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Biden happened to be kind of the last guy standing. He was around. He was serviceable.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  And I still to this day wonder how he won primaries in caucuses in states where his campaign had no presence whatsoever and where the Sanders people were extremely well organized.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  But I haven't had a chance to study those primaries. I don't think the Democrats are happy with their standard bearer, but he was what was available.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  And he hides his socialism as opposed.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  I agree with you. In the minute we have leftstoneculture.com, Roger Stone here. What can listeners do with 46 days left to make sure Donald John Trump remains Presidente?
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Well, first of all, discourage all talk among your friends and your associates that this is a landslide, that this is a cakewalk or some kind of walk in the park, because that kind of talk is what leads people to not vote.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  That's what led to Hillary losing.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Absolutely. So overconfidence is our number one problem. I spoke last night at a Jexit gathering in Palm Beach. It was a great crowd. It was a great event.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  But one of the speakers stood up and spoke and said, this is going to be a landslide for Donald Trump. Folks, it is not. It's going to be very close and very competitive.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So make sure everyone in your family, everyone in your circle of friends, everyone in your acquaintance who you have influence with is not only convinced, but they would get them to the polls or that they vote in advance of the election according to the state laws in the states where they live.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  I 100% agree with you. It's going to be, I think, a landslide except for the frauds, which is very, very close. Every little bit counts. My wife's like, oh, Trump will win Texas. I'm not going to vote.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I'm like, you need to vote. We'll be right back. Thank you, Roger Stone. God bless you.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  Dependency, domestication. In the real world, ignorance is not bliss. It's enslavement and it's death.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential. With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't empower humanity, but makes us obsolete.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  But we're not obsolete. We don't have to listen to them. We can farm again. We can garden. We can become self-sufficient.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  But first, we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists and their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda and with storable food.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  And we have it all, the highest quality, the highest rated at the lowest prices at M4warstore.com.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Take action now. You cannot lose unless you do not take action. We have the best water filtration, the best storable food, and it funds the M4 War.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Take action now while you still can. Become prepared. Become self-sufficient now at M4warstore.com.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  5 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Owen Shroyer with the War Room.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Day-to-night, weekday morning is 8 a.m. And now, through the election, we've got election countdown with the Honola Rain, Owen Shroyer, Harrison Smith, and so many other great folks.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  So look for that weeknights at 7 to 9 p.m. And the show is very popular. A lot of stations are picking it up.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  And thank you all for sharing the links from band.video, the live feeds from M4warstore.com. That's how we win the war.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  You can knock on neighbors' doors all day, but get their emails and send them a link and invite them to watch it.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  So this is the verboten info. You want to see the stuff you're not supposed to see?
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  All right. I want to open the phones up throughout the rest of the transmission.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Nick Foynchez is coming on, but I'll ask him about the vaccine, so we'll take some of the calls when he's on.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And we'll take calls into this hour, into the next, and then Paul Watson takes over in the fourth, but it's on one subject.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Because I see the comments, and I don't respond to comments if they're criticizing me.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Just to respond if they're criticizing, I respond because I care about you, and I think it's a genuine thing.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  And I see, like, Jones, I like Trump a lot, too, but this vaccine's coming out thing.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And he says it's going to be great and clean and wonderful and safe. And, you know, I don't buy into that.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  And I'm not taking it. Well, he said it's not going to be mandatory. He said old people should pretty much only take it.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  I disagree when he says, oh, it'll be, it'll have no problems. But he's looking at a bunch of other subcompanies that are making a real vaccine.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Still have side effects, still have problems, but it's an attenuated virus.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  It's not Bill Gates with this new R, you know, DNA RNA vaccine that goes in and reprograms the cells and super dangerous.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  And they skipped animal trials. Trump's taken control from them, but I agree.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  It's still a very, very dangerous game.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  So I want to take your calls on that subject. And I want to see where you think this is all going.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  He's definitely playing 3D chess on this one.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex,
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  or you can also dial your country code 512-646-1776.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  And I want to take first-time callers, long-time callers, but on this subject, and that's it, please.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  Because I'm not normally torn by something, and I see what he's doing, but it's very, very important.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  All right. Now, this is talking about an important report. It's a John Bowne, Alex Jones report.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  And it is Harris administration brutally fact-checked.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  And it's posted in the John Bowne section at band.video and 2020electioncenter.com.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  Remember, band.video is banned on Twitter to share that link, but not 2020electioncenter.com.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  So here is that report. Harris administration brutally fact-checked.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Please share it if you want to save the country.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Can anyone be surprised if we have more America blaze?
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's de facto army is burning down the west coast
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  and participating blue cities under the guise of climate change and critical race theory indoctrination.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  What are you doing in my property?
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  You're passing through. I didn't know it was popular.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Did you light anything on fire?
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  No, ma'am.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  What are you doing with those matches on your head?
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  I smoke.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  You smoke? Where are you f***ing cigarettes?
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump warns that integration is threatening our suburbs.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  It's ridiculous.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Emboldened white supremacy, unseen since the 60s, and a reckoning on race that's long overdue.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  The west is literally on fire.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  And he blames the people whose homes and communities are burning.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  He says, quote, you got to clean your floors. You got to clean your forest.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  Hots are getting hotter. The dries are getting drier. Climate change is real.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  You don't believe in science. Come to California and observe with your own eyes.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Climate change affects everybody. That's why they call it global warming.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  The wildfires are burning the western half of this country because climate change.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  There's something a little odd. They're not affecting Canada, which is also on the globe.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  It seems like a cover for the mismanagement of natural resources by the Democrats in charge of the state of California to me.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  It's in large part absolutely that. It's not just California. It's other parts and other states in the west.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  This has been going on since at least the 1970s, this sort of no-use forestry policy where you leave all the dead wood.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And so it makes it a tinderbox. Even Governor Newsom sort of admitted that in his meeting with President Trump yesterday.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Admitted their responsibility to need to manage forest better.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  California's had droughts of up to 200 plus years that have lasted centuries.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Recent times in California are nothing compared to the past of where it's been.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  This morning, police say the fires that tore through the towns of Talenton, Phoenix, Oregon,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  destroying about 1,000 homes and killing five people were intentionally started.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  We were able to locate evidence and determine that this individual is likely the cause of the fire.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Michael Duran Bekela was charged with two counts of arson and multiple counts of criminal mischief.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  Biden's rambling speech to the Veterans Roundtable in Tampa, Florida criticized Trump for his support of the troops and the VA.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  In my view, based on reports and interviews, President Trump has proven he's unfit to hold the office of the President time again,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  but nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive to me at least than when it comes to his denigration of our service members.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  I won't say good anger, I won't say good anger.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Quite frankly, it makes me very upset the way he gets in front of a camera and crows about how much he has done for veterans and then turns around and insults our service members
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  and fallen heroes when the camera's off, calls them suckers and losers.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  President Trump's approval rating with the VA is the highest the VA has ever seen at 90 percent.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  It's an all-time high. We're sitting in terms of our healthcare at a 90 percent trust and approval rating, and that's not just us.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  The Veterans of Foreign Wars validated those very same numbers and the surveys that they did with their two and a half million members.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  And when we talk about trust and approval ratings, those ratings are almost 40 points higher than they were in the last administration
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  because this President has put veterans at front and center, and we've seen the benefits of that, and we've seen veterans coming home to VA in record numbers.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  While the Obama-Biden administration, according to PJ Media, oversaw a backlog of VA claims, which had been on the decline when Obama and Biden took office skyrocketed on their watch,
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  unprocessed claims exceeded 900,000 with roughly two-thirds of all claims idling for 125 days or longer.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  From 2011 to 2013, the time it took to process claims increased 40 percent to an unthinkable 272 days.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  More than 300,000 veterans died while waiting for care from Obama and Biden's Department of Veteran Affairs.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  According to an Inspector General report released in September of 2015,
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  there were whistleblowers at the VA, and there was plenty of reaction to what's being called a retaliation and cover-up culture at that agency.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Employment records were illegally altered by CBO Workforce Management Director Joyce Dieters.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  It took nearly a year to make it here. The President, sitting at a roundtable with veterans, VA employees and lawmakers, joined by the Secretary at the Phoenix VA.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  The total out this morning, 33 percent of Americans blame the Veterans Affairs Department and Secretary Eric Shinseki for the scandal.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Waiting three months for a psychological appointment with a psychologist or six months for a psychiatrist is obscene.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Harris Biden administration is going to relaunch that effort and keep pushing further to make it easier for military spouses and veterans to find meaningful careers.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  A Harris administration together with Joe Biden.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Who he today said Harris Biden because you think she's president.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Harris, and someday you'll have to explain that one to me.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Biden's two campaign stops in one day appear to reflect the $100 million donation Bloomberg dumped on the Harris administration in Florida,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  as Hollywood's Latino celebrities joined Creepy Joe for his lackluster showing of Latino support.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  All right.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Meanwhile, Latinos are showing up in droves to support President Trump.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Biden is doing more damage than good on the campaign trail, embarrassing the Harris administration,
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  releasing a campaign app that mistakenly allowed anyone access to millions of voters personal information.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Joe Biden's lies and boasting will come back to haunt him in a big way when the first debate unfolds on September 29th in Cleveland, Ohio.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  The party was not going to go on forever.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  All the welfare, all the entertainment, all the decadence was only designed to get people domesticated, dumbed down, selfish and, most importantly, isolated.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And now that most of the population is selfish, isolated and very, very dumbed down and ignorant, the New World Order is taking its move.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  And they are now going to weaponize the giant masses of foolish followers who believe they just follow orders,
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  they'll get another little piece of green like when the chicken pecks at the lever.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  But all that they're really going to get is the noose typing around their foolish neck.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the mass of slaves, but remember,
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  And so we've got to save them to save ourselves.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And to do that, we've got to expose the globalist.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  We've got to take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes that they've actually committed.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Expose the enemy now.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe and its free will.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists, the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  and openly tell you that you're worthless and crap and you need to die because that will save the earth.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  But they do everything they can to make the most dystopian ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  They are making you hate yourself.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  They are making you be depressed.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And that's what all this is about, you know.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies,
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  It's time to say no.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  World government.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire power.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  In a land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doop, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all others.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  One ring to rule them all.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  One by one, the three lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  But there were some who resisted.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  And sell the ring of Mordor.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  It's an archetype of black magic where a good person can do something evil for a good, but it always ends up boomeranging back.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  And Trump coming out and saying, I'm for the vaccine with these others that aren't as dangerous so that Bill Gates isn't in control.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  So he takes that power away from him so he can turn the economy back on.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  But Scott Kamala Harris coming out and saying, don't take Trump's vaccine.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  It's got Biden saying, don't trust vaccines.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  Don't trust the CDC. Trust me.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  Instead, Trump should have exposed the whole thing as a fraud.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And COVID is a fraud, which he's starting to do.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  But coming and taking control of it, that's actually pissed them off.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  I mean, he's beating them.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  But see, they operate like that.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  They operate at that corrupt level.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And so they're only looking at one stage of this.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  I'm really worried about it.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  I'm concerned, but I get what the president's doing.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  It's certainly working.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  So let's go to your phone calls.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  We got Marcos and Steve and Heath and Larry and Mike and liberal and Jay and Hunter and Jim.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  We're going to go to liberal next, but first let's go to Mike in Kentucky.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  Mike, what do you think is going on here?
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  Welcome.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  I think he's playing five each chess with the Democrat.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  I think he's going full.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  I could be wrong, but I'm like, oh, there's no doubt he did this.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  He was against the vaccine six months ago and said it was dangerous.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  He did this to take control from them so they can't hold it up and hold us up.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  And then once he brings it out, he'll warn people.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  He's already absolutely.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  He's five each chest.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  The question is, is that a moral thing to do to be Machiavellian to defeat these people?
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  He's running effective order on, you know, vaccines have to be safe.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  I don't know if that's going to be effective towards this or not or how it plays out.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  Well, look, the Russians put out a sugar shot because, you know, all this is pretty much exaggerated to fake.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  God bless you.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Appreciate your vote on that.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  I mean, that's what Trump's doing.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  He means well with us.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  And it sure as hell is messed up.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Gates and all of them, they were all saying, you got to take your shots.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  And now they're like, oh, no, don't take your shots.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  I mean, notice there's reverse psychology work.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  There is no vaccine right now.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  And they're saying, don't take it.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  I mean, but again, I could come up with that.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  I could do that.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  You could, you could play games like that.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  I'm them doing that though.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  Because once you start cheating like that, well, when do you stop?
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  I just don't do it.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  I straight shoot.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  I'd come out and expose Fauci and Gates and the whole damn thing.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  Not, not, not play games with them.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  But I'm not the president, Emma.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Liberal, liberal in New York.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  You're on the air.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Welcome.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  I think this is just all theater for the ill informed.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  I think that Donald Trump under his administration, they've donated $1.6 billion or so to Gavi,
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  which is Bill Gates.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  His organization.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  That's the global alliance of vaccines and immunization.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Yes.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  And in my opinion, you cannot donate $1.6 billion on organizations such as that.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Where who, who's actually one of the four permanent members on that particular organization is the
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  federal organization and think that there isn't a relationship, a strong relationship
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  between Bill Gates and Donald Trump.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  And what we are having now is just theater where they're playing off against each other.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  They are going to make it.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  Whomever wins this coming election, whether it be Joe Biden or Harris or Donald Trump,
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  they are going to make this vaccination mandatory.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  If Trump wanted to stop this, as you just stated earlier, he would come out and say
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  to the nation, this whole thing is a hoax, but he hasn't done so.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  He has actually sidelined or he, Dr. Atlas, who is now a part of the administration is
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  now pumping and pushing vaccines as well.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  When he was supposed to be someone akin to Robert Kennedy.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  So it's just total theater to me, Alex.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  Well, here's what's going to happen.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  We're going to, we have a voice in this.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  So we're going to determine what happens with our voice and our actions.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  But I agree with you.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  This could, this could, this could be the determining factor on Trump.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  I just think as earlier instincts were saying, don't trust the vaccine.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  Don't give it to young people.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  It shouldn't be mandatory.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  And now we're hearing it's going to be perfect.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  It's going to be totally safe.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  Well, that's a lie.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  No vaccine is totally safe.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  So yeah, we're hearing the media always says Trump's lying.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  He hardly ever gets things wrong or lies.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  I know what he, I mean, I cover it.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  He is lying.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  And that's what I'm saying.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  I don't like hearing him.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  I played the clip last time.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  I don't know if you heard it.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  He said, it's a perfect vaccine.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  No problems.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  It's going to fix everything.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Well, that's not true.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  It's not true.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  I listened to his announcement on Owen show yesterday.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  And I was just totally not this hot because Alex back in June,
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  when they donated at $1.6 billion to Gavi.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  And then the talking point came out that he pulled money from the who.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  I said to myself, but he then circles around, gives the money to Gavi and
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  who's on, who's one of the permanent members on the board of Gavi.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  It's the who.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  This has all been a sham.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  He pulled money from the who, but then just gave it to the groups that are
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  actually above the who.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  And unless he comes out before election and tells everyone that this is a sham,
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  I will offer notes and I'm a liberal Alex.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  This is the crazy thing.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  I'm a liberal and I was in full support of his moves prior to him actually
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  call towing Jenny flexing to these fools with this vaccination program.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  Alex, this has just driven me crazy now.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  All right, liberal.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  Look, I go off my research, my gut, my analysis, my background, my sources.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Gates is legitimately really pissed and he's legitimately has Fauci undercutting
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  in Redfield.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Trump inherited this huge bureaucracy and Trump at first was against the vaccine
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  and now he's like, Oh yeah, I got one because he doesn't want you to get Gates
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  is super deadly one.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  I mean, I think Trump legitimately wants to get the economy going.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  So that's why he co-opted their movement.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  I don't think there's any doubt that's what's happening.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  But you had the cherry on top of the clip we already played.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  I'm going to play it again about, Oh, it's perfect.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  It's going to be wonderful.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  It's absolutely good.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  I mean, I know Trump and the media says he lies all the time.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  See, I've got to watch him really carefully to hear him get something wrong.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  And I get stuff wrong on accident.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  So I mean, Trump is very accurate.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And that is a big, giant load of horsemen are coming out of his mouth.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  It's going to be perfect.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  It's going to be great.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  But I know what he's doing.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  He's cheerleading for this country trying to get us out of the fear.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  And he thinks the world wide depression is worse than you taking the vaccine.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  I'm not hurrying.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  That's Trump.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  You know, it's all a bunch of tough guys.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  But he did get Harris to come out against the vaccine, that's quite the trick.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  And they are working around the clock to silence info wars.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And a lot of it I can't get into on air at this point.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support,
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And I thank you all for it.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the info war and make your life healthier and better.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  At infowarstore.com.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Please go to infowarstore.com today.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  It is now confirmed.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Every organization affiliated with President Trump and his campaign is being attacked out of communist China in the biggest coordinated cyber attacks the planet has ever seen.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Joe Biden has openly said China should run every facet of our lives.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  The Speaker of the House Pelosi has said that China wants Joe Biden. Info wars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Info wars.com, news wars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowarstore.com, and they're not even hiding that it's coming directly out of communist China.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  Everyone that votes for Joe Biden is a stooge of communist China and an idiot trying to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  But no matter what happens in this election, the awakening and the chain reaction has begun and cannot be reversed.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  The trick that social engineers use is very very simple.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of the species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving liberal technocrats.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  And that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  We build our own environments. We create our own systems. We really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  But instead we're acting like animals and letting the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And that's the trick.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here. I'm your host Alex Jones and it's so wonderful when you tune in.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  It's so amazing when you tell people about the show. That's how we override the sensors.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  We've got so much news on that front. I'll continue with your calls into the next hour.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  With Walton, Karen and Jay and Hunter and Jim and Marcos and Steve and Heath. We'll get to everybody.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  I asked this guest who was on yesterday to pop in for one segment.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  So we're going to go right to him with an update because we did see a huge response and that's really smart.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  That's great. People understand what's going on and that gets you prepared. That gets us prepared.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  And we're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  But first off this is out just breaking the Boston Globe.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  Minutes ago we were just talking about Bill Gates, William Gates Sr., a guiding hand of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  the head of Planned Parenthood, a eugenicist, a death cult leader, is dead at 94 after suffering Alzheimer's for many, many years.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  His wife was a top IBM executive and board member and helped carry out the wishes of the late head of IBM
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  to carry out a world government and sterilization program that was actually a model of Hitlers that he got from Thomas Watson.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  And so that is the breakdown.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  So there's a big article. We'll link to it up on inforwars.com about how wonderful Bill Gates Sr. is and how he just is going to save us all.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  How much he loves us. He wants to kill us. He wants you to die. But he's got a shot for you because he wants you to live.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  Well, I hope he repented to God before he sunk into his Alzheimer's.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  And I hope to meet him in heaven someday. So God can always forgive folks.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  But we'll definitely see what happens to people like him.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  And George Soros, wondering when George Soros is going to go.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  All very, very nasty individuals.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  But I don't want to speak ill of the dead.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  He's Bansomer, is president of my Patriot supply, 14 year company.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  Now the biggest storeable food company in the United States because of quality food at very low prices with great customer service and amazing packaging.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  And so you can get their full catalog of food at inforwars.com.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  But because of hack attacks, the site's secure, you can still order there, everything's in stock.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  But it bogs it down, it has problems and they're trying to take away our banking and everything else right now.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  I've reached out to our main supporters and people that were part of it said, hey, we're probably need to move to a model where you have a website.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  And then I point people there. That's how we have the funding.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Well, I told them that a few days ago and the owner of it was here sitting in my office, I guess on Monday.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  And boom, they had it ready in a couple of days.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  And so folks really liked it. And they never do specials in my Patriot because it's already one of the lowest cost foods.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  Out there and definitely the highest quality for what you pay.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Because there's that nexus point of what you pay versus the price.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  And so they outperform everybody.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Well, there's four days, two hours and 23 minutes, 50 seconds left to get an additional big saving on these different food packages they have that is unprecedented.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  And people know this group never does specials.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  But to support inforwars, they've done it.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  And I know that basically this means they don't even make any money.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  They're letting us make 20% or so, which we need to fund the operation. We're under major attack.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  Just the bandwidth and the cost of five different net security companies is in the millions now a year, folks.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  Where the attacks were under are unprecedented in the annals of attacks.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  These are state sponsored attacks on news wars dot com and force dot com, bad dot video, everything else.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  So I want to thank everybody.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  But Keith, just give people an update.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  Tell people about the special so they can take advantage of it a week to two weeks for delivery.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  You have it in stock at your shipping centers around the country, but you have to get it all packaged and ready, very, very fresh.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  And tell folks about the special because people are really excited about it.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  It's been wonderful to see all the hard work pay off over the last 24 hours.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  I mean, that hard work of securing all the raw goods, materials, the ingredients to make these foods from about 120 suppliers we work with to finally get ahead to pack it fresh in the last week to have it standing by ready to ship right now.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  It's been a busy time here over the last 24 hours at preparewithalex.com.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  Especially you're talking about we've not run all year, but the suppliers gave us a good little cost break here by ordering ahead in volume.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  So we're able to extend that $100 savings on a four week emergency food kit, the one that has the 2000 calories per day.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  And that's important. That's what you're going to need for a long term survival.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  It's the food that comes in two large buckets. These are the water resistant buckets.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Easy to carry, easy to throw in a vehicle or store in your home or stack somewhere safekeeping that lasts up to 25 years.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  That's the one that people are gravitating to right now, Alex, is the food.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  But if you got the moment, we still got the water and air special we put all on the same page.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  Explain, you've got the food special, the water special and the air special.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  People are going crazy. They love it because they know this is a very rare deal you're doing.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  Yes. And it's all together. It's all simple. You can pop them all in the cart at the same time.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  And the cart goes through and anything is an easy transaction.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  The other water is what we call our ultimate flow kit.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  It's with the Alexa Pure Pro that you hear about the one that filters out over 200 different contaminants, gets the fluoride out of the water.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  That's this filter. A single filter can do that. No need for stacking and doing all the crazy other stuff.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  The other filters do. This is a kind of a one filter solution.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  But what we've done in the Alexa Pure Pro is in this special ultimate flow kit that's only available to prepare with Alex.com
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  is that we put in four of these filters.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  So now this unit has a filtration capacity of up to 20,000 gallons of water.
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  That's you and the family that's covered easily for a year for all the water you're going to consume, you're going to cook with and such.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  Also, we added in a nice little stand. It can sit on the counter because you're using each and every day to get all those contaminants out of your water.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  A collapsible water, a collapsible container there.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  In case you want to throw it in the vehicle, you want to store some extra water, it's there.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  And a replacement parts kit, which has got the spigots and the plugs and the such because those parts, when you're using 20,000 gallons of water,
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  if you own a swimming pool, you know, the stuff wears out over time.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  No, I totally agree. But I just want to go back to how great you guys are because I had a lot of storeable food companies and some were great.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  Some became bad. They would be good for a while, but not become good.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  I was just glad to get one great sponsor that everybody loved.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  So my listeners like what they got and we're excited and we had a long term relationship.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  But I mean, you guys are really, I really appreciate you and you behind the scenes, you know what we're going through.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  The attacks here, I don't want to get into it all in air, but I'm having to move to a situation where we might even have a shopping cart or be able to bring people products.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  So you guys instantly acted. I didn't even know yesterday that you guys had already set this up.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  So thank you and thanks to listeners responding, getting something that's essential they need and making that purchase to support us.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers and I want to thank you, Keith Bessemer. I want to thank Matt.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Yeah, absolutely. Glad to do it. Glad to do it.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  Yeah, but you guys really get your act together. You guys have your act together.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  We try. It's a great team here of several hundred people that are working out of Salt Lake City as our main warehouse where we're shipping from.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  But I mean, we're spread across the country. We're in Kansas. We're in Florida. We're in Texas. We're shipping out of Virginia as well.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  You know, this is the operation. So there's hundreds of people that, you know, got it.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  And you guys are patriots and when you say my patriot supply, you are patriots.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Well, we try. Our mission is to help people prepare, help people be self-reliant.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  And the URL to get that additional discount is preparewithalex.com on the water filtration, on the food, on all of it.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  It is preparewithalex.com at the best you're going to find anywhere better than Info Wars right now.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  This special only runs for another four days. I guess this ends on Monday.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  It does. And there's a little countdown clock there that, you know, you can get down the savings, $170 on savings on that ultimate,
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  ultimate water flow kit. The breeze is on there. Let's pure breeze with the bad air quality.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  My gosh, it seems like half the country is in a fog right now.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  Oh, look, I bought your $800 four-stage ion filter six, seven years ago. They've all gone down.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  But the old unit I bought for $800 now about $500. Yours was first at $300. Now you've dropped it down to $200.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Now it's discounted $149. Four-stage ion. You cannot get one this good anywhere near this.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Lowest price you'll ever find on the internet right now. You can purchase online and preparewithalex.com.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Also, we've got an $800 number right there, too, and you can call in and place your order.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Oh, that's great. I didn't even know you guys had set that up. Do you have that in front of you to give that out?
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  I do. It's 888-411-0350. And I'll say that again because it's got a lot of zeros in it.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  888-411-0350.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Triple eight, 411-0350. Triple eight, 411-0350.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Keeping us in the fight and getting yourselves repaired, a 360 total win.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Keith Bassimer, I'm going to get you on with David Knight and Owen Schreuer.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  Thank you for coming through to keep us on air, brother. I really appreciate you.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Pleasure, Alex. God bless.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  It's amazing. I tell you, they're close to shutting us down, but these guys are coming through, and so are you.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Look back at your phone calls. Stay with us. Implewars.com.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet and saw what they thought was a giant UFO.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  It was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  There were thousands of phone calls made in the police departments, newspapers, TV stations, thinking it was an alien craft.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  When the public's told that it was a blimp, they didn't want to believe it, you see, they'd already told themselves it was a UFO, so they had cognitive distance.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu, let people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in their houses.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Well, it happened again over New Jersey yesterday. The Goodyear Blimp was out there with a big gumbo-tron TV screen on the side of it and had flashing lights on it, just like an airplane.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  The public thought it was a UFO, and now the public still believes it was a UFO, and now they were told it wasn't.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  So, for that person, it would be spiritual, or it would be something of a spirit.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains, we now know how scientific it was going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter, we're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people,
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it, because it is a consciousness manipulated through the space-time continuum.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Dependency, domestication. In the real world, ignorance is not bliss, it's enslavement and it's death.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't power humanity, but makes us obsolete.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  But we're not obsolete, we don't have to listen to them, we can farm again, we can garden, we can become self-sufficient.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  But first we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves, and we need to become self-sufficient.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists and their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda, and with storable food.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  And we have it all, the highest quality, the highest rated, at the lowest prices at m4warstore.com.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Take action now. You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  We have the best water filtration, the best storable food, and it funds the m4war.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Take action now while you still can, become prepared, become self-sufficient now at m4warstore.com.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  There is a forced evolution taking place.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  The scientific ruling elite believe they are transcending to a silicon life form.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  While they are making this hypothetical, very dangerous transition that is guaranteed doom to fail and create nightmares that are almost unimaginable,
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  their plan for us is extermination or spiking the cannon.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Like after a major war is done, you don't want those weapons used again, you get rid of them.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  We are being rendered into scrap metal right now.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  So think about all your ancestors, think about your grandparents, think about your parents, think about your children, think about the future,
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  and ask yourself, are you really going to let a bunch of crazy mad scientists steal the future destiny of everyone
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  and basically use us like guinea pigs to experiment so they can try to find cures to cancer and things, not for us, but for them?
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Bill Gates is the leader of this organization.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Bill Gates is the enemy of humanity. Decide what you're going to do, America. Decide what you're going to do, humanity.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  On air in defiance of the global pedophile networks.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  On air in defiance of the Satanist and Bill Gates and George Soros.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  On air in defiance of their will, because your will is strong.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  I'm going to race through your phone calls, Nick Fuentes joins us, we'll continue with phone calls after that.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  I've agonized over talking about this because it's hard to describe something this big, this complicated, this nuanced and getting it right.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  Because even when you try to tell the truth, it's like, how do you describe it?
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  One time I was driving out the lake with my ex-wife and my children to go out with some friends on their boat.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  And it was a rainstorm, I was supposed to blow over and we pulled up at the boat dock and there were triple rainbows.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  That was before, I guess iPhones had just come out, my iPhone was like not charged, it was dead, so I didn't get a photo of it.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And it was like triple rainbows and thunder clouds and lightning with the hills in the background and like looked like a My Little Pony episode or something.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  It was so ridiculous. And I just looked at it with my mouth hanging up and like, that's not even real. You know what I mean?
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  That's like something that's so beautiful, it's not even real. Like black thunderheads with triple rainbow with lightning shooting out the bottom.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Only thing I saw close to it was Hawaii with this giant double rainbow, we didn't get on tape.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  But this is not something beautiful, this is something ugly.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  And I just agonized how to even cover it or what to deal with. Here's the thing I'll go to your calls.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  People need to know what's going to happen if Joe Biden gets elected and what the deep states can do and how they're going to use him to look weak to the whole world and totally implode the United States.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  The Trump's in there to make the United States look strong. Well, the group against that would want this doddering puppet there to totally make us look weak and kill the dollar.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  And the average person I don't think knows what losing the dollar would mean to their eating food every day or their toilet flushing or they flip the light switch and the light bulb ignites.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  So I don't, it's like a paradox. I can talk about what we're going through.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  But you're going to be going through it. I'm just further out in the attack. So I've already experienced what you're about to be experiencing.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  I'm like a passenger that's at the front of the airplane. So we go into clouds. I see it and a half second later, you see it. You know what I mean? And so it's like, oh, Jones, how are you taking? I'm like, how am I taking it? Get ready.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  That's what I'm trying to impart to you is that I need you to get out of this. You need me to get out of this. So it's not like, oh, I think you, you think me, baby, we're one.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  So there's not like some, that's what's so sick about all this is we are screwed if the globalists take over.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  And they've told us what they're going to do. It was like I had London real Brian Rose on a couple of days ago that I was on his show yesterday.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  He was telling the story about he's talking to this high level Google executive because we stalked them as well. You know, we had billions of views and got all these awards.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  He was trying to co-op me. And the Google guy tells him, he goes, so you're just telling me you're going to censor everybody and we better not support Trump.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  We better not expose Bill Gates. And the guy tells me, yeah, I don't care if you say that on air. I don't care if you say we're censoring.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  There's an arrogance to these people. There's a bravada. There's a hubris. There's a hook spot. There's a, I don't give a, you know what.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  And so all I'm saying is, is, I mean, this is bad. This is bad.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  And so I've done the calculations. That's why I'm like, give us the money. Buy the products. Get the stuff because Trump loses, man.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  No conservative or Christian is even be allowed to bank. You're like, oh, they'll never have us wear masks. They'll never lock us in our houses.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  No, no, no, they're going to do it all according to who they're going to bring in the social credit score on January 20th when Biden gets sworn in, just like that.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  And they expect the upheaval. They expect you to freak out and they expect you to come to hat in hand to their local group and get on your knees to them and they'll call Google up and they will allow you to buy and sell that day.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  And you'll think, oh, great, but then they'll want a little more, a little more. Teach your son to be a pedophile, cut your son's testicles off, worship world government, eat GMO, take all your vaccines, and then they've got you.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  So all the banks, all big tech, they're all doing it now to everybody and it's disgusting and it's the end of freedom and it's real slavery.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  Then I see the Attorney General say the masks are slavery. It's true. So there's a fight back against this and we should fight back.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  But just don't think that you're going to like go along with this and it'll just leave you alone. Every inch you give it, it takes its weakness.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  Fighting and saying no is the only course you've got.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  Alright, Karen in Tennessee, thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call. I was going to say that Trump, what he's doing with the vaccine, I was going to say.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  And I believe that what he's doing is actually, I think it's genius and it is bringing the people out.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  If you've already seen people saying that they ain't going to trust this vaccine, it's already for a lot of people who are sitting on the fence for a lot of people who are like, oh, Trump's this and Trump's that.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  This is kind of waking them up a tad bit, which that's what we need. We need to wake people up.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  So I kind of think it's a good idea. Though personally, I will not take a vaccine. I'm an anti-vaxxer.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  Oh, you're right. There's no doubt he's co-opted them and gotten them to come out against vaccines.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  Whereas if he was against it, then everybody would, it was liberal to go out and take it. It's a genius move, but you get what I'm saying about the black magic nature of it.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  Like it works step one, but this stuff always boomerangs back.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  Yeah. Well, I work at a school and so, I mean, I get what you're saying, but I mean, just trying to wake people up.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  I mean, we don't have a lot of time.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  No, I hear you. The only way is to have Trump endorse it and now all the liberals don't want it.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Exactly. Exactly.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  No, I get it. So I guess so maybe he's smarter than I am. I just, I still, I'm smart enough. You're smart enough, Karen, to think of stuff like this.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  We don't have the power he has, but if you were him, would you, would you, would you have done this?
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  I would have came right out and started calling it out as like, you know, I would have just came out with the truth and said, okay, you know, this guy, what, what he is saying is wrong.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  The masks don't work. I mean, I would have just came out.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, Bill Gates ran the Wuhan lab. Exactly. That's what I would do.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  God bless you, Karen.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  No, no, no, go ahead and finish your point.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Well, I was just going to say, no, that you're right. You know, that's exactly what he should have did, but it doesn't matter what he does because he's never going to do anything right.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  No, you're right. Except he's learned if he embraces what they want, then they drop it. It's great reverse. I mean, I get what he's doing. I actually kind of like it.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  But then I feel guilty because I'm like, I am involved in corruption now. This is like a minute. Here's my deal.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  Man, if my wife says his dress look good, if it doesn't look good, I tell her no. You used to add a lot of a girlfriend, you know, because they get pissed.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  I tell her, no, it didn't look good or it does. Yeah, it was great. I've just gotten neurotic about telling the truth and to watch Trump manipulating them.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  I kind of like it, but I kind of feel like it's a sick, guilty pleasure like eating a half gallon of ice cream at midnight. You know what I mean?
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but think about it. We're going to have a, if he says he's got the vaccine and everybody's like, okay, well then, places have to start opening up.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  Exactly. No, he's doing it to end the hysteria. No, he's, he's doing the right thing probably. That's why I'm just being honest about this. Thank you, Karen.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  Okay, well, who's up next here? Heath in Louisiana. Thanks for holding them. Walt, Larry and many others. Go ahead, Heath.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you today?
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  I'm trying to navigate this. We're just an open discussion here, teleprompter free, censorship free. You think Trump's wrong or right doing this?
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  I believe the whole approach with the vaccine is wrong. I mean, I get his narrative about trying to go against, you know, the cabal and what they stand for and all the agendas that they're pushing.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  But when you look at the overall perspective of the people that around Trump, the people that have influence over what's most important in this modern era, which is the Middle East, these individuals have certain connections to people who finance a lot of important things.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  So these are the ones that's telling Trump things in his ears to go against the people's, you know, true purpose and stuff. I think back in, what was it, November, y'all had a article about how China, Russia and Iran were having a prehurst, what was it, training in the sea?
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Yeah, big military drill.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  And it reveals, you know, their connection to each other. And amongst all this, you know, we just now were revealed to the lasers and the satellites that were...
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  I meant to cover that. In fact, guys, I didn't see it in my stack. Pentagon comes out and says China and Russia are now using direct energy weapons in space.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Yeah, and around the time when the Beirut explosion happened in China, they were actually test firing these phase beams. They were blowing up buildings, you know, because a lot of the buildings in China are pretty much vacated anyway.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  So they were test firing on their own buildings.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Yeah, there's no doubt they've got different magnetic wave weapons. They've got all sorts of stuff. But just don't worry. I mean, I don't want to say we do.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  With people that run our country, we've got stuff 50 years in advance of all this. And that's why there's such an arrogance in government because they have got stuff that is just...
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  But there's still a human brain. We still have all the same problems. And it's just... It's like Atlantis, whether you believe Atlantis exists or not, the fable is true.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  You get this advanced technology, you blow yourself up. Well, they're right back with Nick Fuentes and your calls.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't. They're going to contest the election. They're going to say Trump lost. They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  You kept us on air. We did the analysis first. It's now going to make free. We continue to be the epicenter. And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  And you need to stop right now. And they're very, very serious. Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshiping child molesters. This is not going to happen. So they are moving now to destroy me.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  I used to say support info wars. Rescue info wars. Save yourself. Save the world. We're in this together. Because let me tell you something.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  Communism's up here. Info wars is the damn blocking it, which is all of us together supporting. And you and I are all down here with our families.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  My children are right here. But I need money to fight a war. And I need word of mouth. And I need prayer. And I need action. Because that damn's going to come down.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  Crops told you hell's coming. It sounds over the top when I go on air. And I explained that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population, except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  But that's really what they're now externalizing. They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago and actually openly announcing it everywhere. They're going from beta to operation. And think about all these major corporations.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  They tell you humans are horrible. They tell you humans are a parasite. They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of. And then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics. They're absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19. This is all absolute information control. This is beyond 1984.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  I see you again.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  All right, I want to go to Walt. I want to go to Jay. I want to go to Hunter. I want to go to Jim. I want to go to Marcus. I want to go to Steve, Larry. We're going to everybody.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  And Nick Foyntes joins us about 15 minutes to cover the waterfront, a whole host of issues, cancer culture, dredge report and revolver, election coup, so much more and all these crazy videos of school teachers telling white kids, you're bad.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  You don't have speech because you're white. And the teachers are white telling them this. This is total divide and conquer to make the minorities racist who are the majority now and then make the white people racist.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  That's all this is, is divide and conquer. This is so sick, man. The left is just pure cancer. Walt in New York. Thanks for holding Walt. You're on the air.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  I mean, you know, I'm just doing as good as everybody. We are in the fight now, brother.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  What do you think about the Holy Spirit, Alex? Is there a Holy Spirit? Does it permeate space? And is it analogous to a radio, let's say, that we can't see it, but it's here? Could it be permeating and we can tune into it?
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  Absolutely.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  What do you think about this? President Trump needs to lead from the front. He needs to take the moral high ground. And that will win him more votes than anything else.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  No, I agree. I don't like Machiavellian taking over the vaccine thing to stop the gates. He's just a frontal assaultant.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Right. Well, in medicine, first principles, at least do no harm. So if he comes out with a vaccine, that's like a placebo is relatively harmless, maybe not very effective.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  But for those people who want it, let them have it if it's optional. I don't see grave danger.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Exactly.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  Poison.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  No, exactly. That's what Trump's doing, but it's still dangerous.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  And also, I think there are several other issues that are very important. Like Julian Assange is languishing in Belmarsh prison in solitary confinement years, you know, sitting there being tortured.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  He needs to do something about that. We're waiting for that. We're sitting here waiting for him to act.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  I totally agree. He should pardon Snowden. He should pardon Assange immediately.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  It's the last chance that Assange has. Last chance. He could be imprisoned for the rest of his life.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  This stems out of the Espionage Act, which was passed during the hysteria of the First World War.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  And they've never updated it. It's never been reviewed by the Supreme Court in so far as people whistleblowers revealing information that's critical to the public's understanding of what's happening.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  So there needs to be exceptions in it for freedom of speech and for journalists and for whistleblowers.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  I mean, not exactly. I go back to Daniel Ellsberg. He released the Pentagon Papers and he was a hero to the New York Times.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  The New York Times was dealing with Assange destroyed because he exposed the real fraud. He exposed stuff.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  The word is Ellsberg was authorized to do what he did. That's why he was protected.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  But Assange needs to be punished because he was not authorized.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Well, Assange needs to be pardoned because that will be a great inspiration to other journalists and it will be a great inspiration for the rank and file of supporters of Trump.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  No, I agree. And I don't think Ellsberg's a bad guy overall. He's come to Assange's defense.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  I mean, even if you hated Assange, which I don't, every journalist, every person's free speech is in danger. We should support him. It's easy.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  Freedom of speech has got to be one of the, if not the single most important issue.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  If the public is denied information, if they control all the platforms, the electronic platforms, they have more power than the government.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  They can create any narrative they want.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  And that's the point I keep making. They're now censoring the president, the attorney general, everyone.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  So I'm worried about government power, but it has no power now.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  If these big mega tech companies are government, they are the power and you've got the arrogant Justice Department still thinking it's in charge the minute you get a separation of powers, as the founders did.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  As soon as the government realizes that big tech is the government, then we've got a chance to use government to cut them down to size, then cut government down to size.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  That is the beauty of our system.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  There was a situation once where there was monopoly of Standard Oil in New Jersey that controlled everything, and they had to put through legislation to stop that.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  There has to be new legislation with respect to these new technologies.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  Far overdue. You're a genius. Walt, we love you. Absolutely. Walt is on target.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  People say, oh, you're a libertarian. Don't break up big tech. Big tech's the government. My God, they censor more than communist China.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  Remember 15 days to flatten the curve because the hospitals were so full? Of course all that was a lie. All that was a fraud.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  The Rockefeller and Bill Gates documents from the beginning are on record. They said the mask wearing will never end.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  The social distancing will never end. The forced inoculations will never end.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  The social tracking through your cell phones and the global social credit score will never end.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  If you put up with it, this is the rollout of the post-human world. I know you know that, but I've seen national Democrat Party statements, and I've seen CNN and others point out that Jones says that COVID is a hoax.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  What I'm saying is this is an overblown fraud. It's a scam. But he sells InfoWars.com masks.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Yes, if you're going to be made to do it to fly on an airport or by the police on a train, then fight back with information warfare, have a walking billboard.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  That's hypocrisy to be able to hold two different ideas in your head at the same time.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  If you're going to be raped by these people, they're going to put the burqa over your head. Might as well advertise it with InfoWars.com.
[1:59:43.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. Fight back.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Because you belong. You belong in a free world, in a free country. You belong to God. You belong to have your wife, to have your husband, to have your children, to have your grandparents, to have your future progeny.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  You belong in the universe. You will conquer the universe. You've been given dominion over the heavens. You belong. Don't let them take that destiny.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Talk about positive news. In Melbourne, where they have gone to houses and drug pregnant women out of their houses because they protested the mask, because they said COVID was exaggerated.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  77 real deaths in Australia. All the others were co-morbidities. And now, as I predicted, not hard to predict, the Australians were working together. They believed in the system.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  They weren't cowards. And as soon as the government began to crack down on people and push people around, it triggered a massive resistance.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  In government, in media, and at the grassroots. Just like Hitler, started bombing Britain.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  90-plus percent of Brits did one new war. They lost a couple million people in World War I, just 20-something years before.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  And the minute Hitler started bombing those cities, they were all wanting war.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  Hitler thought, I'll bomb them, they'll get scared. It didn't have the effect you thought.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  And I watched those Australian police. You know, you want to bash police.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  Man, the average American cop is nothing like that. They're like, that's unconstitutional. Most cops are like, we're not going to arrest peaceful people. We're not going to do that.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Now, liberals will. Liberal police are bad. They're cult leaders. And that's why people go, Lord, are you against the police state? Absolutely. I'm against police under globalist control.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  Do I want to murder police that are constitutional following their duty, executing their office? Hell no. I support them.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I appreciate their courage. I know I don't want their job. I know it's rough.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  You may be all right. You know, as a cop writing tickets on the highway, that's a job, you know, that's some danger.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  But let me tell you, beat cops. Cops respond in the inner cities. Cops respond in the domestic disputes.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  Pull up some house at midnight and mama and dad are on methamphetamine and been drank a 12-pack of beer. That's dangerous.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  And they show up when you call them and then they die and the media celebrates it. That's dangerous.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  But here's Melbourne, Australia. People go into the open air market and saying, we want freedom and we're done.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  And it's only going to build as those thug police in Melbourne who are under a mayor who is under UN Chinese control signed agreements.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  Just like we're under UN, just like the strong cities under the Justice Department wants to take control via the UN. And their attempt at bully has responded with this. Here it is.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  Horses for people at a market not on the best.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  You know the enemy folks, it's those police. They're the robots that follow the orders.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  They don't stop Black Lives Matter.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  They're there. They stop good people.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  It's a disgusting crash.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  And now they're running over women and children. This little backfire is so good.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  Thank God the folks are forcing it. Submitting is death, but this is the truth.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  Now here come the riot police.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  You want to be Black Lives Matters saying kill the police? Oh, the mayor's just got it on them.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  If you want to go buy oranges and potatoes and peaches and grapes, now they start pushing the police back.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Now they start grabbing people who can't have pathetic, disgusting thugs.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  God Almighty.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  But it's only Melbourne and a few other cities.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  And the left shows you that like that's normal.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  And they show those SJW trash sent to those universities brainwashed to hate their freedom, to hate their race, to hate God.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  And now they're police officers out there on their thuggish power trip.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  Our officers are Black and Hispanic and white, and they're good people on average.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  Even in leftist cities, they've not broken our police yet.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  And they are pissed because in England, they've broken the police.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  In Germany, they've broken the police.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  In Australia, they've broken the police by and large.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  And they're longer sworn officers under the law. They're now instruments of the UN and the globalist.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  And we don't wish harm upon them because they're worthless.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  We wish for those that control them to be brought to justice.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  All right, we got a bunch of callers holding. Let's go to who's been holding the longest here.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  Let's go to Marcus in Texas. Marcus, thanks for holding. We'll go to Gator who disagrees. I just saw that.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  Marcus, go ahead.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  Hello, Bill and Alex. Let me give him, let me give first of all a practice.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  When I'm done with this, I'm going to give a guttural Alex Jones humanity yell.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  But before I do that, I want to say this.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  When it comes to the vaccine and it comes to the way Trump's handling it, if I'm looking at my Bible,
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  I can compare what he's doing to what Jay who did when he invited all the ball worshippers into this temple.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  And then once they were in there for this big feast or whatever he had them going there for, he told his guards,
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  don't let a single person out of here alive. You know what I mean?
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  No, I mean, there is definitely a time when God tells us to be deceitful.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  I just, and maybe that's Trump's office. He's definitely manipulated the hell out of him. It's definitely working.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  Yes. And before I go, can I give you this? Can I give this to you?
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Go ahead, brother. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  Yeah.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  I love you, brother.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  All right. Let's go to Gator in North Carolina. Gator on the air.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  Yeah. Hey, I was just, you know, thinking of the other color mentioned earlier that the,
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  they took the money from the who and gave it directly to Bill Gates.
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  That was completely Trump's move, right?
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  And then on top of it, all you got.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  In fact, he, nobody's going to prison of all the people that have,
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  are complicit and guilty of international war crimes that walk around on our government,
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  pedophilia, addition trees and all those other acts and barred Durham aren't doing anything or not going to do anything.
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  And I think that, you know, I think Trump is playing everybody.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  I think that a lot of people are in denial that perhaps we are definitively in the end of times.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  And then this is all set up and leading exactly where the operation lockstep says to the market of these.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  And I think that this is all coming in. And I think that part of what Trump's doing specifically with
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  Infra wars and Mr. Alex Jones is he's placating the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  and millions of patriots that listen to you and keep giving them just enough to keep us placated just enough to keep us.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  The dated where we have enough hope to where we're not going to do anything.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  And this is all going to reach up and smash.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  Let me just be clear. I am sure of heart.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  I didn't sense your call. You're on air.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  So you can criticize Trump. I had you call in because I respect your view.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  You don't think I'm part of that, right?
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  No, not at all. I'm just saying that I think that there's forces,
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  principalities, powers and rulers of darkness at work that are smarter than you, me and everybody.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  And and and they're working.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  I mean, I'll agree with you to say this.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  I literally only long and air a few times mad at Trump and said he better do this, better do that.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  He literally tweets our stuff or calls me right like an hour after I do it.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  They're watching the show every minute.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  But I don't think Trump himself is evil.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  I think he could be deceived. Nobody's perfect.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  But the legitimate hatred of the left of Trump is real, though.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  I mean, they don't like him.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  But that's the place. Alex, that's the play.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  That's the Hegelian dialectic.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  I mean, I learned that from you.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  I agree. And, you know, I talked to all these horrible folks.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  They obsess on the Hegelian dialectic because it's real,
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  but sometimes not even playing the dialectic shatters the dialectic.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  It's a complex issue. That's why we're open to the calls up.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  I don't know. What do you think you think?
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  I mean, Gates is legitimately pissed that Trump has taken the vaccine away from him.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  He didn't. You can't take it away from him because he owns every vaccine lab on the planet
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  between him and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  Every one of his foundations owns and controls everything on the earth.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  That's true. What do you think about Bill Gates's daddy dying today?
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  That's a nice little omen.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  What's going on with John McCain waiting for Bill Gates and for Obama and the rest of them?
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  I'm not happy he's dead, but I'm not sad.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  Bill Gates will join him. Join him.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  All right. Thank you. Good call, sir.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  Work calls coming up. Nick Fuentes coming up as well.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  infowars.com, newswars.com.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Hey, all I can tell you is I am 100% consciously pro-human and pro-god.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  All right. We'll be right back.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  And our first product got rape reviews.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  Some like bodies better.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  And they fund the info war.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  So get our new liquid Tumeric extract exclusively.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  infowars.com today, an additional 25% off.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  This is a 360 win.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  Tumeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies for inflammation and so much more.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  That's because it was completely scripted.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  And we even know the names of the United Nations Rockefeller Foundation,
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  Bill Mullen, the Gates and John Hopkins documents.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  And it's designed to free civilization and have a post-renaissance stagnation
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  or new dark age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  As you can see, all the check boxes of tyranny are being marked carefully.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  Every eye dotted, every T crossed.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  A total societal vertical integration takeover, medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  The big tech heads on average have had their wealth cooked up 35% in the last eight months.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  Everyone is being forced onto their system to post-human robot takeover.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  You're being made obsolete.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  All right, Nick Foynchez is on with us.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  I really appreciate him joining us.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  We'll take some calls to before we end this hour.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  Paul Watson takes over.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  He's the founder of the Groypert movement.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  He's also been censored and blocked off many years of the internet,
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  but it's still not defeated him.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  He's more popular than ever.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  I wanted to get him on because he wants to talk about cancel culture,
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  the drugs report and revolver, the election coup.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  We'll cover it all.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  Nick, great to have you on with us.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  What do you want to tackle first?
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  The election coup, the drugs report or the cancel culture?
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  Well, thanks so much for having me.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Well, it's all, it's all so good.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Why don't we talk about the election coup?
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  I think that's the most pressing.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  That's where I would start.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  Okay.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  We're some potico.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  So yeah, tell us about it.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  Sure.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  So this is something I've actually been covering on my show for a long time.
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  And I actually really appreciate the work of revolver and people like Darren Beatty
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  for bringing this, I think, to everybody's attention.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  But basically, and I think you probably have sensed this as well,
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  if you watch everything that's been happening over the past few months
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  and really for the past four years,
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  it seems like all the pieces are being put in place now
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  for the elites and the globalists to steal the election on November 3rd.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  And I'm talking about the mail-in ballots
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  and how coronavirus is affected, how the election will be conducted.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  I'm talking about social media, Facebook and Twitter,
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  saying that they'll flag any posts if a candidate prematurely declares victory.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  And I'm talking about the thousands of protesters
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  that have been mobilized in cities like Portland and Chicago
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  and DC and Minneapolis with Black Lives Matter.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  And I look at all of that, all these recent developments.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  And what I've been saying on my show is maybe taken each separately,
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  these would be concerning in their own way,
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  but taken together, I think they constitute a clear and imminent threat
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  from the globalists to try and steal the election in November.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  I totally agree.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Roger Stone was on last Wednesday and he was covering Mattis wanting a coup
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  and Democrats saying we're going to have states secede,
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  we're going to block it no matter what,
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  and Soros funding this election transition group.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  And he said, well, you've got to counter this.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  Well, Bill Barr has come out and said they're going to try to burn the country down.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  We're going to have to arrest them for sedition.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  They spun that that we want election martial law because we're going to lose.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  No, I see the opposite of that.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  Absolutely. Exactly.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  Well, and you just have to look at how they're manipulating everything
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  that constitutes the logistics of the election itself.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  Every time I hear somebody like Mark Zuckerberg,
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  who is one of the richest people in the history of the world,
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  who runs the biggest or one of the biggest social media platforms in the world,
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  I think it's two and a half billion active users and I think his companies.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  And when I hear him say things like he is investing money
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  and he's going to personally invest in seeing election integrity in November.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  He is election meddling openly.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  Exactly. Exactly right.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  Nobody elected this guy.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  This isn't a government official.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  This is some billionaire tech guy, lizard person.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  We don't even know who this guy is.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  And like you said, he's intervening in the case of Donald Trump, for example,
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  taking down his posts and Facebook has said itself that they're going to intervene
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  if Donald Trump prematurely declares victory.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  And I hear that.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  And what that sounds like to me is that we're contesting this as Hillary said,
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  she said, and so to put that we're going to we know we're going to lose.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  We're going to contest it.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  We're going to hold it up.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  And I mean, so they're just saying they're doing it.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  So what do we do knowing in 46 days?
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  That's where we're going to be.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  Everyone, they have the election.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Trump clearly wins.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  They're going to say they don't know.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  We've got to count the 80 million floating around ballots.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  This is just going to be incredible.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  Well, we need attention.
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  I think we need everybody's attention.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  I think we need everybody to wake up and see what's going on.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  I'm actually very glad this has been covered on Fox News.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  Darren Beatty was on Tucker Carlson talking about this the other night.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  You're talking about this.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  We're trying to get the word out to every major dissident right sort of outlet
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  to put the word out so that when this tries,
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  when the globalists try to steal the election, when this transpires,
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  everybody will be watching and looking at the mail-in ballots.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  People will be watching.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Well, let me just stop you.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  I mean, they're already done the precursor.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  They're already doing it.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  I mean, they're going to do it.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  So they're already doing it.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  I agree.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  So how do we counter that?
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  How do we get ahead of it?
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  Just expose it?
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  Expose it.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  And I think the trick is going to come in on election day.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  Like you said, Trump is going to win the election.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  I think it'll be a landslide electorally.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  And what you'll see is that in the days and weeks after the election,
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  that's when they're going to find all of these extra votes for Joe Biden.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  And a Trump landslide will transform into a Joe Biden landslide
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  because they'll basically be committing voter fraud,
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  massive voter fraud because of the mail-in ballots.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  And I think the way that we can counter that is, again,
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  by bringing it to everybody's attention,
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  making sure that people are aware that this is going to happen
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  by getting the elements in Trump's administration and campaign prepared for that.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  He needs to mentally prepare to fight this legal battle.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  They need to layer up.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  They need to get people on the ground.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  Oh, I totally agree.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  Again, Nick Fuentes joins us.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  Nick, let me pull this out of you because you're totally right.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  Clearly they're saying they're going to do it.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  They're going to do it.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  Trump needs to get ahead of it.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  But the general public needs to get ahead of it.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  But the way they project on Roger Stone or myself,
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  because we've been the ones troubling and not bragging, this is true,
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  this was their plan,
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  they're scared of us pointing out what they're doing.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  So when they try to say, oh, it's discredited.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  Don't say we're going to steal the election.
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  That's because they're scared of us up front, as you just said,
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  laying the groundwork for exposing what they've done.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  Exactly.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  Well, exactly right.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  They know what they're doing and everybody knows what they're doing.
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  And it's all, it's everybody from the social media,
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  big tech type people to the Democrat operatives in the party,
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  to the BLM leaders.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  It's like a who's who of this globalist elite class.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  And you could see in the evidences everywhere,
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  all working in concert to steal the election.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  And like you said, that's exactly right.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  It's kind of ironic how they've always flipped this sort of stuff around on us.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  I said, they did the same thing with Russia.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  When they were accusing Trump of meddling with Russia,
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  it turned out it was Clinton that was involved with that nuclear deal in Central Asia,
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  when they blamed Trump for colluding with Ukraine.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  It was actually Joe Biden's son that was in bed with the Ukrainians and so on.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  And in the same way, when they're talking about stealing the election,
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  like you said, back in 16, they were accusing Trump of,
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  oh, he's not going to accept the election results.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  And now they're doing it again in 2020.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  They're running these headlines where they say,
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  what happens if Trump doesn't leave office?
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  I think 538 just ran a huge spread about it this week saying,
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  what happens if Trump does not peacefully leave office?
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  And that's not what people have to be worried about.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  What people have to be worried about is if Democratic state governors try to secede,
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  or if the electors in the different states don't go down to Washington, D.C. and vote for Trump.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  It's a host of things, but it's all, of course, surrounding the Democratic Party,
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  where they will either try to commit ballot fraud,
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  or if they're unable to do that, they will create so much chaos and subversion
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  that they're going to try to do something like a soft coup or a color revolution in America.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  And you're exactly right.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  And like you said, you've been at the frontier exposing this at the forefront.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  And I think that's the most important thing,
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  is just making everybody aware and mentally preparing themselves that,
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  yes, we've got an election, we've got a campaign.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  Plus, Nick, I'm not trying to give myself credit or you or anybody,
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  that the Democrats are out in the open doing this.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  They're in the CFR, they're in Atlantic Monthly, they're in the New York Times.
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  I mean, Podesta was in there two months ago going, we're going to have states secede,
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  and we don't care who really wins.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  We're going to, I mean, this is like terroristic stuff.
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  I would expect the FBI to be like Darth Vader blowing the doors open.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  If I was planning this, they should be.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  They're just doing it out in the open.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  And how do they get this position where they can fund Antifa for arson, killing people?
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  Like who set them up as God?
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  Let's talk about that.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  And what you, your smart guy, expect to happen in the election when they challenge.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  This is going to happen.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  Trump's going to win.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  They're going to challenge.
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  It's going to be crazy.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  46 days away, you cannot cut these suspense with an eye that's too thick.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  They're right back.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  to be so.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  This is a power grab.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S. for blue for Democrats, red
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  the world's waiting to them.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  It's a very simple equation.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  It's illegal.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  We must resist it.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  It is a forecast.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  If we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  and the structure of productivity, it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  that are breaking down supply chains that will starve tens of millions of additional
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  debt, which we're being maneuvered into.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  This really used to be a power grab.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storeable
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their game is to
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  make us dependent on them.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  So get self-sufficient now in FullWars.com.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  The party was not going to go on forever.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  All the welfare, all the entertainment, all the decadence was only designed to get people
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  domesticated, dumbed down, selfish, and most importantly, isolated.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  And now that most of the population is selfish, isolated, and very, very dumbed down and ignorant,
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  the New World Order is facing its move.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  And they are now going to weaponize the giant masses of foolish followers who believe they
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  just follow orders.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  They'll get another little piece of green like with the chicken pecks at the lever.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  And then all that they're really going to get is the noose tightening around their foolish neck.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  Those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the massive slaves, but remember,
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  And so we've got to save them to save ourselves.
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  And to do that, we've got to expose the globalist.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  We've got to take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  that they've actually committed.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  Expose the enemy now.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  Well, Nick Foyn says this is our guest.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  I really appreciate everybody joining us on this live September 17 transmission.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  Nick, I want to get into cancel culture, drudge report, the coming Democrat, shy, calm, funded coup.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  But what about you?
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  Spend a few minutes on yourself, how you got politically involved.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  You became very, very popular.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  You've been canceled.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  You're still as popular as ever.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  And just how surreal is it to see this?
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  And what are you experiencing on the street because on the street, I'm seeing people that are black, white, old, young, totally seeing through all of this.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  That's what I see.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  Then I tune into the news.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  I see something completely different.
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  What are you culturally historically?
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  What would you call this period we're in right now?
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Well, that's tough to say.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  I would say that we are in a distinct period of American history probably after 2016.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  And I'm only 22 years old, but I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  And I think that is really what defines the nature of this time is that it is truly an unprecedented period in American history.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  If you're looking at some of the context or some of the rhetoric about this upcoming election, they're talking about a real threat where people are not going to accept the legitimacy of the election.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  Where in some cases, they still don't even accept the legitimacy of the Trump presidency and his authority as president and as the head of the executive branch of government.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  This is something which we haven't seen in the United States arguably since the Civil War, which was a totally different country.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  So truly, I think the time that we're living through is unprecedented.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  And you know, you're talking about sort of people, everyday people in the streets or people you might see.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  And I think everybody agrees.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  You said before the break just a moment ago that you can cut the tension with a knife.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  And that is totally true. Everybody feels it. Everybody senses it.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  And it is something that permeates everything and everywhere you go on every level.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  You know, it's the pandemic with this mask versus no mask and this disease, the economic recession.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  It has caused businesses collapsing these restrictions.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  It's also the partisanship.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  America is under attack. We're in a major time of change. We're in a major flux point right now.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  And I don't think it's going well for people that have created the stimuli.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  I don't think the globalists pulling all this off are getting what they wanted. They seem very upset.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  Well, exactly. It's causing, I think, a lot of people to start to reflect and question what's happening.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  I think you're right. It has basically backfired because they've been making these very aggressive and overt moves.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  These power grabs. And it's almost having the reverse of the intended effect, which is that it's just now naked and visible.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  And anybody who watches the news, I think anybody that just pays attention can see what's going on.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  And all the chaos that has been caused, all this sort of disruption to the status quo that was unleashed by Trump
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  and everything that we've been seeing for the past year, I think has only made their position more precarious.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  And I don't know about you, but I feel better than ever. I feel like since Trump won the election in 2016,
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  a window of opportunity has now opened up where people like you and I can really start to do some damage against the globalists.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  What would have concerned me more than anything is if somebody like Jeb Bush had won or Mark Rubio or Hillary Clinton.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  Exactly. Right back to sleep and right back to bed.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  But there's the paradox. There's the paradox. My problem is, obviously, this globalist crop is going to be defeated.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  The Clintons, the Soros, they're done. I'm worried about the infrastructure, though. We kind of beat it. We think we beat it.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  But the infrastructure is still there. We end up with the same thing later.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  Exactly. Well, and that's why, you know, I was talking before the break about how we've got this election,
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  but then we've also got after the election, the battle over the legitimacy of the election and, you know, the ballots.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  Oh, that's everything. They know they're losing this election. They've said it. I mean, the folks just tuned in.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  It's the Democrats on record. They know they're losing. There's a political realignment.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  All they can hope to do is break their cities and states off and challenge it to literally bring the economy down.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  And so at that point, I say, arrest their ass. And I'm anti-police state.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  But if you're holding the country hostage and holding me hostage, I say, walk a plank.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Absolutely. Well, yeah, it's a coup. It's a coup against the government, the duly elected president of the United States.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  At that point, there has to be an intervention. But as I was saying, what we're going to see,
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  even if we win this battle and Trump gets in and everything, then in 2024, we have another fight.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  And that fight is over the succession after Trump leaves office. If he doesn't leave office now, he leaves office in 2024.
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Hold on. I want to hear this because if we had a second party, I'd be for the new party getting in power.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  We don't have a party. The Democrats are the Chai-Com in-demerica party, so we need a second party.
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  Or are you saying the Republicans split in two and all there is is a succession fight?
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  Because I agree, we have to extinct the Democratic Party. They're done.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  They're like the Nazi Party in the World War II. Like, this party's done.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  Oh, yeah. There's nothing redeeming about that party. If there ever was at one point, it's certainly extinguished now.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  But I'm talking about in 2024, they're now beginning to field names for who might be a presidential candidate on the Republican side in 24.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  And you're hearing names like Nikki Haley, for example, or Rick Rennell, who's a neocon, and Dan Crenshaw, and characters like this.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  Terrible.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  And so the battle in 2024 will be...
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  We don't want the gay pirate. We don't want any of these people.
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  Yeah.
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  And nothing against Dan being a gay pirate. You know, it's okay. It's just that we don't need gay pirates, you know, to be the president.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  Yeah. No, right. Exactly. Yeah. They can go be gay pirates in the ocean or the seven seas or something.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  We need somebody like Trump. And that's exactly the ticket.
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  We need to have a nationalist Republican Party.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  And if we can't have that, then I think you're right. There has to be another option.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  But that is really the battle at this point is who is going to determine the future of the American right in the Republican Party.
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  Because there's a big risk that four years, even after another four years of Trump...
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  We shouldn't sleep on our laurels with Trump. We should be understanding we're in a very existential battle here.
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  Well, exactly. And it's like what you talked about with the infrastructure.
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  Regardless of how the personalities end up, Clinton and Trump and everybody else, it's that deep state, that sort of permanent bureaucratic and partisan class,
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  where if we are not actively fighting every day for the next four years, you're going to get the same GOP establishment...
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  Well, that's an example. Trump says to the CDC and other agencies, you will not have a 13 month paid course saying white people are inherently evil.
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:10.000]  I mean, they said black people are inherently ill. I say don't have that course. That is super evil.
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  And then they're told Trump, F you, they're still doing it. I mean, that is outrageous.
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  It is. And it's within his own administration. It's sabotage, constant sabotage, constant subversion from his own party from our own American right.
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  It's even like with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. You know, this week, the president announces we're pulling troops out of Iraq.
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  We're pulling them out of Afghanistan. And they all crumpets the troops.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  Yeah, exactly. And then they publish in the book, he says the troops suck. And then they redo that story from a few months ago,
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  when he was talking about pulling troops out initially, where they're saying, oh, Russians are putting bounties on the heads of American soldiers.
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:56.000]  And Trump doesn't care about that. A totally fake story, which they pull out every time to keep us at war forever.
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:32:02.000]  And like you said, as you said, that is the infrastructure and the establishment of both major parties.
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  Trump is really truly the exception. Trump as a personal power in the world.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  I mean, I agree. It's insane how maverick and really is God literally had to give us this because Trump's not perfect,
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  but he's definitely his own dude. They cannot stand it. This is God's sense of humor, Nick.
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  It is. It is. He's a human being. He is a human being flesh and blood.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  And, you know, even just the other day, he's posting a picture of himself eating a Philly cheesesteak.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  And it's something that's very maybe silly or something, but it's a reminder that this is a real person as opposed to what we see on the other side.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  Because a stuffed up alias would not even do that. Or it would come off as fake when Trump becomes as real as it is.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  Exactly. Exactly. Trump is the real deal. He is, in many ways, and I know liberals like to critique this,
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  despite being a billionaire and a celebrity and so on, there is something about Trump which is imminently relatable and more resonant with people like you and me,
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  as opposed to a Nancy Pelosi or somebody else. You know, I think people like on the left, they like to say,
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  well, why do these union people, why does Trump resonate with them so much?
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  Don't they know that Trump is ultra-wealthy, billionaire, famous, perhaps a part of the class that he criticizes?
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  And the answer is absolutely not. Because in spite of the wealth and spite of...
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  He believes in a pro-human service economy.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  Exactly. He is a human being. There's something about him which I feel like we are on the same page.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, we're like different people.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  Now, you said they're lizard people. We don't mean that literally. Artipally.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  Nick Foyntest is in Fuego. He'll be back and we'll take some calls. And Paul, here he wants to take some over.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet and saw what they thought was a giant UFO.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  It was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  There were thousands of phone calls made in the police department. Newspapers, TV stations thinking it was an alien craft.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  When the public was told that it was a blimp, they didn't want to believe it. You see, they had already told themselves it was a UFO.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  So they had cognitive distance. It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  Let people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in their houses.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  Well, it happened again over New Jersey yesterday. The Goodyear Blimp was out there with a big Gumbotron TV screen on the side of it.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  It had flashing lights on it, just like an airplane. The public thought it was a UFO.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  Now the public still believes it was a UFO, and now they were told it wasn't.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells.

[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  The speaker of the House Pelosi has said that China wants Joe Biden.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  InfoWars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day. InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and they're not even hiding that it's coming directly out of communist China.
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  America is fighting for its life. Everyone that votes for Joe Biden is a stooge of communist China and an idiot trying to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  But no matter what happens in this election, the awakening and the chain reaction has begun and cannot be reversed.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  Things are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad for the earth and we need to be faced out.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix like system that they're building.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  We build our own environments. We create our own systems. We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  But instead we're acting like animals and letting the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle. And that's the trick.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson's coming up on a jam of good calls in here. I appreciate Steve, Josh, Jennifer, Larry, Greg, Debbie, others holding will get to you for Paul takes over.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  But getting back to Nick Fuentes, Nick, you want to get into Drudge and you know, I know Drudge has come to town, had dinner, he's been a big booster of him for hours.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  He helped get Trump elected. I don't know what's been going on the last few years, but you want to get into Drudge and Revolver, which is a great publication.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  Paul Watson has come out and said what the hell happened to Drudge. He knows Drudge. Drudge has hung out with him as well. I don't know what's going on.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  I don't know. I mean, we had Steve Bannon reach out to us, which I don't believe a damn thing he says.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  He told us two years ago, he goes, watch Drudge will turn against Trump. He's been bought by CNN.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  Now, that's out of that guy's mouth. So I know it's true. But I just have no intel on Drudge. What do you think is going on there?
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  Yeah, it's tough to say. I've never talked to Drudge personally. I heard some rumors that he was supportive of the Groyper Wars when we were doing that last year.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  And that's about as far as I know. But like you said, it's tricky because for so long, I mean, his website, I think, was really groundbreaking.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  And the format and everything was key to it and providing conservative news for a landscape where that just you don't have a lot of conservative news.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  But lately, it's been out of control. And it's something that I've noticed maybe for about a year or something.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  But lately in the past few weeks, I think it was Drudge that circulated that story initially about Trump calling the troops losers.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  And a lot of that kind of the rumor type stuff from the Trump administration has been pushed there.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  And even this week, there were some really terrible headlines there.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  And I saw that and I think that's such a shame because we as conservatives or we as broadly right wing patriotic type people,
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  we don't really have that much infrastructure and that many assets as far as information goes with the exception of you and others.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  Of course, though, we're waning on social media. They're deplatforming all of us, which makes it more difficult.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  And so whenever you see one of these big guys sort of go down or something's going on, it's a big deal. It's something that's worth reflecting on.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  And I have to say, it's been a very positive and interesting development that this revolvers come around.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  And I don't know exactly who runs it, but I've been, I've been watching that lately. I don't know about you, but I've been reading.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  I've seen a lot of really good stories. I mean, that's revolver. It's like revolver booked the plan that Democrats plan to go.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  Everybody's been zero hedge has been covered. I mean, it's not about credit, but yeah, no revolvers doing a good job.
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  So who do you think's behind that?
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  I don't know exactly. I don't know exactly.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  Maybe Matt Drudge sold the Drudge report and he runs revolver.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  Possibly. That's possible. I would hope so. That would redeem him. I think in my eyes a little bit.
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  But it's a great publication and I'm not, I'm not like behind it. I'm not trying to show it or anything.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  I'm just saying it's like God, it's a, it's a positive.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  The new Drudge report, the revolver report, but I've been checking it out and doing it before my show.
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  I saw Trump put it on his Twitter, Tucker talked about it.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  And I think, you know, that to me is the future of where the right wing is going to be is in creating our own infrastructure like that.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  Get the word out because these days and even just the other day, I don't know if you saw this, but Fox News,
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  they got really weird when Newt Gingrich was on talking about.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Yeah, cue that up. Let's play that clip.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Anybody talks about Soros, who publicly funds Antifa and BLM and who publicly is getting all these district attorneys elected.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  If you say it, you are the devil. So here's what Nick Fuentes was just talking about.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Look, the number one problem in almost all these cities is George Soros elected left wing anti-police pro-criminal district attorneys who refuse to keep people locked up.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  Just yesterday, they put somebody back on the street who's wanted for two different murders in New York City.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  You cannot solve this problem. And both Harris and Biden have talked very proudly about what they call progressive district attorneys.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  Progressive district attorneys are anti-police pro-criminal and overwhelmingly elected with George Soros' money.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  And they're a major cause of the violence we're seeing as they keep putting the violent criminals back on the street.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  I'm not sure we need to bring George Soros into this.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  I was going to say you'd get the last word, speaker.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  He paid for it. Why can't we discuss the fact that millions of dollars he spent.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  No, he didn't. I agree with Melissa. George Soros doesn't need to be a part of this conversation.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  OK. So it's for both.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  OK. We're going to move on.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  Historic day at the White House. We covered it from stem to stem, stem to stern.
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  For major change.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  So they've been told, like with the head of judicial watches on two years ago, the Lou Dobbs, they go,
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  hey, here's Reuters, $1,000 per illegal alien. They're giving them cards to come in and to get on boats or planes and come here.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  The UN is George Soros. Here it is. They said, oh, the head of judicial watch banned on Fox.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  I mean, this is the big no-no. Soros is in the news funding all this and these women know immediately.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  Wait a minute. Whoa. What do we say? What do we do? He just said it.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  It's like the former speaker of the house. He just broke the rule.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  They're like, hey, you're just smart. You just shut up and let them fumble.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  This was incredible footage. I'm glad you raised this.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  Well, yeah, it's sick and disturbing. And to the point, it's getting to the point where these powers that be these elites,
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  this like billionaire class, whatever, they now basically have total control.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  They're approaching total control over all information that you can get in this country.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  And now you can't show leftist arsoning dozens of arrests, anti-faceting fires, Oregon, California, Washington.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  You can't show scientists saying COVID-19 is overblown.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  Stanford had the Hoover Institute come out with scientists and say that banned by YouTube and YouTube said the UN is in charge.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  I mean, Nick, we woke up and the UN is in charge.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  Exactly. Exactly. And it's not just the TV and the radio and all that, but now it's everything on social media.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  It's everything on Twitter. It's everything on Facebook. They're locking it up so tight.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  I don't think there's anybody left with the exception of me and a few others on Twitter, but YouTube has been totally purged.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Facebook, Instagram totally purged. Twitter, I think there's a handful of people left,
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  but it's getting to the point where everything on social media and now everything on legacy media, TV, radio, print,
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  is all completely controlled and nothing gets by to a mass audience, with the exception of you and a few others that are still out there fighting the good fight,
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  without the stamp of approval from the United Nations, Mark Zuckerberg, Lizard Coalition.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  And that's why we have to be on the lookout for these kinds of like products or projects or whatever,
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  where we can break the conditioning and get the signal out there because, like you said, it's everything now.
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  It's the masks. It's the coronavirus. It's Black Lives Matter protests that you can't cover it.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  And it's almost this weird thing where once they get total control over social media too, everybody's entire perception of the world
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  and of current events will be controlled by some billionaires.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  It's a giant echo box, but here's the good news. Everything they're doing is going sideways and is actually,
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  I mean, I've got so many friends and family that thought I was a little over the edge and they're like,
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  oh, what's happening next? I'm like, well, you see what's going on.
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  And they'll tell me exactly what I already think, not from my brain. They see it too.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  So there's kind of that wake up point where there's a crash course in this neck and people finally get it.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  And then it doesn't matter if big tech controls everything and they tell us no Muslim ever did anything wrong
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  or there's no pedophiles or there's no world government or, you know, it doesn't matter at a certain point.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  No one buys what they say.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  Well, I agree. I agree that people are beginning to wake up.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  It just concerns me that these like younger generations, for example, they come up in a world
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  where they never knew the Internet before censorship.
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  And I know you're an early pioneer on the Internet.
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  I was sort of like a youngster when the Internet was like this,
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  but there was a time when the Internet was synonymous with irreverent, controversial, out there, you know, whatever anything goes.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  And it's getting to the point now where children are born and they're raised by public school teachers
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  who are totally controlled, you know, who came up through a university and got four years of propaganda.
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  They're parents who are probably brainwashed, television, TikTok, social media, which is totally controlled.
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  Exactly. And they've got that black box that goes everywhere with them and just filling their head with propaganda.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  And it's like their whole lives from birth until they graduate from college is heavy indoctrination.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  And I'm concerned about a world where the signal can't possibly penetrate that bubble,
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  where where does an Info Wars or a revolver in America first, a Tucker Carlson,
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  where does that even penetrate if they are able to finally construct this sort of information bubble
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  where people like you and I can't even get in. That's what terrifies me.
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  But I think you're right. I think they made a mistake.
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  The signal is already out there. People see what's going on.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  We have to take advantage of our mistake. We have to press the attack. Nick Fuentes.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  Where do people find your great work?

[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  from her Britannic majesties, London Islamic England. Stay with us.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  Get it with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  Now, here's the problem. Some of the patented ingredients that are in APEC PowerStack
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have. It's in stock now.

[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  Big Tech is the global straightjacket of the New World Order.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  It is the enforcement system, the surveillance system.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  It's going to track everything you do, everywhere you go, everything you say, everything you basically think
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  and then reward or punish you for those behaviors and they're not liberals.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  That's a complete and total cover. They are monsters that love authoritarianism
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  and are building towards a post-human world.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  Their mission is to destroy indigenous communities, annihilate small towns, annihilate all human culture
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  and consolidate us all, isolate us all and then carry out our orderly extermination.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  This is their public master plan. The COVID-19 is the cover for the rollout of this digital control system.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's only going to get worse from here.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  When you see officials from Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter,
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  you are looking at people way more smart and way more evil than Hitler.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  They want to murder you and your family. You have been warned.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  She'll slice you apart.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  I know that's not what the actual song says. I rewrote the lyrics.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  She's a cool, cool black. She moves like a cat.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  Bring it back up. Well, you might not make it back.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  She's got the looks that kill. That kill.
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  She's got the looks that kill.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  Okay, just father died. Well, Billy Boy ain't too happy right now.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  Steve in Florida. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  Thank you, Alex. I'll get to this real quick.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  First of all, I want to comment on what these scumbags have said about
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  Trump coming out for the vaccine and then get the Trump himself on this
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  and relate this to you. First of all, Gates, Fauci, Berks,
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  Harris and Biden saying they're against the vaccine now.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  Well, remember, the devil will speak elements of truth,
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  but it's always for the purpose of deception.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  So I relate this to what you said years ago, Alex.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  Brand rabbit, whatever you do, don't throw me in the briar patch.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  They are still planning on using the vaccine because they're a bunch of scumbag
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  eugenicists that want to kill 80 to 90% of the world's population.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  So that's a smokescreen. But to get the Trump, the bigger issue on the
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  vaccine, I want to kind of quell everybody's fears because I got really concerned
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  when I was watching the Republican National Convention.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  First, I saw Vice President Pence. We're going to have a vaccine by December,
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  probably maybe even before that. And then Trump coming out.
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  Of course, earlier on, he was talking about operation warp speed
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  and even using the military to implement this.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  Well, here's what I want to say. I want to remind everybody of something.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  I'm a Christian. I believe the Bible is the word of God.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  And no matter what happens, God is always ultimately in control.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  I believe God put Donald J. Trump in the office of the presidency
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  to be the lightning rod to attract the lightning attacks
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  of the evil. In other words, to bring them out in the open
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  like they are now. And what he's done, remember, he's a businessman.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  He's smart. You've talked about for years from his father and grandfather.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  He knew about Nundair called conspiracy, the John Burt society.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  And remember during the debates, Alex, with the Republicans,
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  how he came out against vaccines and then Ben Carson specifically tried to counter that.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  Oh, there's no proof that the MMR vaccine causes autism.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  And I believe if I remember correct, Trump had a son or a nephew, something like that.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  Well, there was brain damage from the vaccines.
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  Well, he hasn't forgotten that he has a personal vendetta against the CDC,
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  against the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry that was given impunity
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  in 1986 under the Reagan administration. So here's what I want to say.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  He's putting on the poker face. And I believe what he's going to end up doing,
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  he's going to use the military, but it's going to be to invoke the Insurrection Act.
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  It's going to look like he's going to implement this operation warp speed.
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  But then what he's going to do because here's Barr, not talking about...
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  Well, Barr is talking about the Insurrection Act now, so it's getting crazy.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  Right. Going after all these people that are trying to burn down America
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  at their communist revolution funded by sorrows and the corporations and the chai comms.
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  So what I'm saying is that watch for Trump to use the military to come against these people.
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  And I believe according to what Stuart Rhodes said also,
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  he needs to federalize the National Guard nationwide and also needs to go to every sheriff
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  in every county, according to what Richard Mack has said, and have them deputize private citizens
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  because the military law enforcement is going to need our help.
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  No, I agree. Stephen, I've got to go. I've got to go to break.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  I'm sorry to Josh and Jennifer and Larry and Greg and Debbie,
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  and I've said this a hundred times that we're done it. You guys actually, the crew's great.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  We get their names and number, call them back tomorrow.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  I'll put them on the first hour at the bottom of the hour because I want to continue this discussion
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  about Trump and the vaccines and where people are with us.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  So I promise, don't let me forget tomorrow.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  John, you come in, you get them on the phone. I love you guys.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  Josh, Jennifer, Larry, Greg, Debbie, Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  We'll talk to you guys tomorrow.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  I've seen national Democrat Party statements that I've seen CNN and others point out
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  that Jones says that COVID is a hoax. What I'm saying is it's an overblown fraud.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  It's a scam, but he sells info wars.com mask.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Yes, if you're going to be made to do it to fly an airport or by the police on a train,
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  then fight back with information warfare, have a walking billboard.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  That's hypocrisy to be able to hold two different ideas in your head at the same time.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  If you're going to be raped by these people, they're going to put the burka over your head.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Might as well advertise it with info wars.com.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen, fight back.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom,
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  you're listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Think about, yes, you guessed it, the coronavirus locked down once again.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  The situation in the United Kingdom seems pretty clear to me.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  Deaths have completely plummeted. They've completely flatlined.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  They're basically nothing now. The hospitals are still all empty.
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  We had flu kill more people from 2017 to 2018 winter season.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  Now we have headline flu and pneumonia have contributed to more deaths than COVID since June.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  That's according to ONS figures. So now it is just a flu, bro.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  And what's the UK government's response? More lockdowns.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  They've banned people from meeting in groups of more than six.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  And this is the point. You could get a family.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  You could get two families of four people each meeting on the street and they're saying that's illegal.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  The point is, it's completely unenforceable.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  It's only enforceable with the absolute obsequious compliance of the people,
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  which is what they've given as we show with polls.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  But that alone is not enough.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  They need to put the fear of God into people that their own friends,
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  that their own neighbors are going to be spying on them by every classical tyranny in history.
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  That is what is being openly promoted right now by this supposedly conservative government.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  Conservative in name only headline out of the mirror.
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  More chaos as Boris Johnson says, don't snitch on your neighbor unless they're in a hot tub.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  Not what the Home Secretary said.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  And in fact, we've got that clip. This is the pretty Patel clip where she's talking about this openly now
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  encouraging British citizens to spy on their own neighbors to enforce these new pointless draconian lockdown laws,
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  even though coronavirus is basically in terms of deaths, in terms of hospital admissions,
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  totally blacklined and yet now they're saying no, not enough just to wear the slave mask, the face nappy.
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  Now you have to spy on your neighbors in their own back gardens, in their own homes.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  Let's go to this pretty Patel clip. Here it is.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  If there was a big party taking place, it would be right to call the police.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  It is very clear that governments have said people, gatherings, gatherings of 30 or more people,
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  anyone that has effectively defined the rules, they will be helping to spread coronavirus.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:29.000]  That is not a good thing. And obviously we all have a role to play.
[2:59:29.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  We're all taking personal responsibility. We all have to be conscientious to one another.
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  You could call the police if you choose to do that.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  What would you do?
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:44.000]  Well, if I was, I'm really at home, but if I saw something that I thought was inappropriate, then quite frankly,
[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  I would effectively call the police or if it was in a social setting as well.
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:53.000]  The government advice is pretty clear. People should not be gathering.
[2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  The fundamental principles have not changed from day one of coronavirus.
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  So police officers on the front line, if they see you out and about, they will,
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  and if you're with other friends, colleagues, et cetera, in a small group of around six people, no more,
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  they will effectively come up to you and they'll have a conversation.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  They'll engage you, explain the coronavirus rules, you know, keep distance, social distance, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  But of course, if you're not complying, they will effectively enforce a fixed penalty notice.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  That is a fine. That is if you're being non-compliant.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  And I will emphasize that is down to non-compliance.
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  And non-compliance is important. And the reason why we have fines is because we want to stop the spread of this disease.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  Non-compliance, unless you're being non-compliant by marching with thousands of other extinction, rebellion hippies,
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  and then the police, they won't have a chat with you. They'll do more than that.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  They'll start dancing with you. You attend a rally of thousands of violent Black Lives Matter revolutionaries.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  The police will go further than that. They'll bow down and they'll kneel.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  And they'll let you know who is boss and it's then, it's not the police.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  Oh, but if you're hanging out with your friends, if you're having a birthday party, there's seven people there
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  and some curtain twitching next door gets uppity about it.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  Well, then you're in trouble.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  I mean, maybe if the police showed it, you could just say that you're having a Black Lives Matter rally
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  and they'll just prostrate themselves and get down and grovel on the floor
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  because that is the law and it's a double tier law and it has been for months and months and months and it's a joke.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  Now they're saying spy on your neighbors. We had this article from about six days ago, but I want to get to it.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  The whole mask wearing thing is another example of this. They can't enforce it.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  There aren't enough police officers. There aren't enough uppity shopkeepers to enforce this.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  It's just a minority of people disobeyed it, which they do. Not enough, but they do.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  And so who enforces it? The carons of the street.
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  The vehement hysterical mask wearers who've been pumped so full of fear, not just by the news media,
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  but by the entertainment media, that they literally believe in the United Kingdom
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  that five million people have died from coronavirus.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  This poll got no attention. I was the only person to speak about it.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  They did a poll in the United Kingdom. Okay, coronavirus has killed about 43,000 people,
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  obviously the vast majority with co-morbidities.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  But the average British citizen thinks it's killed five million people.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  So why should we be surprised at how they act?
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  How they literally freak out and jump out of the way if you walk towards them on the street?
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  They have entertainment shows on BBC, British television, immediately after the news.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  And they're worse than the news.
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  I caught a glimpse of one last week and it was about two young people.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  Again, not even an in-risk category if you want to go with that terminology.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  They were like a 25-year-old man and like a 30-year-old woman.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  And the whole segment was about their crippling anxiety about being outside.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  And one of them went outside on a street. It wasn't even a busy city.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  It was a small town.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  And he saw like five people half a mile down the road.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  And he's like, oh my God, there are people.
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  This is the insanity of what hysterical drivel has been drilled into these idiots.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  Headline.
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  Author of dystopian classics predicted face masks to enforce conformity 70 years ago.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  Respect to German author Ernst Junger predicted the ubiquitousness of face masks
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  to enforce conformity and uniformity in a dystopian future society in a novel called The Worker.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  Now, this was outlined in an article which I really suggest you read.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  It's a great article by Thomas Crue called The Dystopian Age of the Mask.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  In which he documents how the, quote,
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  eradication of all individuality is a running theme of all dystopian literature.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  And that's precisely what the mask represents.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  We've already been atomized to such a degree that we can barely talk to our own neighbors,
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  but we can report them to the police.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  We can't have a friendly engagement with them on a natural level,
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  but you can snitch on them if they have seven people around their house.
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  So we've already been completely atomized.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  The mask only increases that tyranny.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  Also, as I made clear in a tweet a few days ago,
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:48.000]  if you've seen these Antifa mug shots,
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  you know that the kind of people who are most vehement about mask wearing,
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  which has become a left-wing domain,
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  it has become a big virtue signal,
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  it has become a way of saying, oh, look at me,
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  not only do I wear the mask,
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  but I go marching around, screeching at other people to wear it.
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  That makes me a good person,
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  because these are the worst people you could ever meet.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  But the reason why some people wear it,
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  in relation to these Antifa mug shots,
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  some of which are sitting on screen right now,
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  is because the face mask covers most of the face,
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  and a lot of people are ugly,
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  and they like to hide the fact,
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  especially these kind of people.
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  These were the first out on the streets wearing the mask during the rioting,
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  especially back in May and June.
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  And of course, not only does it give them the convenience of hiding their hideous facade,
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  it also protects, shields, hides their identity from criminal prosecution.
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  So the face mask has triple aspect utility for these kind of people.
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:57.000]  They get to righteously virtue signal and pretend they're better people than everyone else
[3:05:57.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  by screeching at you for not wearing one.
[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:01.000]  They get to hide their ugly faces,
[3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  and they get to hide the fact that they're committing crimes.
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  Really hit the trifecta there.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  I'm going to get into this article after the break.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  Also going to get into Noel Gallagher of Oasis' comments on the face mask,
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  which I was going to send them the video, the two minute video,
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  but it was so full of expletives,
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:26.000]  it would have taken about two hours to edit.
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  So I'm just going to read his comments,
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  because that's a pity on the people in the studio.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  With all that and more, it's coming up.
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  This is a bit.new.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  I got a break from that, and I got away.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  There is a forced evolution taking place.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  The scientific ruling elite believe they are transcending to a silicon life form.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  While they are making this hypothetical, very dangerous transition
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  that is guaranteed doom to fail and create nightmares that are almost unimaginable,
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  their plan for us is extermination or spiking the canon.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  Like after a major war is done, you don't want those weapons used again,
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  you get rid of them.
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  We are being rendered into scrap metal right now.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  So think about all your ancestors, think about your grandparents,
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  think about your parents, think about your children, think about the future,
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  and ask yourself, are you really going to let a bunch of crazy mad scientists
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  steal the future destiny of everyone and basically use us like guinea pigs
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  to experiment so they can try to find cures of cancer and things,
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  not for us, but for them?
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  Bill Gates is the leader of this organization.
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  Bill Gates is the enemy of humanity.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  Decide what you're going to do, America.
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  Decide what you're going to do, humanity.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  and it's free will.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists,
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  and openly tell you that you're worthless and crap and you need to die
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:00.000]  because that will save the earth.
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:04.000]  And they do everything they can to make the most dystopian ugly future they can
[3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  They are making you hate yourself.
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  They are making you be depressed.
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  so they can selfishly control the future.
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  And that's what all this is about.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies,
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  It's time to say no.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  Now, the guys in the studio have managed to pull off a gargantuan feet.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  And that is to edit out the cuspid.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  There's no doubt of it.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  Two minutes later, we're going to play it and we're going to come back and talk about
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  the ridiculous new lockdown measures being introduced in the UK.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  In anticipation of yet another nationwide lockdown,
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  despite the fact that deaths of completely flat-lying hospitals are empty,
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  then again, you all knew it was not.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  There was nothing to do with that in the first place.
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  Here is Noel Gallagher, Oasis star on base masks.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  Let's roll it.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  Yeah, it was good actually.
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  I've been tired this summer.
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  I mean, it's f*****g f*****g virus.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  Bull s**t in the masks and all that is f*****g depressing.
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  So if you've been out, you've been in a shop, so you must have a mask.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  I don't wear a mask now.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  Have you not?
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  So like, aren't you meant to buy a law in a shop and no one's enforcing it?
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  No.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  Is that what's going on?
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  No, you know, because it's the whole f*****g, the whole thing is bollocks.
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  You know, you're supposed to wear them in Selfridges,
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  yet you can f*****g go down the pub, be surrounded by every f*****g,
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  you know what I mean?
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  And it's like, oh, well actually, we don't have the virus in the pubs,
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  but they have it in Selfridges.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  All right, like I was going up to Manchester the other weekend,
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  f*****g guys going, can you put your mask on, on the train?
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  And I was like, they said, because the transport police are going to find you a thousand pounds,
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  but you don't have to put it on if you're eating.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  So I was saying, all right, so this killer virus that's sweeping through the train
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  is going to come and attack me, but it's going to see me out with a sandwich and go leave him.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  Yeah, but I get what you're saying, but what?
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  Tapping his lunch.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  But why that's wrong is because, like, they know that people have got to eat,
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  but like, for the times that you're not eating, because basically what's good about the mask is,
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  if someone's coughing next to you with coronavirus, the mask is going to lessen the dose you get, right?
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  So if you breathe in a lot of it, your immune system, no matter how healthy you are,
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  might be overwhelmed by it.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  Mate, listen to me, listen to me.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  When it's f*****g law, when it's a law, right, it's not a law,
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  there's too many f*****g liberties being taken away from us now and I'm afraid until, you know,
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  I've been in shops today, have you got a mask? No, I haven't.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  You have to wear a mask.
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  Says who?
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Oh, well, says the manager. Who's the manager?
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  Yeah, but who are you kicking back against?
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  Just like, because they don't, they've just told us to do.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  I don't give a f*****g.
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  I don't, I don't, I choose not to wear one.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  If I get the virus, it's on me.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  Yeah.
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  It's not on anyone else.
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  Right, so if every other f*****g's wearing a mask, I'm not going to catch it off them.
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  Right, and if I've got it, they're not going to catch it off me.
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  So f*****g, I just think it's a piss take.
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  Well, there you have it.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  And the other thing is, have you seen the size of the virus particle in comparison to these face masks?
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  Yeah, it's smaller, it goes right through.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  They don't stop 97% of particles going through them, completely, utterly pointless.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  And they were predicted 90 years ago by this German author, Ernst Junger, who wrote a classic dystopian novel called The Worker.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  And in fact, it harkens back to George Orwell's 1984 as well, in which he describes the masses as, quote,
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans,
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  300 million people, all with the same face.
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  And the same thing goes for celebrities in terms of all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  The reason why a clip like that one that you just heard is so remarkable is because the number of celebrities that are living,
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  that are still active today, who will ever speak out about anything that goes against this scientific dictatorship that is COVID lockdowns,
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  that is this violent revolutionary Marxist movement called Black Lives Matter.
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  You can count those celebrities probably in the United Kingdom on one hand.
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  In fact, there was another famous celebrity called Ian Brown.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  It was also around in the early 90s with Oasis, of course, with the stone roses.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  He came out against the mask tyranny against the vaccine agenda.
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  And he got completely pilloried by all these other celebrities who were completely pathetic, inauthentic, desperate,
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  living in fear of their precious careers being absolutely ruined.
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  Because when you look at people like Noel Galger, when you look at people like Morrissey,
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  when you look at people like Ian Brown, and you can make the same argument for celebrities in the US,
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  they've already achieved all their success, all their fame, all their money, all their prestige.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  It's all 20, 25, 30 years in the past.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  And those are the only kind of celebrities who are basically immune from cancellation.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  And that's what Kanye was talking about yesterday in his Twitter meltdown.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  You can't cancel me, even though Twitter did lock his account.
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  But generally speaking, you can't cancel somebody as big as Kanye, because he's already had all the success.
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  He's probably reached the zenith of his career anyway.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  So what else can he do with his time?
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  Then authentically spread a genuine message of good, which is what certain celebrities do.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  But again, you can probably count them on one hand.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  And that's what Noel Galger did in this clip that you just listened to.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  But it's also what Mr. Ernst Junger was doing 90 years ago in his classic dystopian novel, The Worker,
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  where, quote, the uniformity of the New Age is symbolized by the sudden proliferation of the mask in contemporary society.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  So again, he's talking about this hive mind mentality,
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  whereas Orwell talked about everybody shouts the same slogans, everybody believes the same things.
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  And the ultimate physical manifestation of that is everyone looking the same, too, by wearing the face mask.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  It is no coincidence, he writes, that the mask is again beginning to play a decisive role in public life.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  This is the author of the article.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  It's appearing in many ways, but be it a gas mask, and this is from the book, in fact, the 1930 book, The Worker.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  It's appearing in many different ways.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  He's talking about masks in general to create this uniform enslaved population that all thinks the same.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  Be it a gas mask, with which I was trying to equip entire populations, be it a face mask for sports and high speeds,
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  seen on every racing driver, be it as a safety mask for workplaces, exposed to radiation explosions or narcotic substances,
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  we can assume he continues with an eerie prescience that the mask will come to take on functions that we can today hardly imagine.
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  So he makes the point that in this book, this famous dystopian book, one of the ways in which they ensure that all the population remains obedient,
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:25.000]  thinks the same, and then enforces the new tyranny on each other is by the face mask.
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  The article goes on to explain how the public has been brainwashed to believe that the continuation of life,
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  no matter how stifled, atomized, and undignified it may be, which is precisely what it's become thanks to these lockdowns,
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  is the only consideration.
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  And I hear all these droopy self-empowerment TV commercials.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  Oh, hasn't Coronavirus brought us all closer?
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  No, it hasn't.
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:53.000]  No, it hasn't.
[3:16:53.000 --> 3:16:58.000]  People haven't seen their own families for getting on blind share of a year now.
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  Doing a Zoom call doesn't make up for it.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  People have been even more atomized by this in my experience.
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:09.000]  People talking to each other in person far less.
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  So how on earth is that bringing people closer together when you can't even be with more than five other people at a time right now in the United Kingdom?
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  And boy, is that going to get worse.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  They're now talking about reintroducing a national lockdown, which is what I predicted weeks ago.
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  I said they're already talking about doing it again in October.
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  We're now two weeks away from that.
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  And they're talking about exactly that.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:35.000]  We'll be back.
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  We're just going to go away.
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  Now on the clock to silence InfoWars.
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  And a lot of it I can't get into on air at this point.
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential.
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  And I thank you all for it.
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the InfoWars and make your life healthier and better at InfoWarsTour.com.

[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  Dependency.
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  Domestication.
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  In the real world, ignorance is not bliss.
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  It's enslavement and it's death.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't empower humanity, but makes us obsolete.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  But we're not obsolete.
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  We don't have to listen to them.
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  We can farm again.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  We can garden.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  We can become self-sufficient.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:05.000]  But first, we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient.
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:14.000]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists in their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda and with storeable food.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:19.000]  And we have it all, the highest quality, the highest rated at the lowest prices at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  Take action now.
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  We have the best water filtration, the best storeable food, and it funds the InfoWars.
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  Take action now while you still can.
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  Become prepared.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:20:01.000]  Become self-sufficient now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:27.000]  We have the best water filtration, the best storeable food, the highest rated at the lowest prices at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:34.000]  We've got to expose the globalists, we've got to take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes that they've actually committed.
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  Expose the enemy now.
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  Back to the main theme, which is the fact that you don't need police officers, you don't need security officials,
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  you don't need shopkeeper busybodies to enforce this mask wearing because it's done by the general public.
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  That's the entire point.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  They're whipped up into a frenzied lust for obedience because they were told at the beginning of this coronavirus lockdown
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  that what was it, 50 million people could die? No, it was 500,000 people could die in the UK by the same people doing these models now.
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  The same people were still listening to who got it catastrophically wrong.
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  You look at the coronavirus numbers in Sweden and cases, by the way, they've completely dropped off because they've got herd immunity.
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  And yet every single night, what do we hear on the mainstream media?
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  Oh, more cases.
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:54.000]  Look, more cases, more cases.
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  I'll tell you why there are more cases.
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  Because in the week up to September 11, there were 1.3 million coronavirus tests that took place in the UK.
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  OK, 1.3 million tests were done.
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:15.000]  You compare that to the first week of April, which is almost at the height of the entire coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom.
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  They did 95,000 tests in the first week of April.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  So you've got 1.3 million tests versus 95,000 tests.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  Boy, what do you think is going to happen?
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  And it's not just the fact that they're testing more than 10 times more people.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  That's why we're getting more cases.
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  We're not getting more deaths. They've blacklined.
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:39.000]  They're not only testing more people.
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:43.000]  The cases, the tests are producing false positives.
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  Now, flashback to this article.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  In Tanzania, they tested a goat and a pawpaw for coronavirus, and they both tested positive.
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  The pawpaw is a fruit, and it tested positive for coronavirus.
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  So more tests.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  Yeah, you're going to get more cases.
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:14.000]  They never mentioned the hospitalization number or the death number, because that tells you the truth right there, that it is, in fact.
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  As we know now from ONS figures, in fact, here's a headline from the Telegraph.
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  Again, this gets mentioned like in an article here and there.
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  It doesn't get mentioned on the six o'clock news where every single headline is cases, cases, fear.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:35.000]  Case studies of people who are anxious to even go outside their front door and making that the new normal.
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  That's what's being drilled into people.
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  And by and large, they've swallowed it.
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  Headline out of the Telegraph. Flu and pneumonia have contributed to more deaths than COVID since June, new ONS figures show.
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  Again, we never had any kind of lockdown for flu and pneumonia.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  We never had the government telling us we couldn't meet more than five other people.
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  We never had the government telling us to snitch on our neighbors because of flu and pneumonia.
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  Yet that is now demonstrably a bigger killer than COVID in the United Kingdom.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  Demonstrably so.
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  And yet what do the British people think about this?
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  They want more lockdown.
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  It's not enough.
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  They want to literally be put under a house curfew and a house arrest.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  This is how hysterical this moral panic has become.
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  Headline out of Breitbart. Liberty going out of fashion.
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  69% of Britain support 9pm coronavirus curfew.
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  And by the way, they had polls a couple of months ago, I think, where it was like 84% wanted a new lockdown.
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  Maybe it's improving. I don't know.
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  But still an overwhelming majority of Britain surveyed in a snap poll support the government further restricting their freedoms.
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  And those of their neighbors as the possibility of a nightly curfew to prevent merrymaking grows.
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  By the way, they've already instituted 10pm curfews in the northeast of the country on pubs and restaurants.
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  Again, they're on their knees. They're all going out of business.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  Well, here's another lockdown for you.
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  A combined 69% of Britons asked in a YouGov poll said they supported a 9pm curfew on pubs and bars to help reduce COVID-19 cases,
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  which 38% said they felt very strongly in support of the idea.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  So again, it's not enough for them.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  It's not enough that they can't see more than five people.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  It's not enough that people in numerous areas of the country are getting locked down wholesale.
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  No, they want more tyranny.
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  Even though the deaths of flatline, the hospitalizations of flatline, flu and pneumonia are more deadly.
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  It doesn't matter because that's not what they're being fed by the mainstream media.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  The coronavirus government dismisses claims of fresh two-week national lockdown.
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  They quickly came out and tried to push that one up, even though it's what I've been predicting for months,
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  that they had planned in advance to have a national lockdown in October.
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  And I'm going back to this article, the author of dystopian classics predicted face masks, because the author of the article,
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  which this is based on, makes a very good point, he says,
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  given the sudden ubiquity of the face mask in 2020 across the entire globe and in an increasing number of social contexts,
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that this is precisely the sort of development Younger had in mind.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  Our readiness to obscure the face reflects the dehumanizing tendencies that for Younger underlie the modern period.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  It represents another stage in the degradation of the individual that became explicit in the First World War,
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  where there is a scrap of material on the battlefield or a cog in the machine of the wartime economy.
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  The modern age has a habit of reducing the human being to a functional object,
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  everything non-essential, everything that is, that makes us human, is blindly discarded.
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  Again, which goes back to that quote from Orwell about people all thinking the same thoughts, shouting the same slogans,
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  300 million people all with the same face.
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  And it's not just the case in public, it's the case on every social media platform going,
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  which is why anyone, when anyone tries to go against the grain, they're smashed back down in a heartbeat,
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  banned, censored, ridiculed, attacked.
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  Because again, the mob has coalesced around this single unity, this single hive mind, and it's absolutely chilling.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  And it's chilling the fact that they're now openly saying, admitting that they can't get the police to enforce these lockdowns,
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  so other people will do it by snitching on their neighbors, completely insidious,
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  should have no place in any free country.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  Somebody made this comment to the Lockdown Skeptics website regarding the hysteria surrounding all this.
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  He said, from needing to protect our NHS, which is what we were told, by the way, we were told at the start,
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  oh, you just need to lock down for a while to protect the NHS.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  The NHS was never in trouble.
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  They built entire new hospitals, nightingale hospitals, which were never opened across the entire country,
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  a colossal waste of money.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  In fact, there's videos of nurses, the ones who actually tell the truth, and they're like, why is everyone applauding me?
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  Why am I being celebrated as some kind of god?
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  When I've literally done nothing for the past three months, like four months, it's been pretty much like a holiday for a lot of them,
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  because the hospitals have been empty, because people with the actual illnesses are staying away and dying,
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  because they're not getting treatment, again, because they're hysterically paranoid about catching COVID-19.
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  So they're not getting cancer treatment.
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  1.4 million people will die from TB, because they didn't get the treatment, because they couldn't get into hospitals.
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  That outpaces the total number of people in the world who have died from COVID-19.
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  A great chunk of people, as you know, would unfortunately have died anyway, because they had comorbidities before COVID.
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  But this commenter on lockdown skeptics made the point, from needing to protect our NHS,
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  from being overwhelmed, we went to needing to protect ourselves against a new surge of infections brought in from other countries,
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  and now as testing becomes more widespread, more cases are used to scare us.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:55.000]  Again, they could test a piece of fruit and it's positive for coronavirus, which are not cases at all,
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:29:59.000]  but positive results in healthy people with PCR testing.
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  This finds a genetic needle in a haystack, quite possibly a signal from a previous infection with another of the 100 or so coronaviruses out there.
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  They've spent billions on lockdowns of proven uselessness, millions on buying up a vaccine that doesn't yet exist,
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  and yet papers like the Mirror Guardian are baying for still more interference,
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:29.000]  including Stalinist snitching on neighbours who break the entirely non-evidence-based instructions.
[3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  Absolutely, van gone, we'll be back with more after the break, summit.news.go.
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:05.000]  Folks told that it was a blimp, they didn't want to believe it, you see, they had already told themselves it was a UFO,
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:12.000]  so they had cognitive distance. It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu,
[3:31:12.000 --> 3:31:17.000]  but people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in their houses.
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:24.000]  Well, it happened again over in New Jersey yesterday, the Goodyear blimp was out there with a big gumbotron TV screen on the side of it,
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:30.000]  had flashing lights on it, just like an airplane, and the public thought it was a UFO, and now the public still believes it was a UFO,
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  and now they were told it wasn't. You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves.
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:42.000]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands,
[3:31:42.000 --> 3:31:47.000]  but if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic.
[3:31:47.000 --> 3:31:50.000]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them,
[3:31:50.000 --> 3:31:55.000]  so for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit,
[3:31:55.000 --> 3:32:02.000]  and it's similar to how ducks and butterflies of many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place
[3:32:02.000 --> 3:32:08.000]  where they were born. They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains,
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  we now know side-diflutes are going on, there's even a lot more than that.
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:16.000]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter, we're talking about all the things you don't understand,
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  but we know it's there. And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system,
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:26.000]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people,
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:50.000]  and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated in space-time continuum.
[3:32:56.000 --> 3:33:03.000]  That China wants Joe Biden. Info Wars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day.
[3:33:03.000 --> 3:33:10.000]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  and they're not even hiding that it's coming directly out of Communist China.
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:23.000]  America is fighting for its life. Everyone that votes for Joe Biden is a stooge of Communist China
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:27.000]  and an idiot trying to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:35.000]  But no matter what happens in this election, the awakening and the chain reaction has begun and cannot be reversed!
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do,
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.

[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  And we are back.
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  I'm going to get into some big file news stories.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  I'm going to play a clip of a grandmother who confronted a teacher
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  telling her granddaughter that she couldn't have an opinion on Black Lives Matter
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  because she had white skin and blonde hair.
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  This is what your kids are being taught.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  In a way, coronavirus has been good because it shut down the schools for a while.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  Maybe we should be celebrating it.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  Anyway, infowarstore.com is where you need to be right now
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  because we have the Info Wars Emergency Election Sale.

[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  because I guess he's going to let slip that that's where he's destined for
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  with his Harris Biden administration.
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  Info Wars shield, don't tread on me.

[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  I'm going to go to this clip.
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  Headline, teacher tells students she doesn't have the right to an opinion
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  because she's white and blonde.
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  This is a phone call of a grandmother confronting a teacher
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  after her granddaughter came home sobbing
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  and talking about how she'd been lectured for being white in class.
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  Let's go to the clip.
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  Hello, can I help you?
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  Oh, hi, this is Kelsey Murphy's grandmother.
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  Hello.
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  Oh, hi.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  Hi.
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  Kelsey's just called me crying.
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  As you know, she hasn't came to school because of this BLN crap.
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  It was reported.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  I've got a video recording, a voice recorder.
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  Of you saying that Kelsey doesn't have an opinion because she was born here
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  and she's white and she's blonde here.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  Is that correct?
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  Sorry?
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  Did you say to the children this morning, yeah,
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  you lay saying stuff like that,
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  that Kelsey shouldn't have an opinion because she's white
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  and she was born here and she's got blonde hair?
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  Did I say this?
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:03.000]  Yes.
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  Well, I can't remember, maybe.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  Well, I can't remember, maybe.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  Or maybe.
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  Maybe.
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  This is a very sensitive subject.
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  It's very sensitive.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  The girls were telling me their side of the story.
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  And I said, well, because there's privilege, isn't there?
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  And there's...
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  Kelsey would not have lived through what you lately have lived through.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  That's what I was trying to say.
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  All right.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  So you actually did say that then?
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  Well, who has said this?
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  Is there evidence actually?
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  Yes.
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  Oh, yes, there is evidence.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:47.000]  And you've just admitted you've said it.
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  Do you understand?
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  You know, this was a conversation about this very, very divisive thing.
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  Yes, aha.
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  Yes.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  And the girls said to me that Kelsey said something about black lives,
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  does it matter?
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  And I said, Kelsey isn't in a position to know how black girls feel.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  All right.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  Okay.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  She's human, you know.
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  Sorry?
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  She's human.
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  Sorry, I didn't understand that last bit.
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  Kelsey is human.
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  No, she's human.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  She's human, Nan, but she's not black.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  She's not black?
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  What does that mean?
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  And what does that mean?
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  I don't know.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  I mean, what do you want me to say?
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  Well, you know something?
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  Your statement was absolutely racist.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  So basically, kids are being taught in high schools in the UK that their opinion is worth less
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  because of the skin colour they were born with and have no control over.
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  That's otherwise known as racism.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  And more of these cases are propping up because as we highlighted last month,
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  there was a leftist teacher who expressed his vehement concern that these remote learning
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  classes that had been taking place because the schools weren't open due to COVID-19 were
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  letting parents know what was going on with the indoctrination of their children.
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  So he was like freaking out saying, oh my God, we've got one that can see the parents are
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  going to become aware of this.
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  They're going to pull their kids out of school because this has been going on for years and
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  that's yet another example of it.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  And again, it's not just in the schools.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  It's not just on the news media.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  It's throughout the institutions.
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  BBC stands by a comedian who said, kill Whitey on national television.
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  Here we go again.
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  The BBC is stood by a comedian for joking about killing Whitey on Frankie Boyle's show claiming
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  it was simply satirical content.
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  Frankie Boyle is a completely inauthentic sellout fraud.
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  I know this for a fact because I know people who work around him.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  He used to be one of the most daring, funny, offensive comedians in Britain, often getting
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  his shows canceled, often getting kicked off TV shows, but he was funny.
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  He was daring.
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  He was authentic.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  Now he's a pathetic worm.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  He just regurgitates whatever woke crap the BBC has on its agenda.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  And literally has on guests that joke about killing the entire White race.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  Oh, it's so funny.
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  It's so funny.
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  And I'm sure there'd be an equal platform if somebody wanted to get on the BBC and joke
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  about killing all Black people.
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  Oh, it's just free speech.
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  The guy that writes with him literally contacted me on Twitter and was like, oh, are you supposed
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  to support free speech?
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  There is no free speech.
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  Only free speech for saying you want the White race to be eradicated.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  That's the only free speech that's celebrated now.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  Great.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  Well, no, I don't support that.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  Sophie Duker appeared on Frankie Boyle's lame BBC Two show, which had terrible ratings because
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  he's a sellout fraud, where she made the comments about killing Whitey.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  She said, White power is Trump Tower.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  When we say we want to kill Whitey, we don't really want to kill Whitey.
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  But then quickly added, we do.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  And everybody laughed.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  And you had this idiotic, unfunny female comedian doing a concerned nodding of her head in agreement
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  because you don't disagree with a Black person on the television.
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  That is a hate crime, especially if they're calling joking about killing the White race.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  How dare you disagree with that?
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  And of course, this is after the BBC hired a new director general who said that he would
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  try to move the corporation away from its inherent hysterical woke bias, that he would try to
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  restrain its staffers, its presenters from tweeting far left rhetoric.
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  That doesn't seem to have happened thus far.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  I mean, it was seen as a massive battle in the culture war when rural Britannia and Jerusalem
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  were allowed to be sung at the last night of the proms.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  They tried to cancel that saying it was racist, just because the song contains a lyric saying
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  we will never be slaves.
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:19.000]  Well, we are slaves, aren't we?
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  We're slaves to this woke mob that's taken over literally everything and ruined society.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  But the bad news for the BBC is this headline out of Breitbart.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  BBC TV tax subscribers collapsed by a quarter of a million in one year.
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:38.000]  Oh, dear.
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:44.000]  The BBC funding license fee has seen its sharpest decline in recent history, losing some 256,000
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  households in just one year as the broadcaster faces a crisis in confidence over its liberal,
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  metropolitan bias.
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  For those of you who don't know, if you don't pay a mandatory TV license fee in the UK, which
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  amounts to about $200 a year, which if you're struggling to get by financially, that's a
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:11.000]  lot of money, you get harassed on a weekly basis by TV license inspectors who knock on
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:12.000]  your door.
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  You get threatening letters through the mail every month.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:19.000]  And eventually you could even go to prison.
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  That's how the TV license works.
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  They literally put people in prison for not paying this mandatory fee for the BBC.
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  And even if you say, I don't have a television or I don't watch the BBC, you know, for example,
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  you might say, I've only got Netflix.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  I've only got an Apple box.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  I've only got YouTube.
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  They still demand to come in your house and inspect it.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  And they still send you threatening letters through the post.
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:45.000]  Well, Brits are getting sick of it.
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  Last year, 1.61 million Britons cancelled their TV license up from 1.38 million from
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  the year before.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  The loss in viewership resulted in 58 million pounds less in revenue.
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  And is it really any surprise given that they've literally got comedians getting up on television
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  joking?
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:06.000]  Oh, it's just a joke.
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:09.000]  It's not a joke because it's not even funny.
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  It's just reinforcing this Marxist hate through crap comedy that's not even funny.
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  But the BBC is going broke.
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:18.000]  That's the good news.
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  And that's where we're going to leave it.
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  War Room coming up next, Summit.News, don't go away.
