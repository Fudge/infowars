[00:00.000 --> 00:21.960]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones and now your
[00:21.960 --> 00:37.680]  host Owen Troyer well there's a major sign of the times right now which is the fact
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.920]  that President Trump's approval rating is higher right now than President
[00:43.920 --> 00:53.920]  Obama's was at the same time in his presidency now why is this key because
[00:53.920 --> 01:01.160]  Barack Obama was a mainstream media hero Barack Obama was a mainstream media
[01:01.160 --> 01:08.840]  darling Barack Obama could do no wrong Donald Trump on the other hand is a
[01:08.840 --> 01:16.640]  mainstream media pinata Donald Trump is a mainstream media target Donald Trump
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.440]  Donald Trump is the enemy of the mainstream media and yet who has the
[01:23.440 --> 01:32.160]  higher approval rating Barack Obama or Donald Trump Donald Trump now what is
[01:32.160 --> 01:42.520]  that indicative of the mainstream media has lost its stranglehold on America and
[01:42.520 --> 01:46.600]  the mainstream media will never admit that they'll never report that but
[01:46.600 --> 01:55.320]  that's the real story and that's why they're pulling all the stops to try and
[01:55.320 --> 02:04.440]  censor info wars and other alternative news sources or alternative just people
[02:04.440 --> 02:10.560]  on social media doing live videos starting their own shows doing their own
[02:10.560 --> 02:18.200]  political activism they've totally lost their stranglehold on the public but
[02:18.200 --> 02:23.600]  that's the story that nobody's reporting on isn't it the fact that despite all the
[02:23.600 --> 02:28.120]  mainstream news attacks despite all the deep state attacks despite the deep state
[02:28.120 --> 02:32.280]  coup I mean do I really have to go down the list of everything that they have
[02:32.280 --> 02:37.400]  done to try and destroy Donald Trump and yet his approval rating today is I
[02:37.400 --> 02:48.200]  think 53% Obama's was 47% at the same time just think about that the American
[02:48.200 --> 02:57.840]  Revolution is on right now the media is just not telling you it may be something
[02:57.840 --> 03:04.120]  that you haven't really seen or experienced yet but I think slowly but
[03:04.120 --> 03:10.400]  surely we're gonna come to a point here in a couple years where instead of say
[03:10.400 --> 03:16.200]  let's say your favorite basketball team is in the finals and you walk around
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.320]  town and everyone's talking about hey did you see the game you see the game in
[03:19.320 --> 03:21.720]  a couple years it's gonna be hey did you hear what Trump did hey did you see what
[03:21.720 --> 03:23.920]  they lied about hey did you see what happened last night in the election hey
[03:23.920 --> 03:29.040]  did you see that this is where we're going Alex Jones is on a working trip out
[03:29.040 --> 03:32.400]  in California there's a lot of powerful video that's going to be coming out of
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.800]  this trip you're starting to see a little bit of that leak Alex Jones joins
[03:36.800 --> 03:40.680]  us on the phone now Alex it's an incredible time to be a part of this
[03:40.680 --> 03:47.160]  revolution but the mainstream media will never report on it absolutely and when
[03:47.160 --> 03:53.600]  we come back from break I want to open up with the Candace Owens testimony you
[03:53.600 --> 03:56.760]  know I was first going to go into California because Candace invited me
[03:56.760 --> 04:00.920]  on her podcast a few weeks ago but then I ended up setting up five or six other
[04:00.920 --> 04:04.680]  interviews while I was gonna be there but she had to cancel that because she
[04:04.680 --> 04:10.800]  got summoned to Congress for the hearings that we just saw and classically
[04:10.800 --> 04:14.800]  Congressman Lou who's attacked me in that very committee hearing room repeatedly
[04:14.800 --> 04:18.360]  with incredible eyes when I'm in the committee room of course I don't get
[04:18.360 --> 04:21.720]  that face my cues or at least she did and we learned why they don't like that
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.640]  she cleaned the floor off the floor with him he played an edited tape out of
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.200]  context of her criticizing Hitler and of course you know she's not put out the
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.960]  full clip but this is what Megan Kelly did to me this is what John Ronson who
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.000]  swore up and down with his NPR piece that he'd be fair it was total lies what
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.920]  they aired was completely made up whole cloth fiction but that's all these
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.600]  people have got and it really shows how weak they are sort of cover this is so
[04:51.600 --> 04:55.120]  much more on the other side no one's shorter myself than any others in full

[06:05.680 --> 06:14.520]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[06:14.520 --> 06:26.960]  now your host Owen Troyer there's a cultural and intellectual revolution
[06:26.960 --> 06:35.760]  happening worldwide and once again you can point to the West spurring it along
[06:35.760 --> 06:40.200]  where we reached our tipping point elected Donald Trump and now our battling
[06:40.200 --> 06:43.600]  every day to save this Republic other nations around the world are seeing that
[06:43.600 --> 06:52.000]  and they're taking action there's so much big news to cover right now and Alex
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.120]  Jones is with us to break it all down but we're gonna be getting to all the
[06:56.120 --> 07:00.880]  news we've got great guests coming up Alex I'm not even sure what is the
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.000]  biggest news right now I mean we got medical tyranny happening we got
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.560]  revolutions happening worldwide for nationalism we've got a wide open border
[07:07.560 --> 07:11.320]  that's a national emergency we've got the deep state getting totally exposed
[07:11.320 --> 07:14.760]  right now with this fake Russian collusion witch hunt we've got Trump's
[07:14.760 --> 07:18.400]  rating higher than Obama's at the same time despite all the lies and attacks
[07:18.400 --> 07:23.840]  against him and everything the left seems to do right now is just a total
[07:23.840 --> 07:28.640]  failure Alex and you were highlighting this and using the Candace Owen's
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.280]  testimony yesterday as an example I mean it's just amazing to me
[07:33.280 --> 07:37.400]  Obama bills cages at the borders they blame Trump Trump builds the economy they
[07:37.400 --> 07:42.920]  give credit to Obama I mean Alex where does this madness end well it ends when
[07:42.920 --> 07:46.200]  we stop letting these bullies intimidate us and run our lives and that's
[07:46.200 --> 07:52.880]  exactly my top story today after we talk about Candace Owens is that all over
[07:52.880 --> 07:57.360]  the Western world they're bringing in unlimited illegal aliens from places
[07:57.360 --> 08:01.760]  that have been bonded plague drug-resistant TV measles months
[08:01.760 --> 08:06.960]  rubella and then in New York and in California where they've had the the
[08:06.960 --> 08:11.160]  outbreaks in four different towns in New York and a bunch of towns in
[08:11.160 --> 08:15.360]  California the local health department always admits we played this about a
[08:15.360 --> 08:18.880]  week ago I think more of the truth about me pull it up for the next segment of the
[08:18.880 --> 08:25.040]  headline it was a local news story on the New York it was the head of the
[08:25.040 --> 08:28.280]  health department but the headline was New York official admits illegal
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.000]  aliens caused measles outbreak and so the illegal aliens caused the measles
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.560]  outbreak people that are actually vaccinated get it it doesn't really
[08:38.560 --> 08:42.840]  protect you that exposes that it's really running water and detergent and
[08:42.840 --> 08:47.680]  clean society that basically took a lot of these diseases down to nothing and
[08:47.680 --> 08:51.440]  that it is the fact that these countries don't have running water and people
[08:51.440 --> 08:54.560]  wiped their butts with their hands and there's all these incredible bacteria
[08:54.560 --> 08:59.360]  strains involved in everything that that is causing it so I'm gonna say that
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.000]  again folks you can look it up but it's only in local news in California in New
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.240]  York where they've had measles months rubella all this stuff coming back it's
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.280]  always the illegal aliens that are spreading it and it's vaccinated people
[09:13.280 --> 09:16.760]  that are getting it and that's destroying the illusion I mean my
[09:16.760 --> 09:22.800]  children you have friends that they know that say to them you know my mom or my
[09:22.800 --> 09:26.560]  dad's afraid I'm gonna get sick because you're not vaccinated and my kids are
[09:26.560 --> 09:31.920]  like wait a minute you're vaccinated you're supposedly protected so now in
[09:31.920 --> 09:36.760]  New York City Governor de Blasio is ordering outside of law it's full of
[09:36.760 --> 09:43.000]  martial law that the that the orthodox Jewish groups take vaccines as they're
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.680]  not stupid and Leviticus tells them don't take foreign substances and other
[09:49.680 --> 09:53.920]  people's blood other people's seed other people's genetics and put it in your
[09:53.920 --> 09:59.320]  body well those orthodox Jews know they read the vaccine insert and it says it
[09:59.320 --> 10:02.520]  comes from fetal tissue it says it comes from all these things they know
[10:02.520 --> 10:07.360]  there's cancer virus in it most cancers viral the massive increase in cancer with
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.880]  young people everywhere getting cancer is from the vaccines the viruses embed in
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.680]  your bones and in your lungs and in other areas where viruses precipitate out
[10:18.680 --> 10:25.280]  in the body I'm gonna say it again your bones your lungs your brain and other
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.760]  areas so if you want a big old fat juicy brain tumor when you're 18 years
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.440]  older 10 years older you want a big old juicy bone tumor you want a big old
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.600]  juicy little tumor in your lung just remember it's not my opinion it is a
[10:38.600 --> 10:44.200]  fact that sv-40 is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control in a 1979
[10:44.200 --> 10:51.440]  report anybody can pull this up you usually click images CDC report on HPV
[10:51.440 --> 10:59.120]  CDC report on human papillomavirus 40 and you type in human papillomavirus 40
[10:59.120 --> 11:04.000]  you'll get the report that they believe over a hundred million people got cancer
[11:04.000 --> 11:13.840]  from the polio vaccine alone over 100 million Americans got cancer many of
[11:13.840 --> 11:21.920]  them died X's in the eyes cremated in the ground gone finale over bye bye fat
[11:21.920 --> 11:27.520]  lady song show there is a giant covert operation to put cancer viruses in the
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.840]  vaccines it's a fact the insert even tell you it could have cancer viruses in it
[11:32.840 --> 11:37.760]  and they think you're so stupid so buddy it's Logan's run everybody it's
[11:37.760 --> 11:42.880]  carousel it's lower the population it's our dogs it's moon raker it's all these
[11:42.880 --> 11:46.960]  movies telling you the elite want you dead the elite first don't want to watch
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.280]  you die slowly and suck all your family's money and your church's money and
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.480]  your savings out well they give you bug poison for a thousand dollars of
[11:55.480 --> 12:00.520]  treatment patented bug poison it costs them like three cents to make that's
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.440]  right the chemo is a bug poison and sure it may kill the cancer sometimes the
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.840]  point is it's bug poison bug poison bug poison and so this is the this is the
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.160]  big pharma assault where they give you HIV's of the factory rate bear on
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.320]  purpose where they ship the oxycock not have doctors prescribe it knowing they'll
[12:18.320 --> 12:21.240]  make 13 million dollars they get you addicted and control you where they
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.520]  knowingly put cancer viruses in the vaccines of the Gardasil vaccine
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.160]  sterilizes the women so it's all admitted they bring in the illegal
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.120]  aliens who literally and for many of these countries wipes their butts with
[12:34.120 --> 12:38.600]  their hands there's no toilet paper they literally all over western Europe
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.160]  they're now removing toilets and say we need to embrace their culture and crap
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.440]  in a hole in the floor and then wipe your butts with with your hand and then
[12:46.440 --> 12:50.600]  and then wash it down a filthy sink okay this is their plan to make
[12:50.600 --> 12:55.240]  civilization go in reverse the globalist want a post-industrial world a
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.640]  collapsing austere planet for us total wealth of power for them we're being
[12:59.640 --> 13:02.720]  taught to hate the world we're being taught that architecture is ugly that
[13:02.720 --> 13:06.520]  art is ugly that men and women being together is ugly all the numbers show
[13:06.520 --> 13:09.240]  we're being imploded we're being brought down we're being taught to have our
[13:09.240 --> 13:13.000]  life force destroyed by these globalist but humanity is coming back and the
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.240]  globalists are failing they're failing ladies and gentlemen the truth is
[13:16.240 --> 13:19.240]  getting out no matter what they do and as long as the listeners keep taking
[13:19.240 --> 13:22.720]  action and keep spreading the word and keep supporting the local stations we
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.840]  are invincible because info wars is the tip of the spear but when we come back
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.640]  we're going to get to Candace Owens in these incredible clips because it's
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.040]  bigger than Candace Owens it's bigger than that and this is and this is a top
[13:37.040 --> 13:41.200]  story regardless but they have this so-called white supremacism hearing
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.480]  believing the troll of New Zealand who said oh I'm a radical all this stuff but
[13:46.480 --> 13:49.720]  I really love Candace Owens she's more radical than me that was a total troll
[13:49.720 --> 13:54.320]  that her he even admitted it was a troll so they call her up there and then
[13:54.320 --> 13:58.320]  believe the propaganda they follow his propaganda give the terrorists exactly
[13:58.320 --> 14:02.160]  what you want and then they say that she's a white supremacist and play an
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.200]  edited 30-second clip which which indicts of them as total frauds then they
[14:07.200 --> 14:13.000]  lie and tell her to shut up that she just called Congressman Lou stupid when
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.600]  she didn't do that they lied again in front of everyone thinking you're dumb
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.880]  she said that he thinks the American people are stupid and then what does
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.040]  Nadler do he goes how dare you call him stupid and she called him on that
[14:25.040 --> 14:29.720]  they're not used to it they lie with it punitive and they're not getting away
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.120]  with it anymore so we're gonna play her opening statement we're gonna play them
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.960]  playing the edited Hitler clip she then absolutely destroys them and then
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.960]  Nadler just shrugs his evil penguin shoulders because he thinks he's beaten
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.520]  America he takes blacks are literally his slave the Democrats believe they
[14:46.520 --> 14:50.480]  own black people they broke up their family scientifically they shipped in
[14:50.480 --> 14:55.360]  the weaponized gangster cult music from the left of CIA and the black people are
[14:55.360 --> 15:02.680]  the beta test for everybody else in this country and in this world and Alex I
[15:02.680 --> 15:08.720]  don't think people realize how corrupt these Democrats actually are until they
[15:08.720 --> 15:13.200]  see them lying to their face until they see them say oh don't believe your lying
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.080]  eyes listen to me Trump built those cages that the kids were put in doesn't
[15:18.080 --> 15:22.400]  matter if that photos from 2014 that young white boy in a Trump ad he got
[15:22.400 --> 15:25.840]  in that Indians in that Native Americans face by the way that Native
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.560]  Americans a war hero all untrue so I think people are actually now seeing
[15:29.560 --> 15:37.720]  the desperation in their lies and wondering who are these people they
[15:37.720 --> 15:41.080]  are monsters that have gotten away with so much so long they're doubling down the
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.800]  lies but it's not working we're at the tipping point this is a critical time

[20:36.600 --> 20:39.960]  be back very soon I'll ensure you're doing a great job as a bunch of very
[20:39.960 --> 20:43.600]  informative guests coming up with some incredible video and audio he's gonna be
[20:43.600 --> 20:48.800]  playing I'll tell you about the start of the next segment but first when I got
[20:48.800 --> 20:53.320]  to know Candace Owens a few years ago she'd run their IP addresses and
[20:53.320 --> 20:58.280]  confirmed that liberal feminist saw that she was good-looking and smart and
[20:58.280 --> 21:04.320]  charismatic had all the things she needed and that she was building a social
[21:04.320 --> 21:07.840]  media presence very quickly and so they sort of sending her threatening
[21:07.840 --> 21:12.120]  messages from so-called white supremacists saying we're gonna get you but
[21:12.120 --> 21:15.640]  didn't suddenly the feminist reach out and said we'll protect you now this
[21:15.640 --> 21:19.200]  will be doing colleges all over the country the buses arrive with the kids
[21:19.200 --> 21:23.040]  to college they get dumped off the parents top them off and then the left
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.320]  has come the professors come and they say oh my god there's a KKK rally today
[21:27.320 --> 21:30.800]  they're coming for you you've got to come to this meeting we're gonna protect
[21:30.800 --> 21:34.960]  you and then they take him literally into a little auditorium area and begin
[21:34.960 --> 21:38.920]  the hardcore brainwashing that's how PETA does it they take people into an
[21:38.920 --> 21:42.360]  area and show them animals having their heads cut off bloodspray everywhere the
[21:42.360 --> 21:47.040]  very worst footage ever so it's part of traumatizing people with a false flag so
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.320]  the Democrats entire narrative is about deception is about lies is about false
[21:52.320 --> 21:55.640]  flags he is about traumatizing people that's why they want me off the air
[21:55.640 --> 21:59.600]  because I question any big public event sometimes it stays sometimes it isn't
[21:59.600 --> 22:04.920]  but they always use it for power but imagine she woke up from being a
[22:04.920 --> 22:11.560]  leftist mainline liberal by the fact that she caught them in the same IP
[22:11.560 --> 22:17.800]  addresses sending her emails text messages private messages on YouTube all
[22:17.800 --> 22:21.560]  the rest of it threatening her and then sending her messages consoling her
[22:21.560 --> 22:27.720]  playing good cop bad cop she awoken Paul Watson learned about her promoted her
[22:27.720 --> 22:31.000]  she exploded we had her to Austin she exploded got contacted by the Trump
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.880]  people she's done a great job promoted by Kanye West all the rest of it but
[22:35.880 --> 22:41.600]  imagine a country in a world where a psychotic goes in a very very very
[22:41.600 --> 22:47.360]  smelly situation with this big manifesto trying to cause a global race war
[22:47.360 --> 22:52.440]  he specifically singles Candace Owens out later admits it's a troll they have
[22:52.440 --> 22:57.760]  congressional hearings a month later and play an edited clip off of the
[22:57.760 --> 23:03.680]  congressman's phones congressman lose phone and then tries to imply that she
[23:03.680 --> 23:07.760]  likes Hitler so they totally took the false bait that this terrorist put out
[23:07.760 --> 23:12.760]  and they're running with it 100% precisely which being an exolting more
[23:12.760 --> 23:16.040]  mysterious isn't how he's had this plan they're all going along with it
[23:16.040 --> 23:20.000]  using it for censorship using it for control now they have these hearings and
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.520]  here's this beautiful smart charismatic woman who's got even stronger now
[23:24.520 --> 23:28.560]  because you know she's been in the sunlight for a few years and really had
[23:28.560 --> 23:32.400]  time to fight and grow imagine somebody like Candace Owens getting elected to
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.640]  Congress he's only 20 something years old imagine how she'd be at 35 or 40
[23:36.640 --> 23:41.320]  ready to run for president ready to win and people black white holes young
[23:41.320 --> 23:46.000]  would support her or somebody like her could relaunch America there are so many
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.200]  real black women like her out there so many real white women Hispanic women
[23:50.200 --> 23:55.080]  Asian women but you look at Democratic women they're evil hateful witches that
[23:55.080 --> 23:58.160]  want to control other women that know they're lying about all this
[23:58.160 --> 24:02.760]  propaganda that know they're just scaring women into a plantation how the
[24:02.760 --> 24:07.840]  pimps when a woman comes to LA she's 18 she wants to be a movie star a pimps there
[24:07.840 --> 24:10.760]  tells her he'll take care of her he'll tell her there's dangerous people on
[24:10.760 --> 24:14.480]  the streets he'll show her some dangerous stuff happening and a year later
[24:14.480 --> 24:18.560]  she's got cigarette burns all over she's lost 50 pounds and she's ready for a
[24:18.560 --> 24:22.840]  mental institution while the drug she's been on Democrats are pimps and they
[24:22.840 --> 24:28.880]  induct women particularly onto their pimp plantation so they tried to pimp her
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.360]  onto their plantation it didn't work because she actually grew up on a
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.680]  plantation and knows what a plantation is as she explains in her opening
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.360]  statement that she says after the break but just think about that and I want to
[24:42.360 --> 24:45.840]  play a few minutes of this this is Congressman Lou who lied about me in the
[24:45.840 --> 24:49.720]  very same committee hearing months ago right to my face but I couldn't face my
[24:49.720 --> 24:53.400]  user at least she did and she mopped the floor with him he plays an edited clip
[24:53.400 --> 24:57.200]  that she likes Hitler she then of course exposes what she really said and she has
[24:57.200 --> 25:01.840]  a full clip on her Twitter showing what a pre-meditated fraud he is then Nadler
[25:01.840 --> 25:05.640]  says how dare you call him stupid don't do that she didn't call him stupid she
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.960]  said you think we're stupid proving it they lie to her face and the camera's
[25:09.960 --> 25:14.600]  faces and that were just shrugs these people are criminals and they're used
[25:14.600 --> 25:18.120]  to no one saying no to them and no one calling them out they are unbelievably
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.760]  dangerous here is part of the exchange right now all the people that Republicans
[25:22.760 --> 25:27.920]  could have selected they pick Candace Owens I don't know miss Owens I'm not
[25:27.920 --> 25:31.800]  gonna characterize her I'm gonna let her own words through the talking so I'm
[25:31.800 --> 25:36.000]  gonna play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement you made about Adolf
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.480]  Hitler I agree I actually don't have any problems at all with the word
[25:43.480 --> 25:49.320]  nationalism I think that it gets the definition gets poisoned by leaders that
[25:49.320 --> 25:53.160]  actually want globalism globalism is what I what I don't want so when you
[25:53.160 --> 25:55.840]  think about whenever we say nationalism the first thing people think about in
[25:55.840 --> 26:00.360]  at least in America is Hitler you know he was a national socialist but if Hitler
[26:00.360 --> 26:04.560]  just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well okay fine problem is
[26:04.560 --> 26:09.080]  is that he wanted he had dreams outside of Germany he wanted to globalize he
[26:09.080 --> 26:14.120]  wanted everybody to be German everybody to be speaking German right so my first
[26:14.120 --> 26:20.640]  question is to miss Hershinoff miss Owen said quote if Hitler just wanted to
[26:20.640 --> 26:25.360]  make Germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is that he
[26:25.360 --> 26:30.120]  wanted he had dreams outside of Germany so when people try to legitimize Adolf
[26:30.120 --> 26:38.160]  Hitler does that feed into white nationalist ideology it does mr. Lou I
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.320]  know that miss Owens distanced herself from those comments later but we
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.560]  expressed great concern over the original comments great thank you thank
[26:47.560 --> 26:52.960]  you miss Owen miss Owens I'm sorry we just started recording would you like
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.760]  time to respond to that yes I think it's pretty apparent that mr. Lou believes
[26:57.760 --> 27:01.640]  that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in his entirety
[27:01.640 --> 27:07.080]  he purposely presented an extract the extra clip we just will suspend for a
[27:07.080 --> 27:13.360]  moment it is not proper to refer disparagingly or with to a member of
[27:13.360 --> 27:19.040]  the committee the witness will not do that again witness may continue sure
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.840]  even though I was called despicable witness may not refer to a member of
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.480]  the committee is stupid I didn't refer to him as stupid that's not what I said
[27:26.480 --> 27:33.200]  it's not what I said at all you didn't listen to what I said may I continue with
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.680]  please as I said he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.920]  two-hour clip and he purposefully extracted he cut off and you didn't hear
[27:42.920 --> 27:46.200]  the question that was asked of me he's trying to present as if I was launching
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.880]  a defense of Hitler in Germany when in fact the question that was asked of me
[27:49.880 --> 27:53.680]  was pertaining to whether or not I believed that Hitler was a whether I
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.360]  or not I believed in nationalism and that nationalism was bad and when I
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.320]  responded to was that I do not believe that we should be characterizing Hitler
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.040]  as a nationalist he was a homicidal psychopathic maniac that killed his own
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.600]  people a nationalist would not kill their own people that is exactly what I
[28:10.600 --> 28:13.360]  was referring to in the clip and he purposely wanted to give you a cut up
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.400]  similar to what they do to Donald Trump to create a different narrative that was
[28:17.400 --> 28:20.960]  unbelievably dishonest and he did not allow me to respond to it which is
[28:20.960 --> 28:23.880]  worrisome and to tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.800]  trying to drum up narratives by the way I would like to also add that I work for
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.000]  Prager University which is run by an Orthodox Jew and a single Democrat
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.640]  showed up to the embassy opening in Jerusalem I sat on a plane for 18 hours
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.480]  to make sure that I was there I'm deeply offended by the insinuation of
[28:38.480 --> 28:43.240]  revealing that clip without the question that was asked of me
[28:43.240 --> 28:49.920]  thanks Mrs. Owens and I yield the remainder of my time

[32:58.640 --> 33:23.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.560]  welcome back I'm alex jones on the road via the good old-fashioned telephone and we've
[33:28.560 --> 33:32.640]  got Owen shroyer there into the high tech studios blasts him a truth out on
[33:32.640 --> 33:38.160]  AM and FM global shortwave satellite the internet so much more at news wars.com
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.560]  and info wars.com okay so I got caught off by the break I was getting into the
[33:43.560 --> 33:49.960]  fact that coming up Owen's going to interview info wars army members down
[33:49.960 --> 33:56.080]  in Houston who simply went out with signs saying make America great again it's
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.800]  okay to be white things like that the spur of debate and a woman comes over
[33:59.800 --> 34:04.040]  says no it's not okay to be white and again this is this new democrat thing
[34:04.040 --> 34:07.960]  where they're saying whites are inherently evil I mean this is their main
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.560]  line statements in between bullying the unborn or now trying to kill babies
[34:12.560 --> 34:18.000]  after they're born with Chuckie Schumer which is defending yesterday that's up
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.480]  on info wars.com they're out running around saying whites are inherently evil
[34:21.480 --> 34:27.000]  and of course it's not a black person or Hispanic person coming over and saying
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.760]  how dare you say it's okay to be white it's almost always a weird crazy white
[34:31.760 --> 34:37.480]  person and it's a woman crying but she's so threatened by the evil and by the
[34:37.480 --> 34:42.480]  downtroddenness and how you know stupid minorities are supposedly that's why in
[34:42.480 --> 34:46.440]  all the studies the left dumps down their speech to minorities it's this
[34:46.440 --> 34:50.680]  condescension that she's this white knight she's this savior that's what's
[34:50.680 --> 34:55.000]  what next segment and she comes over and starts crying and it's
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.200]  incredible those folks are gonna be able to show so it's the same thing with
[34:59.200 --> 35:02.960]  the end of someone's you see this this white lady guarantees when
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.560]  indoctrinated in college the authors of the civvy training she's been taught
[35:06.560 --> 35:11.360]  that she's bad and so she's got to go out in a tone and make civilization and
[35:11.360 --> 35:15.040]  white people and the Renaissance be a thing of the past she's got to get rid
[35:15.040 --> 35:19.120]  of toilets she's got to get rid of I mean seriously of civilization because it's
[35:19.120 --> 35:23.200]  a bad oppressive thing over the quote minorities and so she's there crying
[35:23.200 --> 35:27.440]  we see Candace Owens didn't buy into that she knew when they were trying to
[35:27.440 --> 35:32.280]  set her up she figured it out and you know her grandfather grew up as a
[35:32.280 --> 35:37.160]  sharecropper that's that's that's that's basically a plantation okay and then
[35:37.160 --> 35:41.480]  she grew up there in her grandfather's house and that's where she got the
[35:41.480 --> 35:47.280]  values you see and if you go back 60 years ago blacks had a lower level of
[35:47.280 --> 35:54.640]  illegitimacy that means lower level of single parent homes than whites now it's
[35:54.640 --> 36:00.840]  almost 80% now think about that they totally destroyed the black family and
[36:00.840 --> 36:04.560]  they'll say well don't bash single mothers nobody's bashing them nobody's
[36:04.560 --> 36:07.360]  bashing you a mother if she had her husband taken and put the meat grinder
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.800]  the point is is they do this so that the boys and girls are alone so things
[36:11.800 --> 36:15.720]  spiral out of control and so they can manage and take control of society and
[36:15.720 --> 36:20.120]  Candace Owens beautifully lays all this out here in a moment in her opening
[36:20.120 --> 36:25.120]  statement and so it's very good that she ended up canceling her podcasts with me
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.400]  it was supposed to happen here stay obviously she'll testify so that's an
[36:30.400 --> 36:37.080]  amazing thing and again guaranteed there are lots of black women just as
[36:37.080 --> 36:40.640]  smart just as charismatic just as good-looking she's got all three of
[36:40.640 --> 36:43.800]  things you need to get like to the office and she's got that fourth thing
[36:43.800 --> 36:50.760]  integrity and discernment and that's the type of person that we need to see run
[36:50.760 --> 36:54.640]  for Congress and win I don't care if they're white or black or older young or
[36:54.640 --> 36:58.640]  Hispanic or a they have the fire of liberty in their eyes they understand
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.320]  the truth they want to empower humanity and imagine having a bunch of Candace
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.080]  Owens elected instead of Maxine Waters imagine having someone like Candace
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.640]  Owens as the chairman of that committee instead of Maxine Waters we have another
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.320]  clip coming up I've heard with the Treasury Secretary literally treating him
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.440]  like a piece of crap playing games because these people are out of control
[37:18.440 --> 37:21.640]  Hillary was supposed to get elected they were supposed to shut down our free
[37:21.640 --> 37:24.920]  speech they were supposed to be in total power that total control they didn't
[37:24.920 --> 37:28.920]  get it so right in the middle of their total takeover they failed so I want to
[37:28.920 --> 37:33.040]  go to this but please listeners understand without your support we will
[37:33.040 --> 37:36.480]  not be here we are under massive sustained continued attack plus we have

[38:58.800 --> 39:03.080]  Candace Owens got her main launch pad here we are so proud of her and so proud
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.200]  of what she's done now she picked herself up by our bootstraps but info wars
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.160]  was the platform that helped produce the boots so ladies and gentlemen here is
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.720]  Candace Owens blowing them out of the water with the truth and then back to
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.560]  Owen Schreuer in the ATX. I received word on my way in that many of the
[39:19.560 --> 39:24.400]  journalists were confused as to why I was invited and none of them knew that I
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.600]  myself was the victim of a hate crime when I was in high school that's something
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.440]  that very few people know about me because the media and the journalists and
[39:32.440 --> 39:35.560]  the left not interested in telling the truth about me is I don't fit the
[39:35.560 --> 39:40.360]  stereotype of what they like to see in black people. I'm a Democrat I support
[39:40.360 --> 39:43.600]  the president of the United States and I advocate for things that are actually
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.240]  affecting the black community. I'm honored to be here today in front of you
[39:47.240 --> 39:51.520]  all because the person sitting behind me is my 75 year old grandfather I've
[39:51.520 --> 39:54.240]  always considered myself to be my grandfather's child and I mean to say
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.320]  that my sense of humor my passion and my work ethic all comes from the man that
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.760]  is sitting behind me. My grandfather grew up on a sharecropping farm in the
[40:01.760 --> 40:06.320]  Syrogate itself. He grew up in an America where words like racism and white
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.240]  nationalism held real meaning under the Democrat Party's Jim Crow laws. My
[40:11.240 --> 40:14.200]  grandfather's first job was given to him at the age of five years old and his
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.840]  job was to lay tobacco out to dry in an attic in the south. My grandfather has
[40:19.840 --> 40:24.480]  picked cotton and he has also had experiences with a Democrat terrorist
[40:24.480 --> 40:29.160]  organization of that time the Ku Klux Klan. They would regularly visit his home
[40:29.160 --> 40:32.400]  and they would shoot bullets into it. They had an issue with his father my
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.800]  great-grandfather. During my four many years I had the privilege of growing up
[40:36.800 --> 40:41.080]  in my grandfather's home. It's going to shock the committee but not once not in a
[40:41.080 --> 40:44.320]  single breath of a conversation did my grandfather tell me that I could not do
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.240]  something because of my skin color. Not once did my grandfather hold a gripe
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.840]  against the white man. I was simply never taught to view myself as a victim
[40:52.840 --> 40:58.640]  because of my heritage. I learned about faith in God, family, and hard work. Those
[40:58.640 --> 41:03.920]  were the only lessons of my childhood. There isn't a single adult today that in
[41:03.920 --> 41:07.760]  good conscience would make the argument that America is a more racist or a more
[41:07.760 --> 41:11.920]  white nationalist society than it was when my grandfather was growing up and
[41:11.920 --> 41:15.720]  yet we're hearing these terms sent around today because what they want to
[41:15.720 --> 41:19.560]  say is that brown people need to be scared which seems to be the narrative
[41:19.560 --> 41:25.080]  that we hear every four years right ahead of a presidential election. Here are
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.640]  some things we never hear. 75% of the black boys in California don't meet
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.920]  state reading standards. In inner cities like Baltimore within five high schools
[41:33.920 --> 41:36.880]  and one middle school not a single student was found to be proficient in math
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.840]  or reading in 2016. The single mother would the single motherhood rate in the
[41:41.840 --> 41:46.000]  black community which is at 23% in the 1960s when my grandfather was coming up
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.640]  as at a staggering 74% today. I am guessing there will be no committee
[41:50.640 --> 41:55.000]  hearings about that. There are more black babies born, there are more black
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.240]  babies aborted than born alive in cities like New York and you have
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.920]  Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo lighting up buildings to celebrate late term
[42:02.920 --> 42:07.680]  abortions. I can go on and on. My point is that white nationalists, white
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.280]  nationalists not do any of those things that I just brought up. Democrat policies
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.560]  did. Let me be clear. The hearing today is not about white nationalism or hate
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.240]  crimes, it's about fear mongering power and control. It's a preview of a
[42:21.240 --> 42:26.400]  Democrat 2020 election strategy same as the Democrat 2016 election strategy.
[42:26.400 --> 42:30.720]  They blame Facebook, they blame Google, they blame Twitter, really they blame the
[42:30.720 --> 42:35.080]  birth of social media which has disrupted their monopoly on minds. They
[42:35.080 --> 42:37.960]  called this hearing because they believe that if it wasn't for social media
[42:37.960 --> 42:43.160]  voices like mine would never exist, that my movement Blexit which is inspiring
[42:43.160 --> 42:46.960]  black Americans to lead, to leave the Democrat Party would have never come
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.120]  about and they certainly believe that Donald Trump would not be in office
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.480]  today. Looking on the next thing to focus on now that the Russian collusion
[42:54.480 --> 42:58.640]  hoax has fallen apart. Amazing. Canisone family been fighting racist Democrats
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.960]  for decades. Wars are like twelve round heavyweight boxing championship
[43:03.960 --> 43:09.160]  fights. It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's
[43:09.160 --> 43:13.800]  ready to do the damage. We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.080]  nationalist in. Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We
[43:18.080 --> 43:22.560]  are winning. But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the
[43:22.560 --> 43:27.720]  spear are under unprecedented attack. So I come to you each day and try to
[43:27.720 --> 43:31.240]  explain to you that this is a war of attrition. This is about who wants it
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.680]  most and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken

[45:01.920 --> 45:06.280]  long. Go ahead. Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I
[45:06.280 --> 45:10.960]  turn on your broadcast, you're bragging. It just gets old, man. I'm gonna shut
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.480]  you down right now, okay? We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you
[45:15.480 --> 45:19.880]  understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down? Do you
[45:19.880 --> 45:24.240]  understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.160]  freaked out. I mean, what's it gonna take us being shut down? Is that what you
[45:28.160 --> 45:33.000]  want, Frank? You know what? I'll put it on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.400]  it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need
[45:37.400 --> 45:41.800]  your help. As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the
[45:41.800 --> 45:44.960]  face of this. I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us
[45:44.960 --> 45:50.040]  backwards. You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank. Go
[45:50.040 --> 45:56.360]  to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War. Do you understand I
[45:56.360 --> 46:01.320]  need your help, Frank? Free Press needs your help, Frank. There are thousands of
[46:01.320 --> 46:05.440]  ideologies out there. Hundreds of different political systems and most
[46:05.440 --> 46:10.280]  of them are funded by the globalist. Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of
[46:10.280 --> 46:13.720]  the zeitgeist. That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it
[46:13.720 --> 46:18.360]  down. I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana
[46:18.360 --> 46:22.560]  and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back. And
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.280]  lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been. That's why the globalists
[46:27.280 --> 46:31.640]  are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.160]  dark of the night that sends chills up my spine. So whatever you do, continue to
[46:36.160 --> 46:39.960]  support yourself and Info Wars by buying the great products at infowarstore.com,
[46:39.960 --> 46:43.600]  by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this
[46:43.600 --> 46:47.160]  operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.240]  discernment. For myself and the whole Info Wars family, I want to thank all of
[46:51.240 --> 46:56.400]  you for what you've done, because without you, Info Wars is nothing. You are the
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.280]  Info War and I salute you.
[47:02.480 --> 47:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:08.000 --> 47:22.480]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this
[47:22.480 --> 47:30.680]  transmission, you are the resistance. And now your host, Owen Schreuer.
[47:30.680 --> 47:38.880]  You know, I'm not really sure what the solution to this cultural paradox that
[47:38.880 --> 47:44.720]  we're witnessing is, where there's literally events happening right now
[47:44.720 --> 47:49.320]  where a bunch of leftist liberals are gathered in an auditorium talking about
[47:49.320 --> 47:53.840]  how white supremacy is destroying everything. And it's all a bunch of white
[47:53.840 --> 48:02.560]  people doing it. And then you see someone like Candace Owens, who recounts her
[48:02.560 --> 48:08.440]  grandfather's story in her opening statements yesterday, and you realize,
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.040]  wow, here's a woman whose family has actually been fighting Democrat racism
[48:14.040 --> 48:21.320]  for decades generationally. And then I have to sit here and look at Fox and
[48:21.320 --> 48:31.600]  Soyboys and nitwits and pinheads and pencilnecks and needle, you know what's.
[48:32.880 --> 48:40.560]  Looking for a new corner to peer around and find racism. You people are
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.640]  pathetic. And I just wish that they could understand that they are the scourge on
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.800]  this country, they are the racists. And I just don't know if they were ever meant
[48:52.800 --> 48:55.600]  to understand that, if they have the capacity to understand that, or if it's
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.240]  just literally in God's grand design for them to never understand that. That's
[48:59.240 --> 49:03.840]  just their role, their NPCs, that's their role. God put them on this earth as a
[49:03.840 --> 49:10.960]  test for the righteous, as a test of our patience. And so I can't tell whether we
[49:10.960 --> 49:14.320]  respond to it, we highlight it, or if it's just time to start ignoring it and
[49:14.320 --> 49:17.520]  having our own victories, like the one Candace Owens had in her opening
[49:17.520 --> 49:21.120]  statement. Here is the rest of that.
[49:23.520 --> 49:26.840]  What they won't tell you about this, the statistics and the rise of white
[49:26.840 --> 49:30.480]  nationalism is that they've simply changed the data set points by widening
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.280]  the definition of hate crimes and upping the number of reporting agencies
[49:34.280 --> 49:38.280]  that are able to report on them. What I mean to say is that they're manipulating
[49:38.280 --> 49:43.520]  statistics. The goal here is to scare blacks, Hispanics, gays and Muslims into
[49:43.520 --> 49:48.200]  helping them censor dissenting opinions, ultimately into helping
[49:48.200 --> 49:51.680]  them regain control of our country's narrative, which they feel that they
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.960]  lost. They feel that President Donald Trump should not have beat Hillary. If
[49:56.960 --> 49:59.520]  they actually were concerned about white nationalism, they would be holding
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.200]  hearings on Antifa, a far left violent white gang who determined one day in
[50:04.200 --> 50:08.440]  Philadelphia in August that I, a black woman, was not fit to sit in a restaurant.
[50:08.440 --> 50:12.760]  They chased me out, they yelled race traitor to a group of black and
[50:12.760 --> 50:16.240]  Hispanic police officers who formed a line to protect me from their ongoing
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.560]  assaults. They threw water at me, they threw eggs at me, and the leftist media
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.440]  remained silent on it. They were serious about the rise of hate crimes. They may
[50:25.440 --> 50:29.520]  perhaps be examining themselves and the hate that they have drummed up in this
[50:29.520 --> 50:36.080]  country. Bottom line is that white supremacy, racism, white nationalism,
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.680]  words that once held real meaning have now become nothing more than election
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.640]  strategies. Every four years, the black community has offered handouts in fear,
[50:43.640 --> 50:49.600]  handouts and fear. Reparations and white nationalism, this is the Democrat
[50:49.600 --> 50:54.320]  preview. Of course, society is not perfect, but we've heard testimony of that
[50:54.320 --> 50:57.560]  today. There are pockets of evil that exist and those things are horrible and
[50:57.560 --> 51:01.640]  they should be condemned. But I believe the legacy and the ancestry of black
[51:01.640 --> 51:06.880]  Americans is being insulted every single day. I will not pretend to be a victim in
[51:06.880 --> 51:10.600]  this country. I know that that makes many people on the left uncomfortable. I want
[51:10.600 --> 51:13.840]  to talk about real issues in black America. I want to talk about real
[51:13.840 --> 51:18.600]  issues in this country and real concerns. The biggest scandal, this is my last
[51:18.600 --> 51:21.840]  sentence, in American politics is that Democrats have been conning minorities
[51:21.840 --> 51:25.960]  into belief that we are perpetual victims, all but ensuring our failure.
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.600]  Racial division and class warfare are central to the Democrat Party platform.
[51:30.600 --> 51:34.760]  They need blacks to hate whites, the rich to hate the poor. Soon enough, it'll be the
[51:34.760 --> 51:41.160]  tall hating the shorts. The time of the witness has expired. Now, another amazing
[51:41.160 --> 51:47.840]  moment in the Candace Owens testimony yesterday is when Jerry Nadler, who's
[51:47.840 --> 51:52.880]  gabbling the committee, is actually shouting her down and she's like,
[51:52.880 --> 51:58.000]  wait a second, I was invited to speak here. How are you gonna gavel me? But
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.280]  that's Jerry Nadler, one of the biggest frauds, one of the biggest liars, one of
[52:01.280 --> 52:09.600]  the biggest conmans in Congress. And you know, look, I'm gonna come back from this
[52:09.600 --> 52:14.640]  break and I'm gonna get to all the news and then I got great guests coming up, but
[52:18.640 --> 52:22.680]  I have to tell you the intellectual formula that's constantly revolving in
[52:22.680 --> 52:32.080]  my head. Because I just want to have victory. And so knowing the formula,
[52:32.080 --> 52:37.960]  knowing the mathematic equation to get victory is key. So that's why I try to
[52:37.960 --> 52:44.760]  figure this out. But it's like, should I be more focused on exposing the left and
[52:44.760 --> 52:49.560]  combating the left and countering the left for all its racism, all its lies,
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.560]  all its deception, all its fraud, just everything. You know, I go out and face
[52:54.560 --> 52:59.960]  these scum. Is that what I need to do? Do I need to really focus on hammering
[52:59.960 --> 53:05.640]  back against these people, countering them? Or do we focus on just having
[53:05.640 --> 53:11.040]  victory and just promoting our own stuff, promoting our own news, promoting our
[53:11.040 --> 53:17.720]  own content, doing our own thing in kind of our own proprietary way instead of a
[53:17.720 --> 53:24.120]  reactionary way to everything that the left does. And I can't tell whether I'm
[53:24.120 --> 53:33.640]  being gaslit intentionally and I need to realize that and put the fire out. Or if
[53:33.640 --> 53:43.040]  that's an actual programmed response tuned in innately by God to put me into
[53:43.040 --> 53:49.360]  action. And I don't even know if this is making any sense, but it's like, should I
[53:49.360 --> 53:52.880]  be, should I really be focusing on these groups out here that are actually
[53:52.880 --> 53:57.480]  promoting racism and division in this country like Media Matters and Right
[53:57.480 --> 54:03.000]  Wing Watch who have all of these meetings and these auditoriums where they
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.120]  talk about how bad white people are. And they're all white, by the way. And so
[54:09.120 --> 54:15.480]  it's just like, it's just so frustrating. You know what, in fact, I'll just go ahead
[54:15.480 --> 54:18.240]  and put it all out in the air. And I don't want to, I don't like doing this
[54:18.240 --> 54:22.160]  sometimes because I feel it actually inflates these people and I feel bad
[54:22.160 --> 54:27.400]  about it. And like this woman that showed up at this Info Wars Army event in
[54:27.400 --> 54:33.840]  Houston, but like, let me just explain. Because unless I just kind of give you an
[54:33.840 --> 54:37.320]  example of where my head's at, I don't know if you can understand. So Jared Holt
[54:37.320 --> 54:43.760]  is a left-wing, you know, liberal, progressive, low IQ writer for Right
[54:43.760 --> 54:48.480]  Wing Watch. He writes stories about me. He's probably tuned in right now. And I'm
[54:48.480 --> 54:51.080]  probably inflating his ego right now. Actually, no, that's right. He's at some
[54:51.080 --> 54:57.120]  consortium, some anti-white consortium right now. And look, because I genuinely
[54:57.120 --> 55:01.640]  try to be friends with everybody. I genuinely, I like being friends with
[55:01.640 --> 55:06.760]  people, even if we disagree politically. I have reached out, I have befriended
[55:06.760 --> 55:13.680]  Jared Holt. I've been totally nice to him. But the guy, I mean, it's just like, I
[55:13.680 --> 55:17.400]  can't tell if I should just leave him alone or if I should actually try to
[55:17.400 --> 55:22.440]  save his soul. But if you go down, he's at some meeting right now where they're
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.680]  just bashing white people. Dude, you're white. You're whiter than I am. You look
[55:26.680 --> 55:32.760]  literally like you look like a Nazi. I mean, you blonde hair, blue-eyed. But it's
[55:32.760 --> 55:37.320]  like, I don't care about your skin color or what you look like. Your politics
[55:37.320 --> 55:43.800]  are insane. But look at this picture they put up. I mean, whatever. The guys had
[55:43.800 --> 55:48.080]  six soilates a day since he was five. It's none of my business. He puts out a
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.800]  picture, this comic that they put out, that the left is celebrating. And they're
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.440]  saying, oh, you know, conservatives make a big deal out of liberals getting
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.880]  triggered over a clown mask. And so they put out this comic. Guys pull up the
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.200]  image from his, he shared it. It's a comic. It's the one after the Paul
[56:04.200 --> 56:09.360]  Joseph Watson picture. And they think it makes sense because they have this
[56:09.360 --> 56:12.960]  conservative dressed up in a clown outfit and they act like, oh my gosh, that's
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.880]  what conservatives are doing. But that's literally what they did. Like, literally,
[56:17.880 --> 56:21.520]  it was the leftist. I played the video here on the air that dressed up in a
[56:21.520 --> 56:28.600]  clown outfit and actually was literally triggered over it. I haven't seen a
[56:28.600 --> 56:33.520]  conservative actually dress up like a clown and be that upset. If they dress
[56:33.520 --> 56:39.280]  up like a clown or like I dress up like a cow, it's just for a funny video. So
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.320]  they're the, they, but that's what I'm saying. Like, what can I do? How can I,
[56:44.320 --> 56:49.000]  how can I, how can I save them from themselves? These people are so degenerate,
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.640]  degenerative intellectually and mentally and psychologically right now. I mean, I
[56:54.640 --> 56:58.560]  genuinely want to help them. I genuinely want Jared Holt to see how he's totally
[56:58.560 --> 57:07.280]  brainwashed. But then I plug into the formula and I say, but what is the formula
[57:07.280 --> 57:12.280]  for victory? Do I eviscerate Jared Holt? Do I eviscerate these people for who they
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.600]  are? Do we go on the attack? Do we go on the counter or do we just kind of say,
[57:16.600 --> 57:22.160]  okay, you know, you're, you're a little mentally ill and it's okay. Here's
[57:22.160 --> 57:25.560]  not a branch. Let's at least be friends. Quit, quit telling people to hate me.
[57:25.560 --> 57:29.440]  Quit telling people I'm a racist. Quit telling people I'm a white supremacist.
[57:29.440 --> 57:33.120]  You know, write your political stuff, but, but let's, let's, let's be fair in this.
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.200]  No, they just keep going down that road. And it doesn't even matter the history
[57:37.200 --> 57:41.400]  that the Democrats were running the KKK. No, no, no, it doesn't even matter the
[57:41.400 --> 57:44.320]  Democrats are the ones that are racist. They say the most racist things to
[57:44.320 --> 57:47.920]  black people, brown people, white people. That you are the racist, Jared Holt.
[57:47.920 --> 57:50.680]  That's what you need to realize. It's simple. If you want to beat the
[57:50.680 --> 57:54.120]  globalist, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin
[57:54.120 --> 57:58.200]  pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey. I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[57:58.200 --> 58:01.440]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all the
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.560]  great it is. I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill? What is the top
[58:05.560 --> 58:09.520]  tumor? It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory. And what's the best lab
[58:09.520 --> 58:12.440]  in the country? Okay, they're the highest rated. I'm like, you're only 50%
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.160]  curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.960]  incredible, sir. And I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later? 90, 95%
[58:20.960 --> 58:24.800]  No one's ever done that. I said, how much does that cost for a bottle? That costs $10?
[58:24.800 --> 58:29.000]  No one's ever done that, sir. The average competitors, 3% to 5%, the top
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.240]  brand's 50%. I'm like, we're gonna have 95% curcuminoid. I mean, you understand
[58:33.240 --> 58:36.680]  like, that's like our information's explosive? Our fish oil. I go out and I
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.200]  get the cleanest, the best. My children take it. You think I'm gonna give you
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.200]  fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul? You think I'm gonna screw
[58:45.200 --> 58:47.640]  somebody over like one of these devil worshipers? Never.
[58:47.640 --> 58:54.080]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[58:54.080 --> 58:58.000]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to

[59:51.880 --> 59:57.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.320 --> 01:00:17.240]  Well, the violent radical racist left has put a chilling effect on free speech
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.560]  and the bullies in the Democrat Party have bullied conservatives out of
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.320]  wearing Trump hats. Caitlin Bennett went out and investigated to find out why
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.360]  people are afraid of wearing a Trump hat. I've heard people like say that
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:54.240]  they're gonna rip it off my head. Like, it's ridiculous.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.200]  Does that make you feel unsafe wearing that hat in public? Oh yeah, I've heard
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.160]  people like say that they're gonna rip it off my head. Like, it's ridiculous.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.760]  People don't want to hurt people. The signs that people are holding over there are like
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.720]  not even like close to what's like going on right now. It's ridiculous. It's stuff
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.240]  that he's said when he wasn't even president and stuff that everyone is
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.040]  like done in their child. It's stuff that makes no sense. And I thought maybe they
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.920]  you know get some sense after you know everything came out with a Russian
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.080]  collusion where there's nothing but you know. Do you ever wear your red hat in
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.600]  public? I got it tonight. So heck yeah, I'm gonna wear it in public. Are you a
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.160]  little scared with all the things that happened? I'm a little scared because I
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.360]  know that people would not say some of the things that they said to me tonight
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.040]  or treat me the way that some people have treated me if I didn't have the hat
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:53.560]  on. So tolerance people, tolerance. Thank you so much. That's just what you preach. Do you ladies feel uneasy when you're wearing your red hats in
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.880]  public? Of course. Today's the only day I would wear it out downtown here.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.880]  Otherwise I feel like we would be a spit-on attack you know yell that. But
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.680]  today is safety in numbers. Oh yeah, if I put anything on my my yard signs or
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.000]  anything I would have bricks thrown through my windows. There's no doubt.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.840]  Yeah, we're like we have to be closet-case people. So it is really the
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:23.560]  silent majority. The silent majority because they're so bad. Isn't it funny
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.240]  they say that Trump supporters are the violent ones but yet you ladies feel
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:32.840]  safest around a group of Trump supporters? Absolutely. Oh yeah, that's why I won't
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.160]  walk back to my parking garage with this on unless I have somebody with me and
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.280]  police nearby because we would definitely get a costume. There's no doubt. Do you
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.560]  feel unsafe when you go out in public with your mega hat? Yes I do. Yes I do. You
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.880]  shouldn't have to feel like that. Hi Instagram. Do you guys feel uncomfortable
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:56.640]  when you go out in your Trump hats? No. I feel a little odd-edged. I wouldn't say
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:02.600]  uncomfortable. I feel like I own one so I haven't attempted it yet. Alright, well let
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:07.240]  me know how it goes. You wear mega hats? I do not. Okay, so you wear
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.960]  mega hats. Do you ever feel uneasy in public when you have it on? Absolutely I
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.920]  do yes. It's very hostile political environment we have here. What's that to
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:23.280]  say to the side that says they're tolerant and anti-violence and loving? I
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.840]  would say it's very hypocritical from that side to say to make those claims
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.360]  and then behave the way they do. I'm a libertarian that's what I identify as
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.640]  but still you know I think the principles remain the same it should be
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.360]  the same standard for everybody so. Especially to profile someone based on
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.760]  what they're wearing or their appearance and assume their ideology or their
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.840]  political beliefs and then act aggressively or hostile towards them. It's
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.000]  a little intolerant. I think that's that's kind of the slippery slope is
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.280]  going on. I don't think it's fair to like your average citizen. I don't think
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.120]  anybody should be like ostracized by their political beliefs. I think
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.560]  everybody should be able to feel safe. Does that make you scared to go in public?
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.120]  Does that make you kind of just look over your shoulder a little bit? Honestly
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.800]  no because from the turnout today thousands of people are here and even
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.960]  more are not able to make it in and I know we have such a strong community
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.080]  that is willing to support and even with this whole incident that's coming up I
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.440]  think that people are supporting people are standing up and feeling more
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.320]  freedom in both. So the full Caitlyn Bennett report can be found at infowars.com
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:35.040]  she was out at the Trump rally in Grand Rapids talking to people but you know
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:43.200]  again it's like just you wear a trumpet out a radical leftist could come out and
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.200]  you know bonky over the head or poor drink on you but you notice how leftists
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.760]  have no fear wearing a Bernie hat out or a Beto shirt or putting bumper stickers
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.920]  all over their cars and bikes and everything no fear from them they're
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.960]  the bullies they're the they're the intolerant ones. I want to say brain
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.120]  force is great I want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:09.480]  fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.960]  that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.280]  body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.520]  got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.520]  fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.560]  but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry you
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.960]  want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.240]  it's so good it in my view I'm not a medical statement here but let me tell
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.040]  you something I eat five campelots of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:48.400]  Santa Claus that night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.680]  so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice I just obsessed because
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:06:07.240]  whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:14.200]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:21.800]  and now your host Owen Troyer you know this is my this is why it's so
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:31.640]  frustrating because I'm telling you they even trick me man I'm even tricked by
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:38.480]  the propaganda not to believe my own my own eyes sometimes but it's like leftists
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.240]  can go out wear all their gear put on all their bumper stickers do all their
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:49.240]  crap hats Bernie hats not a care in the world Beto t-shirts not a care in the
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.320]  world Bernie stickers and Hillary stickers and Beto stickers and all the
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.960]  stickers they put on their car no worries about their cars getting their
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.120]  tires slash or windows smashed in or anything like that but if you're a
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:06.520]  Trump supporter you put on a Trump hat there's there's a likelihood that you're
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.280]  going to get accosted harassed or assaulted you put a Trump sticker on
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.200]  your car there's a chance your car is going to get this tire slash or windows
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.480]  bashed in and so you know and this is where again it comes to the formula I
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.040]  was talking about so if the left can't even realize if these people can't even
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.640]  realize how they are the racists how they are the intolerant ones how they are
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.720]  the violent ones I mean everything they're the bigots they're hateful they're
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.240]  miserable they add to climate change probably somehow just because everything
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.880]  else they accuse us doing they're guilty of so they're probably the ones causing
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.440]  climate change one shape way or another I don't know how but just the formula so
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:54.800]  so that's the thing it's like because I want to bring people together I want to
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.200]  be able to make America great again and that's going to take all of us but it's
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:06.880]  like if you just deny the sky is blue if you deny the sun rises in the east and
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:15.320]  sets in the west if you deny that water is wet I mean what what can I do and so
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:20.480]  then when you reach that level of philosophical acceptance that these
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:26.760]  people cannot live in or accept reality now you have to change your approach
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:32.680]  entirely I mean how do you deal with somebody like this because there's two
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.920]  different things happening right now there's the one instance where we deal
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.040]  with these people likely would treat a five-year-old or likely would treat a
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.080]  mentally handicapped person which is you know we understand you have a mental
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.560]  handicap and so we're patient and we're tolerant and we're loving and we're
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.840]  peaceful and and and we're accepting we understand you have a mental disorder
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.360]  you're mentally handicapped and and and so we want to you know we're patient
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.360]  we're tolerant we love you and so that's kind of how we treat these people right
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:09.160]  now but we're trying to give them the opportunity to see the light we're
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.960]  trying to give them the opportunity for a breath of fresh fresh air we're trying
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.240]  to give them the opportunity to just be real to just just live in reality just
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.280]  accept facts for what they are like the left is violent not conservatives but
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:29.880]  if they're not going to do that then what do I do what do I do intellectually
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.840]  and philosophically to move on to victory what what do we do do we continue
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.160]  to treat these people like mentally impaired people like people that
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:47.200]  genuinely have mental disorders like Down syndrome and other such things where
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.240]  we're very loving we're patient we're tolerant we understand a situation that's
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.360]  how we're treating them right now or do we do we finally take a step back and
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:03.000]  realize that these people are an imminent threat to this country to
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.800]  themselves to everything and I I'm just kind of reaching that crossroads right
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.440]  now and I'm just like and really I just need to forget it and just move on and
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.240]  cover this news but when I get these blockades in my head it's just like
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.400]  because I know I'm not the only one that feels this frustration and I know that
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:31.800]  people tune in to the Alex Jones show as a as a hub as a conduit to kind of get
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  on the same frequency and then and then move through space and time together
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.240]  towards the ultimate goals but I mean we got to figure out what to do with these
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.840]  people then because it's only about to get worse for 2020 all right so just let
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.440]  me here's what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna try to just put this in the back
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.080]  of my mind and move on to some news here but folks we've got huge specials

[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:31.520]  what I'm saying too like how can you not see I can't I can't get over this
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.720]  blockade today I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get over this because it comes
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.840]  back to every every issue there's the left keeping the problem from being
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:50.520]  solved every freaking time see oh for example they sit here and they cry
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.320]  family separation at the border children in cages and then out on the other
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.320]  side of their mouth there's no emergency at the border really because you were
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.880]  just crying about kids in cages you were just crying about family separation but
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.720]  now there's no problem at the border huh okay so I guess there's no kids in
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.240]  cages there's no family separate well yes there is then there absolutely is and
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.720]  it's all Trump's fault okay so there's a national emergency there's a crisis of
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.920]  the board no there's not that's manufactured by Trump like literally
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.720]  Trump doesn't even have to do anything or say anything and they could have an
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.980]  argument with themselves over Trump that's it perfectly that's it kids in
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.280]  cages family separation at the border oh so there's a national emergency the
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.440]  border there's no national emergency at the border Trump Trump manufactured
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.640]  that really you just told me there were kids in cages and family separate yeah
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.440]  Trump put kids in cages and separated families Trump did that okay so there's
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.060]  a national emergency no there's not it's manufactured by Trump this is the
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:51.240]  leftist logic it's just perennially circular and you can never solve any
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:59.080]  issues so what happens over a hundred thousand illegal crossings in March
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.760]  that's records from decades ago we're setting that records now you've got
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.160]  caravans forming in Honduras they're coming up this way
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:12.200]  Univision anchor says border agents dodging rocks is cheaper than a wall
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.720]  oh that's nice so so just have our border agents just get you know rocks thrown
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.840]  at them and treated like garbage that's cheaper than a wall but you know what
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.920]  else you know what a wall is cheaper than the hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.760]  illegal immigration costs this country a wall is cheaper than that which is
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.840]  actually when it's all said not billions and billions of dollars but see
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:38.960]  this is what happens they open up the border disease breaks out and then they
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.320]  can bring in their medical tyranny they open up the border with the welfare
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.400]  state suck our economic system dry collapse the economic system then they
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.200]  can have economic tyranny so you see what the open border is doing it's giving
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.400]  the left medical tyranny and it's giving the left economic tyranny
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.720]  get the stinky dog away from me bad breath and bad gas PD stopped eating all

[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.400]  hi I promise I'm going to try to get over this blockade I have right now but
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:31.360]  here's the analogy I know where we go I know all the victory we could have I
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:38.200]  know all the glory written into our destiny but these people are in the way
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:45.640]  and and look we're dealing with it we're being patient but like if you don't get
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.680]  out of the way you're gonna get run over now you're trying to run over us but
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.440]  you don't have near the power you think you do you've got a bunch of stolen
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:21:00.280]  bureaucratic power outside of that not much your Hollywood influence is losing
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:04.360]  your political influence is losing and your political talking points have no
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:13.200]  basis in reality so understand something it's like you're driving down the
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:21.160]  highway and somebody's going 50 miles an hour in the fast lane on a 75 mile
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:30.800]  per hour interstate and you just want them to get out of the way you know just
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:45.640]  get out of the way just get out of the way but I'll tell you I'm not a violent
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:52.160]  person I'm not calling for violence but when it comes to human psychology and
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:22:00.720]  when it comes to survival instincts if you don't get out of the fast lane soon
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:10.440]  we'll get you out and I don't want it to be like that I just want you to get out
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:16.440]  of the fast lane so that we can drive past you and into the future you can
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:21.280]  sit back and continue to go slow and develop slowly and not get to our
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:26.720]  destination until it's way too late fine that's your choice but get out of our
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:35.640]  way get out of our way we've got places to go okay you're in our way we want to
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:43.000]  be great we want to lift up humanity you're in our way and we're gonna be
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.040]  kind and we've been tolerant we've been tolerant of all the political corruption
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.160]  with the fake Russian collusion we've been tired of all the meat we've been
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.440]  patient with all the media corruption them lying about Donald Trump lying
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.480]  about Trump concern and conservatives saying the race is bigots we've been
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:02.040]  tolerant with all the violence that you guys have engaged in in the street we've
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:09.720]  been tolerant with all of it but I'm telling you get out of our way or we'll
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.760]  get you out of our way that's not a threat that's just how this works that's
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:27.400]  just how this breaks down okay just get out of our way it's all we ask get out
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.320]  of our way because we want to save this country from a collapsing border get out
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:36.320]  of our way because we want to save this country from socialism get out of our
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:41.240]  way because we want to save this country from mainstream media lies just get out
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:46.600]  of our way or we'll move you out of our way and I think that Trump is on that
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.440]  same level right now dealing with this bureaucratic mess that he has up there
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:57.120]  and all these traitors in Congress that he thought were his friends I think
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.560]  Trump's about to have this same realization you know I've been waiting
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:06.800]  for you to get out of the fast lane but you're not doing it so guess what I'm
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.640]  getting you out of the fast lane now and we're pushing the pedal to the metal
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:18.440]  and we're leaving you in the dust of history yeah thank you get out of the
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:23.160]  way yeah we're moving to the front of the pack we're ready we're leaders we're
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:29.400]  winners we're the elite we're moving to the front of the pack because we operate
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:42.440]  at light speed we operate at love speed you don't even operate so they want to
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.840]  bring medical tyranny and economic tyranny to America by collapsing the
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:54.360]  southern border and it is working it is working I hope we don't let them do it
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:59.360]  now let me just focus for the remainder here because I've had this blockade and
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.520]  I hope I've gotten everything out now and I can just pile into this news
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.560]  Bill de Blasio declares health emergency orders measles vaccinations in
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.240]  Williamsburg so now they're issuing curfews if you're not vaccinated they're
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.320]  telling you can't go in public if you're not vaccinated they're finding you if
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.920]  you're not vaccinated and now they're saying it's an emergency if you don't
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.280]  have a vaccination I mean this is medical tyranny walking of course there's no
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:27.360]  logic again a five-year-old would would be able to understand this common sense
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.720]  and logic if you've been vaccinated to protect yourself against this disease
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:37.360]  you wouldn't care if I had it but you see it's not about that it's about control
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.800]  it's about control that's what it's really about city mandates vaccinations
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.880]  for children or and adults or face $1,000 fine who told you that was coming
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.360]  info wars tomorrow's news today New York City Health Department puts yeshiva
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.160]  schools in Williamsburg on notice allow unvaccinated students in at own
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.880]  peril I think they're running a a a medical test right now I think the
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.680]  people of New York are guinea pigs like black people were guinea pigs in St.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.680]  Louis when they sprayed them with radio radioactive chemicals like black people
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.760]  were guinea pigs when they tested them with a syphilis vaccine I think right
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.920]  now specifically this Jewish community is in New York is being used as guinea
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.120]  pigs but overall the state of New York to anti-vaxxer parents hold measles
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.160]  parties to deliberately give their kids the deadly virus to get immunity rather
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:35.200]  than take the MMR shot absolutely it's safer it's more effective and it doesn't
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.440]  have the negative side effect of potential guion beret syndrome Washington
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.560]  Post says teen in viral video can't show defamation nor anti-trump bias so yeah
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.080]  you know the mainstream media in the Washington Post just lies about the
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.720]  Covington Catholic children through their teeth they continue the lie they
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.600]  say they approached the Native American that was a lie I mean the list just goes
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.160]  on and on they say they got in his face that was a lie they said they were
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.280]  engaged in taunting him for having a Native American chant that was a lie I
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.100]  mean just all of it just lie lie lie lie and then they get caught in all their
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:13.080]  lies and they say well we're allowed to lie oh I'm sorry no they said you can't
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.600]  prove any defamation no what they're saying is we're allowed to lie go f
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.120]  yourself good to know where the Washington Post stands on integrity and
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.400]  journalism documents detailing Google's new blacklist show manual manipulation
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.760]  of special search results this is from the Daily Caller and again we told you
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.560]  this I would I would execute this live on air and show you how they're doing
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.640]  this years ago so just another example info wars is tomorrow's news today
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.480]  Google founders haven't shown up at its weekly town halls this entire calendar
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.040]  year and this is interesting Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.400]  have yet to make an appearance at any of the company's weekly TGIF town halls in
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:04.320]  2019 and it's something they used to do regularly they also canceled the AI I
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.280]  guess it wasn't really a summit but it was kind of an AI meeting group I forget
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.200]  what they called it an AI board or integrity board or something guys this
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.560]  is gonna bother me we find out what the name of that board is but basically it
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.480]  was a an AI board that made sure that at Google the AI didn't get out of control
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.240]  and they were you know you know monitoring any reasons to be worried
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:33.940]  about ethics or integrity or whatever well they just cancelled that so Google's
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:38.960]  just blatantly involved in censorship Google's working with China Google's
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.720]  spying on you they're not even doing the right things to keep the AI under
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:48.000]  control anymore the ethics board on the AI got shut down it was it was around for
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.360]  like two weeks they said oh ethics we can't have that we got to roll out the
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.600]  AI we can't do ethics Google and ethics don't belong together unless you say

[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:45.160]  some great members of the Info Wars Army we've got my friend Thomas who I
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:50.440]  guess went all the way to Houston to be a part of this normally is operating
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:57.840]  here in Austin and then Chris and Amanda with him as well so actually guys do we
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.200]  have a clip of that video where that that white girl came over and was throwing
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.000]  a fit over the it's okay to be white signed we have a clip of that let's go
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.600]  ahead and roll this clip real quick so this is the Info Wars Army Houston they
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:17.960]  went out and did an event at a bridge and a a radical leftist commie came up
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.280]  and I didn't like the it's okay to be white sign
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.760]  so there she is it's not okay to be white
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.520]  literally she says it's not okay to be white why she's why okay to be white so
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.720]  jump off the bridge the bridge is right there she might as well just jump off
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:55.960]  her family came from Mexico or that's one of the least brown-looking Mexican
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:05.360]  people I've ever seen but it doesn't even matter I can go out and sit in the
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.800]  sun all day and be burnt red to a crisp so what do I if I look like a crust a
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:15.040]  crustacean am I are you anti-crustacean now because I look like a lobster all
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.960]  right so so so so there's the video you can find the full video at info wars
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:25.880]  calm and I know that you guys also shared it on info comms org so okay so I
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.320]  didn't even know about this and this is this is the amazing thing about Info Wars
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.880]  Army because sometimes and I know I've run into you Thomas sometimes where you
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.080]  guys will have an event and how literally be driving down the road and just
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.320]  and just pop over and hang out with you guys for a minute so so what was the
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.680]  what was the intent it looked like you guys were over a busy bridge in Houston
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:50.240]  holding up signs downstream bridge over 45 yeah we were just trying to get out
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.440]  there and raise awareness for the info army and things like that so okay yeah
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  there's a great shot of it right there oh there's John Boy too wow that's great
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.880]  you guys traveled all the way to Houston so it's got an info wars calm big old
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.440]  banner and so one of the sign says it's okay to be white and I guess that and I
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.960]  guess that's what made this this girl drive her bike up and I mean what was the
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.720]  deal with it with this girl she drives her bike up and she was literally that
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:23.320]  offended by an it's okay to be white sign yeah yeah she had wrote up and started
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.520]  asking me what is this what is this thinking that it's just the ultimate
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:35.040]  form of white supremacy to just be okay with your skin color and not judge other
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.400]  people based upon theirs and she's genuinely claiming that she's Mexican
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:52.080]  yeah well she didn't look like it to me and I grew up in Pasadena yeah that too
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:57.240]  wait wait what was that Amanda she said her family came here illegally she said
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:02.160]  they were illegal for the first year but now they are legal but hey listen
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.600]  legal now so wait a second so wait a minute are this just happened or she
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:12.040]  was born here I'm confused did she go into detail on that no it's all in the
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:19.160]  video see here's my look I've dealt with these people enough and I could be
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.960]  wrong about this girl you guys are the ones that actually dealt with her but
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.160]  but I've dealt with these people enough to know their psychological makeup she
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.440]  probably made all of that up I bet her family is not even from Mexico I bet
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.080]  she because this is what they do they lie about stuff it's like why Elizabeth
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.600]  Warren claims to be an Indian it's like why B2O Roark claims to be Hispanic they
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:41.040]  literally lie because they know their arguments have no foothold unless
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.920]  they're claiming to be from the identity that they're social justice battling
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:50.760]  for right it really reminds me of that South Park episode where it's like I'm
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:56.720]  10% victim how many percentage victim are you you know anybody that
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.080]  makes a South Park reference when I'm on air I'm a big fan of that and that is
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:08.160]  classic that is a hi I found out I'm 10% victim I'm 8% victim yeah that's but
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.000]  that's where these people are at I mean that's literally where these people are
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  at and and and what they're seeing now is their whole reality is breaking down
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.400]  around them with people like Candace Owens I mean I was going through I don't
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.280]  even remember what I was I was searching on something on Twitter just some
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.200]  hashtag and it was like all black Trump supporters just like thousands of them
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.680]  tweeting and I'm like the media ignores this they act like there isn't a black
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.000]  person on earth that likes Trump and if there's one they call him a race traitor
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.600]  that's the most racist thing I could ever seen I mean does this woman realize
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.000]  that she's the real racist the one that came up to you guys well I don't think
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.760]  she did realize that honestly and while we were out there holding the sign and
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.800]  saying it's okay to be white I was on the megaphone preaching Martin Luther King
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.160]  Jr.'s dream that all men are created equal no matter what skin tone you are
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.920]  we're all Americans well I'll tell you what though I actually want to highlight
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.360]  something positive about this video she actually comes up to you guys and she's
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.080]  actually smiling when she comes up to you now obviously things kind of degraded
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.280]  really quick and she ended up getting emotional but that's better than kind of
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.000]  the deranged hysteria that we've witnessed from these people before
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.440]  well we got a little bit of that towards the end of that little deal we were
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.920]  doing out there these two more deranged leftist came up they wouldn't even talk
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.640]  to us which try to come over to them and they were just standing out there for
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.840]  about 30 minutes calling everyone they could possibly think of in the city of
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.080]  Houston like police officers whatever trying to give what we were doing shut
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.760]  down and they weren't able to do it and we eventually we eventually packed up
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.440]  some plan to be out of there by seven and as we were going out there that she
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.160]  you know they called some some city official to come and talk to us but
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.840]  that's that's a holiday of the point they were good they didn't just stop at
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.040]  police they were like going up the line like who else can I call
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:06.920]  oh my gosh I'm gonna get the president of the United States on the line sir we
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.680]  support the president
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:18.680]  wow hey this is amazing footage by the way great work with the HD footage and
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.640]  some of those shots where they're waving the flag but get back you were
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.560]  saying well now wait a second did you capture the deranged leftists that came
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.120]  up afterwards like like Tom was just saying yeah I got a little video of
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.080]  them a few clips I haven't uploaded them anywhere though do we have it on HD though
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:41.200]  I don't think yeah it should be on but I don't have it uploaded okay well you
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.280]  guys can put that at info comms and people with people want to see that
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.320]  because you guys are posting quite frequently on info comms there so what
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.120]  happened when what happened at the end what with these deranged people that
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.600]  we're trying to get you guys shut down did they just leave with their tail
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.360]  between their legs no they took around until they made sure that we were gone
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:03.800]  and I think in their head like we had already planned to leave when you're
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.760]  packing up so I think in their head they they thought that they got us kicked
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.720]  out of there because they were seeming you know free and they were taking
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:16.120]  pictures of my truck and stuff trying to look at her license plate but oh that's
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:22.040]  an old tactic but to be to be fair my truck is definitely something to take
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.240]  a picture of so you're not really hiding anything I think you got like five
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:33.720]  trump flags on your truck that you driver see the craziest part at all is when we
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:37.920]  were leaving we ended up getting a photograph of their license plate and
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:42.920]  she was like yeah what did you say Thomas yeah I went over to her I was
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.560]  like well you know I better make sure you know for for safety I better take a
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.720]  picture license plate something you know in case something happens at least know
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.880]  who they were because I can't I can't find any of their information from that
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.200]  at least I don't know how to but if they did something you know I could give that
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.160]  to the authorities and when I took a picture of it they just went he can do
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.720]  that you know you can't do that you can't take a picture of my license plate
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.000]  what are you doing like well you know that's what it is it's like the bully
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.360]  who bullies somebody who's smaller than them for like you know years and then
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.640]  finally one day that smaller person punches back and fights back and the
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.920]  bullies like stun they're like what what you're fighting back no you can't
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:27.520]  fight back I own you and then they run away crying so but was there was there
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.760]  a flash flood warning warning when that liberal started crying on the bridge
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:37.400]  there did they warn well wait let's find something else out that was pretty
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:41.080]  interesting about that well wait a second all right pause right there as as as
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.600]  John Boyd just pops into the picture there how many info how many info wars
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.240]  army people do you guys have in this compound all right we got a single
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.560]  break we got it there's another one and a pastor Sam I didn't even get invited
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:01.080]  to this party what the heck defeat the globalist hashtag Alex Jones defeat the

[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.200]  and pump the environment for the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:10.800]  name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.920]  quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:20.040]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.760]  hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.360]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.200]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.640]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:41.360]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.920]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:52.040]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to

[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:37.040]  footage shot by Amanda Silan right there in Houston Texas the Info Wars Army
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:42.600]  Houston added again triggering the local leftist it's always fun they were going
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:47.600]  up the chain of command to try to shut down their free speech boy that's just
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:53.480]  the average leftist these days hates free speech total racist just denies
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:48:01.240]  reality must be a sad state of existence and so you can find the video at
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:05.680]  InfoWars.com leftist cries when confronted by it's okay to be white
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:12.080]  sign it's really embarrassing these people but you'll notice a big difference
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.480]  when a liberal approaches a conservative versus when a conservative approaches
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.560]  a liberal if you would have reversed the roles guys liberals would have been
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.680]  telling you get off our bridge get out of here Tommy it would have been like a
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:28.120]  totally hateful display you guys were like hey well what's your problem with
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.240]  the sign like let's have a talk about this I mean well I want to hear this
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.480]  from from from all three of you real quick and then you guys did have an
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:39.040]  Info Wars product I guess the you were keeping the mosquitoes off of you out
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.040]  there you got the the mRex essentials BOA bug spray from InfoWars.com so none
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:48.240]  of you got got bitten by any mosquitoes out there
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.840]  I wasn't wearing it during this man but let me tell you the mosquitoes are
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.200]  probably starting to come back out as it warms up and every time I go for a walk
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:03.040]  you know I live near the brasses river so they're really bad and I spray this
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.280]  all over myself all over my dogs and you know we never get big this works
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.360]  better than normal mosquito spray I'll tell you that much you know what that's
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.880]  actually a great point you know it's all natural totally organic ingredients
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.680]  the bug spray from InfoWars.com so it doesn't have the deet and all that stuff
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.240]  in there which by the way I had friends that worked in bug spray plants they have
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.880]  to basically get in hazmat suits you know when they're producing this stuff and
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:28.080]  then you put it on your skin but yeah it's safe for dogs too I didn't think
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:33.120]  about that it's organic safe for dogs too yeah you know they lick themselves you
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:39.520]  know you could probably eat this let's not let's not give them any ideas out
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:46.880]  there please do not eat the bug spray from InfoWars.com live on air
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:55.480]  no it probably well no I'm not saying that don't eat the bug spray but but
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:59.120]  let's let's get let's get a let's get a comment though from everyone in the
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.200]  room including others I know that there's a whole InfoWars Army party going
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.280]  on so so if others want to comment but why do you think that is why do you
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.880]  think when like a liberal approaches somebody that's a conservative at an
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.720]  event or something the conservative wants to have a conversation is
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.840]  welcoming not hateful not kicking them out not silencing their right to free
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.960]  speech when on the other side of the aisle whenever I go to these events I
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.920]  get kicked out I get yelled at I get called names so so why do you think
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.600]  there's that dichotomy why do you think there's there's such a different
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:33.600]  response to a political opinion that's different than theirs from a
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:38.640]  conservative and a liberal well personally it's their cognitive
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:45.640]  distance is kicking really hard and the thing is it's ideologies communist and
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:48.960]  socialist ideologies the first thing that they try to do is silence your
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.160]  freedom of speech so you can't talk back because in the marketplace of ideas
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.680]  capitalism and free market and the American dream if you will has actually
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:04.920]  produced far more than any other country the world's ever seen and America is the
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:10.320]  sexiest country that has ever existed and they're trying to bring it down and I
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.400]  refuse to let that happen all right Amanda you you you've been really loud
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:20.320]  why don't we hear from you here well I believe they're simply just afraid of
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.720]  the facts they're afraid to come out of the world that they live in they don't
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:29.480]  want to hear what the real world is like it's too much to take yeah you know that
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:33.640]  that is true it is like they're afraid of the real world and and so instead of
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.240]  just accepting it it's like they want to just live in this false reality and then
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:42.720]  write about it and tweet about it and live in this false reality I don't know
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:47.400]  how you I don't know what that is that's that is like some next level
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:52.160]  psychology right there to try to break down that mental illness what's going on
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.280]  John what's up Owen hey man I just wanted to pop in real quick I don't want to
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.120]  take up too much of your time so there's two of the signs that were on the bridge
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:05.120]  that day you hear me okay yeah you're good so two of the signs that were on the
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.600]  bridge that day that the smaller woodlands and always bring out to all
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:13.720]  soon we've been flying here in Houston as well when Tom Thomas and I am living
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:16.920]  with the back of our house my house the other day they sound the back of my
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:21.680]  patio under there under the car for two days I woke up this morning to a note
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.880]  from my neighbor who just you decided just to destroy them rip them up and
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.440]  leave them with pieces on the back lawn and then left a note with this unit
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.840]  number his name I'm saying I could knock on the door and and so tell me how sorry
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:38.800]  he's not we're destroying my science my property vandalizing my property my
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.520]  signs that I made spend money on let this name let this info so I'll be
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.360]  following a police report this afternoon as soon as the sentence is done when I
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:52.040]  go home and hopefully we'll get justice for my property and getting destroyed
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.040]  you know and and so finally maybe somebody will get locked up and you know
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:00.640]  which kind of keep y'all posted hold on a second this is incredible yeah keep us
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:06.200]  posted on info comms.org I know that you post there so so hold on a second first
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:10.280]  vote guys there's literally laws written in this country so that you don't have
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:14.640]  to incriminate yourself this individual decided to put it all on record so you're
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:18.400]  telling me he literally just gives his whole entire admittance of guilt in this
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.840]  note and and and his information first and last name so so you're gonna be
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.360]  filing a police report immediately correct not because the signs really work
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:33.000]  that much money that's not that big of a deal I want to prove a point and let
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.360]  people know it's not okay to do this kind of crap we're trying to see the
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:42.000]  happen you I think and here's the thing too I'm I'm I'm seeing kind of a new
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.260]  leaf right now where police and look I understand what they're coming from they
[01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:49.520]  don't want to file a bunch of paperwork these people are basically like
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:53.200]  children or mentally ill people and so it's like you don't want to you know go
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.960]  through all these motions but I think the police are reached a different point
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:00.080]  now where they realize well we have to go through these motions so that we're not
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:06.080]  doing this for the next 50 years with these people yeah a couple people get
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:10.240]  locked up a couple people get thrown in jail for it maybe that'll send enough
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.560]  message through to stop some of the crime just a little bit of justice that's
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.600]  all we're asking for I don't even care about the property give them a fine
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.880]  something anything's better than that that's I'm sure and then they did they
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:25.640]  not go on your private property too yeah I mean there's all kinds of different
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:31.280]  things that this individual is guilty of vandalism trespassing take a pic it's
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.560]  unbelievable all right we've also Pastor Sam has now has now found room in the
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:40.600]  Info Wars Army Houston compound so so what it I know you've got something to
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:47.200]  say the verse of the day yesterday from acts changing them from darkest to light
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:52.120]  and from the power of Satan unto God and so you want to know why one side acts one
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.440]  way the other side acts the other way it's because there's power of darkness
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:00.520]  and there's the power of God and we got to bring people to do that awareness and
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:05.340]  that understanding and you know there's a growing movement of Latinos for
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:10.280]  Trump the president is here today on the outskirts of Houston and hopefully we'll
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:14.480]  go show him some support we got all the banners with us so today's gonna be
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.160]  another mission yeah yeah the president's in San Antonio tomorrow right
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:25.840]  it's today today he's in Crosby outside of Houston Texas it's just right across
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:31.960]  the ship channel are you guys going out there and showing support yeah buddy we
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.960]  talked to representative Kane and hopefully we'll get some tickets to the
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.120]  private interview this is one of the Latina candidates Avery narrow pay she
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:48.520]  is running for who's our candidate that we hate our incumbent Jackson Lee Sheila
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:54.640]  Jackson Lee is that the cowboy hat the mad hatter she's the crazy one that got
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:58.400]  on the airplane and said you know who I am I'm Sheila Jackson Lee you're not

[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.640]  Republican ever and Sheila Jackson Lee's been in since like 1990 it goes way back
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.040]  so we're gonna beat her because of this Latin grounds well you know the
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:25.640]  Democratic Party thinks that all the brown people are gonna vote Democrat for
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:28.800]  200 years but it's not happening they're coming around they want to be
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:32.800]  conservative they want to run their taco trucks and not get taxed and not get
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.120]  regulated out of business and we're supporting them Ava renairo pay is in

[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:55.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:04.080]  we now take you live to the central Texas commence over and the heart of the
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:13.560]  resistance and now your host Owen Troyer so attorney general William Barr has
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:18.440]  been testifying in front of Congress for the last two days and it's been pretty
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:23.880]  interesting because a bar has not been the attorney general for more than a
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.720]  couple months and so for most of the stuff that was happening or that they're
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:32.120]  questioning him on he wasn't even around for and he's kind of just like I'm
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:37.440]  almost like a unintentional mop-up crew that has to just read what was going on
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:41.520]  under someone else's watch and then kind of just respond to it in his own manner
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:46.320]  but the the questioning has been childlike it's been very immature you
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:50.560]  can see bars frustration with it however there have been some bombshells here and
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:56.880]  there including bar confirming that President Obama was conducting
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:02.720]  unauthorized surveillance of the Trump campaign here's that clip I am gonna be
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:07.960]  reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:19.960]  directed again at the Trump campaign during 2016 and a lot has already been
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:24.280]  and that a lot of this has already been investigated in the substantial portion
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:29.160]  of it has been investigated and is being investigated by the office of
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:35.520]  inspector general at the department but one of the things I want to do is pull
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:40.160]  together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:46.160]  including on the Hill and in the department and see if there are any
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:51.520]  remaining questions to be addressed and can you share with us why you feel a
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:57.560]  need to do that well you know for the same well for the same reason we're
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:04.000]  worried about foreign influence and elections we want to make sure that during
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.880]  elect I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal it's a big deal
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.840]  generation I grew up in which is the Vietnam War a period you know people
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:21.440]  were all concerned about spying on anti-war people and so forth by the
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:25.200]  government and there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:29.200]  there's an adequate basis before before our law enforcement agencies get
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.240]  involved in politics you know political surveillance I'm not suggesting that
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:39.320]  those rules were violated but I think it's important to look at that and I'm
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.360]  not just I'm not talking about the FBI necessarily but intelligence agencies
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:51.040]  more broadly so you're not you're not suggesting though that spying occurred I
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:59.640]  don't well I guess you could I think there was a spying did occur yes I
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:07.080]  think spying did occur well let me question is whether it was predicated
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:10.880]  adequately stunned and I'm stunning blow hold on pause it pause it I want to
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:13.560]  refresh this this is we got to watch this replay this is like somebody just
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:21.640]  landed a haymaker a knockout blow and the opponents out on their feet so you're
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:25.320]  saying that they're there you're not suggesting that there was spying though
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:30.760]  and William Barr is like no Obama did spy actually that's what I said boom and
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:38.960]  then we got out on their feet finish him all right roll this haymaker clip the
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:44.240]  eye necessarily but intelligence agencies more broadly so you're not you're
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:54.160]  not suggesting though that spying occurred I don't well I guess you could
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:04:00.880]  I think there was a spying did occur oh spying did occur oh hold on I want to
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:04.120]  watch that one more time rewind one more time because here's here's the
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:07.200]  Democrats up there trying to protect Obama but there was no spying right I
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:10.080]  mean Obama didn't do anything wrong there was no spying right I mean you
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.680]  didn't just say there were spot that's literally he's like no they were spying
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.640]  and so here oh no no but Obama didn't spy right
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.200]  necessarily but intelligence agencies more broadly so you're not you're not
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:31.480]  suggesting though that spying occurred I don't well that's exactly what I'm
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:37.080]  suggesting I guess you could exactly spying did occur yes I think spying did
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:47.200]  occur let me question is whether it was predicated adequately predicated oh my
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:52.000]  gosh how dumb do leftists feel right now I mean you guys are the dumbest people

[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:12.640]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:35.760]  now your host Owen Shroyer so let's just refresh our memories the left claimed
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.960]  that Donald Trump was colluding with Russia and a Russian agent totally
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.920]  false totally made up you dumbasses fell for it
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:48.920]  conservatives said the Obama administration was spying on President
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:53.520]  Trump the left said you're wrong that's a conspiracy theory oops the left was
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:59.760]  wrong again and now it's about to come out and it already is out but it's only
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:10.680]  gonna get worse so but you know we're gonna go back to Bart testifying but you
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:19.240]  know is there any saving these people and I'm not talking about you know
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:24.280]  religion and and and recognizing you're created by God and you're a divine
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:29.680]  creation and Jesus Christ is the Savior I'm talking about just intellectual
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:34.560]  philosophical slavery that these people are under is there any saving them
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:38.520]  because if they can't see their own shackles and they don't want to be free
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:41.960]  then why am I wasting my time trying to explain to these people how they've been
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:45.800]  deceived but that's the thing like we all do have to come together to have the
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:51.440]  victories we want to have our vision of humanity come true so it's like you know
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:59.320]  again get on board or get left behind to put it kindly but it's reached such
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:04.520]  levels of derangement ladies and gentlemen where they literally call
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:10.800]  black people white supremacists I mean how do you even classify that level of
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:18.400]  delusion Jeffrey Gutterman Candace Owens is a white supremacist like do you
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.480]  realize do you realize the level of delusion that these people are under
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:29.440]  folks they literally are calling black people white supremacists I mean that's
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:37.120]  that's next level I don't even know what next level delusion next level mental
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:45.360]  illness wow but here's William Barr confirming what we told you Barack
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:51.360]  Hussein Obama ordered illegal spying on the Donald Trump presidential campaign
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:57.160]  and I'm not just I'm not talking about the FBI necessarily but intelligence
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:02.400]  agencies more broadly so you're not you're not suggesting though that spying
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:11.400]  occurred I don't well I guess you could hold on I'm sorry I'm sorry just rewind
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.760]  it one more time just rewind it one more time this is so good because this is so
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:19.560]  key this moment right here he literally this is how dumb these people are man
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.840]  deep breaths I just don't know how to break this down and this is my biggest
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:30.680]  frustration today he literally is explaining how they spied on Donald
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:33.840]  Trump like that's the whole thing he's here breaking down how they were spying
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:37.840]  on the Donald Trump campaign he lays it all out and this dumbass Democrat goes
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:42.720]  but but you're not insinuating people were spying and so Barr in like a moment
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:47.240]  of his own shock is like whoa wait a second I literally just broke down how
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:51.320]  they were spying like do you understand like the left like this is shocking man
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:58.440]  I mean it's shocking it's shocking when you're with somebody and there's a big
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:02.120]  full moon in the sky and you say look at that big full moon and the person next
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.240]  to you says what full moon you're like look at that thing it's huge it's right
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:09.000]  there it's bright it's lighting up the whole night sky and like there's no moon
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.960]  here are you telling me you see a moon and you're just like what just like this
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.080]  woman she's like you're telling me that that people were spying on Trump and
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.520]  bars like that's literally what I just told you here so let's complete this
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.120]  real quick and then Dell victory is about to join us he's just got down with a
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.640]  big event but roll bar one more time and I'm not just I'm not talking about the
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.440]  FBI necessarily but intelligence agencies him saying they spied on you're not
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:43.240]  suggesting though that spying occurred I don't he's done he's like what do you
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.560]  mean that's exactly what I just suggested I guess you could I think there was a
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:55.640]  spying did occur yes I think like I just broke it down well let me question is
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.880]  whether now they're stunned all right we're gonna come back this is unbelievable
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.920]  look the Democrats left us liberals we don't have we're not enemies we're all
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.160]  in this together we're all Americans we can come together but you got to
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:10.360]  understand if you refuse to live in reality and you refuse to admit your
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:14.800]  own faults then like somebody that's doing a 50 miles per hour in the fast
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:20.080]  lane we're either gonna have to find a way around you or worse now Dell big
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.760]  tree is joining me right now and I'm very excited because he's got a big crowd
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:29.320]  of people behind him Dell what's going on hey oh and I'm here in Sacramento
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.200]  California where hundreds and hundreds of parents have gathered we are
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:37.800]  protesting SB 276 the law I was telling you about in your show just yesterday
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:41.840]  Senator Richard Payne that took our rights away from parents forced
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:46.640]  vaccinating children in order to go to public or private school with SB 277
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.560]  that law passed he said that there would always be a robust medical exemption
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.480]  this is a slippery slope that any state goes you know steps on to as soon as
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:04.200]  they allow this type of militant law to be brought into into place and so SB
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:09.480]  277 took the rights away from parents but now the medical exemption is under
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.280]  fire senator Richard Payne has written SB 276 which is going to mean that a
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.320]  doctor can't write your medical exemption essentially a bureaucrat in the
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:22.480]  health department of Sacramento is going to write your medical exemption
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.640]  meaning that your family history your doctor patient relationship no longer
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:31.840]  exists so I would say that SB 277 destroyed the Nuremberg code and the
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.800]  right to inform consent and now they're going after the Hippocratic oath which is
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:40.600]  the doctors you know salute to truth to say that we will always make sure the
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.960]  best interest of the patient I'm looking at is what matters not herd immunity not
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:50.240]  the herd outside outside these walls but you I'm gonna take care of you I'm not
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.800]  gonna injure you with a vaccine just so other people can be can be safe or can
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:58.960]  be happier whatever it is this nirvana that they dream about in the medical
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.560]  establishment so we're here saying that the doctor patient relationship is so
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:08.200]  important but while we are protesting here I know that you must be talking
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:11.720]  about we I mean yesterday we were talking about this New York has just put
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.800]  in the first adult mandate we have seen in this country I've been warning you
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:19.360]  literally predicted this down I mean I've been on the war room for a long
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:23.080]  time you've been coming on info wars for a long time you literally predicted
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.520]  this was coming and now it's official now it's official now everyone can see
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:31.240]  exactly what I was saying this has never been about children this has never
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.840]  been about two percent of unvaccinated children the pharmaceutical industry is
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:40.240]  the most powerful lobby in Washington outspending oil and gas two to one for
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:44.520]  one reason not because they want a couple thousand more unvaccinated kids
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:49.840]  because there's over 320 million Americans they want to be vaccinating on
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.960]  a yearly basis they want to take their industry from a billion dollar industry
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.320]  into a trillion dollar industry and it's starting with Bill de Blasio a
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:03.400]  purchased you know Democrat up in New York that is going to do the bidding for
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.040]  the pharmaceutical industry he's basically said you have 40 hours to 48
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:13.720]  hours to comply with a forced MMR vaccine program in New York all of this
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.600]  because my understanding is there's five or six people right now with measles in
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:22.520]  the Hasidic Jewish community this is something I stood up for in Austin Texas
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:26.760]  I put on a yellow star saying you were unfairly going after a religious group
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:30.880]  well now they're using that excuse to go after every adult you know what they're
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:34.320]  gonna find shocking Owen and this is the next thing I'm gonna predict is they
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.680]  have just said every adult hasn't got to prove that they have titers that they
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:43.280]  have you know that they are immune to measles there is only one group that's
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:46.560]  immune to measles and they can count on it and that's everyone that's about
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:51.600]  Bill de Blasio's age that got real live measles they are the only ones that can
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:55.160]  achieve herd immunity they're the only ones that are safe in New York and what
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:58.400]  you're gonna find is people start checking their titers and seeing am I
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:02.200]  immune to measles they go like well I'll be damned I got all of my vaccines and
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:07.000]  yet I am not immune to me and I think we may have got to go to break here Del
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.040]  but I may have another development on this that I think you'll be interested
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:14.080]  in learning it appears and we're doing a little bit more research into this right
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:21.120]  now but it appears that the MMR vaccines patent expires today oh how
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:24.640]  convenient is that we're doing a little more background check into that we'll
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:27.680]  talk about that more on the other side of this break but but here's the thing
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:31.180]  that people need to just kind of realize intellectually and then apply this to the
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:35.680]  forced vaccination thing if I have the flu or strep throat or something and
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:39.560]  I'm contagious I can walk around I know the grocery store I can go about my
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:43.320]  daily life who's gonna stop me are you gonna start saying if you have the flu
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:46.120]  you can't leave are you gonna test everyone for strep throat before they
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:50.080]  leave their house of course not oh but when vaccines are involved all of a
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.600]  sudden we have some sort of authority to do so no it's medical tyranny number

[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:02.160]  great I want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:07.520]  fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.000]  that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.360]  body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:19.560]  got the adults got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:22.560]  fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.600]  but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry you
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:29.960]  want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:33.320]  it's so good in my view I'm not a medical statement here but let me tell
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:37.120]  you something I eat five cabinets of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:46.520]  Santa Claus that night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:50.720]  so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice I just obsessed because
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:56.480]  whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it it's

[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:54.520]  store
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:20:14.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:40.360]  you know it's really awesome to see Dale Big tree with a crowd of people
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:43.400]  behind him because there was a pro vaccine rally here in Austin that got
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:47.560]  maybe organically 20 people to show up and then it was a bunch of med students
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:50.280]  that were forced to be there and then the people that were part of the event
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:54.600]  but here organically Dale Big tree is able to get hundreds of people to turn
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:21:01.680]  out to stop medical tyranny guys let's show this that's right that's what
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:08.400]  America sounds like when they're pissed off that's just beautiful right there
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:14.640]  all right thank you awesome isn't that awesome these are all parents of you
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:19.040]  know people of unvaccinated children others have injured children I call them
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:23.200]  the X vaxxers they try to group everybody into one slur words saying
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:27.960]  we're anti-vaxxers we are pro science we are pro health and science shows that
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:32.240]  unvaccinated children are far healthier I approve of it you know they keep saying
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:36.080]  oh and you know we've complained to the Health and Human Services and the
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:39.920]  National Institute of Health you aren't doing any placebo studies on any of the
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:43.600]  childhood vaccines we give our kids we've proven that and they say well it's
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:47.080]  unethical to do that study but don't worry we've been using them for a very
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:51.000]  long time and they've proven to be safe really proven to be safe highest rates
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.480]  of childhood cancer we've ever seen highest rates of childhood diabetes we've
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:58.020]  ever seen highest rates of autism we've ever seen in other neurological
[02:21:58.020 --> 02:22:02.440]  disorders highest rates of multiple sclerosis ADD ADHD all of our special
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:05.840]  needs classes are exploding in our schools you're telling me that this
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:10.200]  system is working this is the sickest generation of children this country has
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:15.080]  ever seen all under the watchful eye the CDC and the pediatricians of America I
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:21.160]  don't have to listen to you because you suck at your job and you know when you
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:25.200]  bring this information to people that are literally just pro vaccine who want
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:31.160]  forced vaccinations they either discount it or they try to twist it and say yeah
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:35.840]  but you know it's better than like polio or something well how are you to decide
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.320]  that's absolutely right I mean and look if they're accepting a new normal that's
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:42.680]  up to them it's a free country if you don't mind the fact that your child has
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.600]  eczema all over their body okay if you don't mind the fact that your child's on
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:51.080]  ADD medication or depression medication at the age of 12 okay that's up to you
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:56.360]  but talk to any you know unbacked parent any parents of unvaccinated children
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:59.480]  of those that are recovering from vaccine injury and they will tell you my
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:03.760]  children don't have those problems they don't have those issues and that's just
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:07.200]  simply the fact of the matter and if they want to prove me wrong then go ahead
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:11.480]  and do the easiest study known to man simply compare vaccinated children to
[02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:15.760]  unvaccinated children and then let's see and let the tips fall where they may
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:20.600]  until then you can't force any law on me telling me your vaccine program makes
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:25.320]  children healthier because the proof shows otherwise you are making America
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:30.920]  sick and what they do is because they don't have all these these big testing
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:35.040]  programs to see a vaccinated child versus an unvaccinated child they just run
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:39.080]  all the tests on the vaccinated kids and and the vaccines but people in the
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:45.200]  real world have done that with their own families a few years ago I used to I
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:48.920]  used to work with a youth youth development program and specifically we
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:53.200]  had different parts where we had you know homeschooled kids that would come
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:56.400]  during the day and then obviously like public school kids that would come in
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:01.720]  the afternoon homeschooled kids always healthier always more well-behaved the
[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:05.400]  kids from the public school would always show up nose running coughing sick right
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:09.280]  the unvaccinated kids are always healthy and that's just one little case study
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:12.080]  that just says hey you're not your kids gonna be fine if they don't get
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:19.400]  vaccinated but when you apply it to the larger the larger picture it's not even
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:23.280]  about oh my gosh look at this group versus this group it's just saying hey I
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:27.960]  have a choice and by the way why are you ignoring the fact that pediatric cancer
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.600]  is up hundreds of percent why are you ignoring the fact that autism is up
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:35.960]  hundred percent well you know why do you just ignore these things and just say oh
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:39.120]  no no it has nothing to do with vaccines well how do you know what does it have
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:42.840]  to do with there's no studies that can prove that it doesn't get the vaccines
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:46.840]  aren't causing all these illnesses but even beyond that study or no study what
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:50.440]  we do know is that we are now saying this is the first generation of children
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:53.960]  that will not live to be as old as their own parents we're supposed to have the
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:56.240]  best hospitals in the world we're supposed to have the best doctors in the
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:59.840]  world why do we have the sickest children we've ever seen I'm gonna go ahead
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:03.720]  and opt out of any program driven by the medical establishment because I've
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.800]  said it our children are sick and now guess what all these force mandates
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:11.080]  we're seeing in New York now the adults are gonna start getting sick watch all
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:14.680]  these adults get get the MMR vaccine and then we'll be the D tap vaccine and
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:18.120]  then we'll be the flu vaccine and watch how they start you know developing
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:22.600]  rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases multiple sproses I see so
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:27.880]  many superstars that are crippled with autoimmune disease and I wonder how many
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:32.240]  vaccines did you get to go on tour for your rock show or your comedy show why
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:36.400]  are you crippled right now you dance every day you get you have cooks cooking
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:41.120]  you the best food why is it you're so sick it makes perfect sense oh and if you
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:44.680]  look at all the vaccines we're giving people and what they're doing and guess
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.480]  what the science is being done no one has been done all over the world all
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.680]  over in England in France in China in Spain they are doing mouse studies and
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:57.600]  monkey studies showing that mice are having autism like features when it when
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:01.280]  they're injected with the same amount of aluminum that we give our kids in our
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:05.720]  childhood schedule you know so this is the science this whole thing's crumbling
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:08.760]  down around them and that's why they're using that they're having to go to
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:14.280]  martial law it's because we're winning we're winning are we not that's exactly
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:18.760]  it that's exactly it that's why they're censoring all this on social media that's
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:21.240]  why they're censoring all the truth on social media that's why they're pushing
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:24.120]  the mandatory vaccines now because they know they're on the precipice of a total
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:28.800]  defeat but you know you've been following this for a while Dell and we're
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:32.040]  trying to cross the T's and dots the dot the eyes on this when it comes to the
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:37.120]  actual vaccine but there is a measles vaccine that's patent is up today now
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.960]  again whether or not that is tied into what's going on in New York we'll try
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.480]  to cross the T's and dot the eyes but just from your experience studying this
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:51.400]  and being involved in this for so long that's not something that's rare when
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:55.720]  an ex expired vaccine is about to come down oh magically they start selling it
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:59.720]  yeah you know you had a great way to clear the shelves of a product that no
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:03.400]  longer owns the patent anymore I mean they I think that when they had the
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:07.640]  mandate in Rockland County where they were quarantining Hasidic Jews during the
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:11.000]  month of Passover they wouldn't be able to go to their own synagogues they sold
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:17.080]  I think another 17,000 MMR vaccines when they did that and you know this is a
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.680]  way to make money are they just clearing the shelves because they've lost their
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:23.840]  patent I don't know all I know is this we just broke the story this week we
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:28.520]  finally got the trials we use free of information act request to get the
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:33.240]  trials that approved the MMR vaccine we're all using and the results in the
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.000]  stats of and the only tested the 800 kids there's eight different studies that

[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:33.880]  the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer man there's all kinds of news and we're not
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:38.920]  gonna be able to get the half of it child predators being led into the
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:45.480]  country attempted kidnapping kidnapping of an 11-year-old girl thwarted by a
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:51.160]  good guy with a gun all kinds of other breaking news but the developing story
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:55.400]  right now that's kind of piggybacking off of what happened with William Barr
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:34:00.480]  testifying before Congress saying yeah they spied on President Trump they
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:02.840]  spied on his campaign and then the Democrats are shooting they're like oh
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:07.400]  my gosh did he actually just say that they're just stunned you can see it on
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:09.880]  their faces it's like they just got hit with a haymaker and they're out on their
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:15.480]  feet now Trump is swinging for the fences the story is at info wars.com from
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.440]  Jamie White Trump promises justice against deep state this was an attempted
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:24.800]  coup and they got caught and what they did was treason says the president you
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:31.560]  know that treason is punishable by death hmm did you know that and by the way
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:36.200]  now you have leftist saying that William Barr is taking Trump's quote unquote
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.920]  talking points by saying the Obama administration was spying on Trump you
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.920]  mean the truth so according to the left Trump's quote unquote talking points is
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:49.760]  just telling the truth so Alex Jones it's now a it's now considered a talking
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.080]  point if you just tell the truth and that's how the Democrats are gonna spend
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.360]  this now oh Barr is just going with Trump's talking points no he's being
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:07.920]  honest oh and I want everybody to just step back take a deep breath and thank
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:13.040]  God that reality is coming out the arrogant Democrats under Obama and
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:18.200]  Hillary bragged that they had spied on Trump illegally when he was president
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:23.800]  elect after the November 8th election two and a half years ago we have memories
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.560]  here at info wars we played the clips we showed the New York Times articles where
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:30.520]  they said he'll never get seated as president
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:36.400]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter went all over television MSNBC CNN Fox and said we know
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:41.560]  he's a Russian we know he stole the election she tried to get the delegates
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:48.080]  to not see him on January 8th and then 12 days later keep him from being
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:53.040]  inaugurated in DC then they tried to block men women and children families
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:57.680]  from getting into the inauguration then they see an intro the images of the
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:02.240]  gates closed and so no one can get into the mall and said look no one was there
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:06.240]  insane levels of lies because they believe Hillary and Obama and the
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:11.480]  globalist we're going to deliver on removing him but now as Trump said in
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:15.240]  just a statement minutes ago that's up on info wars.com or by the video the
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:20.360]  article from Jamie White must go viral folks also on newswords.com he said you
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:24.840]  lost you got caught and now we're going to prosecute you your criminals were
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:28.920]  coming after you and here's what's happened they committed so many crimes
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:32.560]  the Democrats of the deep state and the neocons and sold us out the time in
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:37.360]  China but the American people the Pentagon literally detonated in a good
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:44.080]  way by this show awakened to the truth the brush fires have been set and now
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:48.600]  the level of crimes committed by the Democrats are so massive they must be
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:53.200]  prosecuted and here's the even best part they're not giving up they've been
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:56.800]  given chances to back down and stop the criminal activity they're not they're
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:01.920]  getting worse they want race for that's their 2020 election bid and so we have a
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:07.320]  clear and present danger of absolutely maniac crazies led by Nancy Pelosi and
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:14.080]  Maxine Waters and others who are beside themselves as you said in rage and now
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:20.200]  fear as cornered animals as cornered rats and so this is so ultramassive that
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:24.040]  it's unspeakably powerful ladies and gentlemen obviously info wars.com is
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:30.280]  sincere on Facebook YouTube everywhere else Twitter but news wars.com isn't the
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:35.640]  article by Jamie White is posted there right now it is so incredibly important
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:42.760]  this is a major major major maximum action alert Trump promises justice
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:46.880]  against each state this wasn't attempted to and they got caught and that's what
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.200]  they did was treason says the president now understand folks I'm not an anonymous
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.280]  person I'm on air exposing this day one before President Trump even got
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:59.040]  elected telling you exactly what was happening the legal thighs of Lawrence
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:02.880]  how we should strike back why do you think they be platformed that's like
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.680]  nobody else and first because in the councils of treason in these boardrooms
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:11.240]  they know we've got their number because we do real research this is so
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:14.960]  incredible when I was in a deposition being sued by the Democratic Party a
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:18.960]  few weeks ago through their whole operation they kept saying who's zero
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:23.480]  hedge who's zero hedge you don't run it you don't own it I don't even know who
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.920]  runs zero hedge but because zero hedge that's the same analysis as the same
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:32.560]  real intel they think I'm running it or they think some intelligence agencies
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:37.240]  running it no it's called doing your homework it's called being on air seven
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:44.720]  days a week living eating drinking sleeping crapping fighting everything
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:49.960]  this is all we do blood sweat and tears we have their number and these arrogant
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:53.560]  people have been so public I love to give myself more credit but no they
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:58.840]  arrogantly were on TV saying we're gonna kill this guy that was the former
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:04.400]  head of counter-op terrorism operations Phil Mudd they've said it on all the
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:08.560]  shows Britain and Clapper said a year and a half ago on CNN at the half of
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:12.640]  Institute we're gonna have a coup by December he'll be removed and Wolf
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.440]  Blitzer said you mean extra judicially and they said yes and they tried to have
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.520]  a 25th Amendment to with Rosenstein and people said well why are they so public
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:24.640]  why are they so public in a coup because they had to go on CNN and that's a
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:29.040]  confidence game and say we're gonna kill this guy meaning Trump we're going to
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:33.040]  removing by December or we're gonna removing by March as they said again
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:37.960]  last year because they had to act confident for the criminals at the
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:42.080]  highest levels the FBI just Department CIA and other agencies but there are
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:45.120]  other agencies that aren't run by criminals and most of the people in the
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:48.840]  agencies that are run by criminals aren't bad they're upset so there is a
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:55.920]  will and a once in a multi-jurisdiction once in a multi-lifetime multi-
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:01.120]  generational system to defeat this we have the momentum we have the truth we
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:04.360]  have all the evidence of the chai comms buying a pollywood we have the treason
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:08.920]  and we must move this is real Trump always attempts to do what he says he'll
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:12.840]  do he does what he says they'll do 90% of the time when he's able to execute he
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:17.440]  is attempting to remove the real swamp leaders at the top they're the plug in
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:22.000]  the swamp you remove that and you actually start prosecuting thousands of
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.080]  these criminals you start putting them in jail they will all turn on each other
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:28.320]  in minutes we already saw Clapper and Brennan in the last two weeks go on
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:31.880]  every major channel and say we were ordered by Obama to run this
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:35.600]  investigation against Trump but see they lied to Congress and said they didn't
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:38.360]  they lied to him once he was the president so that's why we've got him
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:44.160]  right there too we have them doing things one trillion times bigger literally
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:49.200]  literally the Nixon Nixon listen to a few phones broken to a psychiatrist
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.680]  office got a few things against the Democratic leadership that was wrong
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:57.040]  that was bad this is the entire NSA spying on the American people trying to
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:00.840]  steal the election saying we're all Russian agents censoring everybody and
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:04.160]  these criminals are in trouble and Senator Murphy's in trouble and Senator
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:07.400]  Blumenthal's in trouble Mr. President they're running the stay-behind
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.160]  network sir and you know that now it's time to move against them we are going
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:14.960]  to defeat them but the listeners must explode with information warfare they
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:20.040]  must spread these articles habitually by hand call talk radio everywhere we were
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:24.680]  right we were patriots we hit the enemy first we led the charge but now we're
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:28.520]  encircled by what's remaining of the enemy forces in a vicious attempt to
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:32.400]  take us down because they don't want us in the game going into the next level of
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:36.200]  fight so here is the president just about 30 minutes ago the video is on

[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:23.400]  all started because this was an illegal witch hunt and everybody knew it and
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:30.440]  they knew it too and they got caught and what they did was treason ladies and
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.840]  gentlemen what they did was treason what they did was treason that is the 45th

[02:47:54.760 --> 02:48:00.280]  you know it's interesting as it's all coming out right now how Obama illegally
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:03.880]  spied and and soon you're going to find out Obama was leaking illegally too I
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:08.000]  just went on Twitter just to find that old tweet of Obama's that's going viral
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.600]  right now from 2013 where he tweets out I spy I search for it on Twitter it
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:16.880]  doesn't even show up meanwhile there's literally a hearing happening right now
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:21.560]  Ted Cruz is speaking about the big tech censorship and free speech in this
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:28.760]  country but you know Alex I mean everything that info wars has been
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:33.200]  through everything that you've been through do you feel like do you feel
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.920]  like the light at the end of the tunnel is finally approaching do you feel that
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.120]  you can finally feel the warmth of the opening at the end of the tunnel of this
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:45.240]  journey for truth and justice that you've been on for so long do you feel
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:52.040]  that we're finally moving forward okay apparently we have apparently we've lost
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:57.980]  Alex momentarily so we'll try to pick him back up but look at this from the
[02:48:57.980 --> 02:49:06.680]  Washington Post William Barr's highly questionable use of Trump's spying
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:11.960]  talking points so now the truth is just considered talking points to Democrats
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.640]  but but this is what they do when they project see all the Democrats have our
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:20.800]  talking points Trump's racist that's a talking point Trump hates immigrants
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:25.080]  that's a talking point Trump manufactured the crisis at the border that's a
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.520]  talking point these are Democrat talking points Trump puts kids in cages
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:33.840]  these are all the Democrat talking points this is how they that's what fuels
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:40.840]  all of their discourse is talking points so conservatives don't have quote
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:44.760]  unquote talking points I mean sure we'll have subjects for discussion but we
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:50.200]  don't have talking points that we use as a base to then form any other thought
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:55.240]  or idea off of that no we proprietarily think of things come up with things and
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:59.240]  then use facts and research and common sense and logic and reasoning to put it
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:06.080]  all together not talking points but now according to the Washington Post the
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:10.440]  truth is just talking points and so when William Barr says that spying did occur
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:15.680]  turn during the 2016 campaign which is just true I mean this is ridiculous the
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:21.360]  New York Times admitted this it's just I mean it's just unbelievable what these
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:27.520]  people are convinced of I don't even know how to analyze it anymore are they
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:33.720]  just blatant liars or do they genuinely have no IQ at all do they genuinely have
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:38.040]  no comprehension of fact and reality at all have they genuinely lost all touch
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:42.200]  with their own logic and common sense if that or these people are just totally
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:51.640]  liars to say there was no spying to their 2016 campaign are you kidding me but
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:58.760]  see that's just it it wasn't just spying spying fine is just a talking point you
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:05.880]  know what it really was it was treason it was treason and Trump has now said it
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:16.760]  do we have that clip here's president Trump oh man folks get ready their
[02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:22.520]  cornered rats they're a sinking ship it's no holds barred for the Democrats
[02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:26.000]  now folks that they know they know what they're facing they're gonna do
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:29.040]  anything try to save themselves including have Eric Swallow announced he's
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:33.400]  running for president you realize how big of a joke that is so get ready they're
[02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:37.600]  about to pull out all the stops because president Trump has just announced yep
[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:45.640]  the Democrats and Obama were engaged in treason this was a an attempted who this
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:51.520]  was an attempted takedown of a president and we beat them we beat them so the
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:59.400]  Mueller report when they talk about obstruction what we fight back and you
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:03.680]  know why we fight back because I knew how illegal this whole thing was it was a
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:09.520]  scam and what I'm most interested in excuse me what I'm most interested in is
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:14.280]  getting started hopefully the attorney general he mentioned it yesterday is
[02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:20.680]  doing a great job getting started on going back to the origins of exactly
[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:26.320]  where this all started because this was an illegal witch hunt and everybody knew
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:31.000]  it and they knew it too and they got caught and what they did was treason
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:43.480]  boom now see the president has really taken a leap of faith here and set
[02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:49.480]  himself up for failure quite honestly because he's now officially on a suicide
[02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:57.800]  mission you have to understand the level of
[02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:04.840]  criminality we're dealing with here and you have to understand when a group of
[02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:10.720]  people will engage in open treason and sedition against their own country
[02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:14.840]  against their own republic against their own people when they're willing to do
[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:21.800]  that right out in public think about what they're trying to cover up that's
[02:53:21.800 --> 02:53:28.440]  really what this is about they didn't have to spy on Donald Trump they already
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:32.480]  had their people in the media and everything rallying to stop Donald
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:36.240]  Trump Hollywood and everything Republicans were against Trump they
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:39.520]  already had all their apparatchets in place to stop Donald Trump from getting
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:50.960]  in uh-oh but then they realized America had already won America was not dead yet
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:59.120]  and so what did they do they committed treason they didn't have to they didn't
[02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:06.880]  have to illegally spy on Trump but they saw that the threat was real that the
[02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:12.040]  republic was back and that Trump might even beat a rigged election and we did
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:16.640]  all beat the rigged election so they committed treason right in front of your
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:21.840]  own eyes because they're so afraid of what other crimes they've committed will
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:28.520]  now be exposed by a man who's not in their secret societies so Alex before
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:33.800]  we lost you there I wanted to get your take on this oh and I was able to listen
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:37.480]  over over the line on my phone because you have to make your phone problems up
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:44.160]  there but I'm glad I'm on here with you now absolutely this this this is the
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:46.960]  beginning of the fulfillment of everything we're doing it doesn't mean
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:50.840]  we're putting some utopia in but it'd be like if we got the dictator Maduro out
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:54.040]  of Venezuela that at least gives them a shot at a new start that's what they're
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:57.240]  trying to wreck society the globalists are trying to kill what made America
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:02.320]  great rugged individualism because they need a group of domestic swabs that's
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:06.280]  why they're using this incredibly vicious race work acting but the
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:10.560]  Democrats know is made up in bull that's in the WikiLeaks and so Trump must go
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:15.680]  after the state we must go after the deep state we must take action and we
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:19.120]  must understand that because you were just saying they've committed so many
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:24.160]  crimes they have committed so many different angles of this garbage that
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:28.880]  it's just unbelievable that we've gotten to this point that now they're
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:35.000]  cornered rats but they are so incredibly dangerous at this point they are
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.600]  completely out of control at this point and they're gonna strike back and so
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:43.240]  now it's like having cancer that you're in third stage you don't cut it out
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:46.920]  you're gonna die for sure you cut it out it might come back in the country might
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:50.840]  still die but our only course of action is that we have to throw the book at
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:53.720]  these people and if they want to dig up their own republicans and stuff that's
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:57.240]  fine let's get it all out the open but the chips fall where they may and get
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:01.440]  the poison out so getting bit by a rattlesnake and you know you better be
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:05.600]  got a knife cut that spot open you know you can't reach down to your ankle and
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:08.960]  suck the blood out somebody's there with you you know like many a father's done
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:12.360]  for his daughter or son or his wife or wives are done for their husbands bit by
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:17.000]  rattlesnake you remember your family gets in there takes a knife slices that
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:20.240]  sucker open it starts sucking that blood that poison out and nobody likes to do
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:22.840]  it but it's got to be done you better get a lot of blood a lot of poison in
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:25.960]  your mouth better get ready for your own mouth to get sick suck in the poison out
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:30.440]  but we don't do it we don't have a chance where our legs gonna fall off we
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:35.140]  have got to suck the damn poison out we've got to get it out and we've got

[02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:56.480]  if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is
[02:58:56.480 --> 02:58:59.800]  better than that and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:04.960]  liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got
[02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:08.440]  the children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna

[02:59:21.680 --> 02:59:24.240]  human medical statement here but let me tell you something I eat five
[02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:30.000]  cabinets of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:38.480]  your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big
[02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:41.640]  profit off of it but you notice I just obsessed cuz whatever the best is we've
[02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:46.040]  got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it
[02:59:46.040 --> 03:00:09.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show alex jones the cure to fake news coming
[03:00:09.720 --> 03:00:18.120]  to you live from Austin Texas ladies and gentlemen final segment with myself and
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:22.640]  I'll enjoy your then Mike Adams the health ranger probably has the biggest
[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:27.360]  story he's ever broken on our platform he's about to break it's a natural news
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:32.240]  calm we're posting the full article to info wars calm there's a quickening now
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:35.800]  the top scientist medical doctors others I've talked to told me that a lot of
[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:41.480]  cancer isn't just viral it's caused by mutated fungus that's why it's so
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:45.920]  important to flush your body of fungus and there are now forms of fungus I've
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:51.760]  seen mainline reports to kill 90 plus percent of the people that come in
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:59.000]  contact with it medical alert hospitals are releasing deadly super bug funky into
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:03.680]  the open air colonizing that's their word the population folks bill of
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:07.720]  negates are obsessed with weather modification fungus weaponized against
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:13.120]  the public force inoculation this is the eugenics plan and it's admitted that
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:17.360]  HIV was created all this stuff this is the next level so we better get control
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:20.200]  of our government we better understand what the deep states up to because it
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:24.280]  was a lot deeper than just the gatekeeper criminals that were in control of the FBI
[03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:27.800]  and the CIA and the Democrats trying to keep prompt out they were trying to keep
[03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:31.880]  prompt out because this is not business as usual and I wanted to play this clip
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:37.720]  but it's on info wars.com we don't have time now because of the time
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:43.960]  running out here but it's the Attorney General saying yes there was illegal
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:49.880]  spying going on against Trump he said and he said it's election meddling he
[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:54.120]  goes they talk about Russians all day this is the Democrats election meddling
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:58.680]  this is very serious information it's an incredible clip I'm sure Mike Adams

[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:06.400]  sites remember when the internet had sites and not just big social media
[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:11.240]  networks run by globalist the chai comms censoring everybody it's now all up to
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:14.480]  you you see the victory we've almost pushed the boulder to the top of the
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:18.880]  mountain just a few more feet but we now have to put maximum effort in ladies
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:24.560]  and gentlemen now is the time choose your fate choose your destiny Mike Adams
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:28.520]  taking over on the other side but you know the whole purpose the whole
[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:32.960]  motivation you realize there's corruption you realize it's rampant you
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:37.280]  realize it's touched every almost every industry all the mainstream and you
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:41.360]  embark on a journey to expose it and that's all we've been doing here we've
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:45.080]  embarked on an a journey to expose the corruption call it as we see it along the
[03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:48.920]  way but I can't even imagine what the future holds if we can actually get this
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:54.200]  monkey of political corruption and societal corruption off our back the
[03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:59.120]  globalist the eugenicists are always talking down to us they're always
[03:04:59.120 --> 03:05:04.600]  trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant they try to censor because
[03:05:04.600 --> 03:05:08.880]  they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you
[03:05:08.880 --> 03:05:14.240]  can make your own decisions they want you to believe you're powerless but the
[03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:19.520]  truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say
[03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:24.600]  and what we do that changes the world we are the power structure we are the
[03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:31.040]  inventors we are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:35.760]  understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future
[03:05:35.760 --> 03:05:40.600]  from we the people now to help fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip of
[03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:44.200]  the spear against these globalist I want to encourage listeners and viewers
[03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:48.240]  understand that throughout the second half of the month of March we're going
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:52.200]  to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off the enforce store.com something
[03:05:52.200 --> 03:05:59.440]  everybody should take advantage of leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:07.960]  the New World Order it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams all right Mike Adams
[03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:12.400]  here continuing in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show today with a breaking
[03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:18.360]  bombshell report on a fungal superbug that has achieved already pandemic
[03:06:18.360 --> 03:06:24.360]  status across the United States I've done a deep dive into this story to their
[03:06:24.360 --> 03:06:29.120]  credit the New York Times actually covered this story a few days ago and
[03:06:29.120 --> 03:06:33.680]  blew the lid off certain elements of it you know even occasionally the New York
[03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:38.400]  Times actually does engage in random acts of journalism occasionally but we
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:43.800]  took what they put out and then we did a deep dive into the CDC and the CDC's
[03:06:43.800 --> 03:06:50.960]  fungal expert Dr. Tom Chiller I believe is his name I'll verify that and we
[03:06:50.960 --> 03:06:55.600]  looked at the the maps put out by the CDC and the statements by the CDC going
[03:06:55.600 --> 03:07:00.960]  back to 2017 all the way through the present and there are details the New
[03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:05.520]  York Times did not tell you that's what we're gonna bring you right now here on
[03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:08.800]  the Alex Jones show so here's here's the bombshell and then I'll get into the
[03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:14.240]  details of it we're gonna work backwards from this big aha hospitals across
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:23.140]  America are hubs for fungal infections of a superbug fungi named Candida
[03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:31.520]  auras it's a kind of yeast and this fungus is fatal to between 41 and up to
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:36.800]  88% of patients depending on the situation and maybe variations of the
[03:07:36.800 --> 03:07:40.440]  strain and so on and other related strains as well that I'll talk about and
[03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:46.600]  hospitals cannot kill it the CDC admits that the hospital cleaning chemicals do
[03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:52.200]  not kill it and they spray rooms with aerosolized hydrogen peroxide which
[03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:57.160]  normally would kill almost everything bacteria fungi and so on it doesn't kill
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:08:03.760]  it and the hospitals because of their HVAC systems they are ventilating this
[03:08:03.760 --> 03:08:10.320]  fungal strain out into the open air and into the environment and tests have
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:15.080]  found this fungal strain which is a deadly superbug again and I'll explain
[03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:19.560]  where it came from they found it in the air in hospitals in the air around
[03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:26.160]  hospitals and in soils communities and even backyards of homes around
[03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:32.360]  hospitals this has already achieved a pandemic stage do you remember when
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:36.400]  Ebola was on everybody's minds a few years ago and everybody freaked out
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:42.160]  appropriately so when the CDC brought an Ebola patient to the United States that
[03:08:42.160 --> 03:08:45.720]  put that patient in Texas in a hospital in Texas and then that patient
[03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:52.320]  promptly infected a nurse in Texas and it started to spread in Texas and of
[03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:55.600]  course we were all very concerned what is the CDC doing why are you bringing
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:09:01.760]  Ebola patients to Texas and so on and thankfully that that stopped they were
[03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:08.160]  able to keep that under wraps but this superbug fungal strain is already in
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:15.080]  California, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Florida and many
[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:20.320]  other states as well in fact the CDC has already said there are over 600 I
[03:09:20.320 --> 03:09:26.280]  think it was 617 cases that they have confirmed are infected with Candida
[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:31.600]  auris that's spelled A-U-R-I-S if you if you want to look it up that's the Latin
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:37.240]  of it Candida auris and the CDC also identified another thousand people who
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:42.520]  are quote colonized with this fungal strain so they are carriers of it who
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:47.960]  are not sick as carriers they are spreading it to other people and the
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:52.800]  biggest news in all of this is the massive cover-up the CDC refusing to
[03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:58.480]  name the hospitals in New Jersey, New York, Chicago and other places they
[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:03.240]  refuse to name the hospitals where these infections are rampant so now going to a
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:08.640]  hospital in Illinois for example or Chicago going to a hospital there might
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:12.440]  be a death sentence and the CDC won't tell you which hospitals are infected
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:18.720]  this this fungal strain again cannot be killed by Western medicine they don't
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:22.120]  know how to kill it they don't know what to do with it and it has spread around
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:28.280]  the world it's in the Netherlands it's in Venezuela and the CDC has
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:32.000]  documented that this strain is spreading through healthcare facilities in
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:38.620]  nations like India and Japan this is all over the world now and you might want
[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:44.680]  to wonder where did this come from is this a weaponized superbug well the
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:49.840]  the official story is that this is the result of the overuse of agricultural
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:55.120]  chemicals fungicides using agriculture these chemicals are sprayed on
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:59.720]  virtually all crops that you eat that you buy at the grocery store from tomatoes
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:04.680]  and different vegetables and fruits and nuts and seeds everything imaginable
[03:11:04.680 --> 03:11:10.520]  they spray fungicides on everything and these fungicides are in particular a
[03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:18.040]  class of chemicals called azoles now that's azole like triazoles and there
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:22.560]  are other azoles don't don't take what I'm saying out of context I'm not saying
[03:11:22.560 --> 03:11:27.960]  like Adam Schiff is an as as old no I'm talking about pesticides and fungicides
[03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:33.440]  here as all this is a class of fungicides so these as you spread these on
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:40.000]  the crops these create azole resistant superbugs and what they do is they kill
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:44.640]  off all of the so-called friendly fungi that would normally live in soils and
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:49.880]  live on crops and because the laws of competition exist in nature I mean all
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:53.760]  of nature is actually free market principles you have bacteria competing
[03:11:53.760 --> 03:11:57.520]  for resources you have fungi competing for resources you have you know
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:02.160]  organisms insects flowers and plants they all compete for resources it's a
[03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:05.800]  free market system by the way which is why as a side note socialism is
[03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:10.560]  anti-nature socialism contradicts what we see in nature everywhere but when you
[03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:15.640]  kill off all the good friendly fungal strains you make room for the nasty
[03:12:15.640 --> 03:12:20.040]  fungal strains to rise up and then colonize and take over and spread and
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:24.720]  multiply and this is what has happened so now virtually all the food that's
[03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:29.400]  being produced all around the world that is sprayed with this as old class of
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:34.280]  fungicide chemical all this food is now being infected or a significant portion
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:40.160]  is infected with this new superbug candida auras and almost nobody has heard
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:45.920]  of this it's in more than seven states across America it probably is
[03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:51.440]  infecting nursing homes everywhere it probably is infecting daycare centers
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:57.840]  public schools public transportation as well as hospitals malls movie theaters
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:01.120]  I mean think about it the only thing that we know can probably kill this
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:05.960]  effectively is sunlight or ultraviolet radiation where do you have dark places
[03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:10.720]  in artificial light everywhere hospitals movie theaters all these places malls
[03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:14.520]  they're all artificial light and this fungal strain is now being carried by
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:18.000]  people again people are colonized with it they carry it and they spread it
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  through all these facilities meanwhile the deep state vaccine industry is
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.800]  pushing people like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and others like Rockland
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:34.800]  County Ed Day there in New York to create an emergency over measles which has
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:41.520]  infected almost no one and kills almost no one yet this fungal strain candida
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:46.320]  auras has spread across the country it has infected the food supply it has
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:51.320]  infected hospitals it can't be killed and it has a fatality rate from 41% to
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:57.720]  88% and you don't hear anybody declaring that to be a national emergency you know
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:14:01.240]  why you know what the difference is there's no vaccine for this so there's
[03:14:01.240 --> 03:14:05.080]  nothing that they can hype up there's nothing they can push that big pharma
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:08.800]  can sell to make billions of dollars off of this emergency so they just don't
[03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:13.240]  even mention it so people are dying all across the country and you can add this
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:17.200]  well let me back up what's what's really important understand about this is
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:21.320]  this is a superbug that came out of agriculture and then colonized human
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:27.560]  beings that's different from other superbugs such as MRSA MRSA MRSA is a
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:31.840]  superbug that was created by the abuse of antibiotics in health care settings
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:37.520]  but it generated in the bodies of patients MRSA emerged in other words
[03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:41.120]  from patients being treated with antibiotics so it was a health care
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:45.560]  problem and health a health care-based emergence and now it is a health care
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:49.320]  based superbug that is killing patients everywhere across America the same thing
[03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:55.960]  is true with C.diff C.diff you can get that affection just by having you know
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:15:01.120]  various medical procedures even colonoscopy is a common one if they
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:06.600]  don't properly wash the items that they are inserting into your body they can
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:12.240]  actually implant a superbug in your intestines that kills you a few days or
[03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:15.800]  a few weeks later people are being killed all across America from colonoscopies
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:21.320]  because of that very reason well now we have an agricultural based superbug that
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:26.000]  came out of the crop fields came out of the soils and is now colonized humans
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.760]  hospitals are hubs for this infection hospitals are spreading it everywhere
[03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:34.800]  across America and the CDC refuses to name which hospitals which nursing
[03:15:34.800 --> 03:15:38.480]  homes are actually spreading this infection it's as far worse than Ebola
[03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:43.400]  ever got and it's only going to get worse watch for a big media cover-up in
[03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:46.840]  the weeks ahead we'll be right back with more details on this you're watching

[03:19:38.080 --> 03:19:41.840]  what's gonna happen to me in the future I mean all I know is I want to go with
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:46.320]  the master built I want to go to the next level I want to be with the spirit
[03:19:46.320 --> 03:19:50.040]  that I've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and
[03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:55.240]  feels like being in a tomb I want life I want Jesus
[03:19:56.280 --> 03:20:01.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:22.640]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams now
[03:20:22.640 --> 03:20:26.400]  even though the CDC is refusing to release the names of the hospitals and
[03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:31.120]  nursing homes that are carrying this Candida auris a fungal superbug strain
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:36.000]  that's killing well according to the CDC if you get infected with this you have a
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:41.200]  50% chance of being dead in 90 days that's the CDC's number right there and
[03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:45.760]  again we've seen numbers as high as 88% for related strains but the New York
[03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:49.840]  Times actually reported the name of one hospital in their coverage of this a
[03:20:49.840 --> 03:20:55.440]  few days ago the Mount Sinai Hospital in Brooklyn and there a man died from this
[03:20:55.440 --> 03:21:01.080]  Candida auris infection and afterwards the hospital staff tested his room for
[03:21:01.080 --> 03:21:06.600]  the pathogen so they took swabs off of every conceivable surface in his hospital
[03:21:06.600 --> 03:21:12.680]  room and listen to this because this will and probably horrify you and this is a
[03:21:12.680 --> 03:21:16.800]  quote right out of the New York Times remember if we had reported this
[03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:21.160]  everybody in the media would say oh that can't be but this is straight out of
[03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:24.880]  the New York Times this is from the hospital staff quote everything was
[03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:28.720]  positive meaning everything tested positive for the superbug Candida
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:34.720]  auris quote the walls the bed the doors the curtains the phones the sink the
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:39.760]  whiteboard the poles the pump that's a quote from Dr. Scott Lauren the hospital's
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:44.400]  president quote the mattress the bedrails the canister holes the window
[03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:49.800]  shades the ceiling everything in the room was positive for this superbug now
[03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:56.160]  I want you to think about how health care works we can't even get hospital
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:01.680]  staff to wash their hands on a normal day and studies have shown that doctors
[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:06.440]  ties the ties they wear are the number one carriers of superbugs around
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:10.760]  hospitals because they lean into a patient and the tie rubs on that
[03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:17.360]  patients gown or the patient's hand the tie picks up a superbug and then the
[03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:20.240]  doctor goes to visit the next patient because the doctors making their rounds
[03:22:20.240 --> 03:22:23.320]  and then guess what they rub their tie on the next patient not on purpose this
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:28.600]  is inadvertent even if that doctor washes his or her hands that tie is
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:32.320]  spreading disease all around the hospital this is why a lot of doctors
[03:22:32.320 --> 03:22:35.840]  don't wear ties anymore by the way because they know this is happening but
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:40.360]  think about it if this is everywhere in a hospital room that patient dies and
[03:22:40.360 --> 03:22:45.280]  guess what then the that room is available for you now if you're in
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:49.960]  Brooklyn or the next patient whoever it is next patient comes in walks in the
[03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:55.360]  room guess what oh this superbug fungal strain is everywhere it's it's on the
[03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:58.640]  ceiling it's on the bedrails it's on the curtains just like this president of
[03:22:58.640 --> 03:23:02.520]  the hospital said it's everywhere and they can't kill it so now this next
[03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:08.360]  person gets infected now if that person survives the infection and leaves the
[03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:12.840]  hospital and goes home what do they take with them candida or a superbug
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:16.800]  because now they are quote colonized they're colonized they didn't get sick
[03:23:16.800 --> 03:23:19.840]  from it it didn't kill them but they're colonized because you can't get rid of it
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:24.560]  and so they take it home and then it spreads throughout their home and to
[03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:28.360]  their family members and this is how it happens hospitals become hubs for the
[03:23:28.360 --> 03:23:32.080]  infections and we don't even know which hospitals to avoid at this point because
[03:23:32.080 --> 03:23:36.440]  again the CDC won't release the names now there are two other very important
[03:23:36.440 --> 03:23:40.560]  things you need to understand about this according to media reports it's the
[03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:45.160]  people who have weakened immune systems that are being killed by this
[03:23:45.160 --> 03:23:49.800]  superbug fungal strain people with strong immune systems healthy immune
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:55.560]  function i.e. people like you and I who maybe we eat superfoods maybe we take
[03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:59.720]  nutritional supplements maybe we we get some sunlight we have some vitamin D we
[03:23:59.720 --> 03:24:03.720]  do some physical exercise we take care of our health at least in some basic kind
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:09.160]  of way we are not the people who are going to be killed by this but we can
[03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:13.360]  be colonized by it you can become a carrier and not even know it you may be
[03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:18.080]  a carrier right now and then what happens is it goes and kills other people
[03:24:18.080 --> 03:24:24.320]  who are immuno suppressed and who's immuno suppressed in society think about
[03:24:24.320 --> 03:24:29.360]  it it's the children who are being vaccinated with immune system damaging
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:33.920]  vaccines they can then be hit with this fungal superbug and be killed by the
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:37.960]  the fungal strain even though they were weakened by the vaccine because the
[03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:42.960]  vaccine is an attack on the immune system it's senior citizens especially
[03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:47.120]  those in nursing homes might be your parents or your grandparents who are
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:51.920]  living in an assisted facility of some kind you go to visit them you're fine
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:56.800]  but you're you're colonized with the superbug you go to hug grandma let's
[03:24:56.800 --> 03:25:02.320]  say now you've transferred that fungal strain to her she gets infected she gets
[03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:05.960]  sick and she spreads it to the whole nursing home and this is happening all
[03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:09.960]  across America right now have no doubt about that this is happening
[03:25:09.960 --> 03:25:15.760]  everywhere and it shows the importance of taking care of your health because if
[03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:21.160]  you can survive this you can coexist with this fungal strain and it also shows
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:25.640]  in my opinion as a nutrition science person the importance of probiotics
[03:25:25.640 --> 03:25:30.080]  you need to have healthy gut flora because you don't want this candida yeast
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:34.520]  getting into your gut and then take in over your gut and guess when that can
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:39.720]  happen when you take antibiotics so you go in to see the doctor you have a cold
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:43.520]  or a flu or something even though antibiotics are useless against viral
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:47.820]  infections a lot of doctors just to try to get rid of you will say here I take
[03:25:47.820 --> 03:25:52.560]  these antibiotics this will help you so you take the antibiotics it wipes out
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:58.160]  all your intestinal flora you now have no intestinal flora and you're eating
[03:25:58.160 --> 03:26:02.040]  you've got this superbug fungal strain on your fingers you're eating some fresh
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:06.840]  apples or some fresh celery or something and you didn't wash it enough it goes
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:13.280]  right in your gut and then candida are a superbug infects your gut conceivably
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:19.080]  this can happen or it can infect other surfaces of your body the CDC Dr. Tom I
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:25.560]  think his name is Tom Tom Chiller he said that literally they were swabbing
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:30.360]  patients crotches to see if they were infected with this I'm not kidding I'm
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:35.720]  not trying to make this obscene but it lives in people's crotches I mean if you
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:39.440]  can believe that but it's all over their bodies it just happens to be in areas
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:44.280]  that are dark and damp that's where fungal strains like to live so if you if
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:49.080]  you happen to get this you know in your gut it could kill you and that can happen
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:53.960]  because you took antibiotics this again underscores the extreme importance of
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:57.240]  taking care of your health in this time because I'm here to tell you this is not
[03:26:57.240 --> 03:27:00.880]  the only superbug that's going to come out of agriculture there's already
[03:27:00.880 --> 03:27:05.920]  another one it's called aspergillus thick fumigatus that's the Latin term
[03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:11.440]  aspergillus fumigatus that was documented several years ago and that's
[03:27:11.440 --> 03:27:15.720]  actually the strain that has the 88% fatality rate associated with this and
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:20.600]  this strain comes out of agriculture again it's the azole resistant strains of
[03:27:20.600 --> 03:27:25.880]  of yeast and fungus or fungi and they spread all across the world they spread
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:29.880]  through hospitals and everywhere and this is relatively recent though this was
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:32.720]  only in the last few years that this is coming on strong we've had other
[03:27:32.720 --> 03:27:39.520]  superbugs like MRSA MRSA that have been in hospitals for many more years and you
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:42.600]  have now the recognition of the medical system that says we are approaching the
[03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:47.800]  end of the era of antibiotics we don't know what to do the hospital experts say
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:51.640]  that the epidemiologists say we don't know what to do we've run out of
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:57.160]  antibiotics we've run out of antifungals we've run out of chemicals to treat
[03:27:57.160 --> 03:28:02.440]  these conditions so here's the future that you're facing and myself included
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:07.240]  we're all facing this future we're gonna have more emerging superbugs coming out
[03:28:07.240 --> 03:28:11.840]  of agriculture coming out of farm fields crop fields food supply and also coming
[03:28:11.840 --> 03:28:16.000]  out of hospitals it's not just the jungles of Africa Ebola and all that this
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:20.400]  is coming out of the farm fields in Iowa all right this is happening right here
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:25.560]  in America in Illinois in Kansas everywhere and these bugs are gonna kill
[03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:31.240]  people who are immunosuppressed which by the way tend to be people who live in
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:35.560]  cities too because there's a lot of more stress in the cities a lot more salt a
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:40.200]  lot of pollution that's immunosuppressive and so on this is real this
[03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:43.080]  happening I'll have much more for you straight ahead here on the Alex Jones
[03:28:43.080 --> 03:28:49.120]  show Mike Adams talked about Uncle Superbug today say with him

[03:31:53.080 --> 03:31:57.920]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[03:31:57.920 --> 03:32:02.200]  drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[03:32:02.200 --> 03:32:06.560]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[03:32:06.560 --> 03:32:12.040]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[03:32:12.040 --> 03:32:17.000]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:22.640]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:32:22.640 --> 03:32:27.760]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[03:32:27.760 --> 03:32:32.120]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[03:32:32.120 --> 03:32:37.480]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[03:32:37.480 --> 03:32:43.400]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[03:32:43.400 --> 03:32:47.640]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[03:32:47.640 --> 03:32:54.600]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:32:54.600 --> 03:33:01.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:09.920 --> 03:33:15.800]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of
[03:33:15.800 --> 03:33:25.200]  the resistance it's Mike Adams you're listening to the alex jones show there
[03:33:25.200 --> 03:33:31.880]  are days like today that I feel like you you and I we are going to be the
[03:33:31.880 --> 03:33:38.720]  surviving remnant of humanity not a joke humanity has sown the seeds of its own
[03:33:38.720 --> 03:33:44.160]  destruction humanity is on a suicide path with the use of these chemicals and
[03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:49.440]  these antibiotics and these toxic vaccines that have a transgenerational
[03:33:49.440 --> 03:33:53.840]  impact of infertility and immunosuppression and more and when I
[03:33:53.840 --> 03:33:59.120]  just spoke about candida aris this is already really a stage six pandemic it's
[03:33:59.120 --> 03:34:03.320]  just hasn't been declared yet and only those with strong immune systems can
[03:34:03.320 --> 03:34:08.200]  survive it well who's that going to be I mean think about this is this this is
[03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:12.920]  beyond serious this is going to wipe out potentially the entire system of
[03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:16.840]  western medicine as we know it's going to turn hospitals into death camps
[03:34:16.840 --> 03:34:21.680]  essentially hubs of spreading infectious disease but the way to survive it based
[03:34:21.680 --> 03:34:27.200]  on everything we currently know is to have strong immune function and you
[03:34:27.200 --> 03:34:31.160]  know I'm I'm saying this as a third party I don't have any financial ties
[03:34:31.160 --> 03:34:37.480]  with info wars or info wars store.com but if I were if I were to I would get
[03:34:37.480 --> 03:34:41.360]  serious about boosting immune function you know I would I would really invest
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:45.960]  in some good products at info wars store or wherever you get them maybe you grow
[03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:50.720]  some of your own herbs maybe you grow basil you know that that boosts immune
[03:34:50.720 --> 03:34:55.440]  function but you need to get some in my opinion vitamin C can save your life
[03:34:55.440 --> 03:34:59.400]  under the right circumstances vitamin D can save your life it's not a joke
[03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:02.800]  especially as we enter these times when you have all these outbreaks happening
[03:35:02.800 --> 03:35:07.280]  and who knows what's coming after this one another one will be in the works
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:14.120]  get better get your immune system going and really think seriously about dropping
[03:35:14.120 --> 03:35:18.320]  habits that are suppressing your immune function those include of course smoking
[03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:23.760]  cigarettes vaping is safe in that way vaping doesn't give you the cancer
[03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:27.680]  causing carcinogens but smoking burned material does so you might want to
[03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:31.600]  reconsider that or cut down on your frequency don't have a sedentary lifestyle
[03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:35.680]  don't live indoors all the time make sure you get outside make sure you have
[03:35:35.680 --> 03:35:40.200]  some time in nature do some physical exercise eat some superfoods drink some
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:44.000]  superfoods take some high-quality nutrient supplements you need these it's
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:48.680]  it's really really becoming a matter of life and death not a joke you look at
[03:35:48.680 --> 03:35:53.080]  people who are gonna die those are people who live on are living on junk food
[03:35:53.080 --> 03:35:56.760]  people who are immunosuppressed people who are just taking pharmaceuticals
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:36:00.920]  every day and taking antibiotics and having very stressful lives and did you
[03:36:00.920 --> 03:36:04.800]  know that just sleep deprivation can suppress your immune function sleep
[03:36:04.800 --> 03:36:08.760]  deprivation so if you're living somewhere you're on a busy city street and
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:13.400]  those cars honking all night and car alarms going off that's that's actually
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:17.120]  that can that can literally suppress your immune function and get you killed
[03:36:17.120 --> 03:36:20.960]  if you get exposed to something like Candida or us so think about where you
[03:36:20.960 --> 03:36:24.480]  are think about how you can boost your immune function and protect yourself
[03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:29.680]  from all of these insults and the one thing we know for sure is that as these
[03:36:29.680 --> 03:36:33.840]  superbugs continue to spread across our world we're gonna have more and more
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:38.320]  people fleeing the cities cities are going to become death traps cities are
[03:36:38.320 --> 03:36:42.360]  going to become disease-infested zones and one of the things that I noted about
[03:36:42.360 --> 03:36:46.760]  this that was most important was how the CDC has documented hospitals in
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:52.560]  Venezuela spreading this Candida RS superbug why is that happening in
[03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:57.720]  Venezuela well Venezuela you have a collapse of society you have the power
[03:36:57.720 --> 03:37:03.080]  grid going down in major cities they're like Caracas and others you have a lack
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:08.520]  of just basic supplies you can't buy bleach you can't get isopropyl alcohol
[03:37:08.520 --> 03:37:13.600]  you can't get povidone iodine you can't get basic supplies that are typically
[03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:17.200]  used to clean hospital rooms and wash hands and so on you don't even have
[03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:21.080]  circulation or ventilation in the hospitals when the power is out you've
[03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:24.880]  got people starving to death and I saw an article recently to start to dig up
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:30.680]  the bones of the dead to try to rob them of gold teeth and jewelry like anything
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:37.040]  that a corpse had like literally robbing corpses to try to find gold teeth that's
[03:37:37.040 --> 03:37:40.880]  just just astonishing and by the way cannibalism is not far behind in
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:44.320]  Venezuela if it hasn't already begun they're gonna have no choice but to
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:48.800]  start eating each other when that happens you're gonna see an explosion of
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:53.360]  infectious disease like we haven't seen you know since since the medieval days
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:58.560]  and the or the dark ages it's gonna shock people and it's going to spread
[03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:02.600]  it's every liberal city is collapsing in one way or another some faster than
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:08.640]  others look at San Francisco I mean San Francisco is a I have to watch my
[03:38:08.640 --> 03:38:12.640]  language there's human feces all over the streets there's needles all over the
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:17.320]  streets of San Francisco Seattle is the same thing now Chicago is not far
[03:38:17.320 --> 03:38:21.920]  behind New York has a similar problem and so on Los Angeles as well well what
[03:38:21.920 --> 03:38:26.800]  what do all these things do they spread infectious disease if you have needles
[03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:31.400]  and feces all over the streets it's not long before you have a highly infected
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:35.800]  contagious population that's been quote colonized with pathogens and then
[03:38:35.800 --> 03:38:39.440]  they're immunosuppressed in the cities and then they just start dying the
[03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:43.280]  hospitals get overrun with sick and dying patients the hospitals get
[03:38:43.280 --> 03:38:47.920]  infected as those patients die they clear out of the rooms the morgues get
[03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:52.480]  overrun with colonized infected bodies new people come into the hospitals and
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:57.320]  get re-infected with the next superbug pretty soon people are just fleeing the
[03:38:57.320 --> 03:39:02.080]  cities I mean it's already begun for tax reasons right now people are fleeing
[03:39:02.080 --> 03:39:06.120]  California or New York for tax reasons but they're gonna start fleeing the
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:12.560]  cities as a as a means of survival that day is not far behind and as they do
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:17.360]  that you know how the socialists and the fascists in California they have to
[03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:21.040]  flee California because they can't afford to live there anymore and so they
[03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:25.720]  take their fascism and then bring it to Austin Texas or they bring it to Las
[03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:30.240]  Vegas or they bring it to Utah so they're implanting fascism all over the
[03:39:30.240 --> 03:39:34.440]  country and trying to turn those states blue well guess what as these superbugs
[03:39:34.440 --> 03:39:39.800]  get worse and worse they're going to be implanting actual infectious diseases in
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:45.120]  cities like Salt Lake City Provo Las Vegas Austin Texas wherever they're
[03:39:45.120 --> 03:39:49.680]  fleeing to this is this is going to happen you're seeing the economic
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:54.640]  migration or fleeing right now or let's let's call an economic exodus out of the
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:39:59.840]  liberal cities you are going to see a microbiological exodus out of the
[03:39:59.840 --> 03:40:04.240]  cities we're talking about a pandemic on a scale that this world has never seen
[03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:10.080]  and this fungal strain Candida Aris is this is just the beginning you might
[03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:13.800]  want to go back and watch what was that I think it was a Discovery Channel show
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:18.360]  doomsday preppers I want to go back and watch doomsday preppers because it's
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:22.480]  suddenly relevant again I think there was an episode in there about pandemics
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:27.560]  you needed you need to get up to speed on that pandemics are real they are here
[03:40:27.560 --> 03:40:32.040]  they are here now it's not like oh it's in Africa and it might come here no it's
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:36.400]  in Chicago it's in New York it's in New Jersey it's in Texas in California in
[03:40:36.400 --> 03:40:39.800]  Florida Connecticut right now and Maryland I believe another some other
[03:40:39.800 --> 03:40:44.240]  states as well now we know that governments are going to exploit these
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:50.320]  situations to clamp down on freedom and to roll out tyranny and we just saw a
[03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:56.240]  shocking example of this with Mayor de Blasio in New York declaring medical
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:41:03.240]  martial law again in New York City as you recall about a week ago the the CEO
[03:41:03.240 --> 03:41:08.920]  or the the top guy whatever his title is of Rockland County New York his name is
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:14.080]  Ed Day he declared medical martial law in Rockland County said everybody has to
[03:41:14.080 --> 03:41:18.920]  be vaccinated or 18 or under or he's gonna have you arrested and sent to
[03:41:18.920 --> 03:41:23.040]  prison for six months well he was sued and that went to the New York Supreme
[03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:26.760]  Court and just a couple of days ago the New York Supreme Court shot that down
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:32.160]  and said this is a bogus emergency this isn't even real I'm paraphrasing they
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:36.880]  called it I think capricious and something else shot it down and Ed Day
[03:41:36.880 --> 03:41:40.960]  was still saying no we got we got to have this people are gonna die unless we
[03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:46.720]  have medical martial law well yesterday Mayor de Blasio said in New York you
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:51.080]  have to be injected with every substance that the state of New York wants you to
[03:41:51.080 --> 03:41:55.080]  be injected with regardless of whether it's safe or not regardless of the
[03:41:55.080 --> 03:41:58.360]  ingredients you have to be injected your children have to be injected and he's
[03:41:58.360 --> 03:42:03.880]  taken this to the acidic Jewish community in New York as well not telling
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:08.320]  them by the way that all these vaccines are not kosher because many of them have
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:13.880]  aborted human fetal tissue cells in them so this is medical cannibalism being
[03:42:13.880 --> 03:42:20.920]  forced on Hasidic Jews by a tyrannical state government led by a medical
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:26.920]  tyrant named de Blasio and this is happening because they're gonna take
[03:42:26.920 --> 03:42:30.000]  every little emergency and they're gonna blow it up in the medical martial law
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:36.120]  because they are fascists this is what they do they use every emergency to take
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:40.520]  away your liberty and to trample your rights and to violate your human
[03:42:40.520 --> 03:42:44.400]  dignity your body doesn't even belong to you in New York we'll be back after
[03:42:44.400 --> 03:42:47.600]  this break with more stay with us
[03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:58.480]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've
[03:42:58.480 --> 03:43:03.600]  noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:10.920]  buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election
[03:43:10.920 --> 03:43:15.240]  night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and
[03:43:15.240 --> 03:43:20.760]  others get so butt-hurt when Trump won they don't want us to have that victory
[03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:25.920]  they don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the
[03:43:25.920 --> 03:43:30.320]  globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in fours down this is a fight
[03:43:30.320 --> 03:43:34.400]  about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:39.880]  sovereignty away this country is in a war so again I want to thank you for what

[03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:21.960]  popular like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it

[03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:25.920]  don't want you to survive remember the first Terminator movie I think it was
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:31.400]  Reese said to Sarah Connor come with me if you want to live and in Terminator 2
[03:47:31.400 --> 03:47:36.440]  the Terminator the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator said the same thing as he was
[03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:40.760]  rescuing her from the psychiatric facility come with me if you want to
[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:45.040]  live well I'm here today to tell you if you want to live seriously you want to
[03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:50.040]  survive what's coming you watch info wars you read natural news you check out
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:54.040]  the independent media you stay informed because if you go through the
[03:47:54.040 --> 03:47:58.440]  mainstream services if you even use Google as search we now know that Google
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:04.880]  has blacklisted all alternative health and natural healing websites from their
[03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:09.240]  search results this came out in a memo an exclusive bombshell released by the
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:14.040]  Daily Caller yesterday and the Daily Caller story well they acquire these
[03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:19.760]  memos from Google that talk about how they have an individual a senior Google
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:25.120]  search engineer he's been there I think 17 years was responsible for suppressing
[03:48:25.120 --> 03:48:30.920]  websites putting them on a news blacklist if they talk about medical or
[03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:37.600]  health denial what is denial if you what if you deny that vaccines are always
[03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:41.360]  awesome and perfectly safe and never harm anyone if you deny that you're
[03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:46.640]  added to that blacklist if you deny anything about medicine if you deny
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:52.040]  that oh statin drugs are awesome and save lives and never harm anyone on that
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:57.200]  list as well if you talk about fluoride if you talk about geoengineering you
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:00.760]  talk about any of these things you were put on this blacklist this has come out
[03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:07.440]  now this shows the incredible dishonesty and even really fraud that Google is
[03:49:07.440 --> 03:49:12.480]  carrying out and this is why we have got to have an independent investigation in
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:18.240]  the Google I think we need our lawmakers in Washington DC to demand criminal
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:23.920]  indictments of the tech giant CEOs they are engaged in my opinion in election
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:28.640]  meddling in vote fraud but more importantly they are denying the basic
[03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:33.200]  human rights of freedom of speech and they are actively interfering with
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:37.800]  information that could be lifesaving to people in these circumstances that we're
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:43.640]  talking about outbreaks of superbugs infections worldwide collapsing liberal
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:48.720]  cities that are descending into third world status with feces and filth all
[03:49:48.720 --> 03:49:52.920]  over the place that's obviously going to lead to the spread of disease if you
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:59.240]  want to live seriously read info wars read natural news watch my podcast on
[03:49:59.240 --> 03:50:03.680]  that note by the way I've got a full documentary coming this Sunday my
[03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:07.920]  counter think show info wars.com 6 p.m. central time it's the full
[03:50:07.920 --> 03:50:13.240]  documentary of this candida oris superbug it's the whole hour is dedicated
[03:50:13.240 --> 03:50:17.920]  to that so don't miss that if you happen to miss it later on it'll be at
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:22.840]  counterthink.com with all the other videos the point is you got to stay
[03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:28.320]  informed here this is going to get worse the censorship is covering up exactly
[03:50:28.320 --> 03:50:31.680]  the information that you need to save your life the governments like the
[03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:36.080]  Blasio New York are using every emergency to destroy freedom of speech and
[03:50:36.080 --> 03:50:42.240]  to turn you into a medical guinea pig a medical slave and it's it's so much
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:48.280]  worse than what I can even describe here. Did you know that my god I don't
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:53.680]  even how do I even describe this they're taking autistic children and then in the
[03:50:53.680 --> 03:50:58.040]  autistic care centers and schools they're convincing the autistic children
[03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:03.000]  that they're all transgenders so that they can then run big pharma gender
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:08.680]  castration chemical experiments on autistic children this is rampant
[03:51:08.680 --> 03:51:12.720]  medical abuse I think there was a story this morning about people just being
[03:51:12.720 --> 03:51:17.320]  fired from a hospital in the UK who had prayed upon I don't know if it was like
[03:51:17.320 --> 03:51:22.880]  20 teenagers putting them on these chemicals that cause long-term damage
[03:51:22.880 --> 03:51:28.320]  we're talking about the physical maiming of children to conduct their radical
[03:51:28.320 --> 03:51:32.800]  left-wing social engineering and transgenderism experiments think about
[03:51:32.800 --> 03:51:36.600]  this these children who are autistic they were damaged in the first place in
[03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:41.040]  many cases by vaccines that are mandated by the state so the state poisons your
[03:51:41.040 --> 03:51:47.280]  child turns your child into a neurologically damaged individual who
[03:51:47.280 --> 03:51:51.720]  suffers through pain and suffers a lifetime of not being able to use their
[03:51:51.720 --> 03:51:56.040]  neurology like God intended so they're suffering and then the state hospitals
[03:51:56.040 --> 03:51:59.720]  come along and say oh you're a transgender let's cut off your genitals
[03:51:59.720 --> 03:52:05.120]  and treat you with chemical castration pharmaceuticals so we can claim to be
[03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:11.040]  tolerant and diverse and progressive this is the insanity that it has come to
[03:52:11.040 --> 03:52:17.560]  and these people these radical leftists whether it's the the LGBT mad medicine
[03:52:17.560 --> 03:52:23.560]  you know Frankenstein experiment people or whether it's you know taboo in in
[03:52:23.560 --> 03:52:29.560]  Congress or whether it's Maxine mad Maxine any of these they have reached a
[03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:36.560]  level of mental illness and derangement and cruelty and evil upon humanity that
[03:52:36.560 --> 03:52:43.360]  they are worse than a cancer on our world they are an evil they are pure evil
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:49.400]  unleashed like slobbering demons running around just destroying all life
[03:52:49.400 --> 03:52:53.760]  destroying society turning everything that used to be abundance and and life
[03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:57.960]  turning it into death and suffering murdering the babies after they're born
[03:52:57.960 --> 03:53:05.360]  infanticide and then celebrating it and and physically maiming disfiguring young
[03:53:05.360 --> 03:53:09.000]  girls and young boys with their transgenderism experiments and and
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:15.520]  brainwashing and indoctrination this is a war for humanity and I think by the
[03:53:15.520 --> 03:53:19.600]  way this is my opinion the sooner President Trump declares this war
[03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:24.800]  against these life-destroying America hating leftists the sooner he just
[03:53:24.800 --> 03:53:28.720]  declares the war and just sends out the military police arrest all these
[03:53:28.720 --> 03:53:32.840]  traitors arrest these these gun grabbers in Oregon by the way I need to talk
[03:53:32.840 --> 03:53:37.600]  about that for a second the sooner Trump declares it the better and I just want
[03:53:37.600 --> 03:53:41.520]  President Trump to know that we the people are with you if you need a hundred
[03:53:41.520 --> 03:53:45.920]  armed citizens to support every military police person that you send out to make
[03:53:45.920 --> 03:53:51.720]  arrests just say the word because the people the people are ready the people
[03:53:51.720 --> 03:53:59.840]  are out they're out of patience they're ready to get it done on gun control in
[03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:05.200]  Oregon they're about to pass a law now that would criminalize you for locking
[03:54:05.200 --> 03:54:09.240]  up your guns criminalize you for not locking up your guns turn you into a
[03:54:09.240 --> 03:54:12.960]  felon if you drive near a public building with a firearm in your vehicle
[03:54:12.960 --> 03:54:16.760]  send you to prison for five years for picking up a friend or a family member
[03:54:16.760 --> 03:54:21.160]  at an airport if you are a concealed carry person you'll be a criminal if you
[03:54:21.160 --> 03:54:26.920]  have ever built a firearm at home ever you if you put together an AR-15 from a
[03:54:26.920 --> 03:54:31.520]  from a lower receiver or you've drilled out an 80% lower using a ghost gun or
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:35.720]  you will be a criminal you'll be a criminal if someone steals your gun you'll
[03:54:35.720 --> 03:54:40.360]  be a criminal if you own a firearm that's so old that it never had a serial
[03:54:40.360 --> 03:54:48.560]  number on it the Oregon Democrats have become lawless traitors and tyrants and
[03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:54.480]  I never advocate for violence I always call for lawfulness following the law
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:57.840]  but follow the Constitution as well but even then I think it's only a matter of
[03:54:57.840 --> 03:55:04.240]  time before the citizens probably rise up in Oregon to defend their liberties
[03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:09.680]  against these tyrants who are anti-gun criminals these are traitors in Oregon
[03:55:09.680 --> 03:55:15.120]  every liberal every Democrat that votes for this is a traitor actually it
[03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:19.080]  doesn't matter what party they are a part of they are traitors they are
[03:55:19.080 --> 03:55:23.280]  violating the Second Amendment and they should be removed from office I said the
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:26.760]  other day we should have blue flag laws in America you know how red flag laws
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:31.880]  take away firearms from law-abiding citizens without any due process no no
[03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:35.960]  court hearing nothing I mean no no right to defend yourself in a court they
[03:55:35.960 --> 03:55:40.040]  just say oh it's come take away your guns at gunpoint well I think we need
[03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:47.000]  blue flag laws to remove traitors from power how about blue flag laws to remove
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:50.880]  mayors and governors from power if they declare their cities or states to be
[03:55:50.880 --> 03:55:56.560]  sanctuary regions that's lawlessness they should be removed from power how
[03:55:56.560 --> 03:56:01.000]  about we remove from power anybody who votes to take away your Second Amendment
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:05.800]  rights they should be removed from power and every judge that makes a decision
[03:56:05.800 --> 03:56:09.720]  that opposes your constitutional rights should be removed from power we need
[03:56:09.720 --> 03:56:14.120]  blue flag laws now that'll probably never happen but it's a concept that's
[03:56:14.120 --> 03:56:18.800]  important to get out there we need to take this country back and we want to do
[03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:22.200]  it under law under the rule of law that's why what William Barr is doing
[03:56:22.200 --> 03:56:26.440]  right now is very important he's gonna go after some of these deep state people
[03:56:26.440 --> 03:56:30.080]  and yes some of them are going to go to prison as they should the longer their
[03:56:30.080 --> 03:56:34.240]  terms the better but it's just the beginning the lawlessness of the left
[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:40.240]  is nationwide they are violating rules violating laws lying cheating stealing
[03:56:40.240 --> 03:56:43.640]  committing vote fraud everything fabricating evidence did you see the
[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:48.400]  recent report about in fact they were fabricating evidence against Kavanaugh
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:52.360]  something just came out on that today as well it's insane and it's got to be
[03:56:52.360 --> 03:56:56.520]  stopped this is a matter of life and death now for the future of human
[03:56:56.520 --> 03:57:01.680]  civilization so I say the sooner Trump declares war on all those who are
[03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:06.520]  enemies of America including domestic enemies the better will be it's time to
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:11.560]  fight to defend America to defend the rule of law let's pray for peace but
[03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:16.120]  let's not put up with these assaults on our country from the radical left that
[03:57:16.120 --> 03:57:21.040]  hates America and that wants to bring communism in time to stop them and we
