[00:00.000 --> 00:19.680]  I can see in the aftermath of the crisis people are very, very concerned about the United
[00:19.680 --> 00:21.920]  States relationship with China.
[00:21.920 --> 00:28.680]  There's in other words of a second Bretton Woods, but it's not on the cards yet and
[00:28.680 --> 00:35.360]  I think this is where we have to work on the intellectual structure of such a deal.
[00:35.360 --> 00:45.960]  And so this is a breathtaking step which effectively nationalizes or federalizes the deposit base
[00:45.960 --> 00:47.360]  of the U.S. financial system.
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.160]  Look, the bottom line is this, Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe.
[00:53.160 --> 00:56.720]  Mr. President, what do you know right now about why this happened and can you assure
[00:56.720 --> 00:58.960]  Americans that there won't be a ripple effect?
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.920]  Do you expect other banks to fail, Mr. President?
[01:01.920 --> 01:03.760]  Should all depositors be protected at all banks?
[01:03.760 --> 01:11.480]  What I do want to do is emphasize that the American banking system is really safe and
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.480]  well-capitalized.
[01:12.480 --> 01:13.480]  It's resilient.
[01:13.480 --> 01:22.360]  But I do agree that the system is breaking it out and one of the major reasons, not the
[01:22.360 --> 01:27.920]  only reason obviously, but one of the major reasons is that you don't have good corporate
[01:27.920 --> 01:28.920]  leadership.
[01:28.920 --> 01:29.920]  So you say, so what?
[01:29.920 --> 01:31.440]  But I'll tell you, so what?
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.600]  If you don't have good corporate leadership in companies, yeah, with the tide is high
[01:35.600 --> 01:37.760]  and things are great, it doesn't matter.
[01:37.760 --> 01:42.000]  And all these guys that run these companies are partying and having a good time and giving
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  themselves bonuses.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.960]  I'm Scott Shea, Chairman of Signature Bank and it is a pleasure for me to welcome you
[01:48.960 --> 01:56.320]  to this multi-media, multi-casted, multi-spatial meeting of the Pride Council.
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.440]  CNN, ABC News, the BBC, they're like, it's over, all the banks are collapsing, run for
[02:02.440 --> 02:04.440]  the hills, bigger than 2008.
[02:04.440 --> 02:08.120]  Don't worry though, we've got central bank digital currencies there and we're going
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.040]  to save you with these because they're going to have a new system.
[02:12.040 --> 02:15.200]  They haven't told us yet, but you know it's central bank digital currency, they've been
[02:15.200 --> 02:17.200]  prepping it, they've been getting it ready.
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.600]  They are artificially like they locked down our houses, locked down our businesses, locked
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.160]  us down in the last few years and imploded the third world with two plus years of lockdowns.
[02:26.160 --> 02:30.720]  They're now getting a new one ready, just cutting off liquidity in the market.
[02:30.720 --> 02:34.400]  But the Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates five, six times last year.
[02:34.400 --> 02:39.560]  If they don't cut them now, you know they're deliberately trying to put the economy into
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.560]  cardiac arrest and the central private banks are not going to prop up the regional and
[02:43.560 --> 02:49.760]  local banks and credit unions so they all go down and they can bring in the central bank
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.320]  digital currencies, the centralized system that totally controls every fast year life.
[02:55.320 --> 03:03.040]  In fact, the controller of the currency nominee in the first year of the Biden administration
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.640]  literally proposed in an article from Vanderbilt that the beautiful thing about having CBDCs
[03:08.640 --> 03:12.760]  is if you're worried about inflation, you just freeze everybody's bank accounts.
[03:12.760 --> 03:17.400]  The important thing to understand is central bank digital currencies are not currencies.
[03:17.400 --> 03:19.600]  It's a financial transaction control grid.
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.040]  They've got all the C central bank digital currencies ready.
[03:23.040 --> 03:25.120]  They've got the central currencies ready.
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.280]  This is a historic moment, ending Bretton Woods bringing in a global consortium run
[03:30.280 --> 03:36.440]  by the UN, run by the big central banks to bring in a new global set standard in international
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.640]  polls and national polls upwards of 90% of people don't trust the government and don't
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.640]  like it.
[03:42.640 --> 03:46.200]  This illegitimate system does not have the people's support.
[03:46.200 --> 03:55.080]  It's a very strange time where I don't think people have a lot of faith right now in institutions.
[03:55.080 --> 03:59.600]  So I think there's a feeling of chaos that exists today that I don't think has ever
[03:59.600 --> 04:01.560]  existed in my life like this before.
[04:01.560 --> 04:06.560]  See people to judge, Kamala Harris and Biden can't get a sentence out.
[04:06.560 --> 04:07.920]  This is madness.
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.440]  These people are utter fools and these are the people that are running everything.
[04:12.440 --> 04:14.520]  But why is that being done?
[04:14.520 --> 04:19.960]  Because Kamala Harris and Barack Obama's third administration or Biden are puppets,
[04:19.960 --> 04:27.000]  fall guys to take the fall, which I told you two plus years ago.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.560]  You don't understand our so-called elites are like an idiot robbing a gun store.
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.520]  Starting a war, a kinetic war, nuclear wars where it's going with Russia is equivalent
[04:36.520 --> 04:43.400]  of robbing a gun store at noon when you've got five employees armed who are trained retired
[04:43.400 --> 04:44.400]  police officers.
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.400]  You're dead.
[04:45.400 --> 04:55.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, one hell of a broadcast line up for you today.
[04:55.400 --> 05:00.960]  You do not want to miss it.
[05:00.960 --> 05:04.920]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world, the globalist
[05:04.920 --> 05:09.120]  are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives
[05:09.120 --> 05:14.440]  to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless
[05:14.440 --> 05:15.440]  others.
[05:15.440 --> 05:19.240]  So please pray for us now more than ever, spread the word about the broadcast and get

[06:26.520 --> 06:31.920]  Remember, all of you that are listeners and viewers, particularly those that have been
[06:31.920 --> 06:36.320]  listening for decades, have been vindicated in a royal flush.
[06:36.320 --> 06:41.880]  It's our world, all over the planet, all people talk about is the new world order, global
[06:41.880 --> 06:52.560]  government, central banks, tract currencies, forced injections, robots, human animal chimeras.
[06:52.560 --> 06:55.760]  It's all here, it's all going down, it's all happening.
[06:55.760 --> 07:02.400]  Now, a very smart gentleman who's been just as prescient as I have on many fronts, who's
[07:02.400 --> 07:06.880]  a fellow that's worked for some of the biggest banks and financial institutions out there
[07:06.880 --> 07:09.080]  and is a well-known stock picker.
[07:09.080 --> 07:13.880]  Edward Dow will be joining us for the full second hour to talk about the banking crisis
[07:13.880 --> 07:19.240]  and the latest on the globalist war using COVID and COVID shots against the American
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.240]  people.
[07:20.240 --> 07:23.280]  Lots of them will be co-hosting.
[07:23.280 --> 07:29.440]  In the fourth hour today, 2 to 3 p.m. ahead of the war room with the great Owen Schreuer.
[07:29.440 --> 07:33.520]  So here's where we're at.
[07:33.520 --> 07:37.120]  We can sit here and talk about World War III, we can sit here and talk about the rollout
[07:37.120 --> 07:40.800]  of the central bank digital currencies, we can sit here and talk about the totally imploded
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.400]  borders and testimony in Congress by the board of patrol that there is no border and it's
[07:44.400 --> 07:47.160]  completely lawless, but we already know that.
[07:47.160 --> 07:53.160]  Or we can talk about the people running it and just how psychotically evil they are and
[07:53.160 --> 07:59.720]  how it's not debatable and how could anyone go along with the globalist.
[07:59.720 --> 08:02.640]  And so we're going to cover it all today.
[08:02.640 --> 08:08.480]  And the Russian jets dumping fuel on the drone and then saying it's an accident and all the
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.480]  rest of it.
[08:09.480 --> 08:11.880]  We're going to get to all of it.
[08:11.880 --> 08:17.120]  China's new smart religion app forces believers to register with communist regime before attending
[08:17.120 --> 08:18.120]  services.
[08:18.120 --> 08:21.720]  What do you think the 501C3 is in this country?
[08:21.720 --> 08:26.640]  It's that, but it's now intensifying to the market of the beast.
[08:26.640 --> 08:29.800]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.600]  But the first thing I want to hit is something that everybody talks about, but we don't talk
[08:33.600 --> 08:39.640]  about enough really, because it's so illustrative of who's running things.
[08:39.640 --> 08:45.320]  Canada and other Commonwealth countries like the UK and Australia and New Zealand are the
[08:45.320 --> 08:48.760]  models of the new world order tyranny.
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.520]  China is the main testing ground, but the model in the West is Commonwealth nations who have
[08:53.520 --> 08:56.000]  great people living in them, great culture.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.960]  But because of the power of the people and the power of their influence and the power
[09:00.960 --> 09:07.400]  of the inventions of those people, leading the Renaissance, creating America in the last
[09:07.400 --> 09:15.120]  500 years, the people that were able to hijack the British Empire in 1815.
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.000]  With the stock market crash at the Battle of Waterloo instituted by the Rothschilds
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.920]  on record, once they fully captured the British Empire, they had the most powerful institution
[09:23.920 --> 09:28.080]  on earth behind them and their evil plan.
[09:28.080 --> 09:36.000]  And now we're living in this project of the criminal groups that have hijacked the British
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.440]  Empire.
[09:37.440 --> 09:43.320]  And that's really the full system and that's the dominant system on the earth that is so
[09:43.320 --> 09:45.360]  incredibly wicked.
[09:45.360 --> 09:51.800]  And so when we look at places like Canada and Australia, where first they said we're
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.760]  going to legalize assisted suicide, that was decades ago, then they say now we're going
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.960]  to have the state push suicide and basically tell people you got to be killed, you're weighing
[10:01.960 --> 10:02.960]  on society.
[10:02.960 --> 10:08.280]  And then they say even if you're depressed or mentally ill, even though you're not cognitively
[10:08.280 --> 10:13.280]  able to make that decision, the state's going to decide to kill you because the state is
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.960]  your guardian or your ward, a total violation of the oath of Hippocrates or the Hippocratic
[10:20.960 --> 10:22.200]  Oath.
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.880]  And then now as you know, last year and this year, they have normalized it and put out
[10:25.880 --> 10:32.880]  policy reports, not a law, not trying to pass a law, to kill children and say the children
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.840]  have the right under state control to be killed by the state.
[10:38.840 --> 10:46.000]  So you extrapolate out transgenderism, hormone blockers, surgical mutilation, all of that
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  is about depopulation.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.040]  If they can't kill you in the womb, they want to kill your fertility after, which is
[10:51.040 --> 10:54.120]  the equivalent of killing him.
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.800]  And now they're openly pushing and now have test cases of where despite there's no parental
[10:59.800 --> 11:05.200]  consent, children will be taken by the state and children will be killed.
[11:05.200 --> 11:11.880]  Every day I see videos out of the UK and out of New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the same
[11:11.880 --> 11:21.480]  policy, same groups, arresting preachers that peacefully protest 100 yards away from a government
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.760]  building, in the case of Canada, the latest video, where they're trying to pass a law
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.360]  to have the state take over children and be able to sterilize them again with no parental
[11:31.360 --> 11:33.360]  oversight.
[11:33.360 --> 11:39.280]  So this is tyranny, it's as bad as it gets, it has nothing to do with the freedom of children,
[11:39.280 --> 11:41.880]  it's absolute evil.
[11:41.880 --> 11:49.080]  And now the last new sacrament is we've got to let the state kill children if they're
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.200]  depressed.
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.040]  So first they drug us, and all the statistics show the drugs on average cause more depression,
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.160]  more suicide, more mental problems.
[12:01.160 --> 12:05.160]  And now they move on to sterilization and then now they move on to flat out killing
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.160]  children.
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.080]  And you see all the cases coming out in the news with the national post defending it,
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.120]  in some cases actually being against it, there's still some debate going on, some vapors of
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.920]  sanity left in the gas tank, and they say, well really should we be killing children
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.360]  just because they're depressed, should we get them into sports, should we, you know,
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.200]  give them attention, should we get them counseling, no, let's just kill them.
[12:29.200 --> 12:37.160]  So now we're to the point in the pilot countries for a global rollout to kill children because
[12:37.160 --> 12:39.680]  they're depressed.
[12:39.680 --> 12:45.000]  And they have all these studies out, another one came out yesterday, that lack of exercise
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.960]  and a sedentary lifestyle creates depression and creates neurological disorders because
[12:50.960 --> 12:55.680]  you're not meant to have robots picking your crops and robots cooking your dinner and robots
[12:55.680 --> 13:02.000]  cleaning out the cat box and robots cleaning the garage and robots changing the baby's diaper.
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.800]  So you can stick your head into a digital bag called VR.
[13:11.800 --> 13:18.800]  So everything they're pushing creates depression, creates loneliness, creates despair, creates
[13:18.800 --> 13:19.800]  pain.
[13:19.800 --> 13:24.500]  Every policy of the new world order is to do that.
[13:24.500 --> 13:30.960]  Their whole mission is disorder to sabotage civilization, to collapse civilization into
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.760]  their technocracy new world order system.
[13:36.760 --> 13:41.480]  So anyone going along with the system is in a death call.
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.560]  And I believe in humanity, and I believe in humanity sees what we're facing.
[13:45.560 --> 13:52.040]  We can transcend it, but nationalist, populist, conservatives, Christians, pro-humans, pro-common
[13:52.040 --> 13:57.840]  sense, pro-human future individuals, whatever you want to call us together, every race,
[13:57.840 --> 14:05.940]  color, and creed, we have to cut to the chase and stop fighting all the heads of the Hydra.
[14:05.940 --> 14:14.160]  And we have to go directly to the fact that this technocracy, this mad scientist elite
[14:14.160 --> 14:21.280]  who are by the way very occultic, are bad people and have sold out to a very dark twisted
[14:21.280 --> 14:25.880]  force whose mission is to bring down our species.
[14:25.880 --> 14:27.520]  So look at these headlines.
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.400]  Canadian panel pushes the system to a side for minors without parental consent.
[14:32.400 --> 14:34.880]  Canada steps closer to euthanizing children.
[14:34.880 --> 14:37.680]  Panel says sick kids should have suicide rights.
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.080]  See, it's not just the rights to have sexual adults.
[14:41.080 --> 14:42.080]  That's just the beginning.
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.120]  Now it's, you want to die, don't you?
[14:44.120 --> 14:45.280]  It's cute.
[14:45.280 --> 14:48.760]  We know that since it started in the year 2000, they even had a 2020 special on it decades
[14:48.760 --> 14:55.560]  ago on ABC News that as soon as Colorado districts under a federal pilot program in the year
[14:55.560 --> 15:03.640]  2000, began these so-called suicide classes and these classes on dying where they would
[15:03.640 --> 15:10.120]  lock kids in lockers and roll them up in sleeping bags, now people sit on top of them to learn
[15:10.120 --> 15:14.120]  what it's like to die and they teach little girls, this is how you commit suicide so don't
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.920]  do it, don't put your shoelaces around your neck and go in to the coat hanger in the urinal
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.280]  or in the stall and hang yourself, well you've introduced that idea and now the little girls,
[15:25.280 --> 15:30.240]  when they're depressed, don't just harm themselves with knives, there was a rash of little girls
[15:30.240 --> 15:32.200]  and there still is committing suicide.
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.720]  They're teaching you you're a victim, they're teaching you the only way out of death.
[15:36.720 --> 15:41.240]  The psychology they teach in the military isn't to help the troops with PTSD, it's to teach
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.120]  them to be weak and kill themselves, it's all a plan destroying our life force, with
[15:47.120 --> 15:50.880]  the backdrop there's too many humans, humans are bad, get rid of humans, save the earth,
[15:50.880 --> 15:54.440]  so you wonder why suicide is so high on the youth in other areas, is they're teaching
[15:54.440 --> 16:00.040]  us that we're bad, so be a hero, kill yourself.

[19:08.080 --> 19:13.360]  United States, he doesn't care, that's not his job, he's not the president of the United
[19:13.360 --> 19:17.680]  States, he's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[19:17.680 --> 19:25.880]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased, they must be opposed, autocrats only understand
[19:25.880 --> 19:30.560]  one word, no, no, no.
[19:30.560 --> 19:36.720]  Exactly, and that's why we say no to your vaccines, we say no to you shutting down our

[19:52.280 --> 20:01.080]  and we say no and we say no to your war.
[20:01.080 --> 20:26.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:26.480 --> 20:32.000]  We are back, you do not want to miss next hour, never doubt with the inside scoop on
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.120]  what's really happening with the accelerated worldwide banking collapse, back to what I
[20:36.120 --> 20:39.240]  was just saying.
[20:39.240 --> 20:45.360]  The globalists, the state wants the power for the state to kill children and if you go
[20:45.360 --> 20:52.880]  watch the famous movie The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston and others, they talk
[20:52.880 --> 20:59.120]  about when the movie starts, which is not just in the Jewish text, it's in the hieroglyphs
[20:59.120 --> 21:06.200]  carved from the time of Ramses I, Ramses II's dad and he's ordering the first born
[21:06.200 --> 21:12.400]  of the Israelites or the Jews to be killed, the first born males because there were too
[21:12.400 --> 21:19.800]  many of them, they wanted more girls that were controllable and in every culture they
[21:19.800 --> 21:25.960]  start killing children when the society collapses and so now here it is repeating again human
[21:25.960 --> 21:33.080]  sacrifice of children by the biomedical psychological combine and where are the mainline psychological
[21:33.080 --> 21:35.360]  associations coming out against us?
[21:35.360 --> 21:38.520]  In Europe, in the US, in Canada, all over the world, they're coming out saying this
[21:38.520 --> 21:44.920]  is good, we want assisted suicide children who are depressed and will be their guardians
[21:44.920 --> 21:50.440]  and will decide to kill them.
[21:50.440 --> 21:56.960]  California's passed laws where sex with children is not even illegal if it's consensual at
[21:56.960 --> 22:05.680]  age 11 or children at age 11 can decide to take a vaccine without criminal consent or
[22:05.680 --> 22:09.760]  you can give somebody HIV knowingly and it's not a felony.
[22:09.760 --> 22:16.160]  These are psychotic death cult operators who have hatred for everyone, they're evil, it's
[22:16.160 --> 22:20.800]  why they claim they're the liberals and they're the moral high ground and they'll decide
[22:20.800 --> 22:27.760]  all the issues.
[22:27.760 --> 22:34.280]  They want to play God and everything that comes out of them is destruction and pain
[22:34.280 --> 22:43.400]  and death and betrayal and annihilation and you look at how they've gotten the so-called
[22:43.400 --> 22:50.160]  intelligentsia through college to go along with this plan worldwide and to commit these
[22:50.160 --> 22:57.120]  massive crimes of the lockdowns and the mask and the poison shots and the blaming the therapeutics,
[22:57.120 --> 23:05.760]  talking the therapeutics and demonizing therapeutics, everything they do, the rolling out and authorization
[23:05.760 --> 23:09.200]  to use DU all over the world even though it's a death sentence for those that use it and
[23:09.200 --> 23:15.800]  those that are around it for millions of years.
[23:15.800 --> 23:25.120]  There is a force working to destroy the earth, not just humans, here's another headline,
[23:25.120 --> 23:31.400]  US offshore wind farm, given permit to harm hundreds of whales and thousands of dolphins,
[23:31.400 --> 23:38.320]  scientists have confirmed that they create low frequency harmonics that to the whales
[23:38.320 --> 23:46.400]  and dolphins and other marine mammals sounds like nails on a chalkboard turned up to a
[23:46.400 --> 23:55.400]  million in your ears and the animals just beat themselves in mass, do they care?
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.000]  No the globalists love it, they love killing everything, they don't want to just kill us,
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.560]  they want to kill the whole planet, they say carbon is evil, we are carbon, these people
[24:05.560 --> 24:14.480]  have declared war on what they are, it is a spiritual force, it is a drive, it is a command
[24:14.480 --> 24:17.400]  to kill, steal and destroy.
[24:17.400 --> 24:20.440]  Now we've got Edward Dowd joining us in the next hour but I'm going to open the phones
[24:20.440 --> 24:28.480]  up now on the subject of state sponsored suicide which is murder of the children and of others
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.360]  and what are we going to do about it?
[24:31.360 --> 24:38.080]  That subject, I'm going to take six, seven calls in the next two segments because I won't
[24:38.080 --> 24:41.640]  have time to take calls after that and then when Edward Dowd leaves us I'll open the
[24:41.640 --> 24:44.720]  phones up again but I'm not going to have people sit there on hold for an hour while
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.640]  he's on, we'll open the phones up again on other subjects and have a free-for-all in
[24:48.640 --> 24:51.240]  the third into the fourth hour.
[24:51.240 --> 25:01.640]  But the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539, now let me tell
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.280]  you some of the other stuff we've got coming up, smuggler deported more than 40 times caught

[25:16.360 --> 25:20.320]  Judge Andrew DePaulitano says that's criminal and the FBI agents should be arrested for
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.320]  what they did, instead they'll be rewarded.
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.520]  Canadian Foreign Minister calls for regime change in Moscow, assassination, super dangerous
[25:29.520 --> 25:30.520]  escalation.
[25:30.520 --> 25:35.800]  Professor uncovers the white supremacy of organized pantries, I'm not joking.
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.320]  White picket fences, organized homes, happy people is a symbol of racism.
[25:40.320 --> 25:44.680]  They want us all miserable folks, they want to depress us and control us.
[25:44.680 --> 25:51.280]  Rumors swirl over which Biden family member got 3 million CCP linked wire transfer, we
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.200]  know it was Hunter and then he gave 10% to the big guy.
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.280]  That is all coming up today.

[29:33.000 --> 29:40.120]  this years ago, years ago, Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second, you
[29:40.120 --> 29:45.080]  are one of the great thinkers of this, you are a martyr to the First Amendment, the
[29:45.080 --> 29:50.960]  government, beers, Alex Jones, that's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing
[29:50.960 --> 30:00.280]  their corporate worldwide tyranny.

[32:53.440 --> 33:01.320]  we didn't have them for sale but now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[33:01.320 --> 33:20.280]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's alex jones, from the
[33:20.280 --> 33:32.760]  globalist and all their minions hate this broadcast more than any other because we've
[33:32.760 --> 33:33.760]  got their number.
[33:33.760 --> 33:53.440]  It's not going to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen,
[33:53.440 --> 34:20.000]  it's going to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  And they're telling him that these are sick people, folks.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.120]  They don't want you to have value for anybody, including yourself.
[34:27.120 --> 34:30.760]  And now, they're saying they're going to kill children without parental consent.
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.200]  That's the logical extension of this.
[34:32.200 --> 34:33.720]  That's where this nightmare is going.
[34:33.720 --> 34:35.760]  That's the death panels for us all.
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.640]  I suggest Bill Gates should volunteer and lead by example before anybody else dies.
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.880]  Let's go on the quarter of the calls we received, Alex in FEMA Region 6.
[34:47.880 --> 34:48.880]  We're on the air.
[34:48.880 --> 34:49.880]  Go ahead.
[34:49.880 --> 34:53.840]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[34:53.840 --> 34:58.880]  With the assisted suicide, the Jesuits and their Knights of Malta Night Templar Freemasons,
[34:58.880 --> 35:05.240]  they want to kill off targeted populations with their Jesuit Malthusian model, and especially
[35:05.240 --> 35:06.240]  Protestants.
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.960]  And they don't want any of them to hear the gospel that the Lord Jesus Christ died for
[35:09.960 --> 35:14.240]  our sins and was buried and risen again, and upon our repentance will be born again in
[35:14.240 --> 35:15.240]  the Holy Spirit.
[35:15.240 --> 35:22.880]  So, you think the Jesuits are behind the worldwide eugenics movement?
[35:22.880 --> 35:27.000]  Are you saying Thomas Malthus was a Jesuit?
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.440]  Yes, sir.
[35:28.440 --> 35:29.440]  That's correct.
[35:29.440 --> 35:30.440]  What?
[35:30.440 --> 35:31.440]  Was he a Jesuit?
[35:31.440 --> 35:32.680]  Well, guys, look up.
[35:32.680 --> 35:35.000]  Was Malthus a Jesuit?
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  I didn't know that.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  Yes, sir.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.920]  And so, the Jesuits want to destroy the Protestant Reformation because first there was the Renaissance,
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.800]  but then came the Protestant Reformation and the Gutenberg Press, where the Bible was given
[35:48.800 --> 35:51.360]  into the hands of the common man.
[35:51.360 --> 35:54.840]  Before that, only the Catholic priests could read the Bible.
[35:54.840 --> 36:00.200]  And so, the Jesuit and the Black Pope, they want to bring us back to the Dark Ages, where
[36:00.200 --> 36:06.360]  only they have the knowledge and they want to hide salvation of the gospel.
[36:06.360 --> 36:11.720]  And so, we're all just trapped in Satan's system, his Roman Empire, which is...
[36:11.720 --> 36:14.320]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.680]  The federal government just put out a report saying Christians are the number one threat
[36:18.680 --> 36:22.320]  and they said conservative Catholics are the number one threat within that group.
[36:22.320 --> 36:27.280]  Why would the government put out a report going after conservative Catholics if the Jesuits
[36:27.280 --> 36:29.400]  were trying to kill everybody?
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.960]  Well, the Jesuits don't control all the Catholics yet, but they are trying to consolidate the
[36:35.960 --> 36:44.520]  Catholics into a new right movement that hates the Jews and wants to persecute, you know,
[36:44.520 --> 36:45.520]  particular people.
[36:45.520 --> 36:52.720]  Like, Hitler was a Jesuit and he modeled his SS after the Jesuit order, Him and Himmler.
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.940]  And so, this is Operation Paperclip in action that was done through what's called the Vatican
[36:57.940 --> 37:03.600]  rat lines, where they smuggled Nazis through Catholic churches to get here.
[37:03.600 --> 37:10.040]  Yeah, listen, I appreciate your call and I'm not a Catholic apologist, so I'm not Catholic,
[37:10.040 --> 37:13.040]  that's not my job.
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.560]  I really think when we say this one group runs everything, that's not fair.
[37:17.560 --> 37:20.720]  Hitler wasn't a cultist and did not like Christianity.
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.920]  He did want to control the Catholic Church to control Europe and Himmler did model the
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.840]  SS with their black uniforms and things on the Jesuits and wanted to basically take
[37:30.840 --> 37:35.920]  that over, actually read the writings of the Nazis on that subject.
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.480]  So I think part of what you say is true about Catholic Church helping get a lot of the Nazis
[37:40.480 --> 37:45.200]  out at the U.S. request into the United States, but I think it was a group effort and I don't
[37:45.200 --> 37:52.040]  think that I would blame Catholics in general for that or say that Adolf Hitler was a Christian
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.400]  or a Catholic, Adolf Hitler was an anti-Christian, a cultist on record.
[37:57.400 --> 37:58.800]  I appreciate your call.
[37:58.800 --> 38:01.800]  Evan in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[38:01.800 --> 38:04.360]  Hi Alex, pleasure to talk to you again.
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.480]  Hey, I wanted to say that I think it'd be a very smart thing to set aside a show where
[38:09.480 --> 38:15.360]  you actually dedicate it to Jesus and ask people and we pray because there's a lot of
[38:15.360 --> 38:19.680]  great listeners that believe in God and I know there's theological questions that come
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.720]  up in different things, but praying in the name of Jesus and getting people to agree
[38:25.720 --> 38:30.960]  with your wonderful audience might be the most powerful thing yet to be done on your
[38:30.960 --> 38:31.960]  show.
[38:31.960 --> 38:34.880]  Well, I mean, I do love God and we do pray to Jesus here on air.
[38:34.880 --> 38:40.000]  I open the phones up about suicide of children, the government killing children and that next
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.480]  level of evil, but I guess we're not going to talk about that.
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.280]  No, I'd love to, I'd love to and what I'm saying is I believe there is a lot of forces
[38:47.280 --> 38:54.760]  that are actually pushing at the same time, praying, humanists want kids to die, the homosexual
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.560]  lobby wants kids to die and what I think there's no doubt that it's in government documents
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.360]  that we've covered here on air that by the sixties, the university said we're going to
[39:04.360 --> 39:09.200]  push all these agendas to depopulate them and that's not, that's not a, it's not different
[39:09.200 --> 39:10.200]  groups.
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.040]  The leadership of all those groups are globalist pushing for depopulation.
[39:14.040 --> 39:17.400]  It doesn't mean that I hate someone because they're homosexual or I hate somebody because
[39:17.400 --> 39:21.560]  of this or that or Blair White because she would want, you know, it's transgender.
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.000]  I'm saying the agenda above it is very evil.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.960]  I completely agree and what I'm saying is, is that the, the elites above are taking the
[39:31.960 --> 39:37.560]  essentially the most fringe elements of all these different groups and bringing them together
[39:37.560 --> 39:40.360]  and highlighting almost, you know, their dysfunction.
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.520]  Yeah, they're making it a new right to be sterilized or kill yourself.
[39:44.520 --> 39:45.520]  Absolutely.
[39:45.520 --> 39:46.520]  I appreciate your call.
[39:46.520 --> 39:47.520]  Yeah.
[39:47.520 --> 39:50.920]  Let's talk to Robbie in Florida here on the air on assisted suicide now becoming forced
[39:50.920 --> 39:51.920]  suicide.
[39:51.920 --> 39:52.920]  Even of our children.
[39:52.920 --> 39:53.920]  Go ahead, Robbie.
[39:53.920 --> 40:01.880]  It's devastating to hear about, you know, what's going on in Canada with assisted suicide
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.880]  with those that are fighting a freshman or some type of health, you know, issue, but
[40:07.880 --> 40:14.320]  I think we're a little bigger issue of the assisted suicide in America, which is the
[40:14.320 --> 40:22.040]  Trump vaccine that killed my father about six months after he got the Pfizer vaccine.
[40:22.040 --> 40:27.840]  You know, that's been perpetrated on kids to the point to where, you know, one year
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.000]  old have the vaccine and they'll be dying a part of that soon.
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.280]  So I think that we need to get down to Mar-a-Lago and have a anti-vaccine process that we can
[40:37.280 --> 40:44.080]  talk about for years because Trump seems to think that he's got this vote in a bag for
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.280]  2024 and I don't see enough people pissed off if they're really, you know, passionate
[40:49.280 --> 40:54.640]  about this, this vaccine being that, you know, the one that kills everybody.
[40:54.640 --> 41:03.200]  Well, I hear you, sir, and I mean, we're just living in a system that is here to depopulate
[41:03.200 --> 41:04.200]  us.
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.320]  What do you think we do about this to stop it and just point out where this is all going?
[41:10.320 --> 41:11.320]  More protests.
[41:11.320 --> 41:15.520]  We've been scared into a corner by January 6 and every conservative has their tail between
[41:15.520 --> 41:16.520]  the legs.
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.320]  Meanwhile, family, friends are dropping dead.
[41:20.320 --> 41:21.560]  We're dead in the water now.
[41:21.560 --> 41:22.880]  We got to get back out of the streets.
[41:22.880 --> 41:28.160]  We got to have a protest in front of Mar-a-Lago calling out Trump, get him off the water cooler,
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.960]  whatever hell, interview that and talk about the shot is great, it's saving life.
[41:32.960 --> 41:33.960]  That's bullshit.
[41:33.960 --> 41:38.080]  My father's cremated and it's, you know, perpetrated by him.
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.600]  So let's, there's a grand scheme going on here, which we know there is.
[41:42.600 --> 41:47.000]  It seems like we got good cop and bad cop all behind the same agenda.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.200]  So I appreciate your call.
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.720]  You know, at the end of the day, the public's become lazy and ignorant and only cares about
[41:53.720 --> 41:54.720]  entertainment.
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.920]  It doesn't know how the world works and don't stand up for basic human rights and human
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.920]  liberties.
[41:59.920 --> 42:01.400]  And so we don't stand up for our rights.
[42:01.400 --> 42:03.920]  We all get run over.
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.920]  And so as Christ said, what you do to the least of me you've done to me suffer the little
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.720]  children under me, better you tie a millstone around your neck and throw the deepest sea
[42:12.720 --> 42:14.520]  than harm one of these.
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.080]  And then what do the globalists do?
[42:16.080 --> 42:20.320]  Harm the children, dumb them down, poison them, put them on Ritalin, put them on Prozac,
[42:20.320 --> 42:27.000]  put them on GMOs, give them poison shots, try to sterilize them, try to euthanize them.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.640]  That's what they're doing.
[42:28.640 --> 42:30.120]  That's who they are.
[42:30.120 --> 42:31.120]  That's their game plan.
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.520]  And so we have to stand up and we have to say no to it and we have to make it a central
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.760]  issue.
[42:37.760 --> 42:46.360]  We have to rebuke what is the left and understand it is a corporately funded amalgamation of
[42:46.360 --> 42:49.320]  dehumanization for the transhumanist.
[42:49.320 --> 42:53.920]  And this whole movement is a transhumanist, anti-God, anti-human system.
[42:53.920 --> 42:54.920]  We have to rally against it.
[42:54.920 --> 42:55.920]  We have to expose it.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.920]  We have to fight it.
[42:56.920 --> 42:57.920]  We'll be right back.
[42:57.920 --> 43:11.600]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.280]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.280]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[43:18.280 --> 43:24.960]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[43:24.960 --> 43:28.720]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[43:28.720 --> 43:32.240]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[43:32.240 --> 43:35.280]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[43:35.280 --> 43:36.280]  Years ago.
[43:36.280 --> 43:40.120]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[43:40.120 --> 43:42.600]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[43:42.600 --> 43:45.040]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[43:45.040 --> 43:50.320]  The government, deers, Alex Jones, that's why the globalists hate me is because I'm
[43:50.320 --> 44:00.280]  exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[44:00.280 --> 44:04.720]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[44:04.720 --> 44:08.480]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.840]  addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[44:12.840 --> 44:14.640]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[44:14.640 --> 44:16.520]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[44:16.520 --> 44:19.480]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.040]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again, I have info words to thank for that.
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.960]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[44:27.960 --> 44:33.200]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info
[44:33.200 --> 44:38.840]  words team and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips
[44:38.840 --> 44:44.160]  because Alex's whole mentality was go where the story is, go where the mainstream media
[44:44.160 --> 44:45.160]  refuses to.
[44:45.160 --> 44:49.520]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[44:49.520 --> 44:54.080]  helping American people and I really do credit Alex for, you know, living and filling that
[44:54.080 --> 45:00.160]  within me early on in my career.
[45:00.160 --> 45:04.520]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.360]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[45:08.360 --> 45:12.720]  addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[45:12.720 --> 45:14.520]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.360]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.400]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[45:19.400 --> 45:23.920]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again, I have info words to thank for that.
[45:23.920 --> 45:27.840]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[45:27.840 --> 45:33.080]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info
[45:33.080 --> 45:38.720]  words team and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips
[45:38.720 --> 45:44.040]  because Alex's whole mentality was go where the story is, go where the mainstream media
[45:44.040 --> 45:45.040]  refuses to feel.
[45:45.040 --> 45:49.360]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[45:49.360 --> 45:53.720]  helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for, you know, living and filling
[45:53.720 --> 46:00.040]  that within me early on in my career.
[46:00.040 --> 46:05.080]  I'm a huge believer in information I watch for wars every day and following Alex Jones
[46:05.080 --> 46:06.080]  closely.
[46:06.080 --> 46:07.080]  You know why?
[46:07.080 --> 46:11.280]  He can push ahead of the curve and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.280]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two, imagine being
[46:15.280 --> 46:20.360]  like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[46:20.360 --> 46:23.320]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[46:23.320 --> 46:24.320]  This is reality.
[46:24.320 --> 46:26.480]  It just can't get through.
[46:26.480 --> 46:28.760]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[46:28.760 --> 46:32.680]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming and when it comes time, you people are going
[46:32.680 --> 46:33.680]  to be brought to punishment.
[46:33.680 --> 46:34.680]  You're lying to the public.
[46:34.680 --> 46:35.680]  It's disgusting.
[46:35.680 --> 46:39.400]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[46:39.400 --> 46:42.480]  You may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[46:42.480 --> 46:48.200]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks,
[46:48.200 --> 46:50.200]  the biggest megaphone in the country.
[46:50.200 --> 46:58.280]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing, the things that matter.
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.040]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[47:01.040 --> 47:17.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.320 --> 47:18.640]  We are back live.
[47:18.640 --> 47:22.600]  I looked into Malthus, the father of Malthusian depopulation.
[47:22.600 --> 47:24.920]  I can't find anywhere where he's a Catholic.
[47:24.920 --> 47:28.520]  He went to Oxford, which is Anglican.
[47:28.520 --> 47:29.520]  So there you go.
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.120]  I just hear this stuff and I'm just like, what?
[47:33.120 --> 47:38.440]  Regardless, there's a New World Order system that's permeating everything that wants to
[47:38.440 --> 47:39.440]  get rid of human life.
[47:39.440 --> 47:42.440]  And I understand I bring up assisted suicide or forced suicide.
[47:42.440 --> 47:47.040]  People call it a religious issue or a spiritual issue, and that's fine.
[47:47.040 --> 47:48.720]  There is that major aspect to it.
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.400]  But what I'm saying is the New World Order wanting to make us commodities and see each
[47:53.400 --> 47:59.240]  other as worthless so nobody stands up for each other and how this is a culture of death,
[47:59.240 --> 48:01.640]  and obviously that's a spiritual issue.
[48:01.640 --> 48:04.440]  I just spent the first 30 minutes before I took calls saying that.
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.520]  I'm talking about how evil these people are, even from a non-religious view, but they want
[48:09.520 --> 48:12.960]  to kill children and how they say there's too many of us.
[48:12.960 --> 48:16.320]  We should be against this.
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.520]  But they have these selfish people that serve the system.
[48:20.520 --> 48:24.000]  They really believe if we kill a bunch of people, they'll get more.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.120]  Or, oh, cities are too big.
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.920]  That's why we have so much as we have cities and all these groups of people together developing
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.040]  and building things and dreaming of things and wanting things.
[48:36.040 --> 48:38.360]  They're telling you, oh, no, no, you shouldn't go on vacation.
[48:38.360 --> 48:39.360]  You shouldn't have a car.
[48:39.360 --> 48:40.480]  You shouldn't have an air conditioner.
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.840]  They're trying to get you to accept nothing, trying to get you to accept rolling over and
[48:45.840 --> 48:48.760]  dying and turning off your life force.
[48:48.760 --> 48:50.480]  They're really villainous people.
[48:50.480 --> 48:52.700]  We all know villains want to steal from you.
[48:52.700 --> 48:54.040]  Villains want to hurt children.
[48:54.040 --> 48:55.360]  Villains want to starve people.
[48:55.360 --> 48:56.660]  Villains want to spy on you.
[48:56.660 --> 48:57.660]  Villains want to control you.
[48:57.660 --> 49:01.760]  When you go down a checklist of corporate media and governments and systems, they are
[49:01.760 --> 49:04.800]  the worst people ever by any common sense.
[49:04.800 --> 49:06.600]  And suddenly, that's all being forgotten.
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.600]  And we're being told to just accept all these tyrannies as good.
[49:11.600 --> 49:12.600]  That's what I'm talking about.
[49:12.600 --> 49:16.520]  What do we do about the state saying they own our children?
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.640]  Oh, and they want to kill them.
[49:18.640 --> 49:22.400]  Christian in California on assistant suicide and what the public schools are pushing.
[49:22.400 --> 49:24.400]  Thanks for calling.
[49:24.400 --> 49:30.760]  Yes, hi, this is Alex.
[49:30.760 --> 49:32.920]  So you want to go on air and talk or?
[49:32.920 --> 49:33.920]  Yes.
[49:33.920 --> 49:34.920]  Hear me?
[49:34.920 --> 49:35.920]  Yeah, I'm sure did.
[49:35.920 --> 49:36.920]  Oh, sorry.
[49:36.920 --> 49:37.920]  I'm in the mountains of San Diego.
[49:37.920 --> 49:38.920]  I totally understand.
[49:38.920 --> 49:39.920]  It's great.
[49:39.920 --> 49:41.480]  Hey, just how are you doing today?
[49:41.480 --> 49:42.480]  Good.
[49:42.480 --> 49:43.480]  How are you?
[49:43.480 --> 49:44.480]  I'm all right.
[49:44.480 --> 49:47.560]  I'm just, you know, they're now officially saying they want to kill all the children.
[49:47.560 --> 49:49.120]  So just go ahead.
[49:49.120 --> 49:52.720]  I am a single mother of three children, one on the way cooking still.
[49:52.720 --> 49:54.240]  So I know exactly how this is.
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.800]  I fight with my family a lot about it, and I think being in public school, I have a hard
[49:59.800 --> 50:08.480]  time with that and being the kids being influenced by the kinds of things that they want to instill
[50:08.480 --> 50:11.720]  in our children, which is where it starts from the base.
[50:11.720 --> 50:14.320]  You want to start somewhere, that's where you do it.
[50:14.320 --> 50:21.920]  And I have a hard time with trying to get that word out because the public has made
[50:21.920 --> 50:27.040]  it so hard to fight even against your family, which is mainly what is happening and they're
[50:27.040 --> 50:34.520]  carrying families apart, which is singleizing us so we have no support system.
[50:34.520 --> 50:40.160]  And as a mother of three children, it is so scary and I don't want to have my kids in
[50:40.160 --> 50:46.120]  public school and my family, you know, breathes down my neck and my friends and all of it.
[50:46.120 --> 50:52.480]  And it is, it's hard to know what to do when they make it so that you have nobody to support
[50:52.480 --> 50:56.640]  you and assisted suicide.
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.800]  That's crazy what parent would even think that they could do that to their children
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.760]  for one.
[51:03.760 --> 51:08.720]  I don't, it's a scary world and it makes me wonder even having kids, but I know something
[51:08.720 --> 51:10.800]  my dad said a long time ago.
[51:10.800 --> 51:16.520]  He said, you can't think of it that way, God has a bigger plan and he is bigger than
[51:16.520 --> 51:17.520]  all of it.
[51:17.520 --> 51:18.520]  Well, you just said it.
[51:18.520 --> 51:23.840]  I mean, I played a couple of months ago, a clip of Paul Erlich, who's like the rock
[51:23.840 --> 51:29.960]  star leader of the New World Orderly Population Movement in 1970 on national TV saying, we're
[51:29.960 --> 51:34.840]  going to raise taxes and cut off the resources to the point where the average person can't
[51:34.840 --> 51:39.200]  afford to have children and that's our plan and we're going to destroy the family.
[51:39.200 --> 51:42.960]  We're going to discredit men and women, we're going to put all the women in the workforce
[51:42.960 --> 51:43.960]  to control them.
[51:43.960 --> 51:48.440]  They just sit up there and they admit it all and it's so nasty.
[51:48.440 --> 51:53.400]  But then meanwhile, those type of people have a bunch of kids and live in big houses and
[51:53.400 --> 51:54.640]  they've got money.
[51:54.640 --> 51:59.040]  They're literally training you to be a slave and acting like you having a life is bad.
[51:59.040 --> 52:05.600]  They are villainous, greedy, just horrible people that again, moral grandstand like
[52:05.600 --> 52:10.880]  they're in charge and we just bow down to them because they have unlimited central bank
[52:10.880 --> 52:11.880]  money.
[52:11.880 --> 52:14.640]  That's the only reason they can force feed all this.
[52:14.640 --> 52:15.640]  God bless you.
[52:15.640 --> 52:16.640]  I appreciate your call.
[52:16.640 --> 52:18.680]  Let's talk to Jason in Canada.
[52:18.680 --> 52:20.160]  Jason, you're on the air.
[52:20.160 --> 52:27.000]  Hey, so the book is called The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.640]  It's written by George, Anna and Michael Groden.
[52:30.640 --> 52:34.320]  Now, in it, there's a specific quote that I'm going to read.
[52:34.320 --> 52:36.040]  It's very quick.
[52:36.040 --> 52:41.520]  The whole spectrum of normal representatives of the medical profession was involved and
[52:41.520 --> 52:43.480]  they all knew what they did.
[52:43.480 --> 52:50.120]  A medical profession who accepts mass murder of sick people as a normality and to a large
[52:50.120 --> 52:57.680]  degree explicitly approved of it as a necessary justified act for the sake of community has
[52:57.680 --> 53:00.200]  failed and betrayed its mission.
[53:00.200 --> 53:05.320]  Such a medical profession as a whole has become morally guilty no matter how many members
[53:05.320 --> 53:11.400]  of the profession directly or indirectly participated in the killing of sick people in a legal
[53:11.400 --> 53:12.400]  sense.
[53:12.400 --> 53:14.560]  Well, you're right.
[53:14.560 --> 53:20.600]  The entire beginning of the Nazis when they got power in 33 was about killing sick people
[53:20.600 --> 53:23.040]  and setting the president to do that.
[53:23.040 --> 53:29.840]  And so this is very Nazi-esque what we're seeing.
[53:29.840 --> 53:30.840]  He dropped off.
[53:30.840 --> 53:31.840]  Okay.
[53:31.840 --> 53:32.840]  Great point.
[53:32.840 --> 53:34.280]  Well, I'm open to the phones up.
[53:34.280 --> 53:35.280]  Nick in Tennessee.
[53:35.280 --> 53:36.280]  Go ahead.
[53:36.280 --> 53:37.280]  You're on the air.
[53:37.280 --> 53:38.280]  Hello, Alex.
[53:38.280 --> 53:41.520]  This is Nick Anonymous of the Neo-Anonymous True Source on Substack.
[53:41.520 --> 53:42.520]  How you doing today?
[53:42.520 --> 53:43.520]  Go ahead, sir.
[53:43.520 --> 53:44.520]  Thank you for calling.
[53:44.520 --> 53:45.520]  Yeah.
[53:45.520 --> 53:52.440]  I wrote an article about this euthanasia back in December called the Soiling Green Agenda.
[53:52.440 --> 54:00.600]  And basically, I did a lot of research and analysis on this topic, the campaign Life Coalition
[54:00.600 --> 54:09.520]  in Canada revealed very recently that the doctors who were promoting assisted suicide,
[54:09.520 --> 54:16.680]  they wrote an article, I quoted, it says this, it says, Dr. Mirol Gradrell, I'm probably
[54:16.680 --> 54:21.360]  pronouncing that wrong, president of the Quebec College of Physicians is not only pushing
[54:21.360 --> 54:28.240]  for the infanticide of sick, deformed babies, but he's calling for euthanasia for sick children
[54:28.240 --> 54:32.280]  ages 14 and up.
[54:32.280 --> 54:38.320]  We told you about the Quebec infant infanticide proposal after Dr. Gradrell's colleague Dr.
[54:38.320 --> 54:43.240]  Lewis Roy addressed a federal parliamentary committee on October 8.
[54:43.240 --> 54:50.840]  More recently on November 18, Dr. Gradrell spoke to that same committee of MPs and senators
[54:50.840 --> 54:58.000]  where he repeated the demand for infanticide of sick and dead, dying and deformed babies
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.320]  and also added the demand for killing sick 14 to 17 year olds.
[55:03.320 --> 55:11.160]  So they want to basically not only kill children, they want to kill babies.
[55:11.160 --> 55:13.400]  They want to kill them when they come out of the womb.
[55:13.400 --> 55:14.400]  This is euthanasia.
[55:14.400 --> 55:19.880]  Well, you hear all the transgender cult saying we know when a baby's born and it's trans
[55:19.880 --> 55:26.680]  and they just put it into the shoot, into the road, into the database to be destroyed
[55:26.680 --> 55:27.680]  by the system.
[55:27.680 --> 55:31.560]  They call it a right and celebrate it everywhere when it's chemical sterilization, chemical
[55:31.560 --> 55:32.560]  concentration.
[55:32.560 --> 55:33.560]  What?
[55:33.560 --> 55:35.520]  I mean, just look at what we've become.
[55:35.520 --> 55:36.520]  Look what we've put up with.
[55:36.520 --> 55:43.080]  Those were worried about being criticized by the corporate media that 95, 94% of people
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.280]  hate, 92% of people hate Congress.
[55:46.280 --> 55:47.720]  The whole system's hated.
[55:47.720 --> 55:54.880]  No one supports it, but the little managerial class of professors and sociologists and psychologists
[55:54.880 --> 55:56.920]  in the minions of the system.
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.560]  That's all there is, is these people that signed on to this for a little bit of power.
[56:01.560 --> 56:04.160]  And they're all just the most disgusting people.
[56:04.160 --> 56:05.880]  It's disgusting.
[56:05.880 --> 56:07.240]  I wrote an article about this.
[56:07.240 --> 56:08.880]  I suggest everybody go read it.
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.560]  It's called the Fulminant Green Agenda.
[56:10.560 --> 56:16.000]  All right, on Substack, you can find my work at Nick Anonymous near now.
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.400]  No, it's probably pretty simple.
[56:17.400 --> 56:21.520]  You just go to Substack and put in the Fulminant Green Agenda, we'll pull it up, and I look
[56:21.520 --> 56:22.520]  forward to reading it.
[56:22.520 --> 56:23.520]  Thank you so much, sir.
[56:23.520 --> 56:24.520]  And I appreciate your call.
[56:24.520 --> 56:25.520]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.240]  No, well, I want to say you're absolutely right about the Nazi, that one caller who
[56:31.240 --> 56:33.320]  said about the Jesuits.
[56:33.320 --> 56:35.480]  That's not correct at all.
[56:35.480 --> 56:36.480]  You're absolutely right.
[56:36.480 --> 56:43.120]  The Nazis created a group called the Ananerbe, and the Ananerbe were an organization by the
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.680]  SS that Hitler created to study the occult.
[56:47.680 --> 56:57.080]  They were creating basically these crazy, insane agencies to investigate the occult
[56:57.080 --> 57:00.520]  and to go all over the world and study the occult.
[57:00.520 --> 57:01.640]  They were occultists.
[57:01.640 --> 57:03.920]  They were not the Nazis.
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.920]  Exactly, the founders of the Nazi party said they wanted to get rid of religion, period,
[57:09.920 --> 57:14.600]  and particularly Christianity, and wanted to go back to an occultic druidic-type animus
[57:14.600 --> 57:15.600]  system.
[57:15.600 --> 57:20.760]  But look, I'm not saying the Pope, when Mussolini was in control of Hitler, didn't go along
[57:20.760 --> 57:21.760]  with it.
[57:21.760 --> 57:24.280]  I'm not saying that they didn't take over the, you know, I'm not defending the Jesuits.
[57:24.280 --> 57:28.120]  It's just to say that Hitler was a Jesuit is not true.
[57:28.120 --> 57:29.120]  It's not true.
[57:29.120 --> 57:30.120]  So.
[57:30.120 --> 57:31.600]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[57:31.600 --> 57:35.680]  Hitler was a devil worshiper.
[57:35.680 --> 57:40.640]  Hitler was into the occult and dark mysticism.
[57:40.640 --> 57:43.240]  The Catholic Church helped get Nazis out?
[57:43.240 --> 57:44.240]  Absolutely.
[57:44.240 --> 57:45.240]  Because the U.S.
[57:45.240 --> 57:46.240]  Government asked them to.
[57:46.240 --> 57:47.240]  We'll be right back.
[57:47.240 --> 57:49.440]  Stay with us.
[57:49.440 --> 57:52.800]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[57:52.800 --> 57:57.600]  The globalist are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives
[57:57.600 --> 58:02.880]  to shut down info wars and other true tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless

[59:10.360 --> 59:15.880]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarstore.com
[59:15.880 --> 59:18.680]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[59:18.680 --> 59:22.280]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[59:22.280 --> 59:23.600]  That's great, I thank you.
[59:23.600 --> 59:27.680]  But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.720]  for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sleep bait and our nitric
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.960]  oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[59:33.960 --> 59:37.480]  All of these are really great products, they keep us on air, plus you're missing out on
[59:37.480 --> 59:38.480]  these products.
[59:38.480 --> 59:43.480]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infowarstore.com right
[59:43.480 --> 59:58.880]  now and get these great infowarstores products at infowarstore.com.
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:14.680]  If you think the awakening we've seen so far is big, this planet and the globalists have
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680]  not seen anything yet.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.680]  search results.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.680]  Google is evil.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:26.560]  We now take the challenge, not to censor like you do, but to stand against you and to fight
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:32.520]  even harder for our birthright that you are trying to steal.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.520]  Remember this, you killed your profession by becoming nothing but mercenaries for the
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.680]  globalist and people know that your fate knows many of you.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.880]  Now with you trying to kill the First Amendment, you're making yourself true villains.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.480]  You've declared war on the First Amendment, you've declared war on free speech.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.560]  Since when are hundreds of doctors unable to have press conferences in America when
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.720]  they take it off YouTube, they take it off Google, they take it off Twitter, they take
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.080]  it off Facebook, there is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.080]  on conservatives and a plan to deep platform conservatives from the internet and communicating
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]  with each other.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]  Just like communists.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080]  I'm here to expose this fraud.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.240]  I'm here, just like the Congress has here and stopped me, I go there and I get in their
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.760]  face and I expose the truth and that's what I'm going to do.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.840]  We had over 40 million subscribers on Apple, that was our biggest thing with my three podcasts.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840]  Those were all banned.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:41.040]  This is the most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.520]  I want you to get up now.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.960]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.680]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it and stick your head out and
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.680]  yell, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.480]  I want you to get up right now, stick your head out of the window, open it and stick
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.320]  your head out and keep yelling and yell, I'm as mad as hell, I'm not going to take this
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.320]  anymore.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:16.440]  Just get up from your chairs right now, go to the window, open it and stick your head
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:25.740]  out and yell, I keep yelling and yell, I'm as mad as hell, I'm not going to take this
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.720]  anymore.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.520]  I'm mad as hell, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.520]  I'm mad as hell! I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.520]  I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.520]  I'm mad as hell!
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:03:04.520]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:18.520]  As a young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of his government, are actually young nobilities of the world.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:28.520]  So if we penetrate the cabinets, the change is not just happening. The change can be shaped by us.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:36.520]  We have to prepare for a more angry world, how to prepare to take the necessary action to create the fair world.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:48.520]  I see the need for a great reset. So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.520]  This is, let's say, fiction. It will not happen.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:01.520]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go. It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:17.520]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.520]  Our society as a whole.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:33.520]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:05:06.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.520]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.520]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.520]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.520]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.520]  It does such great things to the body.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.520]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:32.520]  It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.520]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at infillwarstore.com.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.520]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.520]  And while you are at it, check out the new ashwagandha line of products.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:51.520]  We have ashwagandha with black pepper extract, fear libido, your testosterone in pill form and we have the pure ashwagandha root gummies as well.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520]  Now available at infillwarstore.com.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.520]  They are amazing products and they fund the infill war.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:16.520]  Take action now at infillwarstore.com.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:26.520]  All right. He, two and a half years ago, began predicting what is now unfolding.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:31.520]  Edward Dowd is our guest for the hour. Dowd, Lord on Twitter.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.520]  Edward Dowd on Getter.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.520]  And I really appreciate him joining us.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.520]  He is a former Wall Street professional with HSBC and BlackRock as well as other groups.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.520]  He worked all over Wall Street, sell side by side, expert in fixed income and equities capital markets.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.520]  He's currently exposing the new world order.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:58.520]  He came on a couple of years ago and said soon I'll bring out big insurance company whistleblowers that are going to show a massive increase in death around the world.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:08.520]  Now those numbers have been confirmed by governments and other insurance companies and he's delivered the last year the whistleblowers to congressional and state hearings and other hearings.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:24.520]  As he said he would do, he has a lot of credibility, not just for his predictions, but also delivering these huge whistleblowers similar to what attorney Renz and others have done.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.520]  So he's here with us to cover two subjects that are obviously intertwined.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.520]  The banking crisis, what's really behind it.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.520]  The question will go faster, slow.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.520]  They now admit it's about central bank digital currencies.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:45.520]  They now admit, I've got the quotes here all over the news, you know, here's Kevin O'Leary on Fox, that it's a transition going to be occurring for a new banking system.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:52.520]  And then how that ties into the whole depopulation program to get rid of the useless feeders in the establishment's view.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:56.520]  Canada said they're going to euthanize children without parental consent, even healthy children.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:03.520]  I mean, this is a real death cult, but humanity's rallying and fighting against it as bad as it is.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.520]  The system admits, they think they're getting their ass kicked.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.520]  I'm not saying we're winning, but we're definitely in the fight.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:15.520]  The hottest issues in the world are the new world order, the central bank digital currencies, the poison shots, the depopulation.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.520]  So at least if we're going down, we're not going down without a fight.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.520]  So Edward Dowd, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.520]  You've got the floor.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520]  Great to be here.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.520]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:33.520]  So look, bottom line, this started in 2019, there was a repo crisis overnight, lending rates exploded.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.520]  And the system was going to unwind then.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:45.520]  Then luckily for the system, COVID came along and allowed central banks and politicians to spend unprecedented amounts of money.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.520]  And that saved the system until now.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.520]  And what we're seeing going on was baked into the cake.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.520]  It was inevitable. It's a global sovereign debt collapse.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:02.520]  And in November of last year, we saw something happen that hasn't happened since 1930.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.520]  What is that?
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.520]  That's money supply, M2, year over year growth rate went below zero.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.520]  This is the fifth time it's happened.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:16.520]  And the other four times since 1868 were associated with financial panics.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.520]  And what preceded all those panics was a great inflationary speculative time.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.520]  The stock market went to new all-time highs in January of 22.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.520]  And so now we see what's going on.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.520]  And it's beyond everyone's control, the Fed, the governments.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.520]  So the question is, can they control the implosion?
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.520]  And I suspect they want to do it slow over time so they can grab power.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:45.520]  If it happens too quick, it's a kitty bar the door and then they lose control.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.520]  So I can't predict whether it's going to be fast or slow.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.520]  I think they're going to try for the slow route.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.520]  Now, I meant when I asked you to come on last week and took a few days to get you on.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.520]  I appreciate you coming on to tell our archivist who does a splendid job to go back
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.520]  the last three or four times you were on, you specifically predicted it.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.520]  And you were on, I think about three months ago, and you said you basically thought it was already beginning.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.520]  You were on about a month and a half ago.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.520]  It's the same thing, but listeners remember you said that.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.520]  How did you know that and extrapolate that out?
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:26.520]  Well, look, the central banking system is a multi-generational Ponzi scheme.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:34.520]  And it's basically a system that requires constant credit creation and constant flow.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.520]  It's not the money stock or the supply.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.520]  It needs constant growth.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.520]  And without that growth, it implodes.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.520]  It's been growing.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.520]  In 1913, we established the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.520]  We had one last panic in 1930, but we haven't had money supply go below zero since then.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.520]  We had World War II, which helped the system.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.520]  Then we had the de-linking from gold in the 70s, which gave it another breath of life.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:10.520]  And the dollar, the fiat currency world reserve system is in every corner of the world.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.520]  So there's really no place for the dollar to go anymore.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.520]  And now it implodes on itself.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.520]  So it's just math.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]  And here we are.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.520]  And the signposts are M2 going below zero.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.520]  And I put a tweet out about a month and a half ago.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.520]  I was tracking a set up, a multi-asset class set up.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.520]  It was bonds, the dollar, and stocks.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.520]  And it's triggered.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.520]  So it's just, it is what it is.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.520]  It's unavoidable.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:45.520]  The hope is that it's slow for all of us because that gives us more time to fight the powers that be
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.520]  and get to see the table.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.520]  If it goes quick, there'll be panic.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.520]  And I can't predict what happens then.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.520]  You broke this down a few years ago here on the show.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]  Why?
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.520]  And he wrote a book about it.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.520]  We'll talk about the book in a moment where you don't look at why.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.520]  You just look at what the facts are.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.520]  As a human, as a smart guy, you can talk about clearly the reason here.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.520]  Not just to create a bunch of new money and trillions to be able to pump out and prop themselves up,
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.520]  but also the obsession with being able to get rid of large groups of people.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.520]  How do they think that helps them?
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:28.520]  Because Elon Musk says, no, we need 2.1 humans for every group out there,
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.520]  or we won't produce an infrastructure for the future,
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  but the globalists want to collapse infrastructure.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  So are they trying to have a control collapse?
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.520]  And why do they fear a successful economy?
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.520]  I mean, why are they doing this?
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.520]  Well, so here's the thing.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.520]  It was going to collapse regardless of what anybody could do.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.520]  So again, I didn't put this in my book because it's opinion and speculation.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:59.520]  My book just basically details the horrific crime of the mRNA vaccines
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.520]  and that it is what it is and it's happening.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.520]  But here's my opinion.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:10.520]  COVID was a very clever way of introducing a control system.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.520]  Let's say if they were completely successful and they haven't been in the US,
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.520]  but other countries they are, you shut down the ability to travel,
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.520]  you shut down the ability to gather,
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.520]  you shut down the ability to communicate and you bring in censorship
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.520]  so everyone's confused and addled while the financial system collapses.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.520]  You can blame a virus and now we have wars coming, they'll blame those,
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.520]  but the bottom line is the system is collapsing
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.520]  and everything you see going on, in my humble opinion,
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.520]  lays at the feet of central bankers and politicians
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.520]  and they're going to do everything in their power to point the finger at something else
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.520]  and it's just the system is at its end and they want,
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.520]  and if you're in power and the system is going to collapse
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.520]  and you know it is and it can't be avoided,
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.520]  wouldn't it be nice to control that collapse
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.520]  and usher in a new system where you're on top?
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.520]  And it's a consolidation of wealth and power
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.520]  and it's not every oligarch that we see in the newspaper is in the club
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.520]  because a lot of these oligarchs unfortunately took the jab
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.520]  and they didn't get saline solution.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.520]  There are oligarchs that are freaking out
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:17.520]  because if you didn't get the memo on the COVID virus coming
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.520]  and the fact that the vaccine might harm you,
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520]  you're not in the club and there's lots of those people.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.520]  And that's key to explain because there's different compartmentalized power structures
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.520]  that don't trust the other groups even though they're still invested
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520]  in the same consortiums.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.520]  There's a lot of different overlapping factions here
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.520]  and I would say the dominant faction is the British Empire biomedical complex
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.520]  that owns the military, industrial complex, the banking complex,
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.520]  but there are major factions and groups that own portions of it
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.520]  who are not in that central group.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.520]  And there's more ChaiKom allied groups, there's Russia allied groups,
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.520]  there's some other rogue independent family groups,
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.520]  absolutely.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.520]  So many of the people even serving the system, their billionaires,
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.520]  have been given the money generationally and are basically useful idiots.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.520]  A lot of them left us who actually believe they're building a utopia
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.520]  when actually they're building the end of the world as we know it.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.520]  Yeah, what happened in Silicon Valley Bank was interesting.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.520]  I mean, basically the government just took over Silicon Valley in my estimation.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.520]  I mean, that won't be apparent for a while,
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.520]  but the government has now got their, they took over Wall Street
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.520]  and the Great Financial Crisis, now they took over Silicon Valley.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  And these people think that they're in control, but they're not.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.520]  All right, stay there, because I've seen some analysts say,
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.520]  this is not just a bailout, this is the beginning of nationalization of banks.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.520]  Correct.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.520]  Ever doubt, stay right there.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.520]  Let's talk about what this means for the average person, how we organize,
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.520]  you get a seat at the table, you're absolutely right, that's a perfect way of saying it.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.520]  This whole broadcast is about informing enough people to know how the world really works
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.520]  so we can actually go to the global to say, hey, we have a seat at the table.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.520]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.520]  that my dad, a retired dentist, an oral surgeon developed.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.520]  Dr. Jones Natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.520]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.520]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.520]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory,
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.520]  it does such great things for the body.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.520]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils,
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.520]  it is just dynamite.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.520]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.520]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste

[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.520]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.520]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming,
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.520]  and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.520]  You're lying to the public, it's disgusting.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.520]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.520]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.520]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country,
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:48.520]  bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:56.520]  We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:25.520]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.520]  So get your copy of the Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.520]  a signed copy at infowarstore.com.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.520]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.520]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.520]  you'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.520]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.520]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.520]  and get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies,
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.520]  and go to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.520]  This is an info war, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:38.520]  I don't say this to say, ooh, look, we got the New World Order scared, aren't we powerful?
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.520]  No, it's the opposite. That makes it even more dangerous.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.520]  This multi-generational, giant, globalist, money laundering Ponzi scheme
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:52.520]  that would make Bernie Madoff or Sam Bankman-free blush is coming to an end.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.520]  And so will they use them World War to cover it up?
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.520]  Will they use a cyber attack they claim brings down all the banking systems?
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:04.520]  Will they use a bank run? I keep saying that every day, and now here we are.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.520]  And we know they're nationalizing the banks. We know they're making this move.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.520]  So we just can't sit here dumbfounded watching this.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.520]  We have to be aware of it and have strategies to expose their agenda
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.520]  so we don't accept their solutions, which is giving the end of their Ponzi scheme
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.520]  an even bigger Ponzi scheme with these programmable digital currencies
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.520]  that track and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.520]  I mean, even try to quantify how bad these are is dizzying.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.520]  To ever doubt who's at the tip of the spear exposing this,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.520]  how do they extricate themselves?
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.520]  Because when I look at their body language, they look scared.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.520]  They know the public's woken up to them by and large.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.520]  They know they don't have any way to fix this anymore.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.520]  Studying history, what do you think they're going to do?
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.520]  And how do we stop them from doing something really reckless?
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.520]  Well, let's talk about the banks.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.520]  Right now, the regional banks are in trouble.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.520]  Why are they in trouble?
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.520]  And also the big banks are in trouble, but they're less risky
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.520]  because they're systemically important banks.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.520]  What happened was these banks drew zero interest rate policy
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.520]  for the better part of 13, 14 years.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.520]  We're forced to buy low interest rate bonds.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.520]  The deposits were at zero, so everyone's happy, fat, and lazy,
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.520]  making money clipping the spread between zero on your deposit
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.520]  and 1.5%, 2% on the bonds.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.520]  Well, interest rates have risen to 5% in less than a year,
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:38.520]  and they're now exposed to not credit risks this time.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.520]  Credit risk in the great financial crisis was bad bonds,
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.520]  bad fraudulent bonds all over the banking system.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.520]  This time, it's called duration or interest rate risk.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.520]  So they've lost a ton of money on the bonds as interest rates have risen.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520]  It's just a simple bond math.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520]  So they're kind of upside down.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520]  Their deposits are going the wrong way now.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:01.520]  So what I think is going to happen is all these regional banks
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.520]  are going to get into trouble, and then the Fed and the government
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.520]  will use that as an excuse to come in and nationalize them
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:13.520]  and or consolidate them into the six systemically important banks.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.520]  And that way, it's easier to introduce a central bank digital currency
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.520]  with only six or seven banks in the US.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.520]  So that, I think, whether it's a plan or that's what's going to happen,
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.520]  it doesn't matter, but that's the path I see.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.520]  Do you agree with me that we're at a major historic inflection point right now?
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.520]  Absolutely.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:39.520]  So I've been putting out tweets the last couple of weeks saying
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:44.520]  that the awakening is clicking along at a very fast pace.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:51.520]  And given my seat in this moment in time with my book on the mRNA vaccines
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.520]  and my talks about the financial system,
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:00.520]  over the last couple of weeks in my LinkedIn messaging system,
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:05.520]  executives from HSBC, major market strategists from Wall Street
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.520]  are saying, great job on your work. I agree with you.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.520]  So there seems to be a dawning of light over yonder,
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.520]  over some people's heads, that something is going on.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:22.520]  And you and I used to be called crazy and conspiracy theorists,
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:27.520]  but I have never seen so many credentialed conspiracy theorists in all my life
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.520]  now admitting that something is going on.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.520]  And these are people in the system who didn't realize what the system was doing to them.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.520]  Now they're waking up. And that's how we win.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.520]  We have a lot of these people that are useful dupes who are now waking up
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.520]  and they're mad and it's good.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.520]  And I think it's really because people know the shot is poisonous
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.520]  and that they did create the virus.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.520]  And people realize, well, it's one thing to be corrupt
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.520]  and go along with something to fix things and kind of rationalize it.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.520]  But when you know it's a Malthusian depopulation death cult you're in,
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.520]  you go, wait, I'm not in the cult.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.520]  And so there's kind of a learning curve that's exponential right now.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.520]  Yeah, absolutely. And I've been saying for months now,
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.520]  once Wall Street figures out they've been poisoned, they're going to be mad.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.520]  And there are people at the mid-level,
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.520]  some of the senior-level people who weren't in the club
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.520]  are starting to get awakened to the horrific tragedy that just occurred.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.520]  And let's talk about this depopulation thing.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.520]  I have no proof that there was a depopulation plan,
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.520]  but I like to look at facts.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.520]  At this point, given the excess mortality, the disabilities,
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.520]  we're going to release soon a report on absence rate and work-time loss.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.520]  So there's three buckets dead, disabled, and chronically sick.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.520]  Whether or not this was a plan, there is now a de facto depopulation going on.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.520]  Regardless of whether it was a plan or not, it's happening.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:56.520]  So we don't need to get into the debate about who or why it is.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.520]  So people need to be alerted to that.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.520]  And fertility rates are dropping.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.520]  We haven't done the work on that yet, but other people are doing the work.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520]  So this is a...
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520]  It's astronomical.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.520]  I mean, I saw a big Australian government report confirming insurance companies yesterday
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:15.520]  saying a 26% increase in mortality, the biggest increase ever in the last two years.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:22.520]  Yeah, so 10% as famously quoted by Scott Davidson, CEO of One American, January 22,
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.520]  he said, 10% is a once-in-a-200-year flood.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.520]  We've seen 40% excess mortality rates.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.520]  And I think the globe is currently running around 20% to 25% excess mortality
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.520]  in Western countries that have been vaccinated.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.520]  And that's a disaster.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.520]  And if this continues, we don't need to get into is there a depopulation plan?
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.520]  It's just a de facto depopulation.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.520]  It is.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.520]  And it's surreal to sit here and see governments admit that.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.520]  I mean, the biggest death rate ever.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:55.520]  And I guess what you're saying is the managerial class is going,
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.520]  wait, we were supposed to be part of this plan.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.520]  We were supposed to be like the Jetsons and bring in this liberal neural order.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.520]  Now they're finding out, no, it didn't like that.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.520]  No, it's not like that.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:11.520]  And the material here is so, so stark, we have to think maybe out of the box
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.520]  here, maybe that was the intent to bring down all world governments
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.520]  and then bring in a new system from left field and the Harare's
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:28.520]  and the Bonville and Klaus Schwab, they get offered to us as a victory lap.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.520]  But really, we have to watch for the people out of left field that come out of nowhere.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.520]  I'm still waiting for those people to appear on the scene.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:42.520]  You know, maybe the plan was to betray everybody and cause global governments to collapse.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.520]  I don't know, but that is definitely something that might happen.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.520]  We got two long segments coming up here.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.520]  What are we going to cover when we come back?
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:59.520]  We can go into the report we're going to drop in the next day or two
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.520]  on absence rates and work time loss rates.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.520]  It's just another piece to the puzzle.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.520]  We're going to tie death disabilities and chronically sick.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:14.520]  The vaccines, the only answer I declared on Twitter yesterday that the debate is over
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.520]  and we act as if we're right.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.520]  And we don't, we're no longer going to talk to people who want to start questioning or die.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.520]  It just is.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.520]  So we're moving on and there's some people are never going to be convinced
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.520]  and those people won't be convinced until it appears in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:34.520]  But we're done, the proof is in, it's the vaccine and it's happening.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.520]  And the question is, what's the public going to do when they find out?
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:44.520]  Because that is a very dangerous prospect for not just the establishment but everybody.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.520]  What happens when the general public is starting to happen learns what's been done to them.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:58.520]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:06.520]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.520]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.520]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.520]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.520]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.520]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.520]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.520]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.520]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.520]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.520]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:58.520]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.520]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.520]  The globalists are in deep trouble but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:13.520]  Info Wars and other true tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless others.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.520]  So please pray for us God more than ever.

[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.520]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.520]  Applying this has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.520]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.520]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.520]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.520]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:23.520]  It's a CIA that manipulates the news in the United States.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:27.520]  They took the babies out of 80 minutes and left the children to die on a cold spot.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.520]  It was almost as if there were a plan in both India and Pakistan.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.520]  We need you to go into the capital!
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.520]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.520]  They are nothing but distract.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.520]  You guys censored Harvard Educator Dockers.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.520]  You silenced those voices.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.520]  What we want to do in Davos is to reset button.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.520]  We start exposing the great preset.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:33:19.520]  As soon as these globalists are going to prison!
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.520]  All right, there is a paradox here.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.520]  I want to be very clear about it.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.520]  I forget who said it.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.520]  I think it was a famous American statesman.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520]  Maybe it was a British statesman.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.520]  Maybe the crew can look it up.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.520]  Who said justice be done may the heavens fall?
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.520]  We can find out real quick.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.520]  And you just didn't do the right thing.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:44.520]  But I've always known that if we exposed the globalist agenda before they rolled all of it out,
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:50.520]  we had their own documents that we would have a better chance of defeating that agenda.
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:57.520]  Except the problem is then they double down and execute their agenda recklessly because they never give up.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.520]  But you can't just roll over and let them do it so you have to fight them.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.520]  But then they still execute it even though their system is collapsing.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:08.520]  So I guess whatever is left after this, maybe we have a better chance of rebuilding?
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.520]  I don't know.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.520]  But it may get us all killed.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.520]  I mean, I just try to do what is right.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.520]  I can't think past 20, 30 moves ahead.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.520]  But that's where we are.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.520]  Their whole agenda is falling apart.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520]  They're scared.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.520]  So they're starting giant wars.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:29.520]  They're trying to create so many crises that it distracts us from the fact that they're the guilty ones for all the financial fraud and robbings.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.520]  But then it actually undermines their own power in the process.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:36.520]  It's a real conundrum because I'm as smart as they are.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.520]  Edward Dowd is as smart as the globalist are.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520]  He didn't choose to serve evil.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.520]  You're smart out there. It's why you're tuned in.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.520]  I'm not patronizing. It's true.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:52.520]  And I think so much of it is these elites are third, fourth generation rich kids.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.520]  So they have educations and things, but really they're not that smart.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:03.520]  And they're almost in a runaway train that was set up for them and following an old eugenics model that's a couple hundred years old.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:09.520]  And there's just got to be some way to get our own elites and our own systems and people that are mid-level to go,
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.520]  hey, let's take the old guys out of positions of power.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.520]  Let's not kill them. Let's just not follow their orders.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.520]  And that happens a lot in the military historically.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.520]  And let's just not destroy ourselves.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:27.520]  I mean, so all I know is I don't have all the answers, but I know the way we're going with them, we can't do it.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.520]  But at the same time, we've got to have a new plan or a new idea.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:37.520]  So I'm kind of just putting out what's happening in my mind here because all these politicians will say they've got a perfect plan and everything's great.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.520]  Just do what I say. That's a lie, folks.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.520]  It's just so complex that nobody has the answers but God.
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.520]  So I think you get where I'm going with this ever doubt.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.520]  Continue wherever you want to go.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.520]  Yeah, so we have a choice, right?
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.520]  We try to get a seat at the table or we create our own table.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:01.520]  And I look at this, you know, use the movie The Matrix as an analogy.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:09.520]  Either you're Neo working with the machines because if you follow the Matrix trilogy, he ended up working with the machine to defeat Agent Smith.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.520]  But who is Agent Smith?
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.520]  Agent Smith represents anarchy and you want it out of the system.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:20.520]  So are we going to become Neo and work with the machines or Agent Smith and create our own alternative system?
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.520]  I don't know yet, but we have to be prepared for both.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.520]  And if they don't give us a seat at the table, we become Agent Smith.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.520]  We want out of the system.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.520]  That's where this goes, I think, ultimately.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:36.520]  Continue.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.520]  I mean, Edward, you've got a lot of ideas.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.520]  Just continue with where you think it's going, what we should know.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:57.520]  Yeah, so right now, my biggest concern is the awakening and the financial crisis is going to quicken that because when money starts to go south and economic turbulence happens, people start to pay attention again.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:06.520]  And a lot of people are going to start to look at alternative independent news when they become dissatisfied with what's going on in the mainstream media.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:14.520]  And they're going to find you, they're going to find me, and they're going to start to be exposed to this vaccine disaster that we've been documenting that's been hidden from them.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520]  The censorship is killing them.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:21.520]  And when they find that out, and I think that's starting to happen and that spreads, they're going to be angry.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:28.520]  And those of us who already know, we need to have compassion for them, we also need to keep common-centered and not have fear.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:36.520]  We, as much as, and I know it's hard to ask people to do this, to have life savings and whatnot, and they're worried about their financial future.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.520]  But you've got to live in the present moment.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:44.520]  Like you said earlier, we can't go way out into the future because there lies the devil, anxiety, and depression.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:51.520]  So we just have to stay in the present moment. We need to continue to, you know, fight the fight and give the results over to God.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.520]  So that's what I do every day. People ask me, what do you think is going to happen?
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:59.520]  I go, well, I can tell you what I think, but I'm going to continue doing what I'm doing regardless of what the outcome is.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.520]  And the book I wrote caused unknown is to save as many lives as possible and prevent people from getting boosters.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:15.520]  And if at the end of the day, that's all I did, then I end up, you know, leaving the scene, then I did my job, and that's all I can ask for.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:20.520]  There's so many things to bring up, so many questions, but I'd rather just, what else is on your mind?
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.520]  You've got the floor.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:31.520]  So right now, Janet Yellen is meeting with, I think, Congress or senators right now.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.520]  One of the other problems we have is the deficit.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.520]  So the deficits are exploding to an unprecedented amount.
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.520]  And the question is, who's going to buy these treasuries?
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.520]  Well, I suspect us, the US citizens are going to end up buying them.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.520]  And how do I know that?
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.520]  Because it's going to crowd out other investments as we go forward in this collapse.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.520]  So why not go where they want you to go?
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.520]  I've been recommending to people who are worried about their finances.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:05.520]  If you're under the insured amount in your bank, don't worry about the bank, you'll be fine.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.520]  If you have more money and you have retirement accounts, it's not a bad idea to move it over to money markets, which are short-term instruments,
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:18.520]  and also potentially do what's called Treasury Direct, where you can buy three-month T-bills and just roll them over.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.520]  Because ultimately, the deficit spending is going to crowd out all other investment.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.520]  We're going into a deflationary period, all financial risk assets are going down.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.520]  So you might as well do what the big boys are going to do.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:36.520]  They're going to be in cash and they're going to wait until the panic button when the headlines come out that the world's ending
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.520]  and buy like J.P. Morgan of old did, buy when there's blood in the street.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.520]  So rather than retail doing what they normally do, retail meaning not sell at the bottom on the fear,
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.520]  prepare for the fear and the mongering and then buy with the big boys at the bottom.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.520]  So that's what I've been telling people to do.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.520]  This is going to take some time and there's going to be lots of headlines that everything's okay, everything's okay.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:04.520]  But ultimately, this just ends up going a lot lower and I don't see any way out of it.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:10.520]  And if I do, I'll alert everybody that maybe they fixed it, but there's no way they can fix the system.
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:16.520]  Well, again, I go on body language and if you look at the Federal Reserve people and other central bank heads in Europe,
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.520]  they look like they saw a ghost.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:26.520]  You know, look, I don't even think they're, I think they don't even understand the system that they've been tasked with.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.520]  I think the people that created this back in the day understand how it works.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:37.520]  But the people who actually run these organizations are literally panicking and I made an analogy.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.520]  It's going to be whack-a-mole and they're going to try to prevent the system from collapsing.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.520]  And that's why I think it'll be slower and I hope it is slower.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:50.520]  But every time they plug the dyke, a new hole is going to burst in the dam and it's eventually going to break.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.520]  So it's a question of speed and I don't think these people even know what's going on.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:02.520]  But when the money supply, year-over-year growth rate goes below zero, it's fifth time since 1868,
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  all other times have been associated with bank runs and collapses and financial panics.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.520]  So here we are.
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:15.520]  So if you want to like question me, just remember, everything was hunky-dory according to everybody in the press
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.520]  and all of a sudden we have a bank failure out of nowhere, out of nowhere.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.520]  And how did that happen? Well, because they've been hiding it and hiding it and hiding it and finally the dam broke
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520]  and it's even alarming them how quick it's going.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.520]  And now the dominoes are going down everywhere.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.520]  Where do you think the next dominoes are going to manifest?
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.520]  Not just in credit, Swiss, but all over the place.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.520]  So the regional banks are going to have problems in the U.S.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.520]  There's all sorts of systemic banks across Europe that are in big, big trouble.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:49.520]  You've got to remember, the European Central Bank forced a lot of these institutions to buy negative interest rate bonds.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.520]  So just imagine how many losses there are hidden in those banks.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:42:00.520]  My biggest concern is a country going kaput, meaning there's a currency run on one of the...
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.520]  A sovereign debt default?
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:08.520]  Yes, and that's when the real action happens, because that's beyond anybody's control.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:12.520]  Who do you think is the weakest right now? What would that domino be?
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.520]  It could be a smaller country, but we need to watch Japan.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:23.520]  Japan has been in demographic decline. They've had unprecedented monetary stimulus.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:28.520]  And if the Japanese bond market goes, then the whole world goes.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.520]  So watch Japan.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:37.520]  I agree. The European Union Central Bank had a month ago said they're on the edge of destruction.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.520]  That could be the EU, right?
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.520]  It could be the EU. I would watch them as well.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520]  The other thing we need to worry about is China.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:50.520]  China hit a demographic wall in 2020, coincidentally enough with COVID.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.520]  Let's talk about that, and then what will they do if they hit the launch of war?
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.520]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:04.520]  We now have three new game-changing products that are in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.

[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.520]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.520]  This is their big move.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.520]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.520]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:11.520]  That's not his job.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.520]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.520]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:21.520]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.520]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:29.520]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.520]  Exactly, and that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.520]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.520]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.520]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.520]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.520]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:49.520]  You're right.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:55.520]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no, and we say no to your war.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.520]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.520]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:09.520]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.520]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.520]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.520]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:26.520]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.520]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:36.520]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.520]  I know you spread the word.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.520]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.520]  Keep doing it.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:46.520]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.520]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.520]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:57.520]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.520]  Please take action now.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:04.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself as 28 years to be over the globalist target
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.520]  and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:12.520]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:19.520]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word, praying for the broadcast, and buying product.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.520]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence and have never actually gone to InfoWars.com to go there
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:33.520]  and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life,
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.520]  but again, will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:43.520]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus or our super high-quality CBD oil or the 50% off or our great Physiomaniasium product,
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:47.520]  or whether it's down and out or rate sleep phase is back in stock, it's all there.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:54.520]  Our turmeric, 95% Humanoid, strongest out there, turmeric 95, it's all available at InfoWars.com and it keeps it on the air.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:05.520]  So make the decision to enrich your life and keep us on air at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.520]  I'm exposing this, so at least humanity is somewhat awake right now.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:33.520]  I want to get back into China here in a moment and other contagions of financial collapse, but also real contagions.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:44.520]  But I also am buoyed and empowered and reassured by thousands of FBI whistleblowers, whistleblowers in every other agency,
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:51.520]  in corporations, in academia, and Dr. Redfield, the former head of the CDC coming out saying it was gaining a function.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.520]  It wasn't made by the U.S. government, it was shipped to China, Fauci's lying, took a lot of courage.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:57.520]  They make killing for that.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:00.520]  I mean, this is rare stuff we're seeing just last week.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:05.520]  And despite the corporate media ignoring it, it went viral everywhere, hundreds of millions of views,
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.520]  and the aggregate just of what I saw with that courage and that's contagious.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:18.520]  So when you've got former heads of agencies saying this is all a lie, that really shows that there's still humanity left, Edward.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:24.520]  Yeah, I agree. And we need to see more and more people do that in the system.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:27.520]  And again, the system needs to understand something.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:30.520]  Do you want us to be Neo or Agent Smith?
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:31.520]  It's their choice.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:37.520]  If they don't let us have a seat at the table and put the people in jail responsible for this, then we'll all become Agent Smith.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:40.520]  And I don't think they want that because that won't end well for them.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:48.520]  So they need to start whistleblowers to come out. The system needs to create neos and expose this.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.520]  Otherwise, it's going to get ugly.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:49:00.520]  So I would rather see whistleblowers exposing the darkness within these institutions and taking down and putting people in jail that need to go to jail.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:05.520]  Because if there's no justice, then it's Agent Smith time and it's anarchy.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:14.520]  And I don't control history, but I'll choose, I'll either be a Neo or an Agent Smith depending upon what the establishment decides to do.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520]  It's their call.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:24.520]  How would you envision an armistice or a meeting with the globalist stop ignoring us and stop acting like they mismanaged things?
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:31.520]  And we actually try to develop a new system to get out of this that isn't a central bank digital currency predatory system.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:32.520]  Why not create a new renaissance?
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:35.520]  Why not bet on what empowered humanity?
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.520]  Why do they keep betting?
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.520]  I mean, here's a classic example.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:41.520]  The federal judge has come out.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.520]  We saw the documents.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:47.520]  It's FBI running the attack January 6th and it's them covering it up and said, I don't care.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.520]  Troll goes forward.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.520]  That's not a sign of stricter sign of weakness.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.520]  Why?
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:59.520]  Why don't they at some point stop that they just keep doubling down, doubling down, doubling down, even though it's not working.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:05.520]  And so I guess the point I get to is why don't they know how to give up because they're their own worst enemy?
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.520]  I mean, here's the microcosm.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:16.520]  The feds want face scanning cameras everywhere, but then the face scanning cameras expose them and then they've got to try to stop the face scanning camera evidence coming in.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:22.520]  So they build these systems and pretend like they're not going to be under them as well.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.520]  I think that's the greatest illusion of tyrants.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.520]  That's what chivalry is about.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:32.520]  Chivalry is not some wimpy thing where we say, don't target women and children and don't use chemical and biological weapons or nukes.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520]  It's like, we want to kill each other.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.520]  Let's do it as men.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.520]  Let's not destroy the system.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:43.520]  So it's like, again, they have deployed things that are too dangerous and then they're the problem.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.520]  Then they pointed us the reformers and say, we're the problem.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:49.520]  That's just stupid.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.520]  I agree.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.520]  The seeds of destruction for evil are always with an evil itself.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.520]  So evil goes too far and it destroys itself.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.520]  You're exactly right.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:06.520]  Your analogy on the face scan cameras is exactly what's going on with the vaccine issue.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:13.520]  I mean, they couldn't include everybody if it was a plan, and I don't know, but let's say it was a plan.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:17.520]  They couldn't tell everybody not to take it because then where it would get out.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:24.520]  So now all of a sudden, all these people that thought they were serving a just system are now waking up to the fact they've just been poisoned.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.520]  So evil itself implodes on itself.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.520]  So we have to make sure that that implosion doesn't take us out.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:36.520]  And that's why I'm saying to people, remain calm, stay centered, focus on spirituality and God.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:44.520]  And you'll be fine because evil is its own worst enemy because it doesn't do the work internally.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:48.520]  And that's what all of us need to do. You need to look at yourself first because we're always our own worst enemy.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:51.520]  Once you get right with God and yourself, then you're able to help other people.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.520]  And that's what I've been trying to do.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.520]  I was part of the system.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.520]  I had no idea what I was doing.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:00.520]  I wanted to make a lot of money and I should drink too much.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.520]  And I was 60 pounds overweight and so satisfied.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.520]  And that didn't end well for me.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.520]  And here I am now trying to help people.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:10.520]  So that's what everybody needs to do internally.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:14.520]  Back to the last point before the break, China as a contention.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.520]  And I know it's hard to guess what's the...
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:24.520]  I mean, I see the car loans to me seems like a big fever blister showing the internal sickness that we're seeing record level defaults on car loans.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.520]  Big car loan companies going under.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:30.520]  Am I right to say that's another big domino?
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.520]  Yeah, that's the domino.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.520]  Look, China is a disaster.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:44.520]  Their whole business model was predicated upon us relocating factories to their cheap labor and they had population growth.
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.520]  Well, they hit a demographic wall in 2020.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:49.520]  They created a ton of debt.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:54.520]  And that debt was beneficial at first because it created manufacturing facilities.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:53:02.520]  Then the great financial crisis came and they created more debt that really went to ghost cities and infrastructure projects to nowhere.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.520]  So now that debt's coming home.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.520]  The bill has now has to be paid.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.520]  They're imploding economically.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.520]  And their greatest fear has always been its own people.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:15.520]  So if you want to stay in power, what do you do during an economic collapse?
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.520]  You create a boogeyman.
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.520]  Who's that boogeyman?
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.520]  That's us.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:24.520]  So unfortunately, the central banking system is so inherently unstable because of the debt.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.520]  The debt can't grow to the moon and eventually collapses on itself.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:29.520]  It creates war.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.520]  War is a result of the central banking system.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:35.520]  Regardless of whether people will agree with me or not, it just is.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.520]  It creates war because people do what people do.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:44.520]  They want to stay in power and they create conflict to take the eyeball off them.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.520]  That was my next question.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:52.520]  What's your prognosis on the Ukraine war?
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:54.520]  Well, that's a sham.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:58.520]  I have not spoken a lot about the Ukraine war because I'm focused on the vaccine issue.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:02.520]  I don't want people to come at me, but I'll give you my two cents in my opinion.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.520]  I've been watching you for years.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:07.520]  You documented what was going on in Ukraine in 2014.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.520]  It was a color revolution.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.520]  The CIA was involved.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.520]  It's basically an oligarchy where we give USAID and then the politicians in DC basically money laundered that.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:19.520]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:20.520]  That's what it is.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:23.520]  And now it's in plain sight.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:30.520]  We gave $100 billion to these clowns and they can't seem to be able to have enough ammunition for the war.
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:31.520]  Where the hell did the money go?
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.520]  Well, we know where it went.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.520]  Went to FTX, was recirculated through there.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.520]  So it's a money laundering scheme writ large.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.520]  We're at end of days with the Washington DC establishment.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.520]  Those crooks need to come to justice at some point.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:52.520]  What do you make of the last two minutes we have left on the state of the world?
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:55.520]  I mean, how would you quantify where we're at right now?
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.520]  There's a huge awakening, evils flailing, trying to maintain control.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:04.520]  I think we should collectively realize how much danger we're in and just stop it.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:09.520]  Well, to quote a novel, it's the best of times.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:11.520]  It's the worst of times.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.520]  Why is that?
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:17.520]  Because you and I have been knowing that this was coming and we felt alone.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:21.520]  But now that the crisis is here, humanity is waking up.
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:27.520]  And we have a real opportunity to create a renaissance where wars don't happen.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.520]  Starvation doesn't happen.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.520]  And we create a society where everybody has an opportunity to participate.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.520]  Because the current system doesn't do that.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.520]  It basically accumulates wealth at the top.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.520]  While it claims it's liberal all day when it's the most illiberal thing ever seen?
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520]  Correct.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.520]  And I'm not talking about communism.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:55.520]  I'm not talking about true capitalism, true ability to at least have a shot at steering
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.520]  your own destiny if you work hard.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:03.520]  Right now, being a laborer in the US economy is a fool's game.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.520]  People who have gotten rich have been close to the central bank, money machine printer.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  Those who deal in money changing and loans and speculation and hedge funds.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.520]  Those are the people that have done well.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.520]  Executives that see sweets.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:23.520]  This has been a zombie economy ever since the great financial crisis globally and in the US.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:28.520]  So something has to change because that's why Trump came to power and was elected.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.520]  Trump understood that zeitgeist and he took advantage of it.
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:38.520]  And Trump was the result of the feeling of unease in the country that something had gone off the rails.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:43.520]  The greatest thing he ever did for us was by going in there, he was not part of the club.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:49.520]  And they were so frightened of him not being part of the club and that he might upset their gravy train.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.520]  That's why we had Russia gave and that's why they tried to impeach him.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.520]  Well, you love Trump or hate Trump.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:58.520]  The greatest service he ever did was showing so many of us how corrupt the system was.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:56:59.520]  Exactly.
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.520]  He made them reveal themselves.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.520]  Correct.
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.520]  They had to come out from the shadows.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.520]  I never doubt again your book.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.520]  People should get the book.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.520]  Tell them about the book.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.520]  The book cause unknown, the epidemic of sudden death in 2021 and 2022.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:16.520]  I wrote it for my loved ones.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.520]  It convinced them that the vaccine is killing people, disabling people.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.520]  And if you already know what I know, buy for your loved ones and hand it out.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:32.520]  That's it's basically unlike Paul revealed, the vaccines are killing the vaccines are killing him on a horse.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.520]  And that's because the censorship is so bad.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.520]  We have to it's like a pamphlet.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:37.520]  You have to kind of hand it out.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.520]  Absolutely.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.520]  That's what we're trying to do.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.520]  All right.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.520]  And we're down.
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.520]  Thank you for the time.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:43.520]  God bless you.
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.520]  Thank you.
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:58:13.520]  We'll be right ahead.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:40.520]  Thank you.
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:59:06.520]  Thank you.
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:32.520]  Thank you.
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:58.520]  Thank you.
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:25.520]  Thank you.
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:51.520]  Thank you.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:01:17.520]  Thank you.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:43.520]  Thank you.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:02:09.520]  Thank you.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:38.520]  Thank you.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:03:04.520]  Thank you.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:31.520]  Thank you.
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:58.520]  Thank you.
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:24.520]  Thank you.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:51.520]  Thank you.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:05:17.520]  Thank you.
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:44.520]  Thank you.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:06:10.520]  Thank you.
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:41.520]  Thank you.
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:07:08.520]  Thank you.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:35.520]  Thank you.
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:08:02.520]  Thank you.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:30.520]  Thank you.
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:57.520]  Thank you.
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:25.520]  Thank you.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:52.520]  Thank you.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:10:21.520]  Thank you.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:47.520]  Thank you.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:11:15.520]  Thank you.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:41.520]  Thank you.
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:12:09.520]  Thank you.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:36.520]  Thank you.
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:13:04.520]  Thank you.
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  Thank you.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:59.520]  Thank you.
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:26.520]  Thank you.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:53.520]  Thank you.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  Thank you.
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:49.520]  Thank you.
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:16:16.520]  Thank you.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:43.520]  Thank you.
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:17:09.520]  Thank you.
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:35.520]  Thank you.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:18:01.520]  Thank you.
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:28.520]  Thank you.
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:57.520]  Thank you.
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:21.520]  Thank you.
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:48.520]  Thank you.
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:20:17.520]  Thank you.
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:46.520]  Thank you.
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:21:14.520]  Thank you.
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:41.520]  Thank you.
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:22:08.520]  Thank you.
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:35.520]  Thank you.
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:23:02.520]  Thank you.
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:29.520]  Thank you.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:55.520]  Thank you.
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:21.520]  Thank you.
