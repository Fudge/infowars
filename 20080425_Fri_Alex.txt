[00:00.000 --> 00:07.940]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.940 --> 00:15.920]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:15.920 --> 00:31.920]  Well, I took off part of the day yesterday to spend time with family. I do that
[00:31.920 --> 00:40.440]  occasionally. And all Hades breaks loose while I was gone. Welcome, ladies and
[00:40.440 --> 00:48.120]  gentlemen. It is Friday, the 25th day of April 2008. And we're going to be live
[00:48.120 --> 00:55.960]  here for the next four hours from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. And
[00:55.960 --> 01:02.840]  then, of course, I'm back Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m. live as well. So we do four
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.400]  hours a day, Monday through Friday, and then pop in for two hours on Sunday,
[01:07.400 --> 01:12.640]  which is a great asset because so many times major news is breaking over the
[01:12.640 --> 01:20.720]  weekend and that, well, as they say, the early bird gets the worm. Obviously, I'm
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.960]  going to talk about the New York Post headline yesterday, as predicted by
[01:24.960 --> 01:30.560]  Jason Berman sitting in yesterday doing a fabulous job. Fox News and others did
[01:30.560 --> 01:40.400]  pick up the slander, the lie, the fraud. Bush Basher smashes disabled teen, that
[01:40.400 --> 01:48.240]  is the headline, and the Neocon websites are calling for his death, his for hit
[01:48.240 --> 01:54.000]  teams to go get him. And even after video came out, and even after eyewitnesses
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.960]  came out that it was all alive, they are now on the message board saying, so what
[01:58.960 --> 02:05.840]  if it's a lie? He's a liberal, basically died. Well, number one, you're living in a
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.040]  false left-right paradigm, boys, over at Free Republic, and Michelle Malkin on the
[02:10.040 --> 02:15.240]  dig comments. We're not the ones for open borders. We're not the ones tripling
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.000]  the size of the BATF. We're not the ones signing on to UNESCO. We're not the ones
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.760]  signing on to the North American SPP agreement. We're not the ones that, like
[02:27.760 --> 02:35.400]  Rush Limbaugh, supporting Hillary Clinton for president. We're not the ones. You've
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.920]  got the wrong people that have bankrupted the economy and the dollar. You see, we
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.320]  know that Republicans and Democrats are owned by the same interest. We are adults
[02:44.320 --> 02:50.680]  here, and we're very upset about what's happening to our beloved Republic. What's
[02:50.680 --> 02:56.000]  happening to our currency, what's happening to our national name, and I don't
[02:56.000 --> 03:07.480]  even really get mad at the neocon minions anymore. I get sad, but I remember
[03:07.480 --> 03:14.600]  being in New York City last year on what September 9th, and it's all on video, and
[03:14.600 --> 03:17.680]  the police call me out of the crowd. I don't touch them. I don't yell at them. I
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.600]  don't abuse them. They put me in handcuffs. They falsely take me to jail. They
[03:22.600 --> 03:27.560]  later admitted that what they cited me with was not arrestable offense, and when
[03:27.560 --> 03:31.400]  I got to the jail, they said, what'd he do? And they said to the guy behind the
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.480]  counter, they said he hit a cop, and they all went, he hit a cop. Oh, big, tough
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.400]  guy. And I just said, listen, there were scores of cameras. You're not going to get
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.360]  away with this. Please don't frame me. Please don't make me sue you. And then
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.960]  they suddenly looked at me like I was a guinea pig that hadn't been declawed and
[03:53.960 --> 03:58.240]  had my eyeballs got gouged out. They're like big Python snakes, and the normal
[03:58.240 --> 04:03.040]  citizen is like a guinea pig that's had its legs removed, its eyes removed, its
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.160]  teeth removed, and they just dropped the furry ball in for the snake to eat it,
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.120]  because the general public has been told to trust cops. Everything's going to be
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.360]  all right. They're here to guard your freedom. Justice is going to be served.
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.760]  Not me, folks. I'm a little guinea pig. I'm still a nothing, but I've got little
[04:19.760 --> 04:23.840]  claws. I got little teeth. I still got eyes, and as soon as they knew I
[04:23.840 --> 04:27.840]  could see, they looked at me like I was a human being. They kind of pulled back and
[04:27.840 --> 04:32.840]  went, whoa, we got one. We got a thinker. I'm not that smart, but again, I've
[04:32.840 --> 04:38.200]  still got a brain. I forgot lobotomized guinea pigs. They also lobotomize them.
[04:38.200 --> 04:45.840]  They do that for some big prize snakes. They basically, you know, gouge the eyes
[04:45.840 --> 04:51.000]  out of what they eat. But anyways, I'll finish up when we get back.
[04:52.640 --> 05:01.600]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[05:01.600 --> 05:08.440]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group, but their objective being world domination.
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.480]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the
[05:13.480 --> 05:20.800]  New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:20.800 --> 05:26.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide
[05:26.600 --> 05:31.800]  open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:31.800 --> 05:34.920]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[05:34.920 --> 05:38.280]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[08:01.120 --> 08:12.520]  Hello, my friends. Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition. My apologies to
[08:12.520 --> 08:18.640]  the former government analyst, economist, amazing researcher, Richard C. Cook. I canceled
[08:18.640 --> 08:24.680]  him today. We were going to come in hot on this Friday edition with an hour-long economic
[08:24.680 --> 08:30.760]  discussion with him. But with this We Are Change frame-up operation that we're witnessing,
[08:30.760 --> 08:36.600]  I have suspended that guest until next week. But there's a silver lining. He'll be with
[08:36.600 --> 08:41.280]  us for two hours to go over the history of modern banking, the Federal Reserve, and
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.080]  where we're going, what they're engineering right now.
[08:44.080 --> 08:51.120]  Jack McClam to talk about the fusion centers, the martial law drills nationwide where the
[08:51.120 --> 08:56.120]  police admit they're getting ready for martial law, where they go out and violate the entire
[08:56.120 --> 09:01.240]  public's fourth and fifth amendment, randomly searching everyone all over the country. Jack
[09:01.240 --> 09:06.400]  will be with us for a full hour and the second hour. Then William Lewis for 30 minutes popping
[09:06.400 --> 09:10.760]  in to finish up talking about his new film, Washington, You're Fired, already sending
[09:10.760 --> 09:20.000]  shockwaves across the nation. Former Reuters reporter, award-winning researcher, historian,
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.880]  also very controversial, Michael Hoffman. We're going to have him back up the next few months
[09:24.880 --> 09:30.080]  to talk about different subjects he covers. But today he'll be discussing some very important
[09:30.080 --> 09:31.080]  information.
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.160]  And then Nobel Prize winner for the last 30 minutes, Joseph Stiglitz has joined us two
[09:36.160 --> 09:40.440]  times in the past. He'll be joining us again today to talk about exactly what's happening
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.720]  with the world economy and his prediction last January on this radio show, that we
[09:45.720 --> 09:52.200]  would go into a world of oppression if the central banks did not reverse their activities.
[09:52.200 --> 09:59.160]  So that is coming up today, really jam-packed radio show. We're going to have Richard Cook
[09:59.160 --> 10:05.440]  on, but I canceled him and moved him this morning because we need to cover what's happening.
[10:05.440 --> 10:12.440]  All right, let me just try to calmly cover all the points. Last night, reading about
[10:12.440 --> 10:18.800]  all this, watching it, reading the Fox News report, reading the Washington article, reading
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.680]  the story out of the New York Post, a bunch of news reporting on it, hundreds of things
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.320]  ran through my mind, hundreds of different pieces of information of the dishonorable
[10:32.320 --> 10:39.160]  activity of the police, the corruption of the media, the way innocence are always framed
[10:39.160 --> 10:45.320]  and the good guys in the history books set up to be the bad guys and the bad guys are
[10:45.320 --> 10:54.580]  made to be the heroes, all these different facets, the response of the neocon blogs calling
[10:54.580 --> 11:00.960]  for the violent attack and death of this poor young man who was physically assaulted by
[11:00.960 --> 11:09.640]  this Bush minion, how the neocons then call us liberals and call Bush conservative, just
[11:09.640 --> 11:21.200]  this Alice in Wonderland nature of everything that we're seeing absolutely boggles the mind.
[11:21.200 --> 11:31.720]  But let me just start the story this way. Last year, I'm in New York, I guess about
[11:31.720 --> 11:41.520]  six, eight months ago, it's a few days before September 11th. I was arrested for using a
[11:41.520 --> 11:48.360]  unpermitted sound device at a peaceful demonstration. Everybody's seen the video on the web. It's
[11:48.360 --> 11:54.000]  on YouTube. It's an upcoming film. I'm making about 9 11 truth. I use a bullhorn, the police
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.640]  come and wave at me from about 10 yards away. I'm in the crowd. I immediately come to them.
[11:59.640 --> 12:03.440]  They immediately bring me to the edge of the street. They immediately turned me around
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.520]  and grunt with full power and put the handcuffs on so hard they cut into my wrist and my wrist
[12:08.520 --> 12:15.840]  bled. They then shoved me into the car. They then arrested a bunch of camera people, two
[12:15.840 --> 12:24.800]  camera people assaulted the Discovery Channel award winning cameraman guys shot for Oscar
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.600]  winning films and documentaries at the end of the year. They just ran across the street
[12:30.600 --> 12:37.280]  to attack him, had a police riot, took me to jail and they marched me in to the classic
[12:37.280 --> 12:43.320]  New York precinct and the Southern precinct as they call it, the Southern police office
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.600]  there in Manhattan, the South office. They marched me up to the big desk and the grand
[12:48.600 --> 12:55.080]  inquisitor behind it on his power trip, a job where he gets to indulge his petty power
[12:55.080 --> 12:59.360]  trip at 24 hours a day. Most of us will be embarrassed to engage in one tenth of this
[12:59.360 --> 13:05.640]  type of just just just absolute. It's like a small child dressing up in a general's outfit
[13:05.640 --> 13:09.640]  and walking around giving stuffed animals orders. I mean, it's it's that ridiculous.
[13:09.640 --> 13:15.680]  I mean, I'm somebody that has quite a modicum of petty power. This whole planet's petty
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.640]  or whole species is petty. If I was king of the earth, I wouldn't be on a power trip.
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.200]  But I have a modicum of power. They would call it these minions great power and I am
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.400]  embarrassed even admit to myself I have power, not these people. And they get to laugh at
[13:29.400 --> 13:32.920]  me and look at me and make me stand there while they're booking in other people. And
[13:32.920 --> 13:39.560]  then what this one do in right in front of everybody in God, the cops said he hit it
[13:39.560 --> 13:45.040]  an officer. And I just put my head down for about a minute while they laughed and jeered
[13:45.040 --> 13:52.480]  and they had a little little psycho celebration there for a moment of the setting me up. It
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.480]  was a minute. It was a moment of victory, a great moment of of stabbing the country
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.360]  in the heart with wanton abandon and deep pleasure. And after about a minute, I looked
[14:03.360 --> 14:12.040]  up and I said, I listened to me very carefully. There were scores of cameras there. I didn't
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.640]  touch any of you and I cooperated. That is a line of fraud. And I said, I know you're
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.440]  very serious. I know you frame people in this town every day. And so you're comfortable
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.120]  with it, but you can beat the rat. You can't beat the ride. I said, I have some means.
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.800]  I'm a syndicated radio host. But then their phones were already ringing. The word had
[14:31.800 --> 14:38.600]  gotten out on the Genesis Network and others. And I said, I'm don't force me to spend hundreds
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.640]  of thousands of dollars suing you all individually. I know the system's corrupt and they're just
[14:43.640 --> 14:50.520]  looking at me shocked. But I said, I'm going to beat you. You're going to lose. And they
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.840]  looked at me like I had 15 snake heads and suddenly stepped back like I was a cobra
[14:55.840 --> 15:02.400]  ripping acid out of my mouth. And they said, all right, big guy. All right, tough guy.
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.880]  And shoved me back into the jailer area where they took me. And he goes, are you going to
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.560]  hit me? Are you a big? Oh, he's a pretty big guy. And I said, listen, I said, I don't
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.600]  have any criminal record. I'm not going to hit you so you can beat me up or kill me.
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.520]  I just said, please, for God's sakes. And then he laughs again. He goes, what do you
[15:20.520 --> 15:27.280]  do? Well, he hit a cop. And I just said, oh my God, oh my God. And I just said, you guys
[15:27.280 --> 15:33.720]  are so evil. And they said, come on back here. Oh, not your cell, not you. And I'm walking
[15:33.720 --> 15:40.520]  by looking at the cells. It's a long hall. And the cells that aren't full of people,
[15:40.520 --> 15:46.240]  they were individual cells that didn't have people in them, weren't open. And I was wondering
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.440]  why they weren't putting me in those. And because I found out they brought me to a special cell.
[15:51.440 --> 15:58.440]  He's a special cell just for you, just for you. And it had an overflowing toilet with
[15:58.440 --> 16:04.360]  human feces all over the caked over hanging over the side on the floor, running out of
[16:04.360 --> 16:11.040]  the hall into a drain out on the hall. And they put me in there and and I, I just felt
[16:11.040 --> 16:15.520]  sorry for him at that point. I wasn't even mad at him. I saw the little cop his chicken
[16:15.520 --> 16:22.520]  neck, his weak, sunken fluoride eyes. He was just a gang member, a punk, a nobody. I was
[16:22.520 --> 16:27.520]  an American. I was a person of honor. I was someone who doesn't cheat people and doesn't
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.440]  lie. I was somebody who gives the charities. I was somebody who loved my children. I was
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.880]  somebody who had courage. And I knew then that someday they're going to torture me
[16:35.880 --> 16:39.120]  to death and kill me. That's what the odds say someday they're going to have their petty
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.240]  victory over me. But in the end, they lose the war. You win the battle scum just like
[16:44.240 --> 16:52.000]  the Red Cups, but you will lose the war. And so I got to sit in there and I thought and
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.960]  then later a somewhat nicer cop comes back. People that have to stay there for days are
[16:56.960 --> 17:04.280]  given McDonald's and he's given the guy a orange drink and a cheeseburger. No, it was
[17:04.280 --> 17:08.360]  a normal hamburger, just a regular burger. And then I and I'd been in there. I said,
[17:08.360 --> 17:11.960]  hey, can I have something to drink? And he said, well, there's water for you right there.
[17:11.960 --> 17:15.400]  It's literally a water fountain built on top of the toilet. I don't know how to explain
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.120]  it. It's like the sink slash toilet unit. And I just said, I said, well, look, it's
[17:21.120 --> 17:25.760]  all overflown. Can I have another cell? I said, this is really a human rights violation
[17:25.760 --> 17:29.400]  that I'm in here. And he said, yeah, I'll see what I can do for you. And then laughed
[17:29.400 --> 17:35.240]  at me, but at least wasn't saying I'd attack police. And I guess that's how the psychology
[17:35.240 --> 17:38.640]  works. They dominate you. They abuse you. And then you're, you're thankful once it
[17:38.640 --> 17:46.120]  stops or at least is reduced. Then about an hour later, I hear the chanting start of
[17:46.120 --> 17:52.760]  let him go, let him go. And then a captain comes back and says, uh, yeah, we shouldn't
[17:52.760 --> 18:00.400]  have arrested you. This is an arrestable offense. We're going to let you go. Um, but
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.880]  then I come out in a higher level captain or multiple captains. They're got the political
[18:06.880 --> 18:12.800]  officers, the guys in white, not in blue, uh, comes over and says, listen to me, you get
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.000]  them and you get them out of here. Or if you want to rock and roll, we're going to crack
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.480]  your heads. You go out there and you tell everybody to go or it's rock and roll time.
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.640]  You understand? And the cop that put the cuffs on me tight and the cop that had, uh, wanted
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.760]  to frame me was standing there looking at me mad. And I said, yeah, but I said, I want
[18:29.760 --> 18:35.240]  everybody to know something you guys did wrong and killer right here. Shouldn't have put the
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.080]  cuffs on me that type. And they all let and said, huh, killer. So I've never told that
[18:40.080 --> 18:47.480]  story exactly, you know, the full story. There it is. Now that said, I read the newspapers
[18:47.480 --> 18:54.120]  every day and I see not one, not two, but scores more than a dozen without looking every
[18:54.120 --> 19:00.760]  day of police caught planning drugs on people, planning guns on people right here in Austin.
[19:00.760 --> 19:05.200]  They've been caught multiple times in the news. The famous case a few years ago in Dallas
[19:05.200 --> 19:09.280]  where they were arrested, thousands of people, they pull you over, throw chalk in your car,
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.560]  asset forbit your seas, your Mercedes. It was always nice cars. They didn't go take
[19:13.560 --> 19:19.640]  your home. And that is admitted not debated to Leah, Texas, every black person in the
[19:19.640 --> 19:23.160]  town, every black person in the town arrested. It didn't matter if you were an 85 year old
[19:23.160 --> 19:30.840]  woman, a 65 year old man, you were arrested, cocaine planted on you. And we have to let
[19:30.840 --> 19:36.120]  that burn in that there are police forces where they're not criminals. But that is the
[19:36.120 --> 19:43.120]  rarity. That is the and I'm not going to go along with the hoax anymore. It's a gang
[19:43.120 --> 19:47.800]  in uniforms that deal the drugs, run the whores, frame everybody. And that's what's happened
[19:47.800 --> 19:54.480]  to we are changed. We're now going to cover that.
[19:54.480 --> 19:59.520]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted
[19:59.520 --> 20:05.360]  methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive
[20:05.360 --> 20:10.440]  the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your
[20:10.440 --> 20:17.680]  entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn to die with lace
[20:17.680 --> 20:24.040]  med inks, patented methodology. Without cutting bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we

[23:49.120 --> 24:02.120]  has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[24:02.120 --> 24:13.120]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[24:13.120 --> 24:24.120]  The war is over. Everybody knows the good guy's lost. Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[24:24.120 --> 24:34.600]  The poor stay poor. The rich get rich. That's how it goes. But everybody doesn't know. Everybody
[24:34.600 --> 24:48.600]  knows. People think they know. But the corruption is so massive, so systemic, that it's hard
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.680]  for me to even be able to consciously grasp it, and this is all I do is research and study
[24:52.680 --> 25:00.920]  this. The sense of justice, the sense of honor, the sense of the right thing happening and
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.880]  the good guys winning and the bad guys losing. The good guys almost always win in the movies
[25:07.880 --> 25:15.760]  and TV, but that's not the way it is. The bad guys poses the good guys, and the good
[25:15.760 --> 25:25.440]  guys, they rot in filthy jails. That's how tyrants operate. I know Gary. I've met Gary
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.160]  several times. I've watched many videos of him peacefully confronting people. In fact,
[25:30.160 --> 25:37.280]  I've even criticized Gary to his face saying that he's too timid, too nice, that he lists
[25:37.280 --> 25:52.960]  so much information. The last time was Bobby Kennedy, Jr. Just a few months ago, you could
[25:52.960 --> 26:01.360]  see Gary. That's what he goes by. His first name is German. You can see him just asking
[26:01.360 --> 26:08.400]  Mr. Kennedy a question, Mr. Kennedy sidesteps it, but Gary says, thank you. You can see
[26:08.400 --> 26:13.160]  Gary on the videotape talking to the Secret Service, being polite, going over to his free
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.840]  speech zone 50 yards away, and then he has to yell. The majority of Americans believe
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.440]  the government's behind 9-11. How does it feel to know that your husband, your father,
[26:23.440 --> 26:30.600]  the people believe that he's responsible for it? Then he turns his camera off because
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.960]  he is walking away. It's over. That's what he now has three witnesses and others are
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.040]  saying. There's also a still photo, the neocons on the web, such as saying, why isn't there
[26:42.040 --> 26:48.240]  video? Why isn't there video? Why isn't there video of your wheelchair man who reportedly
[26:48.240 --> 26:56.600]  uses daughter as a weapon? Where is that video? Don't worry. We're getting the CCTV and Michelle
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.560]  Malcolm, New York Post, others. I think this is a case you need to be sued over, as well
[27:01.560 --> 27:07.280]  as the police. Just to make everybody know you're a pack of liars. See, you've been caught
[27:07.280 --> 27:12.920]  so much lying, that's why the New York Post is basically toilet paper now. The Defense
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.240]  Department just gives them more million-dollar fake news contracts. You know they get those
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.880]  contracts, right? So what is a million-dollar lawsuit if they were to lose it? What is it
[27:21.880 --> 27:28.040]  to defend one that's 50 grand? See, that's why they don't care. But the sadder issue
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.360]  is that neocon minions, these poor people, who I know on average mean well, they just
[27:33.360 --> 27:40.320]  love to be lied to. They're like babies that'll eat poison if you give it to them. I mean,
[27:40.320 --> 27:47.120]  to see how Gary was set up and to have all these eyewitnesses saying the same thing,
[27:47.120 --> 27:51.600]  Gary's walking away down the sidewalk, and here comes this guy veering towards him, openly
[27:51.600 --> 27:58.360]  aiming at the wheelchair at him, runs into him, and then starts wailing on him with his
[27:58.360 --> 28:04.920]  wife and other women in the area trying to pull him off of Gary, who was like 145 pounds.
[28:04.920 --> 28:12.760]  This guy, and we've seen his photo, it's like six foot five, huge belly, over 400 pounds.
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.720]  We know the type. It looks like he is involved in New York real estate and construction with
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.440]  Larry Silverstein and others. We've confirmed the name and we've confirmed it looks like
[28:21.440 --> 28:28.800]  that's who it is. It's 99% confirmed right now. Total Bush minion. His daughter, I guess
[28:28.800 --> 28:34.760]  likes to go to the White House, never picture taken. I mean, these are like Bush groupies.
[28:34.760 --> 28:39.560]  And Gary asked the police when the guy got in his face the first time when he was yelling
[28:39.560 --> 28:45.840]  to please get him to stop, and they wouldn't. And that's how it works. I've seen this. I've
[28:45.840 --> 28:53.000]  seen it time and time again, just like the British police will come over and assault
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.440]  you and then say you assaulted them even on camera. I mean, I've seen hundreds of squad
[28:56.440 --> 29:02.680]  car videos. I just saw one last week where the retired NFL linebacker, no criminal record,
[29:02.680 --> 29:06.480]  great record in the league. You know, he's not one of the gangbanger types. He gets pulled
[29:06.480 --> 29:10.080]  over for speeding. They tell him get out of the car. He gets out and says, yes, sir.
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.840]  They start yelling at him and he says, he starts pleading with his hands. He says, please,
[29:13.840 --> 29:19.400]  sir, please just let and the cop pushes him, pulls a taser. The guy runs and he tasers
[29:19.400 --> 29:27.400]  him and the news says he's bad. I'm tired of the injustice. I mean, do you like working
[29:27.400 --> 29:35.320]  in a rigged game where you get to frame people all day? It's just, it's just so unbelievably
[29:35.320 --> 29:46.360]  disgusting. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the

[32:58.520 --> 33:12.680]  Raging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:12.680 --> 33:17.680]  Detectives in New York have been cleared for shooting an unarmed man 50 times on their
[33:17.680 --> 33:26.280]  wedding day. Ah, bad guys win again, don't you? But it destroys your name, destroys your
[33:26.280 --> 33:31.360]  future. The police were never this corrupt. They've always been dangerous throughout history.
[33:31.360 --> 33:37.640]  They've always been prone to corruption in every society. That's basic criminology. The
[33:37.640 --> 33:42.480]  general public, sappyly with cop shows in Hollywood was taught it wasn't the case in
[33:42.480 --> 33:47.680]  the last 50 years. The FBI would basically arrest anyone who didn't have a good image
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.120]  of police or FBI up until the 80s. They're trying to bring that back and they'd set
[33:53.120 --> 33:59.360]  you up, whatever. That's mainline news now. And this is how we got this delusional fruit
[33:59.360 --> 34:04.280]  cake view. I mean, it's wrong to kill an unarmed guy shooting 50 times for no reason. Cops
[34:04.280 --> 34:08.120]  start shooting, they all get scared, start pulling their triggers. Instead of getting
[34:08.120 --> 34:13.840]  thrown off the force for being idiots, no, they just get to just kill whoever they want.
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.400]  There have been two taser deaths in the last two days. That's only going to intensify.
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.120]  They're increasing the power of the tasers to kill more. It is a soft kill weapon. We're
[34:23.120 --> 34:29.920]  being trained to accept it. Rush Limbaugh has called for riots in Denver. We told you the
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.480]  Pentagon is behind these peace groups. We've tracked them back to other staged events.
[34:34.480 --> 34:42.800]  We've caught the feds and local police in Seattle, in Austin, in D.C., in New York.
[34:42.800 --> 34:50.720]  Of course, in Ottawa last year, it is admitted, do you understand? It is admitted that they
[34:50.720 --> 34:55.480]  dress up like anarchists and attack other cops for the news cameras. And in the news,
[34:55.480 --> 35:01.040]  they know it's staged. They still play along with it. This is what they do, ladies and
[35:01.040 --> 35:09.360]  gentlemen. You understand that the NYPD was having public discussions with themselves
[35:09.360 --> 35:16.660]  about framing me for punching them. And I had to explain to them, I said, don't make
[35:16.660 --> 35:21.600]  a mistake here. We have video guys. I'm not the average person that you can, the poor
[35:21.600 --> 35:27.640]  average person you get away with this with. Please don't make me sue you. And I only spoke
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.880]  to their fear. I only spoke to their common sense as predators. I said, go on to somebody
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.680]  weaker. I'm the big bull elephant. Why don't you try to eat a baby elephant? Try to catch
[35:38.680 --> 35:42.960]  money when she's at the watering hole. Grab the baby, drag it off. And they said, yeah,
[35:42.960 --> 35:48.440]  that sounds good. Let's go get a little one. Let's get a gazelle with a broken back leg.
[35:48.440 --> 35:55.760]  You understand? I grew up with cops that dealt drugs. Do you understand? You understand?
[35:55.760 --> 36:02.000]  I've had New York police discuss framing me in front of me. I will not live in the delusional
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.800]  fruitcake land anymore. I will not play along with this anymore. We have video of we are
[36:07.800 --> 36:15.160]  Change Ireland being assaulted by someone publicly tied in with the IRA. These are serious people.
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.800]  They bring up politely. Why are you selling out our sovereignty to the European Parliament?
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.640]  And the guy pushes a guy in the back, shoves him in the face on video, chases a guy who
[36:25.640 --> 36:33.400]  runs from him, tackles him, falls to the ground. They call the police. The police come and
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.840]  the Sunday Times of London, also owned by Rupert Murdoch, just as the New York Post is. Are
[36:37.840 --> 36:43.400]  you seeing a pattern here? Puts out a headline after they call them. And they say, yeah,
[36:43.400 --> 36:45.960]  we hear you have video. And they say, yeah, we have, we're uploading it now. Do you want
[36:45.960 --> 36:50.160]  to hear the audio? And they said, no. And they said, well, the police, we call the police.
[36:50.160 --> 36:59.320]  And they said, we know. And then they wrote an article saying that the hoodlums, anti-EU
[36:59.320 --> 37:03.120]  hoodlums didn't mention their names, see, because they don't want to get sued. You can always
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.760]  tell the telltale signs. You know, headline, uh, that the member of parliament attacked
[37:08.760 --> 37:14.120]  by anti-EU gang. And it said that the innocent man was walking down the street alone, that
[37:14.120 --> 37:21.040]  the thugs tackled him, attacked him, stole his bag, beat him severely. All lies. The
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.280]  video is on YouTube. I just have a dinner with my parents last night. They talked about
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.720]  how they remembered being in the EU a few years ago and how there were signs up in Greece
[37:32.720 --> 37:38.200]  saying that it was illegal to criticize the EU. Now that's been in the news, but I mean,
[37:38.200 --> 37:45.960]  this is who we're dealing with. This is the world we're entering. And so the same Rupert
[37:45.960 --> 37:54.800]  Murdoch paper, the police give him third degree assault, which says that it's accidental assault.
[37:54.800 --> 38:00.280]  See the cops are afraid CTV is going to get out. Or at the time they didn't know there
[38:00.280 --> 38:05.800]  was video of this. Gary was outside alone. There were people inside. Luke was inside.
[38:05.800 --> 38:12.160]  He got out. La Pasek was arrested inside for asking a question. And then the neo cons
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.800]  on their websites go, why is it their video? Why is their video before the incident, but
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.560]  not after? Well, because these, you guys know how to operate. According to all the witnesses,
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.040]  Gary's walking away. That guy runs the wheelchair into him. Witnesses said he veered towards
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.400]  him, starts pummeling him. Then the police at the police department walk over and the
[38:30.400 --> 38:34.120]  cops are reporting how'd you get the cut under your eye? And they said, uh, no, I saw him
[38:34.120 --> 38:40.640]  last night. Uh, that's not a, that was already there. You understand, put that in the report
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.800]  and they let this other guy go that night within 30 minutes. They keep Gary. So I'm
[38:45.800 --> 38:51.080]  going to go to the, to a witness. I'm going to go to Gary. He has a real name is German
[38:51.080 --> 38:55.840]  talus, uh, Diane Libson and Luke Radowski. And I'm going to hold them over a little
[38:55.840 --> 39:02.440]  bit with Jack McClam into the next hour if they can do it. Um, there's so many facets
[39:02.440 --> 39:07.640]  to this. I am so upset by this because I want to believe in the cops. I want the police
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.560]  to know that I want to believe in you. I want to think you're the good guys. I grew up
[39:11.560 --> 39:16.560]  watching on TV. I want to believe the lie. I want to believe you're not crooks. I want
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.360]  to believe you're not scum. And I know all of you aren't, but the system is, there's
[39:21.360 --> 39:28.160]  no doubt about that. And you're framing this poor young man who was assaulted by this nut
[39:28.160 --> 39:33.160]  who uses daughter as a battering ram, according to all witnesses. I mean, we've got her all
[39:33.160 --> 39:40.920]  to Hovera saying that, that, that, that we're terrorists who are going to bomb. Then magically,
[39:40.920 --> 39:45.600]  there is then a firecracker style bombing. The same type we've seen the British and
[39:45.600 --> 39:50.480]  Israelis through their own embassies. That's been admitted. They, they say that they do
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.080]  it to raise security and to heighten the police's, uh, you know, frostiness, but then they always
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.800]  announced as a real attack, a firecracker that barely bent the hinge of the door. We
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.560]  have the photos of that first. And then later the police quote said the door was jammed,
[40:05.560 --> 40:09.440]  so they crowbarred it open. And then the media showed images of that the door all ripped
[40:09.440 --> 40:18.120]  open. So they even engage in doctoring of the blast. Um, we then see Fox, CNN, MSNBC,
[40:18.120 --> 40:21.520]  every channel we've played these clips. In fact, John, you have a compilation of those
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.920]  dick. They said, put them in camps, torture them, send them to secret camps, kill them,
[40:26.920 --> 40:30.880]  beat them to a pulp or worse. They're terrorists. They're going to attack. They're going to
[40:30.880 --> 40:37.800]  get violent. And then magically, New York post and Sunday times of London, both news
[40:37.800 --> 40:45.480]  core owned, both owned by Murdoch, start the story. Now Fox News is reporting that brutal
[40:45.480 --> 40:52.120]  gang member, brutal attacker attacks girl in wheelchair. What, what activists in the
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.520]  right mind would attack a wheelchair person but a provocateur? Now, what has recreate
[40:57.520 --> 41:03.080]  68 subgroup? They've got groups linked on the site that say throw blood on the cops,
[41:03.080 --> 41:11.120]  bags of blood that say have shields, have weapons, smash citizens cameras. Now, Limbaugh
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.800]  comes out and says operation chaos. We want burning cars. I've got NBC News reporting.
[41:16.800 --> 41:24.160]  Where's my headline? Limbaugh calls for riots at Denver DNC. Rush Limbaugh calls for riots
[41:24.160 --> 41:29.080]  in Denver. We have the audio. We're going to play it for Jack McClam later. We have
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.800]  the news. We have police. We have news articles where they admit that 50 thugs, we have video
[41:34.800 --> 41:40.280]  of them at the training camp funded by a US government funded foundation. They bust them
[41:40.280 --> 41:46.440]  in from Portland at a training camp. The police house them. Then they send them to attack
[41:46.440 --> 41:51.120]  one group of cops that don't know the cops ordered to stand down. I had the cops on tape
[41:51.120 --> 41:57.760]  saying this. They said it was provocateurs, the low level cops. Then the news admits it.
[41:57.760 --> 42:01.800]  I have cops. I mean, I'm tired of it. What are you? Why do you hate our freedom? Why
[42:01.800 --> 42:08.960]  are you so criminal? Why? I mean, you know, I'm going to give Gary some advice. German
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.000]  Talis, Diane Libson, Luke Radowski, I'm going to tell them all this right now. And I appreciate
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.680]  them holding. I've just got to put all this out every angle here. You got to get over
[42:19.680 --> 42:25.040]  there after the show. Now the put they this is a big sigh. They were listening a day and
[42:25.040 --> 42:29.480]  a half ago when I said on air, uh oh, we've said on air that we don't have video of the
[42:29.480 --> 42:35.000]  assault. Now you're going to see hit pieces in the media. And they did. They were waiting.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.320]  That's why they said third degree assault, which is accidental. I noticed third degree
[42:38.320 --> 42:44.000]  assault doesn't fit in with what the New York Post is saying. That's the lawsuit right there.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.160]  The New York Post, by the way, it's come out makes makes actually shakes down Hollywood
[42:48.160 --> 42:55.740]  stars and makes them pay huge hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece to the paper.
[42:55.740 --> 42:59.640]  Pull this up. We didn't even add that in our piece. Paul didn't discrediting them. See,
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.440]  there's so much evil. We can't even cover it. It's a mafia. But that's your lawsuit
[43:05.440 --> 43:11.200]  right there because they know what a class C is. They know it means accidental. Now,
[43:11.200 --> 43:15.160]  see the cops don't want to go to jail for false charges. They didn't know there wasn't
[43:15.160 --> 43:21.280]  video then. So they were still real arrogant. If if if they would have known there wasn't
[43:21.280 --> 43:26.120]  video then they would have charged you with probably attempted murder. And I'm not joking
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.280]  about that. As you can see on the video after they're all talking all doing the setup, you
[43:30.280 --> 43:34.600]  know, they all get together to make up their big lie. It's so disgusting to see that type
[43:34.600 --> 43:39.720]  of conspiracy in action that attack on America's heart and soul and core and on the name and
[43:39.720 --> 43:45.720]  image of police.
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.280]  But the New York Post knows that that means accidental. They exaggerated it into he savagely
[43:50.280 --> 43:55.000]  beat the girl in the wheelchair over and over again. He he attended then they mentioned
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.240]  oh but she wasn't hurt. Now the real witnesses all say include people that we didn't even
[43:59.240 --> 44:04.280]  know we've now gotten their names up said yeah, the girl was crying saying why the father
[44:04.280 --> 44:09.700]  was ramming the chair into him over and over again screaming why are you hitting her. Total
[44:09.700 --> 44:14.960]  setup the police were all watching. Then he pushes her aside starts pummeling Gary just
[44:14.960 --> 44:22.440]  savagely pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding. And then the police
[44:22.440 --> 44:27.560]  come make their arrest make their staged event.
[44:27.560 --> 44:33.040]  Here's the deal. The center where they had the Bush women is is going to edit the tape
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.800]  or lose it. They're going to be other businesses you got to get to those go in be real friendly
[44:38.800 --> 44:43.640]  or or or don't even try to talk to the owners just beg the security.
[44:43.640 --> 44:47.920]  You know later you can try to subpoena your trial that will cost money take time energy
[44:47.920 --> 44:53.320]  will do that if need be. But but right now you need to just get them to say hey will
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.880]  you let me look at it at least. And a lot of times the security guards other maybe a
[44:57.880 --> 45:02.000]  gas station maybe a restaurant. You hit one of them you're going to be able to probably
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.800]  get it. And then we've got them we've got them and and and see we'll then expose how
[45:07.800 --> 45:13.320]  they're liars just like we have the video of them lying about we are change Ireland.
[45:13.320 --> 45:19.320]  This guy's chasing them and assaulting them. They're running from him and the media turns
[45:19.320 --> 45:25.880]  it into member of parliament viciously attacked by anti EU group.
[45:25.880 --> 45:28.680]  Now they're never saying we are change because they're afraid of it. They know it's caught
[45:28.680 --> 45:36.280]  fire. So they're always trying to isolate it. So they decided to say anti EU group.
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.560]  They've just and this is what was said inside the defense intelligence agency inside the
[45:40.560 --> 45:48.460]  CIA inside the CBS broadcast center that gives all the orders to Fox Fox is really a subsidiary.
[45:48.460 --> 45:52.840]  This is what Viacom Intel operatives made the decision to do. Now what you're hearing
[45:52.840 --> 45:58.240]  is exactly what was said. If we can't beat these people and it's clear it's going to
[45:58.240 --> 46:05.440]  continue to spread this this activism. We're going to mislabel each event and recycle it
[46:05.440 --> 46:10.960]  as propaganda against them. Don't say their names. The memo went out and say whatever
[46:10.960 --> 46:20.200]  the group is whatever your agenda is in your sector in the UK in the Emerald Isle it is
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.400]  the European Union integration of Ireland and England and Scotland. So there you will
[46:25.400 --> 46:32.000]  say it is anti EU gang. Use the term gang because it's one of those double use terms.
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.960]  You can't get sued for calling them a gang. There's five guys out for a walk or a soccer
[46:36.960 --> 46:42.320]  game is a gang. It's like calling you an extremist. They'll call somebody that blows up a church
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.160]  an extremist which is too small a word. They should be terrorist but then they can later
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.600]  call someone who's innocent an extremist. See how their psych warfare works. So this
[46:51.600 --> 46:56.200]  is what was said. I'm not kidding. This is what was said. I understand the enemy's operation.
[46:56.200 --> 47:01.000]  I study it so much now that I've got a full map of it in my mind. It's pretty simple.
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.000]  They said we can't beat these people. This is going to be the new attack pattern. Watch
[47:06.000 --> 47:12.000]  watch unfold. We've got countermeasures to that too. For each measure there's a countermeasure.
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.960]  They're going to try to recycle. That's the term they use. I'll guarantee you they're
[47:16.960 --> 47:22.360]  going to recycle this. Oh that freaks you out doesn't it government that I understand.
[47:22.360 --> 47:26.920]  I've got what I know what you're doing. Well probably more than you do is your compartmentalized.
[47:26.920 --> 47:31.160]  Disgusting what you're doing. Find out about sodium fluoride. Find out that your bosses
[47:31.160 --> 47:34.400]  aren't your friends. Find out what you're doing to your children. For God's sakes join
[47:34.400 --> 47:44.240]  us now. They said we will recycle this and so wherever these events happen we'll say
[47:44.240 --> 47:51.280]  oh anti war group attacks wheelchair girl 9 11 truth gotten too much attention. We are
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.040]  changes growing too fast. It's infectious. All these they just had a state senator in
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.400]  Arizona go public highly respected. They're totally freaking out. I mean it's something
[48:00.400 --> 48:06.520]  every day now. They said we got to minimize it but will you a will minimize and not say
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.520]  it's 9 11 truth anymore. We can't beat them by fighting with them toe to toe is what they've
[48:11.520 --> 48:20.400]  said. But we'll also recycle and then say that oh they're anti EU oh they're anti war
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.960]  and we'll use that as the cover story and then we'll arrest and frame each person each
[48:25.960 --> 48:33.080]  group. So you've got to have cameras rolling at all times you can't go out alone and do
[48:33.080 --> 48:37.120]  these events. You can't split up some of you can't go inside and the others of you stay
[48:37.120 --> 48:44.240]  outside. You've also got to know with these high value targets in the info war going out
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.920]  and confronting them that you get around any of the vice presidents as I'm told they
[48:48.920 --> 48:54.440]  did last night. Lynn Cheney or any of the president's women that you're in danger of
[48:54.440 --> 49:02.360]  them shooting you and saying you had a gun. I mean they wanted Nixon wanted to bomb the
[49:02.360 --> 49:05.800]  Republican National Convention. That's on. I had read the documents but I was in a hotel
[49:05.800 --> 49:12.160]  room two years ago in Dallas watching frontline and there they were admitting it on PBS. Yes
[49:12.160 --> 49:21.440]  it's admitted Nixon wanted to bomb the RNC and blame it on the leftist. We'll see Limbaugh
[49:21.440 --> 49:25.960]  saying attack burn destroy make the Democrats look bad the feds have infiltrated they're
[49:25.960 --> 49:32.020]  getting ready to do that in Denver. We've got we've got them doing this to we are change
[49:32.020 --> 49:37.160]  all over. We're in a very dangerous mode ladies and gentlemen. Okay I apologize for
[49:37.160 --> 49:44.160]  making them hold for 10 minutes. I want to hold Gary Diane Libson Luke Radowski over
[49:44.160 --> 49:49.320]  into the next segment. But first off Gary. What do you think of the analysis you just
[49:49.320 --> 49:55.240]  heard? Well you know common sense. I was straight up framed you know in the meaning
[49:55.240 --> 50:04.040]  of the word 500 pound guy and a 145 pound guy. You know it is a big difference and when
[50:04.040 --> 50:09.960]  you have basically all the witnesses saying that this guy was attacking me and then they
[50:09.960 --> 50:15.240]  switched them switch the story saying that you're trying to get me off with their daughter.
[50:15.240 --> 50:20.080]  That's a contradiction right there. And basically how do you think how do you think that exactly
[50:20.080 --> 50:24.200]  at first it wasn't the daughter it was you and him fighting. Now it's I mean what do
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.800]  you want to say to the officers that are framing you. I think that they have a very low IQ
[50:28.800 --> 50:33.960]  when they can't just tell they couldn't even handcuff me they can't even put a story together.
[50:33.960 --> 50:39.000]  And in the backfire on them and we always have the last word because basically they
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.520]  try to discredit us and that's right come back. That's right the CCTV and Michelle
[50:43.520 --> 50:53.640]  Malek and all of you you're going to get sued. We'll be right back.
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.680]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[50:57.680 --> 51:02.480]  sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern
[51:02.480 --> 51:07.360]  history the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[51:07.360 --> 51:11.240]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time
[51:11.240 --> 51:17.000]  frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv

[52:05.120 --> 52:09.760]  agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers
[52:09.760 --> 52:14.160]  wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[52:14.160 --> 52:17.480]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must
[52:17.480 --> 52:22.720]  be kept separate. It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[52:22.720 --> 52:26.360]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement. From history we saw that when
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.960]  church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted. This union
[52:30.960 --> 52:35.480]  would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation. America and papal Rome are
[52:35.480 --> 52:40.320]  uniting in this agenda. Protestant America, awake before it is too late. The prophecies
[52:40.320 --> 52:47.400]  are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon. For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write

[53:54.640 --> 53:58.200]  These truthers are exactly the kind of people who want to rock this nation's foundation
[53:58.200 --> 54:03.480]  terrace apart and plant the seeds of dissatisfaction in all of us. I saw why he's coming at me.
[54:03.480 --> 54:07.320]  I think he's got a bomb in his bag. Start the government phase it out. He'll be in
[54:07.320 --> 54:11.680]  the hall for 30 days. Which is why I believe these guys are dangerous. I believe these
[54:11.680 --> 54:19.080]  guys are anarchists that are looking to tear us apart. I mean this is the kind of group
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.480]  that a Timothy McVeigh would come from. This kind of propaganda is hurtful to those who
[54:23.480 --> 54:29.400]  lost loved ones on 9-11 and damaging to America's image abroad. But the more serious matter is
[54:29.400 --> 54:34.880]  the rise of dangerous radicals roaming the country unchallenged. Infringing on freedom
[54:34.880 --> 54:41.480]  of speech, disrupting worship, and insulting decent people. Stop providing comfort, comfort
[54:41.480 --> 54:48.480]  to terrorists and others who would harm Americans including your own family.
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.400]  By the way that's about three months, four months old. That's not even all the latest
[55:23.400 --> 55:30.600]  ones where Geraldo says we're bomber, terrorist, and we're gonna bomb. Then magically it happens.
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.400]  Magically they say we did it. Magically provocateurs show up at ground zero with signs saying we
[55:34.400 --> 55:41.400]  did it. We've got the Scarborough country where they say that we need to be sent to
[55:42.200 --> 55:49.200]  secret camps that we need to be tortured. We have those clips. We have the same thing
[55:49.560 --> 55:56.560]  being said by other shows. Going back to Gary and then bringing up Diane and Luke Radowski
[55:56.640 --> 56:03.640]  you guys just jump in any time. Gary on the record here just in summation is this correct
[56:03.640 --> 56:08.640]  to say he followed you with a wheelchair, rammed you with it, then attacks you. You never
[56:08.640 --> 56:12.640]  even fought back to witnesses say and the police framed you.
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.360]  Exactly. Well what happened was that he first put his finger in my face and slammed the
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.040]  camera out of my hand. You hear me saying get out of my face. Obviously I was talking
[56:22.040 --> 56:26.040]  to him. Not a wheelchair bound door. That can't be my thing.
[56:26.040 --> 56:32.640]  And by the way I paid for that camera. It is broken. The neocons by the way Luke online
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.640]  just say we're liars. They have no evidence and they defend their lying system. Luke Radowski
[56:37.640 --> 56:43.840]  Yeah I'm right here and it's just incredible what's going on right now in the facade of
[56:43.840 --> 56:49.720]  the media basically calling us not only terrorists but right now that we're assaulting wheelchair
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.720]  girls. I mean this is just ludicrous. I am just so sick and tired of the lies. I mean
[56:54.720 --> 57:00.120]  even in the mainstream media post it says Gary shouted obscenities at the first lady.
[57:00.120 --> 57:04.840]  Look at the video of what Gary said to the first lady. He did not yell any obscenities.
[57:04.840 --> 57:09.800]  That's another lie right there. We never cursed and we never will curse at any high elected
[57:09.800 --> 57:11.800]  official and that's what the media tries to say to that.
[57:11.800 --> 57:15.120]  That's right. There's hundreds of videos you guys never curse.
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.040]  Yeah we never do curse but the mainstream media says right now we're cursing at the
[57:19.040 --> 57:24.600]  first lady. Look at the video yourself. You can see Gary not saying one curse word and
[57:24.600 --> 57:28.800]  then saying get away from me to the guy who was putting his finger in his face who wanted
[57:28.800 --> 57:35.240]  an altercation, who wanted a fight, who was smiling right before this happened. This is
[57:35.240 --> 57:40.960]  just a blatant attack on our movement, on our message of truth and love.
[57:40.960 --> 57:47.520]  Well we need to continue to hurt Rupert Murdoch the lying scum to prove that he lies. We have
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.960]  his other paper the Sunday Times where they say that they stole the bag, assaulted the
[57:52.960 --> 57:59.080]  guy when he was the one doing that, the member of parliament. I mean it's unbelievable.
[57:59.080 --> 58:00.080]  Luke?
[58:00.080 --> 58:04.280]  I mean we're being attacked left and right. That's because we're winning. We're winning
[58:04.280 --> 58:09.120]  the minds of the American people. We're winning this info war. We're winning. We're getting
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.360]  the truth out behind 9-11 and nothing is going to stop us.
[58:13.360 --> 58:18.360]  They also won't ever say your name and then they just put your name on whatever group
[58:18.360 --> 58:20.320]  it is they're wanting to demonize.
[58:20.320 --> 58:24.840]  They never did. The only time the mainstream media ever said we are changed was in Vancouver,
[58:24.840 --> 58:28.240]  Canada without we are changed after up there but they never in the United States.
[58:28.240 --> 58:34.600]  Stay there it doesn't matter we're proving them the terrorists it doesn't matter.

[1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:15.960]  Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones. I was going
[1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:19.920]  to have officer Jack McClam the most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix Arizona
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:26.680]  history on this for the full hour to talk about how the police now admit that they're
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:33.160]  doing martial law, live action drills, swarming citizens, arresting hundreds of people giving
[1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:38.600]  out thousands of parking tickets saying that it's terrorism. We have billboards and signs
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:42.920]  and news articles. Police everywhere are now saying crime is terror and then you don't
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:47.040]  get due process. But we're going to talk about that in the second half of this hour with
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:50.080]  him. In the first half of this hour when he joins us in the next segment let's go ahead
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:57.000]  and get him online. I want him to be able to talk to Gary Talis who got set up in New
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.680]  York. Diane Libson and Luke Radowski. But Diane Libson I appreciate you holding while
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:05.520]  Gary and I and Luke were covering what happened. First stations have just joined us New York
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:13.560]  Post and Fox News. They're all reporting the headline Bush Basher smashes disabled teen
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:21.320]  smashes. And then it just says that he brutally assaulted her like some type of wild vampire
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:25.400]  in her wheelchair. None of that's on the video up to the point they smashed the camera. They
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:31.760]  assault him. All the witnesses saw this and we're going to get the CCTV camera and the
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:36.600]  fact that the police would frame him. I mean we have Luke with the police coming up saying
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:40.520]  he's got bombs and saying we know you don't have bombs but we're going to say you do.
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:48.680]  I mean they now frame you on video and the neocons are on these horrible sites like
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:56.680]  Free Republic and Michelle Malkin. I'm a conservative you're not and calling us liberals and they're
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:03.560]  lying scum. They're calling for Gary. You know they're saying hunt him down, attack him,
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:10.880]  kill him, beat him, hire the mafia. I mean it's just they and then we go to their site
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:14.640]  and say hey here's the video and they just laugh and say oh you're scared now. And then
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:19.200]  Michelle Malkin says we need to be put in camps and I mean they want our blood folks.
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:25.760]  They hate this country. They are scum. And going to Diane Lipson. Diane what do you think
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:27.560]  of this? You were an eyewitness to all this.
[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:34.560]  I think that it just shows like this that the Rupert Night Outland media is that they
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:40.560]  would accuse Gary of doing something that they most dogs would not do. This is completely
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:44.240]  outrageous. You know stop and think about it. Would anybody really do something like
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:51.000]  that? You know that's a good point. This is like the fake CIA nerve gas puppy video they
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.880]  put out. It's like the fake incubator testimony which they admit is fake so I'm throwing babies
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:03.000]  out of incubators. But I mean this plays to the lowest common denominator. Yes and also
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.760]  I saw I witnessed this man's wife trying to tell her husband to stop to stop beating
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:14.400]  up Gary. Now if Gary had really assaulted this man's daughter, daughter, she would not
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:18.320]  be asking her husband to stop beating Gary up.
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:21.760]  Well I want to go ahead and have this go to court. I don't want them to just drop this
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:26.520]  or have him plea out for you know for a misdemeanor. I want to make a big issue out of this. We'll
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:29.880]  make sure the money gets up there. We'll make sure we get the right lawyers. We just raised
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:33.160]  Sally like 10 grand. I want to thank the listeners for that. Sally Costello. I hope
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:42.280]  he gets it all. I'm sure he will. But you know the bottom line here is that oh it's
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:45.960]  just incredible. We need to put her on the stand, put him on the stand and then Michelle
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:52.000]  Malkin, Free Republic, Fox News, they all need to be sued. They are attacking us and
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.440]  then lying about us. This is classic injustice is it not?
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:04:00.840]  I'm just glad that Gary is not alone in this. I'm glad that Gary has a national movement
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:04.760]  and people who are concerned about him because it's the people who are alone that they really
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:07.000]  prey on. Well in a nutshell we're about to go to break
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.200]  him back with Officer Jack McClam. When we come back and try to back off your phone it's
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:14.560]  a little over driven. I really appreciate you spending time with us. In five minutes when
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.880]  we get back tell Jack McClam what you witnessed, what you saw happen. Then I want to get Officer
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:24.520]  Jack McClam who's a real police officer who makes our officers look good, not bad, get
[1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:30.000]  his take on this high treason. And then we'll get more from a German talus known as Gary
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:36.280]  and Luke Radowski. We are Change.org. We are under attack ladies and gentlemen. We have
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:42.360]  them on video with the police saying to Luke we're going to frame you with bombs. Saying
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:51.000]  on video with their faces we're going to frame you. They think framing is that normal.

[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:35.600]  said he had a cop they were setting me up and I told him look I'm gonna sue you there's
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:40.880]  video of this please don't do it have some humanity they dropped that we have video
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:45.240]  of them walking up to Luke with police on video for standing with a sign saying World
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:49.360]  Trade Center seven was a controlled demolition and they say Larry Silverstein doesn't like
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:53.960]  you being here we're gonna show you got a bomb and you'll go to jail for 30 days before
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:59.200]  they find out you're not and then the thugs order the police to grab his camera they grab
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:04.360]  it from him but then for some reason they give it back and tell him to leave I mean
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:09.440]  it is it is Jack McClam founder of police and military it's the new world order now
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.640]  around for almost 30 years your organization most decorated police officer in Phoenix
[1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:18.000]  Arizona history cop of the year twice until you found out about government drug dealing
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.440]  and violations of the Bill of Rights and the rest of it went public how do these police
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.520]  more and more we know all officers in all departments aren't like this but more and
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:31.320]  more it's happening you know Dallas police throwing bags of chalk and nice cars and
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:36.520]  taking them saying it's cocaine how I mean I know they're criminals but how do they just
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:44.360]  frame innocent people over and over and over again I mean this is just amazing brother
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:52.040]  they're being trained that way I was a academy instructor for five years and I saw this coming
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:59.680]  in that not only were they separating the the police officers psychologically from the
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:04.640]  public by telling them that if you ever need help a citizen will never help you you can
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:11.960]  only trust other officers but they were psychologically training them in the end justifies the means
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:18.680]  political philosophy in other words you can do anything at all even criminal as long as
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:24.320]  it promotes the end that you're after and so I saw that before I was injured in the
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:30.600]  line of duty and had to take a medical retirement and also brother we saw myself and other
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:39.400]  officers were watching the most insidious the most criminal the most evil officers being
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:44.400]  promoted up to the ranks to the top of the department here's an example I have a friend
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:49.520]  who's a nice guy no criminal record manages a home depot he's paralyzed from the chest
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:55.520]  down and I had friends that went to the court case and saw the squad car video he walks
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.080]  up he says what are these and he says they're my hand controls and the guy you know looks
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:02.480]  like he's in good shape and the cop says get out of the car and he said okay I gotta get
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.240]  my wheelchair on the back my wife has to get it and he said I said get out and he literally
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:13.480]  grabs him the guy's got huge arms huge neck you know seething with we all know what he
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:18.280]  drags him out slams him beats him you know breaks things and then he got promoted to
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:24.480]  commander that's right brother they're the criminals at the very top of our government
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:30.120]  want criminal judges and so if you're a prosecutor and prove that you're willing to shoot your
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:34.640]  mother for a nickel and take bets on which way she'll fall do anything criminal you
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:40.200]  get promoted up to the judgeships that's what johnny satan satan is trying to do impressed
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:45.800]  bush enough to get a judge ship by running our border patrol agents in the prison railroad
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:52.000]  in them and and we saw that in the phoenix police department our our chief of police
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.760]  was a murderer and got away with it ruben or tega chief ruben or tega was a murderer
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:03.120]  and he got away with it and he promoted up uh... through the ranks the most evil the
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:09.680]  most criminal police officers he could find because uh... at the very top of the system
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:17.280]  the federal and even at the uh... uh... governorships of the state they promote the most evil
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:24.400]  most corrupt and most criminal now now that's not just so their criminals will follow orders
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:29.760]  and do bad things it's so they ever need to burn them they've also got dirt on right
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:35.640]  oh yes that's that's very true yeah like they've just done to that one guy and okay well i
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:39.920]  want to bring up one lady they've got three witnesses she had a still camera got a photo
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:47.280]  of them but the cops having to restrain uh... this huge individual uh... who attacked him
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:51.480]  i want to bring up diane libson who is one of the witnesses to what happened diane in
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:57.280]  a nutshell tell officer jack mclean what you witnessed and then now what the media saying
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:01.760]  okay uh... there was a small amount of people waiting for Barbara and jenna bush to come
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:06.800]  out of the um... to come out of a ninety second street why it was on a side entrance
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:11.760]  um... uh... jerry was exercising his right to free speech he was talking to the crowd
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:16.880]  and the crowd was rather hostile to him but the most hostile with this man i guess in
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:22.800]  the blue jacket who um... threatening just to get gary at one point even cocking his
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:28.240]  fist at gary and he had this um... sick little smile on his face like he wanted you know
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  he wanted violence um... so then the um... Barbara and jenna bush got into their car
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:41.600]  after walking into a waiting van um... gary mentioned something about nine eleven to him
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:45.360]  um... court he had to shout because they were you know we couldn't get that close to
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:46.320]  them
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:51.000]  okay now it's all over and everybody's kind of like walking away up the street and i
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:56.600]  noticed that this man instead of walking straight up the street he's a feeling into
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:13:59.160]  the building or gary is
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:00.480]  next thing i know
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:07.480]  this man is shouting that gary has touched his daughter and he's pummeling gary
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:13.280]  he's pummeling gary you know quite he got a lot of blows and i did not see gary be able
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:18.560]  to defend himself at all he had gary in a corner like a doorway so that gary was kind
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:23.360]  of pinned in there and you know i don't think gary would have even had a chance to like
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:30.360]  you know had their momentum to even be able to defend himself this man's wife was saying
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:36.560]  to her husband stop stop stop so of course that you know that totally contradicts the
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.440]  story that she later told
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:43.360]  um... finally the cops came you know within a pretty short period of time the cops came
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:49.720]  um... i noticed that the young lady in the wheelchair was hysterically crying
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:54.120]  the cops uh... they take gary you know their handcuff gary
[1:14:54.120 --> 1:14:59.240]  i made it down to the precinct within about half an hour or forty minutes of this event
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:03.760]  and i see the man who assaulted gary he's in the lobby of the precinct not back where
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:05.760]  gary is but he's in the lobby
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:11.840]  the police are taking photos of him he looked unharmed to me i did not see any any mark
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:15.800]  on him the police are taking several photos of him
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:18.080]  uh... it felt like
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:23.480]  they were kind of sympathetic to him that was just a subjective impression
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:28.520]  then this guy was free to go you know i waited two and a half hours uh... well first thing
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:32.040]  i came in and i said i wanted to make a statement they told me to wait
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:35.640]  two and a half hours later they told me i couldn't make a statement
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.560]  that's pretty much it
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:40.600]  well i suspect
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:45.600]  many times it's the case that this big guy was an undercover cop
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:47.320]  uh... there to promote
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:51.080]  uh... some kind of violence or so forth because they do that all the time in our
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:52.640]  gathering
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:54.920]  uh... i was uh... fired
[1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:59.800]  uh... one of the reasons i was the most highly decorated officer but i was also the
[1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:02.440]  most fired officer in the phoenix place department
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:05.600]  and one of the reasons was because i refuse
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:09.520]  to go along with the fact that the new policy was that
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:15.160]  if you had a patriot get out of the out of his car on a traffic stop or something
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:19.920]  one of the cops there would fall down in pain like he had been pushed
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:25.520]  and now you've got the now they can charge the patriot with a
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:29.840]  pushing down the police officer let's be clear you were told to frame people
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:32.440]  yeah told the frame people that's right
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:34.920]  and uh... things like you'd have a gun
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:36.560]  in your car
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:38.240]  out in in uh...
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:39.520]  plain sight
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:42.680]  when they pull you over if they didn't like you if you're one of these
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:45.280]  patriots christian patriots or something
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:48.680]  they would say to themselves and i was there
[1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:52.280]  uh... okay we're gonna say his jacket was under his gun and getting for a
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:55.000]  felony of carrying this gun concealed
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.240]  and i'd say no you're not going to do that
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:02.000]  because i'm going to tell you know i'm gonna expose you if you do these things
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.960]  and of course that led to one of my firing
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:06.200]  and uh...
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:10.480]  so today this has been twenty years ago since i was a cop
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:14.640]  so today it's just uh... as i've seen and talk to police officers all across
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:15.920]  this country
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:19.680]  it's just totally out of hand now that they've got the real criminals in
[1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:21.000]  uniform
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.360]  across america especially but jack i mean here's the question how would a cop
[1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:26.880]  feel good
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:30.280]  about pulling a citizen over uh... in arizona where as long as you have the
[1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:33.040]  gun out it's legal
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:37.360]  how do they all day all night ruin lives with such enjoyment
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:41.920]  well it's the unjustified the means political philosophy that were taught
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:46.920]  in the police academy that we have to stop criminality we have to stop the
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:48.040]  citizens
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:52.600]  it's all the citizens fault that crime is going up they're out of control
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:56.400]  we're here to control them our job is to control women sometimes we're going to
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:00.800]  be asked to do things you won't like to do jack won't want to do but you have to
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:01.600]  do it
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:03.160]  even if it's criminal
[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:05.040]  to stop this kind of
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:09.320]  corrosion of our system now now i've i've got gary here with us
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:13.960]  what advice do you have gary in this process obviously get the cctv cameras
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:16.120]  uh... what else
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:19.680]  yes he needs a very good attorney
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:23.600]  what they're going to try to do the criminal judge judges are promoted to on
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:25.380]  how criminal they are
[1:18:25.380 --> 1:18:29.800]  they've they they have them practices that uh... prosecutor
[1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:33.400]  and they see if they're criminal enough and evil enough and then they make them a
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:34.560]  judge
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:38.280]  the judge is going to try to not allow that evidence in
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:41.840]  so you need a very good attorney that's not
[1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:46.560]  not going to side with the bar association and the judge for his
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:48.520]  career potential
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:51.800]  and we do have some of these attorneys around the country
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:55.200]  that are brave enough to stand up to the criminal judge in the criminal
[1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.640]  prosecutor
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:58.000]  and uh...
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.120]  just uh...
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:18:59.640]  fight
[1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:00.520]  for
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:01.680]  the uh...
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:02.880]  uh... the client
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:05.200]  and and most of them will not
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:09.600]  they want to be promoted up to judge sips himself so they're not going to go
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:13.640]  hard against the judge or the prosecutor in these cases when they try to throw
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:14.720]  out that
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:19.120]  evidence that you try to present the you know the camera okay the tapes and so
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.480]  forth stay there jack mclean want to come back in the final segment with gary

[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:06.960]  me getting a good attorney and i'll have to do a lot of research i think
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:10.240]  i have some information regarding his guy's criminal background he
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.160]  he has uh i heard uh money laundering on his record and
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:17.840]  he was involved in some city scandal i just didn't have let's say this a guy by
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:23.280]  the same name who fits the description is that's an associated press it's in
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.080]  new york daily news uh and that we're investigating now
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:34.960]  right um it's just it seems like open a showcase but it's basically
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:39.280]  up to the attorneys you know style of presenting the
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:42.800]  the evidence which points to a clear frame up
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:46.640]  um jack mclan how do you think this went the cops just say
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.080]  this guy shouldn't protested that's not american so we're gonna frame him
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:54.240]  i mean how does that you get beat up and you get framed
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:58.960]  well all the officers are going to lie on the witness stand and say that he
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:02.400]  threw a punch at him or tried to kick him or something
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:06.400]  uh at an order for them to get away with beating him
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:11.360]  um and uh i just want to say to uh these young men
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:15.680]  gallant young men there that if you can't get a great attorney
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:21.200]  to work with you get one out of the state because uh what we found is the
[1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:25.680]  state attorneys all go to the same clubs many times the masonic
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:29.920]  lodge with the uh the judges and they're all buddies
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:32.960]  and uh the prosecutors and defense attorneys
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:37.120]  and so you definitely if you if you can get one out of the state
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:41.280]  that has a license to practice in your state so they're not a part of the good
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:46.000]  old boys club there and uh and also do a background
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.960]  check on this guy who i suspect is a government agent
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:54.800]  that is one that attacked him you know and that would be good
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:58.160]  if you could get that information to prove that he was a government agent
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:01.840]  you have no idea jack we're not even gonna say what we've already found on him
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:06.000]  oh okay good good it's and i believe the whole thing was a setup they'd
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.920]  publicize that they were going to be there
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:12.560]  yeah and uh it's it's following an m o it's rupert murdoch papers
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:15.840]  lying with staged events where we are changed gets attacked

[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:41.600]  why we're doubling our efforts and that's why we got gary heart yesterday
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:44.640]  and that's why we got lynn chain yesterday and we confronted both of them

[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:46.560]  newspapers we we read about it in legislation
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:50.160]  but i challenge listeners go out there like dianne and others have done
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:55.280]  see it for yourself up close be persecuted
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:34:59.440]  uh... i mean as jesus said it's a blessing you you really discover
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.280]  just how real it is jack is i mean can you elaborate on that point before we go
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:06.880]  to uh... gary and uh luke and finish up with them
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:11.840]  and of course pray for gary this is full name is a german tallis
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:18.080]  because i mean you need to get out there on the streets to really experience it
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:21.440]  i think a lot of people living in their houses on their couches
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:24.400]  have never really experienced this they don't know how it's growing how
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:27.120]  important is really experiencing this uh jack
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:31.680]  well it's very very much so brother because
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:36.800]  if if you're not being persecuted at this time in our society
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:40.880]  you better check your parameters because you're not getting the right things
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:44.160]  done as god said in matthew five eleven
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:48.800]  blessed our youth when men revile you and persecute you and say all
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:52.160]  manner of evil things against you falsely for my sake
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:56.240]  so if you're not being persecuted at this time
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:00.560]  you better check see what you're doing because anybody that's doing what god
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.200]  wants them to do it this time is going to have people
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:07.840]  even their own family members coming against them and uh...
[1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.600]  so i'm honored to know these guys there and uh...
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:16.000]  i would ask any attorneys out there listening to this program to please get
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.600]  a hold of them if you can be unbiased and not
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:23.200]  not side with the bar association and so forth
[1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:26.800]  please get a hold of them because they need some good attorneys that
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:30.720]  can go up against the evil judge and the evil prosecutor that are going to try
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.880]  to hold their evidence out of of the jury seeing that evidence
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:38.800]  absolutely diane libson thank you for your eyewitness testimony
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:42.000]  thank you for the photos you took of the police restraining
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:46.080]  the madman thank you for joining us let's go to luke for a final statement
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.120]  and then one from gary i just want to say that this is a
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:53.040]  outlier outright lie it's slander libel
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:57.520]  what the public tour attack on us is is really it really is
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.320]  and it's just trying to destroy our name and our message
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:04.240]  and everything we've done for all not eleven victims family members
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:08.240]  and all not eleven sick and dying first responders which we have been working
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.160]  tirelessly for this is an outright lie this is an outright slander this
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:17.040]  we will not be stopped this will not work this but the truth is on our side
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:22.000]  that we have everything by the way the listeners of this show are the main
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:26.800]  contributors to we are change.org i went to new york last year paid
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:30.080]  for everything on my side and you know help
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.680]  contribute the fourteen thousand to the field good foundation he's even given
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.080]  his own kidney he lives in a tiny little
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:39.520]  hovel john feal he gave a kidney to a first
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:43.760]  responder he is a first responder just a wonderful person
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:47.280]  and uh so we are changed paid for the buses
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:51.360]  to take them to congressional hearings and then you saw the result of those
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:55.360]  epa comes out and says the judges say christina taut wittman knew it was
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:37:59.200]  deadly but that she's immune uh bloomberg just admitted the people are
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:02.640]  dead and dying and being poisoned and so bloomberg has finally said they should
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.360]  be taken care of that's a major victory luke
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:08.400]  the majority started those congressional hearings by confronting
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:11.840]  dennis kesinich who was a presidential candidate with david meller who was a
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:14.960]  sick and dying first responder dennis kesinich hurt us out and now he's
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:18.640]  starting congressional hearings but but what did you get what do you get instead
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:22.400]  you get slobs and corrupt cops coming over saying they're going to plant bombs
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:26.800]  on you and uh laughing at you i mean jack mclean this is
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:29.840]  disgusting isn't it
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:36.400]  it's the status quo today sorry sadly when i was on the police force they
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:41.360]  started i i was real close to the recruiting uh area
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:45.600]  because i was academy instructor and uh they started
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:50.000]  screening out christians anybody with high moral values they would screen out
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.960]  of the recruitment process and i had a lot to do with that because i was a
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:59.600]  born-again christian and refused flat out to do anything immoral and lawful
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.080]  or unconstitutional and so uh that's right there in the phoenix police
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.760]  department they start ruling out anybody with a high moral character they
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:12.240]  wouldn't hire them so it's sad but that's the status quo today
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.440]  and by the way uh we're getting some feedback there
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:19.680]  by the way they also trick the officers they say
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:23.120]  you're a good man aren't you uh would you do this to your wife your children
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:26.960]  they they have them answer that 600 and something question psychological
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:31.280]  evaluation that catches them in lies that really finds out your true
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:36.160]  moral compass and uh i mean i had the head of the
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:39.200]  texas he retired shortly after the head of the
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:42.720]  texas federal marshals the whole division it's actually several states the
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:47.600]  area uh and he told me he said don't become a
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:55.760]  cop unless you're a criminal now that was in 1994 when i was in
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:00.400]  college jack why would the friends of my dad my dad's patient
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:03.760]  why would he ask me to come to the office when he heard that i was thinking
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:06.800]  about becoming a cop it was just one of the things i was thinking about
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:10.240]  uh why would he ask that i meet with him and and then spend five minutes with
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:13.760]  me telling me don't don't become an officer unless you're a criminal
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:19.920]  why would he do that jack well i was uh injured in a line of duty in 86 and
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:24.480]  took a medical retirement and it was going that way at that time they were
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:27.520]  hiring criminals off the street to be cops
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:31.120]  and so in 80 or 94 brother i guess it's uh
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:34.320]  just showing what we know today to be true
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.160]  that if if you're a good moral upstanding person
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:41.280]  you're not going to do well in law enforcement today
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:46.880]  now let me say this we have some thousands and thousands of good moral
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:50.000]  upstanding cops but they don't go anywhere they stay
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.800]  patrolmen they don't get promoted and it's sad but that's the truth of the
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:59.280]  matter well you can see it i'll go to events
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:03.760]  no matter black white ispanic asian and the
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:07.440]  you know it seems even like the handsome smart friendly smiley
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:10.480]  you know you can see the intelligence in their eyes you can talk to them
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:14.400]  they're patrolmen and then it leads a bunch of uh
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:19.360]  on average fat crazy looking gang memberish guys on top
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:23.360]  yes that's right and that's what it is i um
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:27.120]  i went to lunch with my dear wife yesterday
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:31.840]  and i'm sitting in there and in walks the
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:34.800]  second in command of our sheriff's department here
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:39.840]  in idaho county and he's got an earring in and tattoos up and down his arms
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:45.280]  big heavy guy and uh i mean he he looks just like a guy out of
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:50.800]  prison and i'll tell my wife about it said man if if i were to guess this
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:56.880]  guy's a a a a felon and a you know and he's in the
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:00.080]  sheriff's department well we knew this 10 years ago but now mainstream media
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:03.840]  admits this week masses of felons in police departments and the
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:08.400]  military that's who they're looking for that's what they're looking for in
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:10.960]  uh...
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:16.320]  alex i was told by one of our intel people six months ago
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:19.920]  that uh... the real president of the united states cheney
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:24.320]  and his puppet uh boy george bush are bringing back
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:30.160]  uh hardcore mass murdering mercenaries from uh

[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:46.800]  they're bringing them back to one for each county in america to be over the
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:49.280]  county to rule over the county
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.200]  uh... even over the sheriff in these counties course nowadays they're well
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:57.360]  that's what that's what the fusion centers do and they quote said a cia
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:01.600]  operative who will secretly coordinate the county that's mainstream news
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:06.080]  that's it that's it and that's these hardcore mass murdering mercenaries
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:10.640]  they're bringing back these uh... special forces guys from 40 different
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:14.160]  nations and by the way there are hundreds of videos of them just sitting
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:16.560]  off the road shooting families for fun
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:19.840]  don't say that's good jack i want to finish up with you i'm gonna let our
[1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:22.480]  guests go luke anything else you want to have before we go to gary

[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:41.360]  yeah i commonly walked up to her and i asked and i asked her if i could ask
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:42.320]  her a question
[1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:46.000]  and then i said i recently spoke to norman menetta the former secretary of
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:47.120]  transportation
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:50.160]  and on the morning of not eleven he places you and dick cheney
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:53.680]  and the presidential bunker at nine twenty five a.m and at this point she
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:54.960]  looked at me
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:57.840]  you could see fear in her eyes and she just started running away like a
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:43:58.800]  little coward
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:01.200]  later i came back to her again i was like

[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:08.240]  and she just looked at me
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:09.760]  and she just looked away
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:12.000]  well handle them ahead of the committee

[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:17.760]  and norman menettas reported so we know they're lying
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:20.960]  luke you're not only that but you have jason burmese who said yesterday because
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:21.840]  of newsday

[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:35.120]  questions she ran away from my questions

[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:50.400]  gary final comments the guy being set up by these criminals
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:54.080]  yes these guys are just actually like doing us a favor they're the ones
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:57.520]  providing the fuel for us to actually keep going and exposing them without
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:00.720]  them doing this we wouldn't be able to pull who they really are
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:04.480]  and it's um it's us having to be you know we have to be men and go through
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:08.160]  these situations in order to become stronger and that is exactly even the
[1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:11.840]  point of christian christianity you have to pick up your cross and you have to
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:14.800]  sacrifice yourself for greater good that's the only way you could grow in this
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:18.000]  world and it's basic physics what comes up must come down
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:21.520]  these guys are coming down very hard they know it they live in the shadows they
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:25.200]  live in a dark they creep they slime and uh basically um
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:28.720]  i shine light on them they run away and scatter and
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:32.080]  this is going to keep this is going to keep going even if it went for a little
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:34.240]  bit but it's going to topple up on them i mean they
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:37.920]  they themselves have different factions fighting with each other they
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:41.120]  they don't have any rules and they're going to want to be showing each other
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.320]  and that's that that's just a fact um basically we are very strong because
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:49.280]  they are very corrupt and we're taking their power away from them or we're
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:52.320]  trying to try to get into something very positive
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:55.920]  and taking our country back and they are petrified if they're scared
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:59.440]  well jack there is suddenly all over austin and other cities i go to
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:04.320]  anti-new world order graffiti is everywhere uh on people's houses their
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:06.880]  cars on you know people themselves what do you

[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:14.240]  hearing it everywhere and i do think the new world order realizes that they've
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.640]  gone too far and that they have been revealed
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:22.560]  i i think you're right brother they're they're running scared
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:26.720]  and they're trying to get this next false flag bombing of america
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:30.800]  accomplished in probably three cities it looks like
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:35.440]  so that the people are absolutely fear struck and will go along with martial
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.680]  law and then it's all over there's no bill of rights no first amendment
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:44.880]  no nothing and uh they're trying to push that as fast as they can
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:51.920]  so that uh we we lose you know so i ask the people to pray constantly that god
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.920]  gives us more time and stays their hand and confounds them and
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:59.600]  doesn't allow them to pull off this next false flag bombing it'll
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:03.520]  put us immediately under martial law and in the first amendment because we're
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:06.640]  winning and praise god there's a more and more
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:12.400]  activists like this all the time rising up and taking on this uh antichrist
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:15.440]  world government system and it's scaring them to death
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:18.960]  they're trying to move as fast as they can
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:22.880]  and some of us will lose the battles but we're going to win the war with god's
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:25.920]  help in the end we know that that's right amen
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:29.120]  yeah they are going to fall they're going to fail

[2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:38.000]  of carolina look here's the key let me try to explain
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  the thinking here in the in the operations manual for operation chaos
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:46.160]  let's not forget what this is about this is not about securing the
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:51.280]  nomination for either one of these two because i
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:54.640]  sink you suck commander-in-chief u.s operation chaos that became can be
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:58.480]  either one of them precisely because of operation chaos
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:02.400]  they have both been bloody they're both in the gutter the blooms off the rows of
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:07.920]  obama half the country hate hillary we don't now want to reverse course
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:12.560]  operation chaos and secure the nomination for obama and have this end
[2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:15.840]  we want this to go on we want the super delegates to have to make this
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:18.640]  decision not the voters in the democrat party
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:22.640]  this is about chaos this is why it's called operation
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:26.560]  chaos it's not called operation save hillary
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:32.160]  it's not called operation nominate obama it's called operation chaos
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:35.440]  the dream and i mean if people say what's your exit strategy
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:41.200]  the dream end of this is that this keeps up to the convention
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:47.680]  and we have a replay of chicago 1968 with burning cars protests fires
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:52.720]  literal riots and all of that that's the objective here
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:55.600]  and there has been nothing that's happened on the battlefield
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:59.200]  all right stop as he just goes on now a bunch of people
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:03.840]  i looked at the number what six turned my stack people died during those
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:09.440]  nixon wanted to then the 70s bomb the rnc to get martial law
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:12.640]  that's now on front line i mean i knew this decades ago but now it's on the
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:16.800]  news uh recreate 68 has subgroups that say throw
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:21.040]  blood on cops attack other people bright cameras wear armor
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:24.240]  they're linked back to big foundation groups that have staged this before
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:27.840]  jack when we have the left and the right in the stage paradigm
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:31.600]  wanting riots there that'll really be used to crack down on further free
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:36.240]  speech uh... what's your analysis of what you just heard
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:39.760]  yes uh... they they want chaos
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:44.320]  uh... as you know alex we've known for a long time that their whole point is
[2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:50.080]  to bring chaos and they can crack down more and more and more in the people
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:53.760]  many times using the controlled press to tell him how
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:57.680]  bad it was and how many people were killed and injured and everything
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:01.920]  the people will acquiesce many times to the crackdown
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:06.880]  so it's out of uh... chaos comes their new world order so they want as much
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:10.800]  chaos as possible and russia limbaugh is a part of this
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:14.480]  globalist and a christ movement and i want to add if there are bombings
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:16.800]  deaths killings he's not going to get in trouble
[2:03:16.800 --> 2:03:20.320]  if you are on air and said we need riots right
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.600]  or we need to attack police like these leftists are saying we'd be arrested
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:27.120]  we should be because that's not free speech that's calling for crime
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:28.640]  that's it
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:31.680]  yes and that's uh... that's what he does
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:35.920]  is try to stir up problems and to cause chaos
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:39.040]  and uh... if he's successful then he gets uh...
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:43.440]  at a boy you know good boy good boy and he he's uh...
[2:03:43.440 --> 2:03:48.000]  he he's hoping and and these guys are so foolish uh... alex
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:51.360]  the police officers the soldiers the russia limbaugh
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:54.080]  they think they're going to be part of the

[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:01.120]  i do see bigger strides and i thought we'd even have but i see the enemy just
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:05.200]  not caring now i think it's out of fear they have to just move
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:11.840]  and i'm just very upset in my spirit i have never been on this much on the
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:16.160]  edge of my seat even before 9 11 and i went public and said look out then
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:19.600]  i think something really big is about to happen i know they would have already
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:23.120]  staged more terror attacks that would have already done more
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:26.400]  if we wouldn't have been exposing their false flag paradigm their problem
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:30.560]  reaction solution hughillian dialectic but
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:33.920]  i want the average cop to know that i'm not your enemy i don't hate you because
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:38.240]  you got a uniform and you got authority i i'm tired of growing up and seeing the
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:41.680]  local sheriff deal the drugs and then send kids to jail who used it
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:45.840]  and he later went to prison for that by the way you know i i grew up seeing bad
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.520]  stuff i've i've seen hundreds of squad car videos
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:53.200]  of them framing people beating them up and it hurts my heart i mean i guess
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:56.960]  i'm a sap but there's this thing of it's not even something i was taught i was
[2:09:56.960 --> 2:10:00.480]  taught it of justice uh you know i mean i guess
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:03.680]  watching the old westerns i thought that was reality i mean
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:06.800]  you know i don't understand wanting to hurt innocent people i don't understand
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:09.920]  wanting to set up people i don't understand how
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:13.680]  how you and i know all cops don't do that i mean you know i've run into nice
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:17.200]  cops when i was a teenager when i had beer with a date and they'd take the
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:21.840]  six pack out and pour it out uh you know i'm not saying that they're all bad
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:25.280]  i've had cops pull me over when i'm speeding and say uh alex don't speed
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:27.920]  because i guess they like to show or whatever you know i'm not even saying
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:32.160]  that's a good thing the point is is that more and more they're scary
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:40.000]  and uh and i just i'm so sad and jack where do you see all this going
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:45.840]  well brother they just about have uh total control of the system they have
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:48.240]  their judges and prosecutors that are
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:53.600]  as criminal and serving evo as as they are at the very top
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:58.400]  um they have their law enforcement people in position that are absolute
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:02.880]  criminals and many of them killers and then so
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:07.280]  they're we're going into this anacrisis world government system that of the
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:11.920]  super rich and the super poor and so and and they're rushing it
[2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:16.000]  because they're scared to death that uh we may
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:21.760]  um with god's blessing get ron paul in his president by the way they've also
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:25.280]  are making i mean like 10 big announcements more this week admitting
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:29.520]  they're getting rid of the internet yes that's right the internet's
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:33.280]  really hurting them bad folks you better appreciate this while you got it
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:37.120]  you better spread the word about this show these websites what we do
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:40.960]  i mean this is amazing what's happening i hope people treasure this
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:44.400]  yes get all of those wonderful videos of alex
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:48.880]  jones folks get it get a bunch of them and get them out because i'm doing that
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:55.600]  with my family as we speak um and uh and they're they're fantastic for
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:12:00.880]  waking people up because it's all based on fact and evidence and i'm using it
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.400]  with our police and soldiers because it is evidential
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:10.160]  and factual and based on on the reality and so
[2:12:10.160 --> 2:12:16.400]  but folks do it now because we may not have this ability in the near future
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:20.800]  to get this kind of information out if they're successful with this next
[2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:24.560]  false flag bombing of three cities that they hope to pull off and that's the
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:28.160]  intel you're getting that's the intel we're getting
[2:12:28.160 --> 2:12:32.560]  that um if they're successful and we're asking all of our listeners to pray
[2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:36.240]  that god will just shut them down and destroy them with double destruction
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:40.080]  like daniel asked him to do and david asked him to do in the bible and he
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:44.080]  did it pray these imprecatory prayers that god just shut
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:48.000]  them down and destroy them with double destruction but here's the reason god
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.360]  and try to plan if they even try to plan these
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:55.200]  false flag operations in america to put us under martial law
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:59.040]  and and god is in his heaven on his throne alex and i think
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:03.600]  if enough of us do that that god will grant us the blessing to go on and on
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:06.400]  and on i agree and i mean let me just stop you people
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:10.480]  make fun of us for this but george washington literally did that and
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:14.240]  and and right and it's not our histories even the hessian histories of
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:17.440]  him and trenton with hundreds of guys shooting at him and the bullets is
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:20.880]  flying through his hat everywhere going right through his coat
[2:13:20.880 --> 2:13:24.960]  um very true but the problem is everything the new
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:27.680]  older does touch goes to crap but at the same time
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:30.560]  maybe we deserve all this with fifty million abortions
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:33.280]  well maybe maybe we don't deserve it to be held back
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:36.560]  that's true brother the reason this is happening of course
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:42.640]  i read my bible almost every night and all throughout the history of the bible
[2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:48.400]  god's law and god's word every time his people threw him out like we've done in
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:51.680]  america we've thrown god out of this nation or set back
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:56.560]  and let it happen that god has brought his enemies upon his own people to
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:00.560]  destroy them and enslave them and that's exactly what's happening now
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:04.720]  so we better improve we better impress god right away
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:08.720]  so that he'll put his hand of protection back on america and grant us victory
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:13.840]  over his enemies and he will do that if we will just turn back to second
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:18.400]  chronicle 714 my people see their face and ask forgiveness
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:21.920]  well i i i agree with you but i think people like luke when they're
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:25.360]  threatening to frame him with bombs and send him to prison
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:28.800]  i think that does impress god because i know the spirit of these young people
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:31.920]  they're they're doing this for the right reason and they're not even afraid of
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:35.280]  death jack and i'm not either but i'm a little bit older than them
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:38.080]  and i don't want to die i want to keep fighting the enemy but if i have to i'm
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:43.360]  ready to die they just don't even care and uh...
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:47.440]  alex alex let me share something with you very very exciting
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:52.480]  you may already know this but uh... uh... my assistant carol just went to
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:57.280]  montana to meet with ron paul and all across the nation
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:01.360]  at the universities believe it or not they have these
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:05.040]  uh... students for ron paul coming together
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:11.520]  and they had a thousand plus students there at the montana university
[2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:15.760]  uh... for ron paul and it's really exciting to see these young people who
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:20.800]  have most of them have marxist college professors that try to turn them into
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:25.120]  new world order uh... citizens but they're rebelling
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:29.200]  and they're going and they're trying to work to help get ron paul and his
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:31.840]  president they see him as the only
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:35.760]  solution to getting our leadership back in this nation
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:40.960]  and so it's very exciting to see our police officers and soldiers waking up
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:45.360]  as we hear from them here and our students are beginning to wake up
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:49.120]  absolutely and and and jack i've got to leave it and they're getting in college
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:52.800]  i've got to leave it right there but you're right people say even if he
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:56.800]  doesn't win the presidency this has been a gateway to wake up tens of millions
[2:15:56.800 --> 2:16:01.600]  of young people and it's another great victory jack fire out the website
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:07.840]  okay yes uh... well it's police and military against the new world order
[2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:13.040]  dot com and you put a hyphen between each word police and military against the

[2:16:43.360 --> 2:16:46.560]  chris jones that the judge will just let him out a lot
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:50.640]  of us have written letters to the judge yeah folks for those that don't know his

[2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:12.320]  but it's it's a culmination of all the

[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:18.160]  compounded on top of each other how they relate to each other
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:21.800]  what civil liberties they affect and what the people can do

[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:33.880]  because you're great but I'm saying that there are other documentaries out there that may
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:39.800]  not present solutions to the audience action items things for them to go out and do and
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:44.640]  actually combat what we're talking about and I think that's the real difference here is
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:49.640]  we're you know we're seeing a lot of people buying this because they can show it to their
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:54.760]  friends and not only does it convince their friends of what's going on but it it sort
[2:25:54.760 --> 2:26:02.040]  of lifts that veil of secrecy and doom and gloom and presents them with some solutions
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:07.080]  that they can go out and actively participate in themselves and you know as well as I do
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:12.600]  you know the we've got to keep active no matter what you're doing no matter whether
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:16.720]  you're showing this thing to friends pulling it up on the internet sending out the emails
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:22.600]  blogging about it whatever all of that helps to spread the message all of that brings awareness
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:26.640]  to the project all that helps you know helps this movement because that's what this is
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:32.800]  developing into is a nationwide movement to restore the United States Constitution through
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:39.920]  our House of Representatives continue that show continue I mean break down how you tie
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:44.000]  together this grid they're building to really prove to people that they're butchering the
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.040]  bill of rights because you because you show this is what the bill of rights says this
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:54.240]  is how our country's always operated now they're changing that illegally well you know the
[2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:58.400]  USA Patriot Act is a good example people know that it's bad and then the rest of the people
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:02.240]  out there the other 95% just support it because the president said it was you know what we
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.080]  needed to protect the country the law enforcement officers everybody out there supports this
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:11.440]  USA Patriot Act not even understanding that first of all it was drafted by viet din who
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:15.840]  was a communist and second of all it's not even the original bill it was switched at
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:20.560]  the last minute with the viet bin communist version of the bill so I mean this is a really
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:24.880]  good example of some some information that people may not be all that we're you know
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:34.520]  aware of we you know the USA Patriot Act removed about six you know six of our amendments
[2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:39.240]  to the bill of rights that's a lot and it didn't stop there it you know they they continued
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:43.520]  with but we've got to remove habeas corpus we've got to remove posicomitatus we've got
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:48.240]  to invade your business records and your banking records and your medical privacy I don't
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:54.520]  think that the American people have a really firm grasp that they are having every aspect
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.120]  of their right to privacy absolutely invaded because that's what this is about and more
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:03.280]  than that your film focuses heavily in on that also focuses in on all the other police
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:09.360]  state aspects of PDD 51 and the john warner defense authorization act I mean they're openly
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:13.200]  building FEMA camps they're openly saying they're getting ready for martial law everything
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:19.000]  we warn people about with the guest we had and covert experts and secret documents 10
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.960]  1520 3040 years ago it's all coming to fruition you know they're bringing the crops in now
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:30.720]  I mean this is a massive program and your film covers that absolutely and you know we
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:36.080]  got a great outpouring from the showing that we had last week on or it was this past weekend
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:40.240]  on free speech TV with people calling us up and just letting us know that they're going
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:43.280]  to support us and that they're going to get this information out there to other people
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:47.120]  we'd love to hear from you so you know the phone calls and emails don't let that stop
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:52.040]  you know keep it up and email your friends and and you know tell them what's going on
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:56.040]  because obviously this is a documentary that you know just a little different than some
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:28:59.960]  of the other ones we have to choose from out there absolutely William Lewis I want to have

[2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:05.440]  now finally caught up with us in the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already
[2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:09.720]  being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months
[2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:13.240]  it's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to
[2:30:13.240 --> 2:30:17.520]  make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether remember
[2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:21.480]  our trade deficit trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now
[2:30:21.480 --> 2:30:26.400]  rushing in to buy our food production at any price by late summer if not early fall it
[2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:30.160]  is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial

[2:32:45.600 --> 2:33:03.960]  online today we got text Mars in studio next week first learned about Michael A. Hoffman's
[2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:11.400]  work from text about 12 years ago gave me some of his books I've read quite a few of
[2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:17.400]  them and he's only with us for an hour today he'll be with us for two hours coming up the
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:21.160]  next few months I want to get him on because there's so many subjects and things he researches
[2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:26.360]  that I'm interested in and he's actually a good researcher he's actually very gentlemanly
[2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:32.600]  very intelligent and focuses in on things that he can prove and documented and does
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:36.680]  in a very even-handed way a lot of people ask why don't you have this person or that
[2:33:36.680 --> 2:33:42.280]  person on to talk about some of the same issues Mr. Hoffman does I don't because it just it's
[2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:49.080]  done so shoddily and it's it's it's it's done so mindlessly that a lot of times those people
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:52.800]  that turns out are working for the other side but we'll talk to Mr. Hoffman about a host
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:59.160]  of issues coming up here in just a few minutes before we do that I want to invite all the

[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:21.080]  saying there won't be any food for you but we're saying food prices would explode and that some
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:25.640]  things would be hard to get and then if there's a financial collapse then you could not you know
[2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:30.840]  end up not having enough food that's my main reason is the financial threat of collapse that's coming

[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:29.800]  make this show possible and we appreciate you supporting them okay going to our guest I have
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:36.120]  researched a lot of the claims of Michael A. Hoffman and he was educated at state university
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:40.920]  New York College he's a former reporter for the New York Bureau of the Associated Press and other
[2:36:40.920 --> 2:36:49.320]  publications the author of several books and articles including the UK based magazine 14 times
[2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:57.640]  and he's moved from New York to Idaho in 1996 he now writes just on a whole host of subjects the
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:04.280]  occult the roots of Freemasonry white slaves you name it we're going to be talking about some of
[2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:11.640]  that today with him but but like I said I read other books by people similar to Mr. Hoffman
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:19.400]  and it just turned out being kooky or lies or weird or exaggerated or you know just just very
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:26.120]  vitriolic very tribalistic very isolated little niches who all fight with other camps that are
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:30.840]  even very similar to themselves I'm just looking at his stuff I just found that it's very well
[2:37:30.840 --> 2:37:35.720]  researched and that's why even you know mainstream people that don't like Hoffman have to admit that
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:40.200]  he's accurate so that's why we've got him here because he's serious and we really appreciate
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:46.120]  him coming on Mr. Hoffman good to have you on with us thank you Alex it's good to be here
[2:37:47.160 --> 2:37:52.680]  there's a lot to talk about today a subject I've talked about because I've seen it in history books
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:58.520]  quite a bit know quite a bit about it but it seems like I tell the public about it and I think I'm
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:02.920]  lying then I read some of your writings about it on your site and and and some of the things you
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:09.000]  recommended and it was even more pervasive than I thought and that was white slaves and we never
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:13.560]  seemed to hear about the white slaves let's start there then get into the new world order the whole
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:19.800]  occult system their twilight language the things you discovered well the first thing about white
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:24.520]  slaves is we need to differentiate between the modern understanding of it and then the
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:30.120]  frame of reference that I'm dealing with most people when they hear about white slavery they
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:35.880]  think you're talking about prostitution and that's of course a valid area of study we know that the
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:42.760]  Israelis have a large slave market there for people who have been sexually enslaved but that's
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:48.360]  not my bailiwick what I'm concerned about is the enslavement of whites both in Great Britain
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:54.440]  and in colonial America and you're absolutely right this is an obscure if not entirely unknown
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:39:01.000]  theme in American history the reasons for that are multifarious but let's start at the beginning
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:07.800]  at the beginning you had a surplus population in England now just the word surplus is a pejorative
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:12.760]  because the population of white people should not be any kind of a problem if you have a large
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:18.200]  population you should be able to utilize them especially in a wealthy country such as
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:24.840]  Great Britain but there's no question that the theoreticians of predatory capitalism saw the poor
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:30.760]  whites as being a surplus and the question was what to do with them hence Australia New Zealand
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:39.080]  the US Canada yes but we're going back to prior to discovery and exploration of of Canada and
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:43.640]  Australia although Australia would become a white slave dumping ground after the American
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:50.120]  revolution succeeded but prior to that when you saw the beginning of the enclosure laws
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:56.840]  it started under Henry the eighth as he began to take over the monastic lands and the lands that
[2:39:56.840 --> 2:40:03.960]  historically had represented the divide between the church and the king and as he usurped that
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:10.840]  role for himself you began to see avarice take hold in Great Britain as it seldom had in its past
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:19.000]  and they began roping in and fencing in these large commons as they were known where hyper feudalism
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:24.600]  there would be large areas around each town that people communally used and they up the feudalism
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:33.160]  and even took that exactly because feudalism the term is also considered to be pejorative but
[2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:39.640]  at least in the sense that the peasant in the Catholic middle ages of Great Britain was dressed
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:47.240]  in his own nice wool clothing he had a sheep or a few sheep to raise he had a standard of living
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:54.200]  that existed without usury and without inflation and he was able to live a type of a life once
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:59.640]  predatory capitalism began to build and it wasn't a sudden phenomenon it was gradual of course and
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:06.280]  Henry the eighth was himself conflicted about it but we really see it come on with the victory of
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:11.320]  what i regard to be the predatory capitalist which is the rise of the reign of queen elizabeth
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:17.400]  the first now she's a heroine in modern american media and in europe and in the cinnamon so forth
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:22.440]  but there's a huge disparity between the documentary record on her and what the media
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:28.440]  portrays her as by these attractive actresses and she's supposed to be sort of a a free thinker as
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:34.600]  she was nothing of the kind but the enclosure laws really came into force under her and they
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:41.560]  would continue to do so successfully with with each aristocratic regime that came to the fore in
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:47.480]  Great Britain and what this meant was you needed a political theory to go along with it to go along
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:53.160]  with how we were going to deal with these surplus whites who were being pushed off the land and
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:59.240]  driven into the cities largely london and from that we can go back as far as heichlet who is
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:06.120]  called a geographer but that's actually a euphemism for political scientist and even more than that
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:11.080]  but heichlet is known to be a geographer and he's the one and we see them to develop what we call
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:17.400]  eugenics today and we i mean i'm gonna see if you agree with this and that uh literally the whole
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  system they built then you have the malthusian view uh that came a little bit later about everything
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:29.000]  about the state controlling these horrible dirty ruffians and exterminating them please continue
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:35.720]  yes uh malphus uh ta reverend thomas malphus is at the turn of the 18th and beginning of the 19th
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:41.480]  centuries uh but you're correct malphus was also part of this chain of transmission because what he
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:48.680]  was doing was he was saying that population is a problem now what's unusual about that is usually
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:54.440]  when someone is talking about demographics and an enemy's demographics they say well the enemy
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:43:01.800]  has too many people but for a nation to regard its own people as an enemy this is largely
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:07.080]  unprecedented in the west and here we see a revolutionary break between what western civilization
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:12.680]  had originally nurtured under christianity and what was beginning to emerge with the rise of
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:17.640]  usury and predatory capitalism now now let me stop you want to be clear here you're not a
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:23.640]  communist uh from what i've read of yourself you're explaining the different forms of capitalism
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:30.760]  a strip mining of the society a predator class where they feed on the lower population you're
[2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:37.560]  saying this is a period of blooming of that mindset we didn't have the club of rome 1993 document
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:43.080]  written by richard and haas reissued last year by the council on foreign relations publicly i don't
[2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:49.400]  know if you've seen this mr hoffman but he's this is public he says we must have a unifying order
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:55.720]  terrorism will be one branch and environmentalism the other for the elite to use it and designate
[2:43:55.720 --> 2:44:03.640]  the world population as the enemy humanity the enemy with us the managers managing it's incredible
[2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:09.480]  quotes have you seen those i have not but what you're describing is basically a symptom an extreme
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:15.320]  symptom of the final fulfillment of what i'm talking about in its mid-state okay please continue
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:21.800]  with the history i appreciate it go ahead but thomas malthus in the late 18th century saw the
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:27.400]  surplus whites as being a problem now he did not advocate birth control because great britain at
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:33.800]  that time was just too christian and contraception as my late colleague charles proven pointed out
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:40.200]  historically was seen as a form of as equivalent to sodomy or abortion so it was literally impossible
[2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:46.600]  for a clergyman to advocate contraception so what he advocated was this complex system of celibacy
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:51.720]  and bachelorhood which obviously wasn't going to work but and that was an also crowding people
[2:44:51.720 --> 2:44:57.400]  together to and and spreading disease yeah yeah and that's what was happening in london but also
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:04.600]  in london from the elizabethan age onward the the london mob as it was called had a revolutionary
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:10.760]  potential great britain to its credit had no standing army it had no police force and there
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:16.600]  was a very thin line that stood between the ruling monarch and the people and the london mob
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:22.120]  was an obstreperous and vigorous group of people at any time they were capable of overthrowing
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:26.840]  the government and that went back that went back to the magna carta that went back to the magna
[2:45:26.840 --> 2:45:33.640]  carta and so what we began to see was the criminalization of the white population of the major
[2:45:33.640 --> 2:45:40.280]  cities of great britain and scotland as well scotland coming more to the four in the 17th century
[2:45:40.280 --> 2:45:46.280]  where you had now people have asked me what's the basis of the law here the law here was ad hoc
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:52.120]  the law was to take what we're what we see with the new world order in the united states today
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:57.400]  is to take one law and misapply it and where i find the beginnings of white slave law
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:46:03.400]  is number one in the enclosures which drove them out but the actual weaponization of the
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:10.120]  enclosures that law relates to pressing or the press games and once again our media has dealt
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:15.880]  with this inadequately they almost make it romantic the sailors were forced on to the ships and then
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:20.760]  they got gangs well and and and i want to be clear about this because you have scientifically
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:25.240]  broken down and written about what i organically recognize they want to get you on welfare get
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:28.840]  you in the psychiatric system or get you in the criminal justice system or get you in debt
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:33.000]  the form of slavery you're talking about is what the british really invented in a modern sense
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:38.520]  would be the the debtor's prison where oh you and now they're saying under homeland security bad
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:44.600]  credit you'll have a bad security rating this is the new system where they create economic uh
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:50.840]  suppression to get control of you and then get you into the system by giving you some type of
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:56.760]  criminal designation right because what they did was they pauperized the yeomanry the yeomanry
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:03.320]  were willing to work they had worked for hundreds of years sharing the commons hurting their sheep
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:10.680]  and making at least a subsistence living and uh then they were pauperized forced into the city
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:16.760]  and then labeled as criminals and then you had the press gangs sweeping them up and the press
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:24.120]  gangs operated in in two ways initially they operated to populate these very early settlements
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:31.400]  in north america and then later on they were used militarily uh to fill the ranks of the army
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:38.440]  and the navy but it began with getting settlers to go to places like north america which north
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:46.360]  america in the 17th century was regarded as an extremely hostile place and for example i have
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:52.120]  traced back to some of the early english literature where a convict had a choice of being sentenced
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:59.320]  to transportation that was the euphemism for white slavery or to being hanged at tyburn and he said
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:04.120]  i've already talked to people who have been transported i've i've read some of the letters
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.600]  i've heard about what happened to them i would rather suffocate at rather suffer suffocation
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:15.800]  at tyburn gallows for a minute or two then a lifetime of slavery in the colonies so here was
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:21.320]  a realization of two points one that it was a living death over there and two that it wasn't
[2:48:21.320 --> 2:48:28.040]  seven years of indentured servitude polishing the master silverware in the big house and then
[2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:34.680]  being released as we're told uh that that applied more to indentured servitude which was a separate
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:39.880]  system we're talking about the mainline historians report that black slaves generally because they
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:45.000]  were pure property were better treated than white slaves because the white slaves you didn't even
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:50.680]  have to feed them you just let them die yeah the the white the white slaves were treated much worse
[2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:58.200]  we even have as recently as the uh 1840s and 50s when frederick law ombstead the architect of central
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:04.280]  park went down south and wrote his classic work about his tour of the south and he was watching
[2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:10.680]  a barge uh being loaded up with bales from a ship that had come in at the port of new orleans
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:16.280]  and he saw that the bales were being thrown recklessly down into the barge and the uh white
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:20.920]  men who were stacking the bales were at risk of serious injury and he asked the overseer what
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:26.280]  was going on and he said oh they're just patties meaning irish men he said they're not worth anything
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:32.040]  we can always replace them and uh ombstead asked him well what if they were blacks and he said well
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:37.240]  they cost us money we would have had to take in much greater care but of course when you're talking
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:43.240]  about slavery in america alex you have to be careful because the situation changes dramatically
[2:49:43.240 --> 2:49:47.560]  from century to century that's right they actually trick the whites to go along with it because
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:52.440]  they at least quote were above the blacks and then it gets more sophisticated please continue
[2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:59.320]  but in the 17th century uh you had different you had even different crops that the uh white slaves
[2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:04.920]  had to work as opposed to the black slaves the white slaves were working after they did the
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:11.240]  land clearing and land clearing is is the most onerous labor that you can engage in on the
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:17.080]  frontier draining the swamps cutting down trees with hand axes and after all of that
[2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:23.560]  backbreaking labor was completed then you had to tend to the tobacco crops and the sugar crops the
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:28.760]  sugar mostly in the west indies the tobacco yeah the way they described the white slaves was
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:36.040]  it was like putting a goat out to mow your yawn they would just throw them out and hey survive
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:41.480]  you form something then we'll move in behind you with the black slaves uh stay there um
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:47.800]  michael hoppin is our guest give you his website a lot more we're gonna get into the occult globalist

[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:08.280]  more of your study of how the elite control us that's why they're the elite I mean they're into
[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:13.480]  how to control societies how to propagandize the average person's into wanting to have a new coat or
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:18.040]  eat a big meal or have a girlfriend or go to the you know go to the Bahamas once a year or
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:24.280]  maybe just stay out of prison and they rule over us the next hour when I get into what their mindset
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:29.640]  is what you believe they're planning and how the whole Germanic death cult occultism ties in
[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:37.160]  with the cabalistic mysticism of the Jews because people all say it's either a totally
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:43.000]  Zionist thing or it's a Catholic thing or it's a from when I studied it's it's a satanic thing but
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:50.200]  we'll get your whole analysis of that sir but but finishing up with the white slaves well we were
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:56.600]  talking about their use initially in colonial America for land clearing and this stoop labor
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:56:01.880]  and only afterwards were the blacks brought in and of course I don't want to minimize in any way
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:08.520]  the pain suffering and hardship that black people endured as chattel slaves in America the thing is
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:12.760]  that most of us are aware of that very few of us are aware of what the whites went through when
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:18.760]  congressman david wilmott and the free soil party through its support behind abraham lincoln
[2:56:18.760 --> 2:56:24.120]  and the reason that they did so was that they were very worried that the southern plantation
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:29.160]  owners were going to put blacks in black slaves in oregon and california and they wanted to
[2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:35.880]  reserve the west for free white labor and they called themselves the free soil party and congressman
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:42.920]  david wilmott the sons of toil and nowadays when someone raises a shirt in a movie and shows
[2:56:42.920 --> 2:56:48.440]  whiplashes on his back it's usually a black man who's been abused by a white overseer alex
[2:56:48.440 --> 2:56:53.720]  but i can assure you in colonial america and i've documented it that there were many hundreds
[2:56:53.720 --> 2:56:58.600]  of white men who also had those whiplashes on their back and of course we know in the military
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:04.920]  and in the navy they received fatal whiplashing up to 200 lashes well that's something that i got
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:10.040]  you know really into just uh... it would be so interesting was the naval histories of the
[2:57:10.040 --> 2:57:15.720]  napoleonic wars the sea battles british naval history and that was some of the big reforms
[2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:20.840]  in england that finally ended pressing was that the uh... the the midshipmen the officers
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:25.560]  would just uh... i think your cordless phone's cutting out there my friend if you've got a
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:30.520]  regular line be better would would just walk around for no reason beating people with whips
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:35.960]  not just for cat or nine to help punishment go ahead well of course uh... the service in the navy
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:41.880]  which is especially the napoleonic era navy which is made to be so very romantic now in movies like
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:47.320]  master and commander uh... you couldn't get guys to serve on those ships so you had to press them

[2:57:57.800 --> 2:58:03.400]  over except for one brief of conversation between the ship's doctor and the captain

[2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:15.240]  press ganged white slaves on board that ship but my point i was trying to make earlier alex was that

[3:00:07.960 --> 3:00:14.360]  michael hoffman former reporter new york bureau of associated press other major publications
[3:00:14.360 --> 3:00:19.880]  award-winning historian highly respected judges will tell you about some of his books and his
[3:00:19.880 --> 3:00:28.600]  website you'd like to check it out or learn more revisionist history dot org is one of the sites
[3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:36.280]  we have links to that up on info wars dot com right now yeah being a history buff because
[3:00:36.280 --> 3:00:41.720]  it's so entertaining i mean i got into history because it's uh better than fiction i mean the
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:48.360]  slave ships the beating the people the uh killing the white slaves the white slaves all over the
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:55.000]  us all over australia uh you were allowed to kill them but not kill the black slaves but see they
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:59.160]  can't allow that out in the news because then whites and blacks wouldn't hate each other
[3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:04.840]  blacks wouldn't feel especially downtrodden in second class wouldn't imagine every white person
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:11.240]  was their slave owner when really a few percentage points of whites even own black slaves um going
[3:01:11.240 --> 3:01:15.400]  back to michael hoffman finishing up on this subject then i want to get in to the roots of
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:19.640]  the new world order the occult empire this amalgamation of groups what you believe is the
[3:01:19.640 --> 3:01:24.440]  heart of it sir but uh anything else you wanted to add about white slaves and bringing it up to
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:29.960]  modern times well i think that you're right about racial reconciliation i believe that the people
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:35.080]  are trying to harm blacks in america the ones who are trying to establish some sort of genetic
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:41.880]  predisposition for enslavement and being passive in this way and uh once you've done that then you
[3:01:41.880 --> 3:01:47.800]  are controlling the minds of black people because you're giving them a permanent subservient status
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:54.280]  and a permanent stigma of racial resentment against the white master when that hasn't been the
[3:01:54.280 --> 3:02:00.360]  case and the definition the very definition of the word slave comes from the root of the word
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:07.240]  slab because it was the slabs of eastern europe and russia who had been hereditary slaves uh for
[3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:12.760]  various uh economic and political reasons well if you read the bible with the israelites of the
[3:02:12.760 --> 3:02:17.800]  or the romans or anybody else there were slaves of every color there were slaves of every color
[3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:23.400]  and when we get deeper into this subject we will also talk about how the midrash and rabbi
[3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:29.800]  moses mamamadis caused black people to be associated with ham and that the curse and
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:34.840]  genesis on ham was made a racial curse and for those who know their bible they know of course
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:40.680]  that there is no racial component to the curse on ham and genesis that and then that was used to
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:46.440]  kick off the transatlantic slave trade in the mid 15th hundreds into the 1600s and provide the
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:52.200]  justification for it yes absolutely uh now i want to be clear about this because blacks feel
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:58.200]  victimized they feel like a subgroup and and all whiteies must pay listen to obrach Obama's
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:03.480]  preacher the blue-eyed devil and if you look historically in numbers there have been more
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:08.280]  white slaves than there have been black slaves now now again this is the modern way of thinking
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:12.840]  that doesn't lessen what happened to them it's just like again if there's two bank robbers you're not
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:18.040]  saying one's innocent and the other isn't it's saying that that that this is a button they have
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.920]  installed in the psyche of blacks where the government the nanny state can play the part
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:27.720]  of the provider when really they're carrying out eugenics operations against them well you
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:33.640]  mentioned the the elite and how the people who are not a leader mostly uh concerned with uh animal
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:38.920]  appetites whereas the elite is concerned with control but anyone who aspires to become elite
[3:03:38.920 --> 3:03:45.240]  or get into the elite hopefully for benevolent reasons and not predatory ones understands what
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:50.680]  maybe a lot of civil rights activists do not understand that if you don't take responsibility
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:55.720]  for your life if you don't blame your life on yourself or take credit for your achievements
[3:03:55.720 --> 3:04:02.040]  on yourself you can't get ahead your psychologically crippled and yet we see this covert mechanism
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:07.400]  in american society where blacks are told to blame others that's not a way for them to get
[3:04:07.400 --> 3:04:12.680]  ahead it's a way to keep them out of the elite second point here alex when you mentioned uh
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:19.560]  barack obama's preacher uh one of the things that troubles me about all of the negativity
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:26.360]  that's associated with that is why is there not a commensurate amount of fury and media angst
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:33.640]  about john mccain's preacher john hagi who is a man who uh is forms what i call q cluck
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:39.720]  judyism and no i agree stay there well we actually expose the fact that he says jesus is the messiah
[3:04:39.720 --> 3:04:43.480]  and that works being israel is the new religion we'll be right back with our guest stay with us

[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:29.640]  intriguing uh and then i want to get him back for a full two hours the next month or so and

[3:08:33.240 --> 3:08:39.320]  about some of the books you've written the website alex is revisionist history dot or g
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:44.200]  and some of the books are such as the one we've been discussing they were white and they were
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:49.160]  slaves the untold history of the enslavement of whites in early america and industrial britain
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:56.200]  secret societies and psychological warfare and i'm just finishing up a 900 page book judyism
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:09:04.600]  discovered you also wrote uh judyism strange gods judyism strange gods in 2000 which was a
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:12.040]  groundwork for an introduction to the religion of judyism this 900 page book i style an introduction
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:17.560]  it's a vast subject so even this large tome is still an introduction but i'm gonna have you on
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:20.360]  i'm gonna have you on about that because people are fascinated with it and it's important to
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:25.240]  understand our society and these cultures how they've grown together uh let's continue to get
[3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:29.800]  into you were talking about pastor hagi when we hit the last break well i just think that john
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:36.360]  mccain is getting a free ride here obama is is got to answer and continue to answer for uh his
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:41.960]  preacher as he should certainly absolutely uh he should be responsible for this man's remark
[3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:47.080]  well it hasn't been brought up about clinton and pardoning the weatherman i mean it's just it's
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:54.120]  look rush limbaugh is calling for riots and burning cars and death uh at the dnc they just want
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:10:00.040]  crisis crisis crisis but i'll go ahead and talk about hagi well you know it's interesting i believe
[3:10:00.040 --> 3:10:06.200]  that uh it mccain is the candidate of the cryptocracy i think that hillary is their fallback
[3:10:06.200 --> 3:10:12.200]  and certainly they could deal with obama if they process them sufficiently but i'm a long time
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:17.640]  student of the israeli media and i know from the israeli media and from my own informants
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:23.640]  and counterintelligence that we have operating inside zionism and so forth that we see that
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:30.360]  they're very much in favor of john mccain they're worried about obama and uh they would and and
[3:10:30.360 --> 3:10:35.640]  clinton is acceptable so when you understand that you understand how the media is treating mccain
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:42.360]  as far as i'm concerned he's getting a free ride on hagi because hagi and in my judgment is a far
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:48.680]  more sinister character well hagi is like a cartoon character i mean i mean statements like he
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:53.880]  praises god when palisthenics children are shot and jesus is the messiah i mean even if you're an
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:11:00.520]  atheist you have to know that that's asinine for a supposed Protestant preacher to be saying jesus
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:07.000]  was basically a bad guy and it was a rebellious person i mean and then he goes to the uh different
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:14.760]  adl meetings and apologizes for being a christian it's it's saddening so why aren't we seeing that
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:19.640]  question that you've just formulated put in front of john mccain why aren't we seeing investigative
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:25.160]  reports in the washington post wall street journal the new york times along these lines were not
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:30.120]  they're protecting him from the fall out there there is some token criticism and some token
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:35.640]  references but nothing like obama is facing with his preacher so i think the disparity between the
[3:11:35.640 --> 3:11:40.760]  two is very instructive well i agree with you i want to go to the root of this next time we have
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:45.880]  you on we'll do two three hours to really cover all of this to go back to the roots of a cult
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:49.400]  because we can say the roots of the new world order in egypt we can say babelon we can say
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:54.760]  solomon's temple but that was borrowing from the previous myths uh we know i mean from my
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:58.680]  studying in the new world order reading history books and and and and you know reading really uh
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:03.960]  you know things that are you know little known but admitted historical facts that you have this
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:10.840]  weird obsession with with germanic power you've got then also the royal family of england the german
[3:12:10.840 --> 3:12:16.760]  royal family believing that they are really israelites uh you you've then got uh the you know
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:23.640]  supposed uh mainline jews or really uh central european or eastern european uh you've then got
[3:12:23.640 --> 3:12:29.240]  their weird behavior radiating the jewish children who were sephardic seems there's a war against the
[3:12:29.240 --> 3:12:34.840]  brown jews uh you've then got weird zionists supporting hitler uh to the degree of not letting
[3:12:34.840 --> 3:12:39.560]  jews get out of the country uh it's just there's so many weird similarities we know the germanic
[3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:45.000]  cultures and the and the britannic cultures you know merged with a lot of the judaic stuff
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:49.960]  thousands of years ago but from as a historian studying this i mean when you get to the end of
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:56.280]  the day isn't it a cultist that run it and then you've got two big branches that have grown together
[3:12:56.280 --> 3:13:02.200]  and are basically like the rothschilds i see them as almost inseparable from you know the crazy uh
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:09.320]  leadership this germanic and britain and then so to me it's like a sub predator group above
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:14.520]  another predator group i mean what's the real hierarchy according to michael hoffman well first
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:19.240]  of all i want to define our terms we want to go to first principles because when you talk about a
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:24.280]  cult you start to turn off one section of the audience who thinks that you're misdefying political
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:30.600]  science and current events and i don't think either one of us is doing that because a cult
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:36.040]  when i'm talking about it is the science of mind control and arthur c clark who just recently
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:42.120]  passed away in shrillanka defined any sufficiently advanced technology as having the appearance of
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:49.480]  magic and so for various reasons the elites have both wanted to manipulate religions and mystify
[3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:57.320]  issues as well as keep alive the mind control system which goes into the eternal pagan psychodrama
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:04.600]  and from that exploit nations and people but you have given us a cornucopia of conspiracies
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:10.920]  and actors in the conspiracy but i would say we can reduce it to the way christ reduced it you're
[3:14:10.920 --> 3:14:17.640]  either christ or your antichrist there is good and there is evil and i don't believe in existential
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:24.360]  shades of gray in this so we can talk about a whole plethora of people nations and individuals
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:31.640]  who are involved but we can also track this in a system how it originated where it came from and i
[3:14:31.640 --> 3:14:38.680]  would say that the cradle of it is egypt the talmud says nine tenths of the sorcery uh...
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:45.880]  that uh... the evil one had he gave to egypt one tenth went to the other nations and actually
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:50.360]  that was a left-handed compliment on the part of the talmudic rabbis because they're into
[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:56.040]  sorcery and it was uh... an indicator one of many that they wanted to study and master
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:01.800]  what egypt had and from egypt to babelon from babelon to the and let's be clear this isn't
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:07.800]  just ugabuga this is how to know with mathematics when the next eclipse is coming to freak out
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:12.280]  everybody because the high priest can tell you a year before when it's going to happen
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:16.280]  that that's where this it's you know that's why they built big buildings it's
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:21.880]  it's it's it's a whole system of shocking and making the people feel small and the government
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:27.720]  and those that run the seats of power as being gods well egyptian archioastronomy which you're
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:33.960]  referring to and mystical topotomy in terms of the buildings and how they're situated is well known
[3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:41.080]  but it seems to me that the manipulation of words and the notion that words had power
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:46.440]  and how they were to be utilized is lesser known in our circles and certainly the egyptians were
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:53.640]  masters of word manipulation and key words uh... which uh... dr carl gustav young later on in
[3:15:53.640 --> 3:15:59.160]  the twentieth century would talk about in terms of archetypes which can trigger reactions in people
[3:15:59.160 --> 3:16:03.960]  so that's the other aspect of it and see that's it so so like the atheist world which the globalist
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:09.080]  have made the latest a blind them to the real sciences that this is really a science even
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:14.040]  if you don't believe there's a spirit behind it the elites the ancient elites of five thousand
[3:16:14.040 --> 3:16:19.080]  years ago they figured out how to literally program people and that's why they're occult
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:24.600]  practitioners because that's really what it is and that programming and that pyramidal structure
[3:16:24.600 --> 3:16:30.520]  continues in our society today yes man you're amazing i've got to have you up for two three
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:35.880]  four hours if you'll do it with us but but please continue and so when we get into the western
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:42.680]  secret societies we see an anomaly because it emerges in the renaissance where you have a group
[3:16:42.680 --> 3:16:49.560]  of avant-garde thinkers who were beginning to believe that they needed to study the cabala
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:56.040]  they needed to study judyism in order to advance the concept of human brotherhood and yet the
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:17:01.560]  anomaly in the high irony here is is that this is when they began to pick up the idea
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:07.560]  that black people were genetically predisposed to enslavement because as they studied the cabala
[3:17:07.560 --> 3:17:13.080]  and the talmud and they had been led to believe by various occult pied pipers that they were going
[3:17:13.080 --> 3:17:19.000]  to find a human brotherhood theme in those texts just as freemasonry let me stop you we now move
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:24.760]  forward to the talmud and the zohar because the jews had been in egypt they'd also been in Babylon
[3:17:24.760 --> 3:17:30.840]  so they had been in all the different schools as wanderers picking it all up yes the mission of
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:37.640]  the first part of the talmud which has existed in oral form in jesus time and then after israel
[3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:42.440]  rejected its messiah and became much more corrupt as a result it was finally committed to writing
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:49.080]  that was done in Babylon in the second third and fourth centuries ad and as a result of that they
[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:55.320]  did pick up by a process of osmosis a great deal of the paganism that was around them so that
[3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:00.280]  the talmud and the cabala the mission of the gamara the zohar the suffriets are on these other
[3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:06.120]  texts are brimming with uh... uh... with a cult concepts and themes and this is what i bring out
[3:18:06.120 --> 3:18:11.960]  in my book that basically judeism far from being an old testament religion that clings to the old
[3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:18.840]  covenant and reject christ is actually an ossified form of Babylonian paganism and this is what
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:23.640]  infiltrated the west particularly in the renaissance that had always been gestating there
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:28.520]  but it only came into full bloom in the renaissance and then of course in early modern europe
[3:18:28.520 --> 3:18:33.320]  it came to fruition in the various uh... rosa crucian and freemasonic cult
[3:18:33.320 --> 3:18:36.520]  which aren't just about having sex orgies and pentagrams
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:42.440]  it's all the whole science of word smithing manipulation brainwashing mass programming
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:48.120]  how to control societies and that's why when you get to the top level it doesn't matter whether
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:53.080]  in my research whether it's the ss or the zionist it's all the exact same people at the top
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:59.240]  worshipping the same thing well you especially see this level of sophistication and a mathematician
[3:18:59.240 --> 3:19:04.840]  who was astrologer royal to queen elizabeth dr john d are the author of many important
[3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:11.240]  mathematical texts which to this day are referred to and yet he was the developer of this
[3:19:11.240 --> 3:19:17.320]  uh... scrying concept of concept of a secret alphabet he actually claimed to have contacted
[3:19:17.320 --> 3:19:25.320]  extra human uh... deities with whom he was in contact with uh... his uh... his allies there
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:29.480]  in the royal court of england and i think that's not what we got a break final segment
[3:19:29.480 --> 3:19:31.560]  we're gonna have to have him back up very soon
[3:19:31.560 --> 3:19:35.240]  you understand ladies and gentlemen doesn't matter if you don't believe they believe
[3:19:35.240 --> 3:19:38.280]  and they built the world the civilization you live in
[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:44.040]  and they believe that their great day of mass extermination is coming for you and your family

[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:15.640]  the uh second half of the show really slowly go through all this history
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:22.840]  but i guess the last five minutes we've got with him i'll just let him talk about whatever he likes
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:28.120]  other than i want him to give me his take on this i don't know what his take is but i would
[3:24:28.120 --> 3:24:33.400]  imagine it's probably similar to mine because everything else seems to be similar um the globalist
[3:24:33.400 --> 3:24:40.280]  the controllers the architects they understand human activities human interactions how waves
[3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:45.240]  and a pond work and so they've designed it where if you fight one of their mechanisms it's built to
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:50.520]  actually empower them and make them stronger unless you strike at the root of it like i've
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:55.960]  say you attack zionism well their own documents say it only makes their people support them more
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:59.960]  thinking that they're being abused from outside kind of like if you attack corrupt police
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:04.760]  in a wrong way which i do all the time out of primitiveness that actually compacts them more
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:09.960]  into their gang mentality but but then if you give people wide spectrum that know at the highest
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:16.200]  level it isn't even one group it's a mindset a belief then people can suddenly unlock that kind
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:20.440]  of what he was saying about slavery it's important to understand that whites were slaves too because
[3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:25.960]  then it ends this enmity and it's but that that lie was put there so that we would have enmity
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:30.680]  and and and fight with each other and so this is all i don't want to use the term delicate it's
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:36.760]  just so sophisticated that i can see it but it's hard to even articulate i guess that's why he writes
[3:25:36.760 --> 3:25:43.400]  900 page books do you agree with the statement i just made well yes i do i i would articulate it
[3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:48.840]  as not fighting with carnal weapons uh... we know from oklahoma city that the system loves
[3:25:48.840 --> 3:25:54.120]  violence they love that mcvay and the conspiracy behind him attack that building bill clinton
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:59.000]  was able to add a number of orwellian police state laws and of course we know what happened
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:05.800]  with the 9-11 conspiracy but i i don't believe there's any quick fix to this alex i believe
[3:26:05.800 --> 3:26:11.800]  that uh... we we need to organize we need to build our communities the reform starts with
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:19.240]  ourselves and our own lives with deep study and reflection and then having organized be more a part
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:25.720]  of our own local communities then together we can build on something with which offers a pro-life
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:30.520]  alternative to this death system that they're imposing on us and if i may i wanted to give
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:37.320]  my website one more time if that's all right sure uh... that's w w w revisionist history
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:42.840]  dot o r g now i'm going to get you on for years i don't know why i have them but here you are
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:48.200]  we're gonna have you back up it's just take the example of zionism you know you talk about how
[3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:52.680]  that's a core global system right now key to all of it going right back to the roots of egypt and
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:59.320]  babelon but then i find hundreds of times where adam gadon poses al qaeda the adl you know heads
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:05.160]  grandson adam perlman i see where they catch rabbis running white supremacist groups british
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:09.400]  intelligence german intelligence and then i see all these groups who think they're fighting
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:14.920]  this when they fight it only on that front they don't see the big picture of it's a system it's
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:20.600]  like a river cuts a grand canyon it's we're all in it we're all connected to each other
[3:27:20.600 --> 3:27:26.040]  and it's much bigger than just that group and when i try to say hey it isn't one bank robber it's
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:32.760]  ten bank robbers but they're all guilty people try to say no in fact you know it's got to be
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:37.000]  this little niche or or i say yeah the vatican's involved but they're tied in with this group they
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:41.560]  go oh now you're defending the vatican what all i'm trying to do is give people full spectrum
[3:27:41.560 --> 3:27:46.680]  do you see what i'm trying to say i think that one of the viruses or memes that's been implanted
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:53.400]  in our ranks is that there is an enemy people and whenever you go that way and i don't go that way
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:58.840]  then you're falling into their snare because the enemy is not any group of people the enemy
[3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:05.880]  is an ideology it's a spirit it's a spiritual ideology it can affect you it can affect me it
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:11.960]  can affect any nation of people no one is invulnerable to it and it's not just now showing that monkeys
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:16.600]  in one research lab five miles from another if they can teach these monkeys suddenly the other
[3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:23.720]  monkeys learn it it's like a radio waves being broadcast so much is undiscovered about the way
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:30.280]  that we are used and more and more we're discovering how what was called magic in the past is actually
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:36.760]  science today but i do want to advise people to stay away from targeting any population whether
[3:28:36.760 --> 3:28:42.760]  it's the casars the judaics the israeli the palestinians or the arab they're not the issue
[3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:49.960]  everybody is capable of having goodwill and of changing their lives the enemy is an ideology
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:55.240]  it's a spirit and if we stick to that we can win alec and the globalists you mean this evil force
[3:28:55.240 --> 3:29:01.720]  it recruits the intelligent it it it it recruits the the the creative so that's why at the highest
[3:29:01.720 --> 3:29:06.120]  places everywhere you're going to find this spirit because if you take that spirit you're given the
[3:29:06.120 --> 3:29:11.960]  earth just like the devil told jesus on the mountain yes that's true all right well we
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:18.280]  appreciate you joining us and we really appreciate the time and uh we'll talk to you next friday i'm

[3:30:54.840 --> 3:30:58.680]  for the last three years the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce
[3:30:58.680 --> 3:31:03.160]  and it has now finally caught up with us in the u.s commodities such as flour and rice are already
[3:31:03.160 --> 3:31:07.640]  being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months it's
[3:31:07.640 --> 3:31:11.320]  fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through
[3:31:11.320 --> 3:31:16.440]  the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether remember our trade deficit
[3:31:16.440 --> 3:31:20.440]  trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food
[3:31:20.440 --> 3:31:25.720]  production at any price by late summer if not early fall it is likely our government will step in

[3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:11.560]  us last january we also interviewed him here in austin of the tv show and he said with the
[3:33:11.560 --> 3:33:18.040]  that within two and a half years if the global financial order did not make some serious reforms
[3:33:18.040 --> 3:33:24.120]  we would have the hyperinflation that could lead to a worldwide depression and you can go to the
[3:33:24.120 --> 3:33:29.720]  websites info wars dot com if you want to read that article from last year he is a nobel prize
[3:33:29.720 --> 3:33:35.560]  winner in economics he is a former world bank chief economist i've i tried to go over his
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:41.320]  entire bio it would take hours but you can just google joseph stiglitz he's written quite a few
[3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:47.000]  best-selling books as well the new one the three trillion dollar war and that's just how much it
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:53.560]  costs now not to mention our good name worldwide and so i really appreciate joseph stiglitz joining
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:34:00.680]  us thank you for coming on sir nice to be here uh you were here about a year and four months ago
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:07.560]  and you laid out in 20 minutes a forecast of what indeed happened but but we've gone about 90
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:11.720]  percent near forecast i'm hoping the rest of the 10 percent isn't correct and we don't have a
[3:34:11.720 --> 3:34:19.400]  depression in another two years uh what do you see happening well actually uh the the prospects
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:25.560]  of our economy right now are not very good uh to some extent what happens depends on what the
[3:34:25.560 --> 3:34:33.320]  what the american government and other governments do uh but right now uh even the imf and i've often
[3:34:33.320 --> 3:34:39.080]  disagree with the imf but right now i think they're on target uh they are saying that the american
[3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:44.280]  economy is going to be very weak uh not only this year but next year and it won't be until
[3:34:44.840 --> 3:34:53.560]  2010 before the economy really starts to show a recovery uh part of the problem is that the current
[3:34:53.560 --> 3:34:59.480]  administration uh has been doing too little too late what they've been doing is not well designed
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:07.400]  and the fundamentals of economic policy are that it takes a while before any action that you take
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:14.680]  has full effect so uh if this administration isn't going to do anything it's going to be until the
[3:35:14.680 --> 3:35:21.560]  next administration comes into office and that means it will uh we won't begin to get the right
[3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:30.840]  medicine until uh the beginning of 2009 and that means we're talking about 2000 late 2009 2010
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:39.160]  before we start seeing a really a solid recovery now a lot of people thrown around the term depression
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:44.840]  a lot of top economists have you've used that term before a depression i guess i would be a little
[3:35:44.840 --> 3:35:52.920]  bit cautious about using that that term um i think that that we tend to you know reserve that for the
[3:35:52.920 --> 3:36:03.800]  great depression or for the kind of situation that uh was in the island of java uh in 1997 98
[3:36:03.800 --> 3:36:08.600]  right now to collapse starving but but i mean a recession you're the double president economist
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:16.120]  but tell me if i'm wrong a recession is two continual quarters uh of uh you know zero growth uh and
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:21.800]  then a depression would be how many quarters well they don't actually we usually think of a depression
[3:36:21.800 --> 3:36:28.840]  as really uh very strong negative growth for an extended period of time uh but it doesn't make
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:33.960]  any difference you know the fundamental question is whether the u.s economy is going to be performing
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:41.240]  below its potential for an extended period of time and you know on that i think there is almost
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:48.360]  unanimity now among economists that uh we're looking at what we're looking for towards an
[3:36:48.360 --> 3:36:55.080]  extended period of the economy operating below its potential and there's a very simple reason
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:37:01.080]  then and part of the reason why there's a little bit of discussion depression is that the fundamental
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:07.080]  reason for this downturn is very similar to that of the great depression weaknesses in the financial
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:15.080]  system uh the losses that are the banks are incurring and the financial system incurring
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:21.400]  are are quite literally mind boggling uh we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:29.480]  we've seen lots of write-offs and uh the imf estimates the total amount uh to be nearly a
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:36.200]  trillion dollars and then there's that cascading effect as you have the bubble popping everybody
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:43.000]  leveraged out in the western world more and more housing crises with sub primes more and more of all
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:51.080]  these instruments they're triple a rated uh i mean it's it's all leading towards i mean you said
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:58.280]  here a year ago that i mean you talked about the term depression now use i guess things are so
[3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:06.520]  serious you don't want to use that term what i'm trying to understand here is uh how we could get
[3:38:06.520 --> 3:38:12.840]  out of this where you see this hey where do you see it going with the current management uh and the
[3:38:12.840 --> 3:38:18.280]  different jockeying groups that are out there at the helm of central banks versus where you'd like
[3:38:18.280 --> 3:38:23.960]  to see it go yeah with the the basic the basic thing is that the what happens to the financial
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:31.160]  sector is not unconnected is very closely connected with the real sector uh law 3 to main street are
[3:38:31.160 --> 3:38:38.760]  very closely linked uh if as is what's happening the financial sector is having serious economic
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:46.200]  problems it has no choice but to start reigning in credit if it's not making loans uh individuals
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:51.800]  households uh firms can't do the investment that they wouldn't would otherwise have done
[3:38:51.800 --> 3:39:01.160]  as they cut back their economic activity uh the whole economy slows down and uh it eject the whole
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:08.120]  thing just sort of unravels and that's what we're beginning to see go through our economy going
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:13.160]  through now you are absolutely right and i've been talking about this actually now for several years
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:20.120]  it was so clear that we faced a housing bubble and that housing bubble was sustaining a consumption
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:27.800]  boom uh savings in the united states plummeted to zero some quarters negative it was clear that that
[3:39:27.800 --> 3:39:33.160]  was not sustainable what was going on well it's pretty simple and it's actually related to my
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:38.680]  book the three trillion dollar war where i argued that in fact uh there's not two issues in this
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:45.080]  campaign but one uh the war and the economy are very closely connected the war was having a very
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:51.400]  negative effect on the economy for a variety of reasons that i spell out the fed said uh we have
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:56.920]  to cover it up uh you know our job is to keep the economy going uh and they did it in a very
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:05.480]  short-sighted way uh they let loose a flood of liquidity and loose regulations and uh not what
[3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:11.720]  would happen was it did cover up the negative effects of the war but we were living on borrowed
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:17.720]  money and borrowed time and a day of reckoning uh had to come we couldn't predict when it was going
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:22.600]  to come but we knew that it was going to come so in layman's terms how bad is it going to get
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:27.160]  because i've had the head of the new york you know business school on i've had all these other
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:33.160]  former treasury policy heads i've had them uh you know i've had the shadow stats people on about
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:39.000]  what real inflation is like 15 now look at the food look at the oil look at the dollar plunging
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:44.040]  and then bush is out giving speeches saying we're not even in a recession he said that two days ago
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:51.000]  at the spp meeting uh you know in the north american integration i mean it's just and you know the
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:56.040]  old cliche of it's a recession of your neighbor's out of work it's a depression if you're out of work
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:41:00.760]  i mean i mean if half the social security check value has been cut in the last five years compounded
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:05.320]  and believe me i know i got families on social security uh if if people are out of work if i'm
[3:41:05.320 --> 3:41:09.880]  seeing more homeless people if there's houses going you know all over the place going under
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:15.800]  uh i mean hell this is just the beginning mr stiklitz how bad is it going to get worse i mean
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:22.600]  just to put we expect now at least in the next year about 2.2 million americans will lose their
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:28.520]  homes uh and with that much of their life savings many of these will lose their entire life savings
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:35.080]  the forecast is that housing prices already gone down 10 percent are probably going to go
[3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:42.280]  down another 10 to 20 percent uh when that happens uh we're not sure how many houses
[3:41:42.280 --> 3:41:49.960]  will be underwater but numbers 14 15 million houses households will have mortgages exceeding
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:58.200]  the value of their house um we're in for uh uh very unlikely a very uh bad time now the president
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:04.280]  is uh trying to push the problems of the economy onto the next administration just like he pushed
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:09.960]  the problem of the war onto the next administration uh i think you'd hope that the whole bubble
[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:17.560]  wouldn't break until after november 2008 but it began to unravel in august 2007 uh like so many
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:25.560]  other things in the last few years they haven't gone quite according to plan uh the the big
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:33.640]  uncertainty as i say is uh what can't what what will be done uh let me tell you what some of the
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:39.480]  things that need to be done uh we need a stimulus the president seems to think that the tax cut
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:45.080]  is the solution to all problems particularly tax cuts for the rich in fact i would argue that our
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:54.360]  current problems actually began with the 2001 tax cut that actually set us on a wrong course
[3:42:54.360 --> 3:42:59.640]  what about the argument that cutting taxes generally raises the general amount of tax
[3:42:59.640 --> 3:43:05.640]  receipts because it accelerates the economy uh you know that's this old idea of supply side
[3:43:06.200 --> 3:43:11.000]  economics it was totally discredited in the 80s and you see it right now the way that i was supposed
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:15.480]  to work is i thought increased spending i mean more more money did come in let me let me try to
[3:43:15.480 --> 3:43:20.440]  go through the two sides of it on the supply side that's the traditional argument is that
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:26.200]  it's supposed to encourage labor supply and savings well it hasn't exactly done that savings
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:31.400]  has gone down to zero i don't see how you can say that the tax cuts that helped savings no it's on
[3:43:31.400 --> 3:43:38.040]  the opposite and labor force participation which is the labor side is weaker than it was in the
[3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:46.040]  90s so it hasn't worked now on the demand side it did help a little bit but much much less than
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:51.560]  would have been the case had we given a tax cut to lower middle income americans we gave tax cuts
[3:43:51.560 --> 3:43:57.480]  to the very rich americans who would i agree we need to slash taxes on the middle class the problem
[3:43:57.480 --> 3:44:02.840]  is the the blue collar folks think the middle class of the elite uh dr sticklets you know i mean
[3:44:02.840 --> 3:44:06.760]  i mean that's the larger issue and i want to get into your book in the uh time we've gotten in the
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:12.600]  15 minutes we've got left before we end this at 58 after with you sir but uh because it's a very
[3:44:12.600 --> 3:44:19.800]  powerful book i saw this the financial times of london about eight months ago say that the headline
[3:44:19.800 --> 3:44:24.440]  that you know bigger institutional banks could stand the game from all this and that they all
[3:44:24.440 --> 3:44:29.080]  played the game of issuing liquidity they bought real assets they grabbed infrastructure they grabbed
[3:44:29.800 --> 3:44:35.000]  different commodities and then now governments are coming in bailing that out they're gobbling
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:40.040]  up more banks the fellow reserves talking about taking over three federal federal regulatory
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:47.320]  agencies the private fed you know more foxes watching the henhouse and so i also see a predatory
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:52.520]  capitalism and i'm for capitalism but not the predatory crony type uh here where it's not just
[3:44:52.520 --> 3:44:56.600]  a bunch of people screwing up it's a bunch of reckless people that knew they could create
[3:44:56.600 --> 3:45:01.240]  a money bubble that they could use it literally buy the planet up with and then we the people get
[3:45:01.240 --> 3:45:07.000]  left holding the bag with hyperinflation and with taxes to pay it back well you know you've
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:12.520]  identified one of the big problems what we've been doing is we've been socializing risk and
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:20.680]  privatizing wealth and uh you know the banks walked off a lot of the a lot of the the the
[3:45:20.680 --> 3:45:27.560]  the uh investors investment banks walked off their their uh senior officials with these huge
[3:45:28.360 --> 3:45:34.280]  bonuses some exceeding a billion dollars meanwhile the taxpayers are being left to pick up the risk
[3:45:34.280 --> 3:45:41.080]  you know the federal reserve exposed the taxpayers to a twenty nine billion dollar risk and we don't
[3:45:41.080 --> 3:45:47.240]  even know it was done in so non-transparent way we don't know fully how much we are true you know
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:54.840]  uh uh uh uh totally at risk for it meanwhile uh Bear Stearns shareholders walked off with over a
[3:45:54.840 --> 3:46:01.720]  billion dollars of money totally without paying a cent of insurance premium for the risk that
[3:46:01.720 --> 3:46:06.520]  uh the taxpayers have picked up i mean no as Bear Stearns got their bonuses right before
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:13.080]  all this happened that was very suspicious was that used as a cover for JP Morgan Chase being in
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:18.520]  trouble that they grabbed Bear Stearns because there's talk that they were in trouble as well
[3:46:18.520 --> 3:46:22.520]  and there are a lot of other brokerage houses that were in worse trouble than Bear Stearns
[3:46:22.520 --> 3:46:27.880]  uh but i mean that was very strange what happened there oh i agree it was very strange all i can
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:36.440]  say is that there's a lot of lack of transparency in the financial markets and uh we you know
[3:46:36.440 --> 3:46:42.200]  the to be to be honest we don't really know what is going on well as you know sir in the last month
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:47.400]  three big central bankers in europe have said that in mid-march we narrowly avoided total
[3:46:47.400 --> 3:46:51.400]  financial collapse now i know you're a very important person of a prize winner former chief
[3:46:51.400 --> 3:46:56.040]  economist world bank you don't want to freak people out or anything but i mean on the good side
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:01.800]  what two or three years of recession tell me if i'm wrong uh and uh then we come out of it with
[3:47:01.800 --> 3:47:07.480]  some new bubble and then we just kind of have some inflation on the bad side just war in the
[3:47:07.480 --> 3:47:11.800]  streets starving people running around with machine guns i mean i mean the government's
[3:47:11.800 --> 3:47:16.440]  building FEMA camps that's in the news bush has said he's gotten ready for martial law i mean i'm
[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:20.840]  sure you're an educated guy you've seen that in the news the government's acting really weird right
[3:47:20.840 --> 3:47:27.080]  now what what are the chances of the good side bad recession bad side depression really bad side
[3:47:27.080 --> 3:47:32.120]  because we had a 1929 depression now most people can't even have their own food you know don't live
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:39.080]  on farms right now we the world is in a rather unusual situation that at the same time we're
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:46.840]  facing uh one of the most troubling uh periods in terms of economic downturns with this almost
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:52.440]  you know trillion dollar losses on the financial system we are also facing high levels of inflation
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:47:58.440]  that you referred to earlier uh price of oil is over a hundred dollars a barrel price of food
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:06.040]  is reaching new is skyrocketing uh well things are bad in the united states we have to remember
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:13.240]  how how much worse they are in most of the developing countries good rocks but the the they
[3:48:13.240 --> 3:48:19.480]  have uh to spend most of their money to get by on food and energy and with food and energy prices
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:25.320]  soaring uh they're having real trouble and it's not a surprising a surprise that riots
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:30.840]  have been breaking out in many developing countries and i i anticipate to see more of that
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:38.840]  and that just highlights uh the difficulty that that the global economy is facing
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:43.560]  meanwhile a million dollars could have fed these people but instead like your new book says
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:48.200]  three trillion has been spent so who are the real culprits i mean who are the bad guys
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:51.960]  in all of this you know i mean who are the main companies the main individuals we know
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:56.360]  it's bigger than george bush mr stiglitz well well i mean the point that you just made is i
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:02.760]  just want to emphasize three trillion dollars is a lot of money a lot of money and if we expend that
[3:49:02.760 --> 3:49:12.680]  uh on uh uh helping people in the developing countries helping america uh i was just in
[3:49:12.680 --> 3:49:19.320]  gary indiana the city i was born in uh and uh talking to the mayor and he said you know three
[3:49:19.320 --> 3:49:24.360]  trillion dollars we can't get three cents out of the federal government uh our city is decaying
[3:49:24.360 --> 3:49:31.080]  uh schools need to help our road infrastructure build the pottles and we just can't get the money
[3:49:31.080 --> 3:49:36.440]  that we need to help revive our economy and it's no good contracts to do by halliburton
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:43.560]  is even here now uh well they that that is another part of the scandal um you asked who
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:48.600]  who were the winners they're actually only two winners in this war the oil companies have made
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:54.920]  out of fantastically with the soaring oil prices but the real the real winners are uh
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:49:59.960]  the defense contractors and number one on that uh helbert and their stock prices have increased
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:08.840]  almost tripled uh they the you know in previous wars uh there has been a uh a sense of shared
[3:50:08.840 --> 3:50:15.000]  sacrifice uh you send our young men and women off to fight uh the rest of us make a contribution
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:21.080]  by paying taxes uh there's an effort to make sure that there's no profiteering well this is the
[3:50:21.080 --> 3:50:26.360]  first war in america's history that we put entirely on the credit card and that's what leon coca

[3:54:13.400 --> 3:54:19.640]  former chief economist world bank um nobel prize winner he left in 2002 exposed a lot of the
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:25.240]  internal corruption the imf riot how they go in and want economies to craters so they can buy it up
[3:54:25.240 --> 3:54:29.800]  the hundred point plan all of that i gotta get him back up and i hate even talking over and i
[3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:36.360]  just have so many questions your new book uh the three trillion dollar war uh breaking this down if
[3:54:36.360 --> 3:54:41.240]  we don't end the war and it costs another trip three trillion and five years will that ensure
[3:54:41.880 --> 3:54:47.560]  uh a deeper financial crisis or is this good for us oh it's definitely not good for us you know
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:53.640]  this is a of a uh an idea that goes back and myth goes back to world war two that wars are good
[3:54:53.640 --> 3:55:00.440]  for the economy doesn't bother but but but we know at least since the time of king's that you can
[3:55:00.440 --> 3:55:07.000]  stimulate the economy without going to war and these other ways investments in education health
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:13.080]  roads infrastructure uh we have long-term productivity effects and nobody ever said that
[3:55:13.080 --> 3:55:17.880]  wars have good long-term productivity effects increase our living standards this particular
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:24.520]  war has been very bad for our economy and easy way to see that is spending money on a napalese
[3:55:24.520 --> 3:55:30.920]  contractor working in iraq just doesn't provide much stimulus to the economy is anywhere near
[3:55:30.920 --> 3:55:37.240]  as much as spending the same amount of money building a road in the u.s so uh and this war
[3:55:37.240 --> 3:55:43.560]  has also been bad because it let forth uh uh set forth the the rise in oil prices don't you also
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:49.960]  have the fraud associated you know 15 million dollar haliburton blue tarps yeah i mean that that
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:56.920]  that's an example of of you know that kind of spending uh uh doesn't help the american economy
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:05.000]  and and make it even worse haliburton operates off offshore so uh it it it it does that so it
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:12.760]  doesn't have to avoid taxes um that it doesn't pay medicare and social security taxes uh you know
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:18.360]  normally we would be coming down hard on anybody but it's dick cheney why are we seeing this level
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:23.960]  of arrogance even leah yacocca has come out and said we quote have a criminal corporate elite
[3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:28.520]  running the white house running the government destroying the nation did you see those quotes
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:34.040]  no i didn't but but but he's you know it is astounding and and the problem is it's not only
[3:56:34.040 --> 3:56:41.080]  bad directly for our economy it undermines confidence in our country uh you know anybody
[3:56:41.080 --> 3:56:46.200]  wants to deal with united states says you know what's going on here exactly so so we only got
[3:56:46.200 --> 3:56:50.600]  two minutes left and i want to talk about the book but then it doesn't look like the war is
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:54.600]  gonna end they're building all these permanent bases calling them embassies the name's been
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:56:58.600]  destroyed they say we're gonna be there forever the other political candidates say well we'll
[3:56:58.600 --> 3:57:02.440]  keep some troops there it looks to me like what you said a year ago is happening they're not
[3:57:02.440 --> 3:57:09.640]  going to change course uh i think they won't change course unless the american voters come out and
[3:57:09.640 --> 3:57:14.920]  give a very strong message you know we're spending 12 billion dollars up front every
[3:57:14.920 --> 3:57:20.280]  month that we're in iraq but actually the total cost which includes the disabilities about 40
[3:57:20.280 --> 3:57:24.520]  percent of the people coming back from iraq are disabled somewhat absolutely horrible
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:30.280]  disabilities when you start including all the other costs but twice that anybody who says
[3:57:30.280 --> 3:57:36.120]  stay the course has to say how we're going to be able to afford 25 billion a month but even that
[3:57:36.120 --> 3:57:40.680]  doesn't take into account the full cost because at the beginning of the war we were spending
[3:57:40.680 --> 3:57:46.200]  four billion a month now we're up to 12 billion the longer we stay the monthly charge goes up
[3:57:46.200 --> 3:57:51.160]  so we're going to be talking you know staying there every month is going to cost more and more
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:58.200]  and more sir we're out of time uh just absolutely incredible stay right there like to speak to you
[3:57:58.200 --> 3:58:04.520]  for one moment when the show ends uh here on the network retransmission starts right now at info

[3:58:35.080 --> 3:58:38.920]  why should we fire congress because they use the constitution of the united states
[3:58:38.920 --> 3:58:44.600]  as a scrap of paper they swear an oath to follow it and then they rejected that was their employment
