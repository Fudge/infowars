[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.280 --> 00:25.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well he's got an amazing record
[00:25.960 --> 00:33.360]  predicting seismic activity was on with us about a year ago and predicted we'd see increased
[00:33.360 --> 00:39.400]  earthquakes around the United States this is just out today swarm of earthquakes strikes
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.880]  parts of northern Oklahoma Dallas is getting hit New York's getting hit what's really behind
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.600]  this is that the pole shift the pole we know is starting to move at the fastest rate ever
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.520]  recorded it's only been measuring it for about a hundred years or so what's happening with the
[00:57.520 --> 01:08.440]  super volcano there out west what's going on we're going to be talking to stand day
[01:08.440 --> 01:23.760]  O coming up today in the second hour now before we go any further I want to just mention some
[01:23.760 --> 01:33.200]  of the other news that's coming up US considers the classifying report on Saudi funding of Al
[01:33.200 --> 01:41.120]  Kaida that's Reuters and of course that goes into the 9-11 report which also basically states
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.720]  we've talked to the members of Congress and others that have seen the secret 28 pages that
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.520]  our government had a stand down and wouldn't allow the investigation of Muhammad and Atta and
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.440]  others when they were on the ground in the months before 9-11 because of the Saudi connection
[01:55.440 --> 02:02.960]  that is aiding and abetting so where are the apologies from all the Fox News MSNBC and CNN
[02:02.960 --> 02:10.400]  reporters calling me a traitor for correctly from day one saying what we saw on 9-11 was
[02:10.400 --> 02:18.200]  obviously not the whole story where is my Pulitzer price for saying clearly Saudi Arabia quarterback
[02:18.200 --> 02:24.680]  the operations and I had the head of the US Embassy Visa section springman and countless
[02:24.680 --> 02:30.880]  others on I talked to Colonel Butler who went public at the San Jose Mercury News saying
[02:30.880 --> 02:37.400]  they trained hijackers at his secret base at the defense language school in his class
[02:37.400 --> 02:43.320]  I mean all I was doing was telling you the truth so I got demonized for it well where
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.440]  is the apology and what you're going to do what you're going to do when the false flags
[02:48.440 --> 02:52.320]  come for you what you're going to do when all this comes out what you're going to do
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.600]  when it comes out that they've known that the vaccines are brain damaging people they
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.800]  even have Merck and CDC whistleblowers going public and then Wakefield I forgot Dr. Wakefield
[03:01.800 --> 03:10.840]  just won his lawsuit against the fake journal a report put out by a reporter in a medical
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.060]  journal that he was a quack Wakefield was never a quack Wakefield never got caught
[03:15.060 --> 03:20.600]  lying Wakefield never got caught fixing things there were two British studies before him
[03:20.600 --> 03:24.640]  that were not publicly released that basically did the same thing he did and found the same
[03:24.640 --> 03:31.080]  thing of course the government had tested decades before a new what do you think a heads
[03:31.080 --> 03:38.800]  up optics is in a in a in a F-18 that's the target and that's what they test for is for
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.280]  their targeting systems of course whatever they're doing to us they studied and and whatever
[03:44.280 --> 03:50.760]  we reverse engineer and discover is always in government documents and plans and comes
[03:50.760 --> 03:57.840]  out later that they were already testing it knew it of course they knew of course they
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.160]  knew that vaccines were linked to autism of course they knew it caused autoimmune disorders
[04:02.160 --> 04:08.880]  of course they knew it caused blood on the brain and and allergic responses in key organs
[04:08.880 --> 04:16.320]  like the brain like the pancreas of course it says on the insert for 40 something years

[08:54.000 --> 08:58.760]  seeing earthquakes all over the united states and he has a forecasting system he uses that
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.440]  he even gets hired by governments state governments other governments our government to forecast
[09:03.440 --> 09:10.360]  for them he's going to be joining us to give us his earthquake forecast in the next hour
[09:10.360 --> 09:14.880]  and talk about what's happening out at yellowstone and other issues and is there a secret order
[09:14.880 --> 09:21.720]  out by obama gagging a major government connected seismologist and others to cover up what's
[09:21.720 --> 09:29.200]  happening at the super volcano that we know is erupted in the scheme of time on pretty
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.880]  much a routine basis covering much of north america in molten ash making what happened
[09:34.880 --> 09:45.640]  at pump a look like a cakewalk and of course idly where to begin bombshell after bombshell
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.960]  tom brokaw who has been engaged in plenty of war propaganda lying and disinformation
[09:50.960 --> 09:58.560]  in his own right so that's the pot calling the kettle black has come out and said that
[09:58.560 --> 10:06.960]  drop brian williams so the fellow nbc anchor says get rid of brian williams boy shouldn't
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.600]  be throwing rocks and in glass houses but i agree i said he should be fired but that
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.120]  sets a precedent though that all you other liars so it's okay to lie about wmds like
[10:18.120 --> 10:23.000]  tom brokaw did it's okay to knowingly hype stuff up it's okay to push anti gun agendas
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.280]  and try to disarm people's okay to lie about vaccines being safe and effective just don't
[10:28.280 --> 10:38.400]  make yourself a hero just don't get caught saying that you were in a helicopter that
[10:38.400 --> 10:42.640]  was shot down when none of the helicopters were shot down when you basically flew over
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.760]  another helicopter an hour and a half later or so that had been shot down so don't get
[10:48.760 --> 10:55.080]  caught i guess well hillary clinton got caught by cbs news who was with her saying that they'd
[10:55.080 --> 11:02.480]  gotten shot at in the air and on the ground in bosnia and it was totally fake so should
[11:02.480 --> 11:13.840]  hillary clinton then have to resign from public life absolutely she should in fact cbs news
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.960]  sharyl atkinson says brian williams not alone hillary clinton lied about being shot at in
[11:18.960 --> 11:26.680]  bosnia so this is really starting to come out this is really starting to come out but
[11:26.680 --> 11:31.920]  i think it's lesser to lie about being heroic like he's done that's kind of a glorified
[11:31.920 --> 11:40.160]  fish story i think it's stolen glory and is distasteful and disgusting and a bad repute
[11:40.160 --> 11:52.480]  as they would say but lying to people like rachel madow and bill o'reilly and these
[11:52.480 --> 12:00.360]  other hosts saying vaccines are totally safe totally effective it's the law take them you
[12:00.360 --> 12:05.160]  won't get sick if you take the flu shot or take a measles shot all total lies the flu
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.440]  shot insert says it give you the flu the measles shot says it can give you the the measles i
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.960]  mean we've shown those on air from the merc insert it's a fact and then she got up there
[12:15.960 --> 12:23.280]  and said i'm having one of those mental blocks who's then who's the fox news megan kelly
[12:23.280 --> 12:29.720]  yeah megan kelly and i'd love to like megan kelly but she's the one i've got a clip of
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.320]  saying too many kids is what's making the planet worse we should have a log and seven
[12:33.320 --> 12:41.040]  more kids and i've got that clip in my film in game well now she's out saying that oh
[12:41.040 --> 12:50.480]  it was all discredited that vaccines were ever linked to autism no the media six years
[12:50.480 --> 12:56.000]  ago ran a national international hoax with dr wakefield who's on next week in studio
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.200]  he lives in austin formally of england he's got his medical license here in the states
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.440]  he had his medical license removed by a kangaroo board with this report put out by a journalist
[13:07.440 --> 13:13.520]  in a medical journal claiming he'd been discredited claiming he'd recanted well dr wakefield
[13:13.520 --> 13:19.400]  filed suit last year he announced it on this show in the studio well now it's being reported
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.800]  by british newspapers and there it is on screen for tv viewers british court throws out conviction
[13:24.800 --> 13:32.240]  of autism vaccine md andrew wakefield's co-author completely exonerated and now it's going to
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.840]  be wakefield and wakefield's lawsuit has passed some hurdles and is going forward against
[13:37.840 --> 13:44.000]  the so-called journalist who's connected to big pharma of course in the revolving door
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.800]  so folks are suing people are going after medical boards they're getting their licenses
[13:49.800 --> 14:00.640]  back it's on it's on because wakefield has two secret studies that have been declassified
[14:00.640 --> 14:07.040]  in the last three years that the british government did decades before finding exactly what he
[14:07.040 --> 14:14.920]  found exactly what he found i'm gonna say it again exactly what he found that the vaccines
[14:14.920 --> 14:21.000]  are messing up the intestinal flora of children creating toxins and basically your children
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.920]  are drunk all the time they're autistic that's a simplified way of saying it there's a toxic
[14:27.920 --> 14:33.600]  response the gut is connected to the brain and they've got treatments if they're done
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.240]  early but no one will tell these parents the parents keep wondering why do they have such
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.000]  bowel problems suddenly and they can't talk the medical doctors are like no connection
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.720]  no connection because they just want to say oh it's genetic that's why they've gone from
[14:46.720 --> 14:51.920]  one in twenty five thousand having autism in the fifties to now one in forty something
[14:51.920 --> 14:56.800]  just five years ago it was one in a hundred and fifty something then it was one in sixty
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.440]  eight now down to you know one in fifty something one in forty something depending on what region
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.080]  you're in in south korea it's one in thirty something look it up and of course they're
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.640]  the more heavily vaccinated than us and it'll be one out of two it'll be we can't take
[15:11.640 --> 15:18.160]  care of all these people euthanize them that's the next plan watch it happen watch it at
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.120]  current rates within ten years one out of ten is going to have autism you ready for
[15:24.120 --> 15:32.480]  that then it's going to be one out of three and then fifty fifty baby you're gonna stop
[15:32.480 --> 15:40.400]  it are you gonna let a bunch of media whores like brian williams sit up there and lie all
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.280]  of us into hell because they've been bought off by special interest and will use their
[15:44.280 --> 15:51.680]  good looks their well-spoken repertoire off a teleprompter to lie to everyone convincingly
[15:51.680 --> 15:58.400]  the good looking square jawed alpha male with a twinkly blue eyes and the perfect tie the
[15:58.400 --> 16:05.760]  thousand dollar tie the ten thousand dollar suit sitting up there practiced deceivers i
[16:05.760 --> 16:13.680]  mean tom brokaw in my view is worse a more evil propagandist than brian williams and
[16:13.680 --> 16:19.000]  he says throw him under the bus yeah i gotta tell you if i was one of these liars up at
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.400]  that level i wouldn't throw my colleague under the bus but see there's no honor among this
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.560]  scum they don't even there's no honor among thieves they don't even have the honor to
[16:28.560 --> 16:35.480]  stick up for each other i mean they are the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst
[16:35.480 --> 16:40.800]  and they are lying to you on every front and getting caught with a straight face i'm not
[16:40.800 --> 16:44.520]  coming after your guns not your rifle not your shotgun not your handgun that was a quote
[16:44.520 --> 16:51.040]  by obama and biden that they gave hundreds of times in speeches and they immediately
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.160]  came after our guns you can keep your doctor it's going to cut it to the price of a phone
[16:55.160 --> 17:01.080]  or cable bill guaranteed don't listen to these liars that quite frankly are racist you notice
[17:01.080 --> 17:06.960]  the health care prices are exploding i mean they are a pack of scum the president's become
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.440]  a dictator is dissolving the border shutting off our power plants i mean we are in a red
[17:11.440 --> 17:19.600]  level emergency if we were a ship you'd hear that means wake up everybody all hands on
[17:19.600 --> 17:25.040]  deck we may have to go to the lifeboats i mean this country this world is going on alert
[17:25.040 --> 17:35.760]  this is for real people we're going into tyranny now before i get into other issues you've
[17:35.760 --> 17:42.400]  probably heard me say this let's not exaggerate since i saw tsa founded 14 years ago and about
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.600]  a year into it and they were founding homeland security i told you this i watched a two hour
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.320]  c span report i even played clips on air back in the old days i would record on vhs bring
[17:51.320 --> 17:54.680]  it into the office we only had a few crew members we grabbed clips right off of it and
[17:54.680 --> 17:58.680]  play it on air we would just queue up the vhs in the control room and they would just
[17:58.680 --> 18:02.400]  play audio clips off of it that's how we did stuff we had computers we could put it
[18:02.400 --> 18:07.480]  on but it would take too long to dump it and then snip it and wait for the audio to render
[18:07.480 --> 18:12.520]  so we would just play it off vhs i've played this somebody can go into the archives from
[18:12.520 --> 18:17.640]  2002 when they were having cabinet meetings about congressionally creating a new agency
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.440]  to take over all the other agencies that was going to be homeland security and in that
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.840]  two hour meeting with governor ridge the first head of homeland security before it was even
[18:26.840 --> 18:32.320]  a cabinet position before congress had made it one i watched it with horror where they
[18:32.320 --> 18:37.760]  said to buy and sell you'll have to have a tsa card approved i d card uh... you they
[18:37.760 --> 18:43.160]  will be on the streets they will be everywhere you will not buy or sell you will without
[18:43.160 --> 18:49.640]  their authorization you'll have internal checkpoints total federalization of all police under tsa
[18:49.640 --> 18:55.160]  because you create a whole new body well there's a new bill that's getting major sponsorship
[18:55.160 --> 19:02.960]  to give them homeland security period without a law enforcement degree law enforcement powers
[19:02.960 --> 19:10.160]  and the power to tax everyone's paycheck to fund it and here's the headline paul joseph
[19:10.160 --> 19:17.840]  watson info wars dot com linking directly to hr seven one nine an economist top economist
[19:17.840 --> 19:24.400]  warning new bill turns tsa into tax police yeah member when the tsa outside of law stopped
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.640]  letting people fly out of the country if the irs in a database said don't let them leave
[19:28.640 --> 19:34.520]  no judge no jury no indictment no bond no no no lawful justice you can't leave we said

[37:53.200 --> 38:01.080]  a black op and the public absolutely loves it they love getting thrown in prison for
[38:01.080 --> 38:09.320]  being dumb enough to use opiates either prescription or illegal that's how you run an operation
[38:09.320 --> 38:19.200]  on the slaves and the slaves love it they love it here's the article economist new bill
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.520]  turns tsa into tax police legislation would create berlin wall around all americans they're
[38:25.520 --> 38:29.800]  already doing it but now they just want to codify it like they already have fema camps
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.400]  but then they introduced the bill emergency centers establishment act to give you know
[38:33.400 --> 38:39.400]  billions of dollars a year to it and make it a conventionally recognized like they've
[38:39.400 --> 38:43.160]  been spying with the nsa illegally for decades they get caught then they try to pass laws
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.560]  to reform it that then legalize it sorry you can't legalize murder even if you say it's
[38:48.560 --> 38:54.760]  legal i guess you did with killing babies so i'm wrong economist martin armstrong warns
[38:54.760 --> 38:59.480]  that a new bill which directs the tsa to apprehend and investigate anyone quote suspected of committing
[38:59.480 --> 39:04.280]  a crime would turn the federal agency into a new branch of the irs well that's the plan
[39:04.280 --> 39:08.800]  you know told you uh... the tea effect i work for the irs and the irs is going to enforce
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.320]  obama care and everything else because it works for the federal reserve the tsa office
[39:14.320 --> 39:21.160]  of inspection accountability act hr seven one nine reduced on wednesday by u.s. representative
[39:21.160 --> 39:26.640]  john catco would require tsa criminal investigators to spend a minimum of fifty percent of their
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.400]  time investigating apprehending or detecting individual suspected of committing a crime
[39:30.400 --> 39:35.000]  i thought it was for terrorism in the evils saudi so we had to blow up iraq
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.600]  it's never for that
[39:40.600 --> 39:44.520]  man i'm getting so angry i can hardly breathe according to armstrong legislation we create
[39:44.520 --> 39:49.600]  a new kind of Berlin wall around all americans close quote because it would provide the federal
[39:49.600 --> 39:55.880]  agency with a huge remit to prevent people from traveling well yeah internal police
[39:55.880 --> 40:02.760]  internal checkpoints the the cherry on top the hundred ninety degree conversion from
[40:02.760 --> 40:10.600]  liberty to all out tyranny catco is a former federal prosecutor so he knows precisely
[40:10.600 --> 40:14.320]  what he's doing writing a law that is so broad that anyone suspected of a crime cannot leave
[40:14.320 --> 40:20.280]  the country rights are strong this is any crime and it's by the tsa in the feds no judge
[40:20.280 --> 40:25.560]  no jury no indictment no nothing keeping gold in a safe deposit boxes money laundering
[40:25.560 --> 40:33.600]  camp twenty five years in prison under this yeah notice the irs has been um... taking
[40:33.600 --> 40:38.160]  small diners money that they've kept you know in a bank and that they deposit every day
[40:38.160 --> 40:41.800]  saying it's illegal to do that it's not illegal they just say it is that's new york times
[40:41.800 --> 40:49.960]  by the way the bill would now result in the arrest of anyone for any alleged crime whatsoever
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.920]  and that will also apply to taxes well yeah that's what the tsa tried that two years ago
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.400]  to say you can't leave the irs so so warns the economist accusing the congressman of
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.560]  converting the tsa into a police force less concerned about air safety and focus more
[41:03.560 --> 41:09.240]  on catching anyone the government can argue violate some law federal or state and i love
[41:09.240 --> 41:15.160]  how this top economist is a smart guy but hasn't studied this like i have every day every waking
[41:15.160 --> 41:20.640]  hour basically i watch c span this was the plan from the beginning and it's not just
[41:20.640 --> 41:25.240]  in the airports he's he's reading this bill thinking oh in the airports this economist
[41:25.240 --> 41:28.840]  probably doesn't know they're already in every city
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.600]  mike hanson called me from gonzalez uh... used to be my uh... camera guy did a lot of
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.400]  uh... video editing for me he helped me after buckley helped me the first few years mike
[41:38.400 --> 41:40.760]  helped me for a long time
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.480]  and so mike's grandfather died and gave him a bunch of houses and land and hotels and
[41:44.480 --> 41:50.000]  gonzalez texas birthplace of texas by the way that's where coming take it comes from
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.280]  and call me up all out of breath yesterday and he's got audio up and everything i'm
[41:53.280 --> 41:55.240]  trying to get him in here next week
[41:55.240 --> 41:57.280]  he's about eighty miles away
[41:57.280 --> 42:01.600]  and he said my gosh i was just at city council about some zoning stuff and
[42:01.600 --> 42:03.440]  uh...
[42:03.440 --> 42:07.320]  they had five feds there and they had a ceremony federalizing and solace and
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.280]  say well now run the department and and he said you're gonna run things they said yes
[42:11.280 --> 42:11.840]  and
[42:11.840 --> 42:15.160]  he put in a for a request and they said it's quite basically classified
[42:15.160 --> 42:16.720]  classified local government
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.880]  and the police chief called mike aside as mike's a big wheel in the town
[42:20.880 --> 42:24.600]  and said uh...
[42:24.600 --> 42:26.320]  we can't have you doing this mike
[42:26.320 --> 42:29.320]  and and and and it makes a excuse me as you understand me you're not going to
[42:29.320 --> 42:31.040]  stop this
[42:31.040 --> 42:34.920]  i mean this country is just so gone folks this is happening everywhere i mean my
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.160]  god we're being criminally taken over
[42:39.160 --> 42:42.280]  and the d a was there saying you're all gonna be rich we're gonna ask it for
[42:42.280 --> 42:43.920]  which is your in your department
[42:43.920 --> 42:45.960]  here in your city and off this highway
[42:45.960 --> 42:49.080]  we're gonna give eighty percent of money to your local police
[42:49.080 --> 42:51.160]  and that's been going on forever but now they're
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.960]  publicly federalizing and that's just a microcosm
[42:55.960 --> 42:58.840]  of what's happening in the macro
[42:58.840 --> 43:01.920]  and the article just goes on i mean the
[43:01.920 --> 43:05.000]  i'm not trying to scare you i'm warning you this is going on this is
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.640]  happening where are the legislatures well they're starting to move on
[43:09.640 --> 43:12.400]  but that's what texas three years ago said you know what you keep growing on
[43:12.400 --> 43:16.640]  our legislators and doing this we're going to
[43:16.640 --> 43:19.960]  kick the tsa out or the state police are arresting you when you grab genitals
[43:19.960 --> 43:21.040]  it is assault
[43:21.040 --> 43:23.960]  we have prosecutors on california certainly the same thing
[43:23.960 --> 43:27.640]  and obama said alright f-16s are on standby
[43:27.640 --> 43:30.000]  we're gonna force down in the aircraft in inner texas
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.520]  we're gonna have a federal blockade that was in u.s.a. today
[43:33.520 --> 43:36.800]  like it was no big deal
[43:36.800 --> 43:40.480]  the legislature says you're not gonna grab people's genitals
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.160]  and the feds say f-16s are standing by
[43:44.160 --> 43:46.440]  because the tsa is the center
[43:46.440 --> 43:48.160]  of their takeover
[43:48.160 --> 43:49.280]  and the center
[43:49.280 --> 43:52.160]  of their federalization to create a whole new bureaucracy
[43:52.160 --> 43:53.680]  a domestic security force
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.080]  just as big just as strong as our military
[43:56.080 --> 43:57.760]  to quote obama
[43:57.760 --> 44:01.760]  and this is it and understand it transcends obama it's a larger blueprint
[44:01.760 --> 44:05.800]  announced within months of nine eleven but planned by the rand corporation
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.280]  and the heart redmond commission of the council on farm relations
[44:09.280 --> 44:12.720]  in nineteen ninety nine
[44:12.720 --> 44:14.000]  that's in my films
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.960]  road to terry and others them saying it
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.440]  i have the video the art rubin commission admitting they took the rand
[44:20.440 --> 44:24.280]  corporation plan for the domestic national police force
[44:24.280 --> 44:28.720]  the national stabilization police force
[44:28.720 --> 44:31.640]  i mean do you understand folks they're doing this because they're gonna take
[44:31.640 --> 44:34.800]  your pension funds they're gonna put a lot of people in forced labor
[44:34.800 --> 44:38.360]  they're gonna totally open the borders and make us a giant third-world hell
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.600]  i mean it's on
[44:42.600 --> 44:45.720]  now who are these people that are doing this well here's the headline u.s.
[44:45.720 --> 44:49.880]  considers the classifying report on saudi funding of al-qaeda
[44:49.880 --> 44:52.800]  well the u.s. isn't doing it
[44:52.800 --> 44:56.280]  see they're spending it because walter jones is about to get enough votes
[44:56.280 --> 44:57.800]  republican north carolina
[44:57.800 --> 45:01.440]  to release this so now the obama administration is considering
[45:01.440 --> 45:06.120]  whether to classify still secret sections of congressional inquiry
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.080]  in the nine eleven attacks and now zacharias michelle has come out saying
[45:10.080 --> 45:12.080]  yes he worked for saudi intelligence
[45:12.080 --> 45:13.680]  the so-called twenty-odd hijacker
[45:13.680 --> 45:16.520]  so try to discredit saying even that dirty terrorist as it
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.680]  it isn't the dirty terrorist
[45:18.680 --> 45:23.320]  it's senator graham the co-head of the nine eleven commission
[45:23.320 --> 45:27.200]  said the saudi's funded it and ran it but our government stood down
[45:27.200 --> 45:30.480]  and let it happen of course they did
[45:30.480 --> 45:32.640]  of course they did
[45:32.640 --> 45:33.880]  nor add
[45:33.880 --> 45:35.880]  stood down we have that from
[45:35.880 --> 45:38.280]  panetta
[45:38.280 --> 45:39.520]  norman panetta
[45:39.520 --> 45:42.800]  the head of the transportation
[45:42.800 --> 45:44.800]  system
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.640]  he was in the bunker with cheney
[45:46.640 --> 45:48.200]  when the stand-down was given
[45:48.200 --> 45:50.960]  cheney took nor add shoot down powers away
[45:50.960 --> 45:55.800]  five weeks before and gave him back a week after
[45:55.800 --> 46:00.520]  and they plan to fly flight ninety three ladies and gentlemen into the capital
[46:00.520 --> 46:01.360]  but
[46:01.360 --> 46:02.840]  the air national guard
[46:02.840 --> 46:04.560]  from the decodas
[46:04.560 --> 46:06.640]  on drill in virginia
[46:06.640 --> 46:09.760]  flew into pennsylvania and refused orders and fired
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.240]  the general refused orders and i was told us by all the pentagon
[46:13.240 --> 46:14.760]  i was told us by colonel
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.160]  donna grand prix was a famous cia
[46:18.160 --> 46:21.600]  black ops colonel that's what they use of the cia of the army colonel over
[46:21.600 --> 46:23.160]  huge operations
[46:23.160 --> 46:25.680]  and uh... they killed him couple weeks after he was on
[46:25.680 --> 46:28.360]  he died of a heart attack two weeks after being on the show
[46:28.360 --> 46:30.880]  and he he bent the pentagon he talked to the people
[46:30.880 --> 46:31.800]  and then later it
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.000]  it came out and it's on the air traffic tapes they fired two a nine
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.800]  sidewinders in the ninety three
[46:36.800 --> 46:42.320]  there wasn't any let's roll all that was meant to make you buy into it
[46:42.320 --> 46:44.840]  the the the the the the
[46:44.840 --> 46:47.120]  air force national guard
[46:47.120 --> 46:49.920]  shot down ninety three
[46:49.920 --> 46:53.080]  that's why i had to be over eight miles all the rest of it
[46:53.080 --> 46:56.960]  they would always fake debunking pieces the state police saw the explosion
[46:56.960 --> 47:02.880]  heard it all you see that debris field we know what happened
[47:02.880 --> 47:07.120]  i mean do people realize how many people come on the show like the the dc
[47:07.120 --> 47:08.240]  madame
[47:08.240 --> 47:09.320]  uh... or
[47:09.320 --> 47:11.960]  the head of new york emergency management deputy head
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.240]  very jennings and died within weeks of being on
[47:16.240 --> 47:18.720]  to say well why are you still alive
[47:18.720 --> 47:22.680]  because i'm not i'm not the focal point
[47:22.680 --> 47:25.760]  of where it's coming from on the focal point with the information coming out of
[47:25.760 --> 47:31.920]  now it's coming out everywhere else so it makes it more
[47:31.920 --> 47:35.000]  obvious if they take me out but they still could do it i mean i don't think
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.640]  any of this for granted
[47:36.640 --> 47:40.440]  they've instead tried to assassinate my name my character by building strong
[47:40.440 --> 47:43.920]  men and saying i said things i didn't say
[47:43.920 --> 47:47.440]  and other dirty tricks campaigns but but realize how important this broadcast
[47:47.440 --> 47:49.720]  is this is real ladies and gentlemen
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.040]  this is not a game this is not a joke we have other men and women that are in
[47:53.040 --> 47:55.360]  media to stop being cowards
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.920]  like the cbs news reporter that exposed fast and furious
[47:59.920 --> 48:03.400]  if we all don't start telling the truth we're gonna lose everything
[48:03.400 --> 48:06.080]  you understand it takes more courage
[48:06.080 --> 48:09.080]  and not to fight this
[48:09.080 --> 48:13.600]  than to fight this you just got a gut up and do the right thing
[48:13.600 --> 48:16.680]  and as more whistleblowers come out as more people to the right thing in law
[48:16.680 --> 48:18.800]  enforcement it doesn't matter across the board
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.120]  in corporate areas
[48:20.120 --> 48:24.360]  this system will not be able to be converted into a tyranny
[48:24.360 --> 48:27.200]  this is the key time where they're moving on every front now
[48:27.200 --> 48:29.100]  and the enemy's exposed right now
[48:29.100 --> 48:33.720]  they've emerged
[48:33.720 --> 48:36.720]  washington examiner report sixty four percent of reporters say fed spine on
[48:36.720 --> 48:37.640]  their emails
[48:37.640 --> 48:39.840]  calls online searches
[48:39.840 --> 48:43.040]  that's worse than that they go in and plant stuff on people's computers fake
[48:43.040 --> 48:46.440]  search entries you name it you can't believe anything comes out of the feds
[48:46.440 --> 48:48.080]  now
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.760]  they're just that corrupt just like the prostitute media and ryan williams is
[48:51.760 --> 48:53.960]  just that corrupt
[48:53.960 --> 48:56.040]  but understand folks
[48:56.040 --> 49:00.200]  those of us that said nine eleven was a stand-down an inside job it was
[49:00.200 --> 49:04.880]  senators in congress people are on record bipartisan it's true it came out
[49:04.880 --> 49:06.800]  they couldn't
[49:06.800 --> 49:09.040]  the question is how do they try to spend it now
[49:09.040 --> 49:11.640]  coming up lawmakers do obama arm ukraine

[55:06.040 --> 55:11.680]  are all bound together it really is magic there's a CNN piece PSA they're
[55:11.680 --> 55:16.040]  running this anti-human that says that you mother nature could destroy us in
[55:16.040 --> 55:21.040]  any time that's a nice cliche I've starved species greater than you is the
[55:21.040 --> 55:29.120]  quote we are of the earth God's creation and yes humans have hurt things on the
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.720]  planet but these PSAs only target humans and even as humans is a problem not
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.720]  some of the bad things we're doing like GMO it's just humans are bad period so
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.080]  government can devalue us that's all that's happening is the value of human
[55:43.080 --> 55:48.080]  life and if we devalue human life we devalue everything because humans are
[55:48.080 --> 55:55.760]  clearly the greatest expression of God's mind on this planet this planet is

[56:07.400 --> 56:13.560]  flipping around through a magazine mother Jones there had a eugenics at it and
[56:13.560 --> 56:19.400]  I meant to take it ask permission at the haircut in place I was that I meant to
[56:19.400 --> 56:23.160]  ask permission I was also on the cover it was the police state issue the
[56:23.160 --> 56:26.440]  federalization of police was I think it was military cops was the headline had
[56:26.440 --> 56:29.840]  a demonization of me and Rand Paul on the cover I was gonna ask for it but
[56:29.840 --> 56:34.600]  forgot to it had a eugenics at it maybe we can go out and find that magazine I
[56:34.600 --> 56:38.360]  think it's a current issue I think it's warrior cops as the headline I'm already
[56:38.360 --> 56:44.080]  digressing there's just so much information I go down rabbit trails we're
[56:44.080 --> 56:49.480]  gonna be playing that PSA we're gonna get into the economy only 44% of US

[56:55.720 --> 57:00.200]  coming crisis is worse than 2008 blames US printing press but they're there

[57:13.160 --> 57:17.040]  as slow as it's ever been is worried he'll get fired or gone after by the
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.520]  government for admitting that because there's a cover-up is Russia planning a
[57:20.520 --> 57:26.160]  gold-based currency that's just some of the news on the economy let's play that
[57:26.160 --> 57:30.720]  clip I just mentioned of Gallup poll CEO Jim Clifton fears he will suddenly
[57:30.720 --> 57:34.840]  disappear for exposing unemployment rates because they've been ordered you
[57:34.840 --> 57:38.080]  cover-up we're going into a depression here's a clip I don't think that the
[57:38.080 --> 57:41.520]  government is misleading us at all I think that the number that comes out of
[57:41.520 --> 57:46.440]  BLS and the Department of Labor is very very accurate I need to make that very
[57:46.440 --> 57:50.240]  very clear so I don't suddenly just disappear I need to make it home
[57:50.240 --> 58:02.040]  tonight let's stop right there you read the full transcript he looks crazy when
[58:02.040 --> 58:05.000]  he's saying this because here it's like Gibbs saying I lied to you there is a
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.800]  drone program but you already know that it's crazy it's Wizard of Oz because
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.240]  it's just no one everyone's gut doesn't want to go with this just lying about
[58:14.240 --> 58:18.160]  everything all these reporters go just out of the blue yeah I lied forever I'd
[58:18.160 --> 58:25.720]  be fired I'm sorry and the system you know I need to be clear these numbers
[58:25.720 --> 58:33.360]  we're getting are very very accurate I don't disappear tonight I mean all the
[58:33.360 --> 58:37.160]  top experts are on record the numbers are totally phony across the board just
[58:37.160 --> 58:40.960]  like Brian Williams is a phony and Tom Brokaw's a phony and Rachel Maddow's a
[58:40.960 --> 58:45.040]  phony they're all a pack of lion trash scum

[59:50.680 --> 59:56.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:56.120 --> 01:00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:27.880]  Alex Jones when I went through the process of becoming press secretary one
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.320]  of the things one of the first things they told me was you're not even to
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:37.040]  acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists and so I
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.880]  would get a question like that and literally I couldn't tell you what major
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.880]  asked because once I figured out it was about the drone program I realized I'm
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.720]  not supposed to talk about it and but here's what's inherently crazy about
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.440]  that proposition you're being asked a question based on reporting of a
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:00.240]  program that exists right so you're the official government spokesman acting as
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.040]  if the entire program pay no attention to the man behind the curtain pay no
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.840]  attention we're setting up a world government pay no attention to all the
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.800]  autistic kids pay no attention to 10,000 plus percent pediatric cancer increase
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.320]  from basically not existing to being epidemic just pay no attention to the
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.160]  death panels pay no attention to the increasing prices of health care pay no
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.580]  attention pay no attention pay no attention pay no attention to Alex
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:32.400]  Jones I know nothing nothing that's what's so frustrating is this is not
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.840]  hard to figure out but I guess I was a kid growing up that they let me watch
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.680]  TV on Saturday mornings and I can watch PBS documentaries on you know serious
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.920]  stuff and I guess they took me to the opera and Shakespeare theater and I
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.440]  guess they didn't take me to Stanley Kubrick movies I guess I didn't get the
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.800]  upbringing of the people God I guess I got kind of a snobby hoity-toity one but
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.200]  I went shooting and fishing and the boxing matches to my parents just exposed
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.480]  me to a lot of history and culture and I guess the average person that doesn't
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.840]  know that I mean because you've you've read a hundred books on Adolf Hitler like
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.760]  I have or more it's almost embarrassing I probably read 200 or more more on
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.960]  World War two I mean you just know everything works I mean if you if you
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.280]  read a 700 page book on the SS like I've done and it's so accurate off the
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.680]  Nuremberg trials and then you see that we adopted all that you just don't have
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:27.560]  stuff works order of the death said read it twice I just mentioned that because
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.800]  it's an easy I mean it's all about secret societies and this and that and
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.360]  this black op crew and how the British were funding this Nazi group and I
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:40.480]  mean and this is from the Nuremberg trials okay and then you got this child
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.400]  like publicly like I watch NFL and got a Harley and I'm a man I don't have to
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.640]  know nothing hey I love Harleys and I love football quite frankly you want to
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.120]  get down to brass tacks but that doesn't make a man a man that does not make if
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:02.160]  you said it in Yoda speak now let's go to this club I want to play the full one
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.040]  he tongue-in-cheek says I could be disappeared but he's throwing that out
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.760]  at people to tell him hey you know you're not supposed to say this and then he
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.640]  goes on to say no the the numbers are totally fake this is again the CEO of
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.960]  Gallup Jim Clifton here it is I don't think that the government is
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.680]  misleading us at all I think that the number that comes out of BLS and the
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.320]  Department of Labor is very very accurate I need to make that very very clear
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:32.560]  so I don't suddenly just disappear I need to make it home tonight
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.080]  jeez all right we hope that wouldn't be a follow-up anyway carry on but no are I
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.640]  think it's the way the numbers being used so so Gallup analytic teams they
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.000]  looked into they're trying to figure out where the middle class was looked into
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.800]  the GDP and of course GDP your audience is very astute you know it hasn't moved
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.360]  in five years yeah blended rate of five years is about 2.2 so then I went to
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.440]  jobs we said well I keep reading and in good papers the Wall Street Journal the
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.560]  Financial Times and the president tells us that that that unemployment is the
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.960]  best it's been in 10 years okay there's one side of it our concern with our
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.080]  analysts is that that that it's very very misleading because what America
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.240]  really wants are full-time jobs okay 30 plus hours but here's the here's the
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:27.720]  point the misleading point the percent of full-time jobs in this country to the
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.680]  population is the worst it's been in 30 years and and although you haven't a
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.360]  student audience when you're at dinner ask people about this nobody that's right
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.600]  they count people working two or three jobs as jobs against the general
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.760]  population and then Obamacare kicked 20 30 maybe 40 million off of their full
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.120]  time pay so people could avoid Obamacare so you got to get two jobs they call
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.200]  that a new job I mean it's just total horse manure from a pack of lion's
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:03.880]  scum for all of recorded history civilizations around the world praised

[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:26.680]  last hour was just over the top how insane all the news is. General Mill
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.840]  starts pulling preservatives after assault from the food babe army that's
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.280]  out of the observer and she always launches her operations here on this
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:39.600]  show great job to the listeners. British court throws out conviction of
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:46.560]  autism vaccine MD in Andrew Wakefield's co-author completely exonerated and
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.080]  next it'll be Wakefield. See they always say oh the study that vaccines
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.840]  hurt kids is a hoax no it was a hoax that they were discredited there's a
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.160]  whole bunch of other studies show the same thing continuing here the economy
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.920]  every number the Gallup is showing the real numbers that the economy is
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.880]  obviously in deep trouble globally the Chinese the Canadians a bunch of other
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.280]  governments are saying just brace for serious global crisis much bigger than
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.960]  2008 I don't know how long they can push this off but it is a big deal we're
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.840]  gonna be breaking that down huge news as Obama says he's considering before
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.440]  Congress passes a law releasing the 28 secret pages the 9-11 report showing a
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.960]  federal government stand down by NORAD and the Saudi Arabian government
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.400]  funding the operations now that's in Reuters I know you've heard this
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.320]  thousands of times here but now it's mainstream news I know you heard it a
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.080]  year ago from Walter Jones when nobody was cosponsoring his bill he was on a
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.880]  week and a half ago he is now about to have enough sponsors to pass it they
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.080]  are very embarrassed so now I predict Obama will come out and say they want
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.960]  a partial declassification to kill the movement to release the whole thing
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.560]  they're gonna try to just make it about Saudi Arabia oh am I gonna get
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:11.720]  apologies from all these radio hosts and Fox News and CNN people that go Alex
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.040]  Jones is a 9-11 truther and he thinks the firefighters blew up the World Trade
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.400]  Center that's what they say I never said that because when I say government they
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.400]  go you mean the cops you mean the and I go no I mean high-level government there
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.760]  was a stand down at NORAD that's on record read the 9-11 report oh shut up
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.720]  okay yeah right yeah you're saying radical Islam doesn't exist no actually it
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.800]  does our government's funding it al Qaeda and ISIS in protecting them shut up
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:48.840]  truther to shut up that's the games the mind games they play there it is in
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:55.520]  Reuters here it is in the New York Times yep boom another one we're gonna get to
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.560]  towards the end of the hour with our guest stand out I've starved species
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:05.040]  greater than you CNN airs creepy anti-human PSA we're gonna get to that
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:12.080]  we're also going to get in to the new domestic army where no judge no jury no
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.320]  indictment the TSA will just not let you travel or disappear you in a new bill
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.000]  that's being called by economist and law scholars just just North Korea I mean
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.760]  it is North Korea lawmakers to Obama arm Ukraine now she noticed everything I've
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.600]  been warning about since 9-11 14 years is now starting to unfold because they
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.600]  said they would make the TSA a domestic ground force to just disappear people now
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.800]  it's happening lawmakers to Obama arm Ukraine now that means war with Russia
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:47.960]  the president of Ukraine it says if it escalates Ukraine to declare martial law
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:55.360]  I mean this is just Jordan Moles ground campaign against ISIS mulling a quick
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.640]  strike lightning blow against Tara group as US troops begin to deploy to the
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.720]  region to fight the group armed by our own military I mean this is just insane
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.840]  Brian Williams NBC news bosses are hanging him out the drives the headline
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.400]  Tom Brokaw's just as big a liar raises okay to laugh for the government or
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.200]  criminal elements just don't lie about yourself or just don't get caught I
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:26.200]  predict he will resign I predict he will resign because he's destroyed I mean how
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:32.080]  will they believe all the other lies he spews and obfuscations and omissions
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:39.480]  and manipulations once he's destroyed and he's no longer a good and these
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:46.240]  thieves they steal truth they cover it up with lies they are the cowardly and
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.120]  despicable American prostitutes that's the headline on info wars.com a new
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:58.320]  story by Kit Daniels global debt nears 200 trillion dollars governments
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.880]  households in more debt than before great depression now the 200 trillion is
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.040]  current real debt owed by governments and by people and corporations the fake
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.400]  debt the derivatives that the bankers created that they then manage as a
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.360]  black hole to control countries that they get to sign on to it is two thousand
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:24.380]  trillion. I am plagiarizing Rush Limbaugh when I do that I remember listening in
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.240]  high school to Rush Limbaugh I'm 41 that gives you how long Rush Limbaugh's been on
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:36.160]  air and just love this. Okay I'm sitting there laughing about all this it's
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.200]  gallows humor you know they say imitation is the greatest sincere form of
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.440]  flattery I now tune in to the main line conservative talk show host and I hear
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.600]  my talking points that are just truth my talking points are basic maxims of
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.440]  understanding that I've come up with you know that I've developed historically
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.120]  with analysis and I just hear it all I mean I'm winning you're winning we're
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:03.680]  winning and it's very exciting for to have him up in the near future to
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.920]  break down Saudi Arabia and other big issues that he covers at his website
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.400]  but today we're just gonna focus on earthquake seismic events and geopolitical
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.240]  operations stand a is really an amazing individual I'm not gonna go over his
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.040]  engineering background working in secret top security clearance operations with
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:27.760]  the FBI and with other federal agencies he's developed solar related systems for
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.080]  Earth's climate he's been involved a lot of Tesla type research he's done a lot
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.240]  of marine projects and marine architecture that are classified advanced
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.080]  propulsion engineering but what he really does these known for is accurately
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:50.400]  with unorthodox systems predict seismic activity and he's on record on his
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.600]  website and here last year predicting a lot of new seismic activities across
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.840]  the United States in areas it's not traditionally New York Oklahoma Texas I
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.080]  got a headline here in fact it's in my stack they had earthquakes up in the
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:10.520]  Dallas-Fort Worth area again just in the last day but I know it's here in my
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.320]  stack but I'll never find it guys just here it is here yeah this is in
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.200]  Oklahoma swarm of earthquakes strike parts of northern Oklahoma but even
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.920]  again up in north Texas they've had some tremors what's going on a swarm of
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.800]  earthquakes is shaking parts of alfalfa county in northern Oklahoma the US
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.640]  geological survey says four earthquakes have been recorded and these are big
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.800]  ones for that area of the country around Cherokee and Hell in us since late
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.640]  Wednesday including a magnitude 4.3 quake with five miles east northwest of
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.960]  Cherokee at 9.08 a.m. the sheriff's department has been reporting there's
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.480]  been some other quakes as well let I want to go to our guests to talk about
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:55.080]  this and to break down how he basically predicts these and what he thinks is
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.040]  causing it is it the pole moving we know it's been moving at rapid rates and may
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.120]  even move faster what's going on with Yellowstone is there really because I've
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.480]  read this and talked to some folks that say it is there that most US geological
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:13.000]  survey seismologists are fully government funded and or they work at a
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.480]  university's government funded they've been told if you say anything alarming
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.280]  which we saw a few years ago about the Yellowstone could be getting ready to go
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.680]  that you'll be fired or never see a lot of day again Stan is that true a and
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:29.600]  then be just just give us what you think's most important first off well
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.760]  Alex as far as what the the muzzle is on the USGS that has been a matter of
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:40.800]  public record so gosh probably five years ago but I have had a chance to talk
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:47.000]  to a couple of witnesses that were actually at Yellowstone and when when
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.240]  people were told the geologist to keep their mouth shut or they would be fined
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:56.040]  or imprisoned and that was probably two years ago that I got the phone calls to
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.040]  tell me about that that's right and they use the argument don't they that well
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.520]  this is government equipment and so this is classified even though it's not a
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.400]  classified agency yeah look they even told the truck drivers that were
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.160]  breaking the equipment in they weren't even USGS personnel don't you talk they
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.600]  made them sign the little non-disclosure agreement you know fine or and or
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:24.160]  imprisonment and look the data I got from one geologist there that actually is
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.600]  one of those that was told to be quiet and pass the information out through
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:34.720]  friends is this they are monitoring all kinds of sites that they're not showing
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.560]  on the USGS earthquake plot for Yellowstone and there is so much data
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.440]  being gathered out of Yellowstone by the government the moment that they're
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.560]  having to use a supercomputer just to analyze the data from you know second
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.760]  to second to try to forecast as best they can when there will be an event
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.080]  there and whether it's a major eruption or whether it's a magma flow or a toxic
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:05.560]  gas release all those are important to consider and to prepare for but you know
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.440]  as well as I do with the internet like it is with the spread of news and rumors
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.280]  a lot of times without people fact-checking that should a hint of this
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.280]  come from official sources it could create panic and hurt the economy even
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.520]  farther you know I don't know how much farther you can go the world those are
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.160]  don't know the AP and others have reported USGS says earthquake hazard
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.520]  greater than previously thought so I mean this is being admitted but as you
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.640]  said they then muzzled them well look you know I've said this with you before
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:45.280]  Alex if we play the game where say you or I were in charge of the country and
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.680]  we wanted to protect the country and its people and the people from each other
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:56.480]  if we were to come out and say the end of the world is coming tomorrow we think
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.920]  but we're not sure then as an official announcement people would panic they
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.560]  would go out shooting each other rioting and that kind of stuff looting if we
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.240]  announced the possibility not from the White House but from unofficial leaks
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.440]  that occur across the country then these leaks are picked up by people who watch
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.120]  the news and watch for behind-the-scenes colors you know what's happening and they
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.320]  spread it through the community slowly without causing panic now I think you
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.480]  and I would do that to to keep the infrastructure intact in case we're
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:35.560]  wrong because you know even with supercomputers you can't really accurately
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.160]  forecast earthquakes and volcanoes to the minute what's the best science on the
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.200]  last three big eruptions in fact guys you can search last Yellowstone super
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.080]  eruptions and they go back over the thousands of years and the hundreds of
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.000]  thousands of millions of years and it shows the areas that we usually it
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.640]  covers more than half the country and changes the climate for a long period of
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.320]  time what are the estimates on what the eruption would be like this time and
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:08.840]  how bad could it be well they've been revising their thoughts on it that it
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.240]  might not be 600,000 years between eruptions there might be a thousand
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.160]  year window that sort of thing so they're they're being very flexible
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.560]  between a thousand six hundred thousand years for the next one but they do all
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.920]  agree that we're in the zone now for another eruption statistically from
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.200]  Yellowstone and how many super volcanoes are there on the earth because it
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.280]  couldn't just be this one going off no there's there's this one there's another
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:39.960]  undersea one gee I can't remember which ocean it's in but there's the third one
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:45.240]  is in North Island New Zealand at Lake Taupo and we've been watching that too
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:51.320]  in fact number of people have it's it's going to be so big that it's the Yellowstone
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.840]  of the Southern Hemisphere I think the other one is in the Northern Hemisphere
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.680]  and under the sea somewhere I think it's Iceland isn't it yeah I'm we won't
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.320]  well Iceland certainly doing some wonderful things as far as magma
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.720]  and volcanoes Iceland's actually raising up out of the the seabed because the
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.920]  ice pack that covers of the the glaciers that cover the volcanoes there
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.600]  is melting so Iceland is starting to rise up and you can see more magma
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.360]  activity along that whole long fissure in the Atlantic Ridge that goes
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.120]  underneath Iceland and they're blaming it on global warming when the
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.840]  volcanologists know it's because the magma well well yeah and the other thing
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.560]  is why is the northern pole region why is that warming up and melting ice like
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:41.400]  rapidly in Greenland and Iceland and yet the South Pole is gaining ice now
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.000]  that's not a global phenomenon it is the transfer of electricity in the earth
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.600]  system from the South Pole up to the North Pole transferring the heat from
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.080]  the South Pole up to the North Pole warming the North Pole there but
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:58.080]  cooling and I talked to astrophysicists or you know got multiple degrees and they
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.720]  say that is indeed what's happening and NASA admits the pole starting to move is
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.960]  that connected yes in fact NASA did release last year really high
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.760]  resolution images of the magnetic fields inside the earth and they show in the
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.880]  northern hemisphere to North Poles and to South Poles down here underneath it
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.440]  and that tells us that the North and South Pole is really two sets that are
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:28.360]  splitting and rotating at the moment and this is a pole reversal a magnetic pole
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.920]  reversal and that is generating part of the the climate changes we're seeing
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:39.200]  all over the world now expanding on that I'm looking at your breakdowns I'm
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.080]  looking at the USGS I'm looking at the Japanese numbers I'm just a layman not
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.600]  an expert like you but but clearly isn't volcanic activity and seismic
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.600]  activity exponentially increasing right now well it certainly is increasing I
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.480]  haven't plotted to see whether it's exponential but it's rapidly increasing
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:01.520]  we get notices here Holly and I daily you know by the hour from USGS and over
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.560]  the last few weeks we just noted lots and lots of earthquakes all over the
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:11.840]  planet more than we would normally see so yes it is rapidly increasing in
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.000]  numbers now I remember you were on about a year ago and you said you thought
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.920]  there'd be more seismic activity in places that hadn't been you talked about
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.440]  the fault lines or Oklahoma and into a Missouri and other areas we don't have
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.800]  the staff of the crew to go back and pull that I know it's on your site you
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.320]  did say that why were you predicting this increased seismic activity because
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.960]  now it's happening right where you said it would but also in New York and
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.920]  Illinois I mean what's going on well what I use to to kind of estimate what
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.720]  would be happening rapidly is the fact that there were a lot of sinkholes all
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.120]  over the planet appearing and these to me it fits in with my hypothesis that the
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.400]  earth is expanding again it it has expanded before by as much as 25% of
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.600]  its old diameter now it's starting to stretch the surface and put increasing
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.720]  pressures on tectonic plates particularly the United States and if you
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.400]  can I don't know whether you can push a button when your producer can but if you
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:11.480]  go to my website to the show images page at the top row right in the middle I've
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.960]  got today's snap of the USGS plot of earthquakes and we'll put it up
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:22.560]  standaio.com d-e-y-o standaio.com we'll put that on screen go ahead okay and so
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.760]  what it does is that in the middle row at the top it shows the earthquakes today
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:31.360]  sorry about that it's okay to have come come down from Oklahoma down through
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.920]  Dallas and down underneath San Antonio and if you look at that that image I've
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:40.480]  got there it shows that there is some kind of a geological formation that
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.780]  seems to the earthquake seem to be following that line and so then if you
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:49.120]  look at the next picture on the top row on the right which is a geographic map of
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.360]  Texas you'll see I've drawn a yellow line with the black outline showing where
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.280]  those earthquakes have been happening in Texas it's right down the fault line and
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.200]  that line goes right through Austin Texas in fact I'm shitting right in the
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.480]  middle of it right now yeah and and the thing is it's that whole area connects
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:13.600]  to an area over into the new Madrid fault line if you go to the second row
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.800]  first picture where it says new Madrid fault region and go on there too I'm
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:26.960]  just going to tell you which line to go to one two three this one shows it the
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.160]  best I think click on the third line first picture which has kind of a white
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:38.600]  line diagonal line cutting through it and it shows the the shaded area on the
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.800]  east Texas right up into the new Madrid it's all kind of connected in that weak
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.120]  part of the well of where the United States should have split when the
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.920]  continents were splitting but it didn't quite do it and new Madrid is a leftover
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.280]  of that but I saw that if we keep stretching that that it would create
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.840]  stresses along the edge of that that plane that coastal plane that goes up
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.440]  toward Dallas and Austin and that's that's exactly what's happening there
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:15.480]  is a there is a safe zone kind of a shield if you wish that if you I'm just
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.480]  trying to see if I've got that I don't have that map up there at the moment I
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.800]  don't think but anyway this shield is a line showing where earthquakes occur
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:28.360]  from the edge of Canada you know on the west side all the way to the east side
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:36.520]  down into the Oklahoma region and that is called a shield and inside that area
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:40.240]  north of that area there's not many earthquakes but south east and west of
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.480]  that toward the coastal regions there is and that's what I used to kind of
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.320]  forecast what I thought would be happening here at the United States break
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.760]  that down because you did predict that and and now it's happening what do you
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.720]  think's going to come next now well I think that we may see some more
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.360]  earthquakes start to form from Oklahoma City eastward toward Little Rock
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.680]  Arkansas into the new Madrid fault line somewhere in that weakness area there
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.480]  in fact if you look at that middle picture at the top row of the the main
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.160]  page the show images page you'll see a lighter region which shows a depression
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.120]  in the landform of the United States coming from Oklahoma City over toward
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.160]  Little Rock and there is a fault line there that's not been very active but I
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.920]  suspect that that will be an area we will see some earthquakes here in the
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:34.120]  next few months as well Oklahoma has just seen it looks like a hundred how
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:40.320]  many that was like a lot that's a lot of points well yeah and that we think is do
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:45.920]  primarily to fracking whether injecting water into gas and oil wells you know to
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:51.080]  to bring it back up to the surface and we do that here in Colorado as well but
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.240]  they're doing they're doing so much here that I suspect that what they're
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.560]  trying to do is relieve seismic pressure in smaller amounts in that region to
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:04.080]  avoid a massive earthquake you know where the pressure builds up and doesn't
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:09.920]  release until it's too big Israeli's patented systems to use explosives they
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.240]  believe with computer models to stop earthquakes that's right that's right can
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.800]  you tell us about that well I actually was in the middle of one of those over in
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:24.440]  West Australia years ago back in the late 70s at that time I was seeing
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.400]  classified telexes are you know coming from Pine Gap but the United States sent
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:35.760]  a team over to Western Australia north of Perth into the mining fields to start
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:40.360]  detonating along minor fault lines with TNT they they had the teams out doing it
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.840]  they were tributary fault lines to a major fault line that ran from up the
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.040]  coast above Perth down through Perth and they were predicting a seven point five
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.440]  to eight Richter earthquake in that area which would shake Perth to the ground
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.240]  because most of its buildings had not been built earthquake code before 78 now
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.640]  to mitigate that they were they were relieving the pressure on the main fault
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:07.840]  line by blasting the smaller ones and letting the pressure equalize out now
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:11.480]  the Israelis have come up with a better system as I understand they drill don't
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.280]  say I think they do go down deeper yeah and because when you're when you're
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.120]  blasting at the surface it's not as good as getting down you know like a
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.160]  kilometer so took so the shockwave does what you want it to amazing it's so
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.560]  fascinating not just from the perspective of who this is scary we're on a

[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.360]  I want to get his take on things they're geopolitically happening right now as
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.480]  well after he finishes up with earthquakes but we gotta get him on more
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.000]  than once a year stand-out is really interesting really informative guy

[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:21.760]  thinking about the month of February and we've got super male vitality super
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:30.520]  female vitality it's not a herbal diagram I mean we don't advertise it as that but
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.960]  obviously they've got estrogen mimicers in a lot of the food a lot of the
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.600]  plastics we're being bombarded with it this stuff was designed by Dr. Group
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.720]  cold press the purest ingredients I think it's 16 ingredients in the male I
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:50.760]  think it's 18 and the female that just supercharge your normal glance this does
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:55.600]  not mimic testosterone or other key compounds it simply gets your body to
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.440]  release it according to Dr. Group's research all I know is it works like a
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.840]  charm back when I was playing football some in high school and in college I
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:08.560]  never took any illegal stuff but I went to GNC and got some of the herbal
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.040]  yo-himby and stuff and it made me a little bit bigger but made me feel
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.160]  crazy and feel terrible and have hot flashes so I never stayed on that stuff
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.960]  more than like a week super male I can just take twice a day just more energy

[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.720]  crazed I hate tyrants I'm kind of natural I mean you read back to folks that
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.120]  fought King George or people that fought other tyrants I mean they were more
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.920]  crazed than I am I'm a wimp compared to these people and they were so angry they
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.640]  haul guns a hundred miles through the snow with no shoes with trail of blood
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.280]  behind them back then shoes you know broke down and slush they were leather
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.640]  bottomed I mean I couldn't do that I mean so so I'm nothing compared to our
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.880]  ancestors and compared to most people I'm a crazed Tasmanian you know devil or

[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.520]  my own line that there are so few other really reputable grips out there I go
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:40.440]  to these biggest manufacturers that have you know high quality stuff that we can
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:46.160]  get and they say we've never seen anyone put this much high quality stuff in
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:52.120]  something like DNA force I mean we love what you're doing but you're just beyond
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.520]  the quality of anything we've ever heard with what you're doing most of these
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.840]  big names slick bottles beautiful models in national TV ads they'll put like a
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.320]  dollar worth of product in a bottle that costs 30 something cents and then spend
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:11.000]  $5 a bottle on marketing and sell it to you for 50 bucks DNA force has over 50
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.960]  dollars of product in each bottle and then we mark it up the average stuff we
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.400]  average have about a 50 to 100% markup the average the industry standard is a
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:31.240]  seven-fold markup seven times that's crazy so that's why we're the best we

[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.280]  thanks for being on hold during that break and plug let's go and of course
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.200]  people can find all your books as well there and a lot more but before we go
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.720]  any further let's get back into earthquakes hit the most important
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.960]  points I've asked a lot of the questions now you kind of cover some of the other
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.880]  areas of what's happening with the earth's crust what's happening inside of
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.800]  it the pole shift all these things that are just out of this world but are
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.200]  really happening and then let's get into your view geopolitically it seems like
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.280]  all hell's breaking loose and I know you're a smart guy and have a lot of
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:27.120]  contacts on that front what's happening standio. Okay first on the
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.760]  earthquake situation while we were having the break there I uploaded an
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.560]  image of something I think you you and your listeners will find very very
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:40.040]  interesting it's on the fracking sites in the United States a map published by
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:45.120]  the industry April last year fourth row from the bottom on the right-hand side
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:51.600]  it says fracking USA and if you click on that map all the green dots you see are
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:57.880]  where they are fracking into oil wells or gas wells etc and when you look at the
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.120]  earthquakes today through Dallas down through San Antonio and beyond you will
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:05.840]  see that to the right of that they are fracking the heck out of it all the way
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.640]  over into Louisiana and up at Oklahoma City you will see they've started not
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.120]  not only they got fracking all around Oklahoma City and north of it you will
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.320]  see that there is a finger of fracking going out to the right through Arkansas
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.080]  just like I was telling that long at fault line right into the new Madrid
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.760]  fault line and in West Texas there's a whole cluster out there don't know why
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.880]  they're doing that so much unless it is for oil and gas but these others in the
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:37.240]  in the plains of Texas the coastal plain region and in Louisiana you know and
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:42.440]  part of Mississippi that tells you that they're they're they're taking a great
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:48.720]  risk pulling it out there because those are very well laced areas with fault
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:53.720]  lines because of various activities and by the way five years ago I heard you on
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.440]  coast-to-coast AM I'm not tooting your horn it's just no brag just fact I heard
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.200]  you with George Norris saying you believed fracking was connected to
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.120]  earthquakes and now top scientist degree in the last year we have an ABC News
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:12.200]  headline that fracking is connected to the earthquakes in Texas yeah yeah look
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.440]  I it's a it's a minor victory to be saying that I'm sure that that the
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.600]  Charles just knew it at the time but it took this long for them to be able to
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.560]  say it publicly I think without getting in too much trouble I interrupt it please
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.040]  continue okay well that that's all I just wanted to show you that on that
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.280]  fracking map that it's quite interesting that they're doing it on fault lines and
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:41.000]  certainly that the coastal plains of Texas and into Louisiana Mississippi these
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.520]  were all lowered and damaged by the chicks love meteor impact in the Gulf of
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:51.840]  Mexico you know long long time ago which shoved up shockwaves up into Texas so it
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.400]  already is a weak area and I just you know I don't know whether they're
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.960]  weighing their their need for the gas and oil from those fields against trying
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.600]  to avoid any subsidence or earthquakes in the area I just don't know but that map
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.120]  when I look at it it just stands out in your face if there's something big
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.800]  going on in those areas anyway that's that's earthquakes what are other hot
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:20.320]  areas in the world or in the United States for seismic activity well we
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.200]  have let's see here let me see if I can just pull it up I'll ask of course is
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.160]  as always ongoing the one that I watch the most is right up near Eureka
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.480]  California off the coast there's a long ridge that comes in out of the North
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:43.000]  Pacific it's called the Mendocino Ridge or fault line but it's a ridge and as it
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.640]  joins into California Eureka it's at the very foot of something called the Juan
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.640]  de Fuca Plate and people the geologists have been watching this for years in
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.600]  comparison to all of the other fault line locations around the entire Pacific
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:03.560]  Rim you know the Ring of Fire and the only area that is built up this much
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:08.360]  pressure you know here at like like a Richter 9 or plus earthquake is right
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:12.680]  here at the foot where the Mendocino Ridge comes into Eureka and this is what
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.040]  you said last year is this is the only area in this big ring of fire that hasn't
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.440]  yet triggered that's right it's over 55 years overdue by their estimates and so
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:27.800]  that there alone tells you that oh maybe they're not quite that accurate so it's
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.040]  a guess and it is and in their defense it is the best guess they can what would
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:36.880]  happen if it fully triggered we're talking about an 8 a 9 yeah you are
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:42.960]  talking about a 9 and that would produce tsunamis along the coast there of course
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.040]  they would it would hit Japan later you know a few days we've been so blessed
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.120]  people go that'll never happen here I know folks that have been in some of
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.680]  these LA earthquakes that are a lot smaller where highways collapse hundreds
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.480]  die I mean folks how many hundreds of thousands died in the tsunamis a decade
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:04.240]  ago or or less it was eight nine years ago people I mean this is happening all
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.320]  over the world we've been very blessed not to be hit by what's hit Pakistan and
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:12.760]  Iraq and Iran and all these other countries that just get devastated I
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:15.920]  mean I've seen numbers of hundreds of thousands getting killed in earthquakes
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:21.400]  in places like Pakistan you know Alex you chose the word blessed and I do
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:27.320]  agree it is by the blessing of our Creator God that we have been spared
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.480]  these things but when we pull away from God like we're doing now due to the
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:36.000]  administration you know and all the changes they've made we can expect these
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  things to fall upon us like judgments you know it's the blessing is being
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.600]  removed I'm sure you know it is really true historically that when governments
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.280]  do really bad things even the pagans believe that if the government got real
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.120]  bad that the lead of earthquakes and volcanoes and all the rest of it and
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.760]  the Bible says that and people always poop of it I just know that it's pretty
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.820]  interesting what's happening right now well let's watch what happens in the
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:05.640]  Middle East so we can segue from here to politics because if the United States
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:12.480]  is heavily involved which it is in the the partitioning the dividing of Israel
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:17.800]  for a peace treaty between you know Palestine and Israel and you know the
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:21.920]  rest of the Arab nations if it is divided we can expect our country
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.920]  physically to be divided by earthquakes and damaging geological events like
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.080]  volcanoes etc you're saying because that's in revelations or Daniel or you know
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.640]  I'm just saying we've observed that that whenever we do something to hurt
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:41.440]  Israel something of a measured response comes from God to our country you know
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:46.240]  proportionate response so wait for it when we hurt Israel we're gonna get hurt
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.880]  and this administration I'm gosh I tell you what if you go to the my show image
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.920]  page second row down right in the middle have a picture of Patrick Stewart you
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.200]  know Captain Kirk in them in the movie they made Star Trek First Contact and
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:07.960]  he's saying there this far and no farther you know they draw the line and
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:13.560]  that's like in the Alamo but the line must be drawn here we have got to stop
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:20.240]  this administration somehow we must draw that line now and I can't I can't stress
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.880]  that enough well there is I mean even folks that don't like some of the things
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:27.080]  Israel's up to sometimes the different government yeah what's going on with
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:30.240]  arming all the radical Islamists is turning them loose all over Africa the
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.180]  Middle East trying to overthrow Egypt and then and then and then criticizing
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.200]  Israel I mean that is what the White House has been doing that's just
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:47.600]  insane well the White House is funding you know the enemies of Israel and even
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.160]  though you say that there are good Muslims and then there are terrorist
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:55.240]  radical Muslims when you fund those countries it funds the radical segment
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:59.400]  more than it does the people the Muslims of those countries that really just
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.040]  average everyday people in Iran we have to watch what the administration here
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:10.840]  does with funding Kasem Soleimani General Soleimani that's Solomon in their
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:17.680]  local language because he is moving against ISIS and is therefore quote
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:21.140]  unquote a friend of the United States because the enemy by enemy is is by
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:27.400]  friend and so the United States is helping Iran Kasem Kasem Soleimani
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.720]  against ISIS and everybody's supposed to applaud when ISIS gets crunched and I
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:36.000]  think they'll get crunched and the guy in the Middle East the military genius
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.480]  that will do this and is doing it is General Kasem Soleimani and so America's
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:49.560]  funding of those activities there and in Africa you know it allegedly is to get
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.520]  rid of ISIS but it is a betrayal of the United States well there's got to be a
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:57.880]  larger master plan because criminals in our government and in NATO helped arm
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:02.840]  the Syrian Free Army which basically is ISIS now Saudi Arabia is involved
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.280]  funding it too but claims they're fighting it there's a double game going on
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.200]  here from my view what do you think oh yeah look this is a chess move and it's
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:15.720]  not the final play at all but the reason I chose that picture from a
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:19.960]  Star Trek of Captain Kirk saying you know this far no farther he was referring
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:26.320]  to an invasion from off-world by aliens on to the United on to the the the world
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.480]  to conquer humanity you know and to enslave it and I think the end game look
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.560]  further than we are right now at local politics look at the global picture and
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.080]  I've said this time and time again for decades now we are going to have an
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:49.600]  official meeting release you know announcement of friendly aliens coming
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.560]  to earth with super technology and this is according to biblical prophecy as
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.280]  well and this is what you do see the pope and others coming out saying they
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.720]  think there's other life forms out there and all the Hollywood movies now
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.400]  there's a project blue beam to have fake alien landings but I mean you're saying
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.800]  you think the end game is something like that absolutely absolutely we're
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:14.200]  going toward a global dictatorship but it will be like the movie the miniseries
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:20.760]  V that Kenneth Johnson produced in the mid-70s the friendlies come looking
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.000]  like humans with their spaceships park all over the major cities they have
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.720]  ships that are a mile wide you're just hanging in the air over cities and our
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.800]  scientists are kind of just you know dumbfounded this is impossible but there
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.480]  it is and they come in peace they say we mean you know harm we will give you
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:43.560]  cures for cancer and energy in this and that so people suck it up and now then
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:49.560]  you know that they had human skins over reptilian bodies well I know Hillary
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:55.200]  probably is actually a demonic 14-foot Easter Bunny underneath her I know the
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.000]  elite running things act like they're aliens from deep space come to enslave

[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:21.240]  music little George straight little great white stand a.com our guest we're
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.960]  getting back up soon on his political worldview of what's really going on but
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.480]  he just hit the hardcore issue why is it when somebody an engineer or scientist
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.680]  says hey this is demonic you know that's what's happening people like oh
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:39.040]  that's kooky that's weird but wait 80% of America's 82% says their Christian
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.480]  believe in a God the devil well we're on a planet in space who is the devil what
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:47.600]  is the devil that wants to kill still in destroy and become God and mutate the
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:51.440]  genetics of the planet everything the Bible says but it's not taught in the
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.920]  churches because they're basically government run now we're seeing
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:59.820]  prophecies fulfilled and look if you're an atheist don't believe in spiritual
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:03.520]  things and other dimensions which mathematics has proven in Einstein went
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.840]  for being an atheist to being you know someone who believed there was a God
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:13.160]  because how can you do these equations than not see the fingerprints there but
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:18.080]  there's also a spirit of evil but even in a Carl Jungian way there are archetypes
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:23.040]  and humans build a satanic archetype that always ends in giant black pyramids
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:27.240]  with human sacrifice and every ancient culture believed all this was going on
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:30.680]  I don't go there because people won't believe there's FEMA camps when I have
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.080]  the congressional documents so they're not going to get into other things that
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:40.880]  are fantastical but clearly folks we're not in Kansas anymore and we never were
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.800]  we're two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.400]  so Stan next time you come on we'll get you into the heavier more esoteric
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:52.920]  stuff but the elite do believe it's skull and bones they believe they're
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:58.720]  worshiping angels goddesses from space that's been in New York Times best
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.920]  selling books by people that broke in there basically they don't call the
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:07.080]  bushes crazy for worshiping entities at Bohemian Grove they were worshiping
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.800]  entities when I was there so whether they're space aliens entities whatever
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.920]  or even if they're not real our elite believe they're real but you're saying
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:18.720]  they may fake this as the great delusion that were biblically told about
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.800]  absolutely they're gonna come as the good guys when the Bible says beware
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.280]  the first lot coming as messengers of light that's almost a literal
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:31.320]  translation we got a few minutes of this segment one more five minutes segment
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:34.480]  with you get I mean get into some of your larger view because you've been
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.800]  accurate predicting earthquakes your smart guy did a lot of secret operations
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:42.560]  that have been documented I mean what what what made you form this cosmology
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:50.600]  just researching it well yes back in 1969 I fell ill with a bacterial
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:53.840]  infection that nearly killed me in fact I had the out-of-body near-death
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.880]  experience and after I came back into my body from that I had a lot of stuff in
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:07.000]  my mind that told me to eventually write the book the cosmic conspiracy to
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.040]  expose this this great deception that was a super worldwide bestseller oh
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:19.080]  absolutely absolutely how many copies of that as you sell well I last count a
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.920]  couple years ago quarter million copies which is just for an amateur guy
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.040]  that's a lot of books I know but I got picked up put into other cereals and
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:28.800]  things I just know it was in magazines you name it we're gonna come right back
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:33.200]  I'm gonna have you back up soon for a full hour on the cosmic conspiracy your
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:40.800]  view on that that's a book I heard Bob Dylan likes thank you for listening to

[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.480]  up give us a little preview of what you're going to cover next time you're
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:48.760]  on well I suppose the most important thing will be the developing situation
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:53.040]  in the Middle East and how it would potentially relate to announcing the
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:58.480]  alien presence here I know that for years a number of us you know in the
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.560]  radio industry here and in the news industry have poo poo the idea of UFOs
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.320]  and aliens and anybody that talked about that for real should be wearing a
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.920]  little tinfoil hat you know but now that things are becoming quite intense in
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.800]  the world just as I predicted the cosmic conspiracy in the in the TV shows
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:21.720]  I'll be talking about why the the the world events are going where they are
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:27.800]  move ahead a bunch of chess moves from where we are now and I want to warn
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.440]  people in a long discussion saying look here's what you watch for and here's
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:37.280]  what to avoid and I base a lot of that on what's in the biblical prophecies and
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:41.360]  about this time there have been so accurate and are becoming even more
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:46.400]  accurate now happening in four eyes that it's going to be easy for me to point
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:51.160]  people to this and say here's what you do do and here's what you don't do if you
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:56.080]  want to get through this and as the Bible says have everlasting life you
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.640]  know that Colonel Craig Roberts good friend of mine I want to get him back
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:04.000]  on he died of cancer surgery and colon cancer for ten minutes I mean
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.880]  that you know but unless you're putting ice there's no way you're gonna come back
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:11.120]  from that he came back from that had the whole experience of the portal the
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:15.920]  angel the decision being made he was given all the data sent back and there's
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.840]  even main line as you know studies and reports government reports we can do a
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:24.920]  whole show on this where people who aren't even Christians who are in
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.200]  African tribes or who are in New Guinea when they die and come back it's the
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.840]  same thing this is real I mean this is going on absolutely what happened to
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:40.280]  you briefly when you died well I I left the body I shot through the roof in my
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:46.840]  room and out into a very smooth velvet like darkness and off to my right as I
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:50.120]  was moving through this darkness toward a light way out there off to my right
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:54.880]  there were a bunch of like little theaterettes like maybe 50 60 even a
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:03:00.360]  hundred all showing events in my life up to that point where I had hurt someone
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:03.960]  by actions or deed and then they would go a little bit further showing how that
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:08.320]  affected that person's life down the road it was kind of like judging myself
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:13.600]  and as I was moving through this silky darkness pieces of me seem to be
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.600]  washed out by this invisible fluid like like dirt clouds and they would fall
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.560]  behind me in a puff of smoke and I would notice I was losing a negative
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:28.320]  emotion like greed or hate etc etc so you were being sanctified well I was I
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.520]  was sitting in judgment you know nodding my head saying yeah okay I did that that
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.160]  you know I wasn't embarrassed or anything I was just looking analytically at
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:39.000]  the things I'd done wrong what it had happened what it had caused and I even
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.960]  got to see a little bit into the future and then when that all stopped and I
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:48.200]  was you know able to just think without watching all those screens at once which
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:52.360]  I could do easily at that point my mind was bigger and I could know about the
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:55.240]  universe and I said well how does it work and how do flying saucers work and
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.560]  all kinds of questions but when I squeezed back into my body it was like
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:03.240]  getting into a tiny little shoe and pieces of what I had learned out there
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.520]  seemed to drop off the side was fragments yeah and they came back later in
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.240]  dream states over the next you know probably seven to ten years well that's
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.600]  the same universal thing going back thousands of years since writing was
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.680]  invented and and sitting with Roberts he's in a dark room and the angel had his
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:22.340]  hand on him he was like just being instantly shown all the good things he
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:26.520]  done bad things he's done and it was and it was like and then the decision was
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:31.400]  made just like you in the movie send you back back it's just unbelievable it's
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:37.560]  so real right it is it really is we live outside the body it's amazing and the

[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:38.280]  this is all just crazy Schwarzenegger saying he will terminate climate change
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.960]  how with the global tags in his five years ago that he went to the Copenhagen
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.920]  Denmark event and he said if we cannot get it past it are you in then we will
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:53.800]  simply get it past the city by city state by state you will accept the carbon
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:09:00.400]  taxes that I'm invested in that people are weak I want to come to love Hitler I
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:06.960]  want to be a god these are quotes you know he even admitted to Rolling Stone
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.840]  and I met a documentary he's a little part of sudden research on him that he
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:18.240]  would go up to black people at the gym and say blacks are dumb and subhuman and
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:22.280]  I'll kick your ass man if he walked up to me I care the guys big Roy that I'll
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.520]  stomp his head in the ground man I'm serious I'm taking on people as big as
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:30.420]  Schwarzenegger back when I was 20 years old 18 I mean I'm not bragging saying
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:37.320]  I'm tough I just can't make people put up with this Christ crap I'm sick of him
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:46.120]  anti-gun pro-abortion open border promoting sack of Nazi pus oh he said he
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:51.280]  admired Hitler and dressed up in Nazi uniforms I mean he's a fruit man he
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.800]  wears a Nazi belt buckle on the cover of Rolling Stone everybody's too stupid to
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:01.560]  see it don't get me off of my Schwarzenegger thing I shouldn't sit up
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:04.920]  and say I'll beat up Arnold Schwarzenegger all I know is is the guys are
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:14.760]  coward and the guy is an American and the guy it makes me sick and I will not
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.520]  pay him money he's part of the carbon trading companies I guess Californians
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.000]  already are so you know into these people it's like Brian Williams I can't
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.800]  stand him I can't stand Obama I can't stand these lying pieces of crap it's
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.880]  like they got out the governor they had there and I was supportive of the recall
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:39.040]  but not for Schwarzenegger blaming him for Enron connections when Schwarzenegger
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:43.760]  was involved with Enron people are stupid and helpless I love to control
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:49.280]  them it's that enjoying that people are dumb and he can pray on them he's a
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:55.160]  psychopath but you know what everybody I know doesn't like Schwarzenegger he's
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:11:02.440]  a washed-up nobody and he'll get his from God so I shouldn't go off on a jag
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:07.120]  screaming about Arnold Schwarzenegger I'm just saying that I'm surprised but I
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:12.400]  know he was the big star somebody stand up to him but it's just to hear about
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:15.920]  this guy and the things he did it's just another example of these bullies
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:22.300]  getting away with whatever they want to do and I'm tired of it I'm sick of it
[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:27.040]  I'm sick of these cowards having their way with people I'm sick of them praying
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:34.800]  on people I'm tired of good men laying down to these people excuse me I'm gonna
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:43.480]  stop right there I'm a little bit crazy today I'm sorry I blew off working out
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:49.760]  I've been working out like an hour in the morning real intensely and finally
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:55.240]  gotten a good enough shape to do power clings deadlifts things like that and I
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.760]  didn't work out this morning and I went and ate breakfast instead after the
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:01.560]  kids went to school and because I've got a amount of homeschooling right now I'm
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.000]  going to a prep academy really good homeschooling was good they're getting
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.280]  older want the socialization and well I'm telling the story right now so when I
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.600]  now when I don't work out I have more energy and I'm even more crazed but it's
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:18.680]  the working out that's making me crazed so I need to keep doing the working out
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:22.440]  but then it just sometimes it's a little bit out of control because here's what
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:26.400]  happens I tell you on this show what I'm thinking there's not a filter here and
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:29.840]  that's what people tune in and put up with me but sometimes it's a little out
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:35.480]  of control and I apologize I want to play this because it's all about why
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.360]  they're forcing inoculations on us the social engineering then we'll go to Bob
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:50.960]  Carl Gordon Tessa Ken and others here on this live worldwide Friday edition of
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:56.280]  the Alex Jones show that I call Alex Jones live but Ted Anderson 18 years
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:59.640]  ago said no we're not gonna call it in for worse live we're gonna call it Alex
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.800]  Jones because the stations need to have a name set over and over again so it
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:07.480]  gets written in the Arbitron ratings so that's why it's always the Rush Limbaugh
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:12.560]  show the Glenn Beck program the Alex Jones show the Sean Hannity program the
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:17.040]  Michael Savage radio show it's not that people want to have their name out there
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.400]  over and over again it's that has to be done for the ratings so Alex Jones
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:26.160]  Alex Jones Alex Jones but that's how that works let's go to this piece you
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:29.640]  can see the video up on info wars.com we'll play the audio here for radio
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:36.560]  listeners I've starved species greater than you that's what her voice ought to
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:41.960]  be like I'm Satan the spirit of the destroyer that is destroying the planet
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:47.080]  with genetic engineering mutilating God's creation and vandalizing the human
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:52.640]  species the creator's greatest creation in his image and my plan is to sell you
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.040]  on destroying yourself and your family and loving death and turning off your
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.920]  survival mechanism and destroying your family so the state and the computer
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:07.520]  robot age can corner every last one of you and slowly suck the life force out
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:14.600]  of you into the block of deep space that should be the voiceover for this
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:28.720]  stinking ad instead it's an MPR voice some call me nature Julia Roberts others
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:37.120]  call me mother this call me mother my name is Satan over four and a half
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:44.320]  billion we'll have her long you've been here we're of 22,500 times longer
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:51.960]  than you I don't really need people bull but people need me humans are
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:58.160]  obviously older than this planet your future depends on me when I thrive you
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:07.800]  thrive not of this world when I falter you falter or worse
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:19.440]  I mean they show a glacier sloughing off from the first Viking text written over
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:23.640]  a thousand years ago about the glaciers it's how in the summers they collapse it
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:28.280]  snows they're in the winter and it piles up and then when it gets hot the
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:33.360]  glaciers move and melt and slough off it's always going on but they play on
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:39.160]  people's ignorance I mean this is so sick another lecturing voice real slow I'm
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.760]  your mother but the mommy talks about starving us later let's go back to the
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:49.960]  clip but I've been here for eons and then I have sped species greater than you
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:56.160]  oh really and I have starved species greater than it costs these people are
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:59.000]  so weak they're in all this eugenics stuff because they're they're powerless
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.360]  and they hate humanity because they are they're they don't see themselves as
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.080]  dominant so so they get together in these death cults to then pull down people
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:10.480]  greater than them and that's why they're like I've starved species greater than
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:15.440]  you oh yeah what's the species greater than us I didn't see Tyrannosaurus Rex
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:23.120]  sending spaceships into orbit or coming up with mathematics I mean shut up shut
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:29.520]  your murderous fat mouth you pig here's the issue they've taught people that love
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:35.840]  life to lay down and be cowardly that's over you understand that scum you're not
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:42.480]  turning our life force off you're not flipping our self-destruct switch the

[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:37.920]  if you believe the Bible made in the image of the Creator who's not of this
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:43.120]  world and that's what most of genetic engineers and elites now believe time
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:46.720]  magazine Reuters you name it they go actually with life was brought here
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.240]  humans were probably engineered well but but it's not what this Bible said that
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.560]  turned out to be accurate written thousands of years ago as if there's
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:58.040]  nothing to learn for one of the most ancient texts on the planet that matches
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:07.080]  up with other ancient text it's not like the Bible said it's like Prometheus said
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:11.360]  but see it's about you feeling guilty and now the government will represent
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.880]  Mother Earth and she'll decide who starves and who lives so you need to feel
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.200]  guilty and live real poor we're gonna genetically engineer and dump all the
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.480]  stuff that hurt the earth it's just humans that are bad period because the
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:29.440]  system is of the spirit that hates humanity I love humanity I want to

[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:29.320]  results is with our dollars that's why the globalists want to shut down the

[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:40.920]  markets the girls with the lemonade stands is because that's the enemy they

[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:50.080]  fighting the Borg but you believe it's deep space space aliens the devil
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:54.400]  whatever I don't get into all that the elite say they're building a Borg
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:58.200]  world it was like in Reuters yesterday and a bunch of places that top
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:02.600]  scientists met and said the elite are funding them to merge their brains with
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:06.200]  machines to live forever and Peter Thiele's in the news saying I'm gonna live
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:11.320]  forever all of them it's all they talk about they're on a power trip and they
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:17.200]  decided we're not going to get access to all this if they actually develop it and
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:21.480]  to make sure you don't compete with them they call us bad sons give it a crate
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.200]  myrtle tree or an oak tree in your yard and little trees pop up around it and
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:31.360]  the gardener kills them or you cut them that's the real eugenics and their
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:35.240]  argument is if you're stupid enough to take vaccines and if you're stupid enough
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:38.580]  to eat GMO and preservatives and fast food you deserve to be brain damaged and
[02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:45.560]  die but they pass a cosmic line when they come out and they say it's the law
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:50.760]  you will take it and it's safe and effective they're basically coming with
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:56.360]  guns to kill us it's it goes into territory that we're not talking about
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:01.880]  not being violent anymore and I'm not planning anything violent myself I want
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.160]  to be clear but you want to shoot me up with stuff that's known to brain damage
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:09.200]  people and known to hurt people in a large percentage of the time and the
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:13.000]  insert says it but you're lying well you know what they don't do force an
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:21.180]  oculation last time I checked in North Korea nobody does it nobody except the
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:29.160]  military nobody this is a big deal we're taking your phone calls Bob Carl
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:35.560]  Gordon Tessa Ken and others let's go to Tessa in Texas you're on the air go
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:41.760]  ahead hi Alex I'm a Christian and I'm pastor's wife and I've been dealing with
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:46.760]  this issue for quite some time I actually only recently started listening to you
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:51.560]  probably maybe a year and a half ago because I quite frankly I had my head
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:55.200]  in the sand as well until my brother talked to me about a few things anyway
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:00.040]  see that's good news your brother helped help help help get you to open your eyes
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.280]  and then wake up he didn't tell you what to believe he got you to think exactly
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:09.960]  and so I just find it interesting all the stuff that you're talking about today
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:15.160]  because this week I've been ranting all week to my husband and how the church is
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:21.040]  so closed-minded and closed have their ears closed to hear in the truth of the
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:26.160]  reality of what's going on today and half of the problem is is they're so
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:31.480]  focused on the coming of Jesus that they will not link the coming of Jesus with
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:36.240]  today's reality of what's going on well absolutely and people aren't you
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:39.680]  aren't gonna be able to save people if you don't explain to them about the the
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.120]  devilish system we're in we're gonna lose everybody but instead they just say
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:47.840]  no we're gonna hide the church till the end of the world I mean this is crazy
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:52.480]  right and that's that's what's bugging me and I talk to people about things and
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:58.760]  they think I'm absolutely crazy and so I just even today I got on Facebook I
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:03.120]  ranted on Facebook I call my rent but I was starting to put up different things
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:07.720]  that the the new world order is trying to do to open people's eyes to the fact
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:13.400]  that it's going on right now and it's such a deception in the church and so I
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:18.800]  think the only way that I can just encourage Christians out there to really
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:23.400]  talk to people is to dig up the facts about the population control and
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:28.000]  different things like that and link them with you know second Timothy link them
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  with Matthew 24 and link them with Revelation and really come at it that
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.320]  way because I think that's the only way you don't that we're going to be able to
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.840]  really open their eyes to what's going on you're right look the church has been
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.480]  pretty much government run in this country for about 80 years that's why
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:48.440]  we got Roe v. Wade through I mean 1973 they said we're gonna start killing
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:53.880]  babies and so nobody's safe the veterans aren't safe nobody's safe and look the
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:58.240]  average person at a church is there because they're scared they've got some
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:01.480]  discernment they know there's trouble they're hiding in the closet well we're
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:04.280]  not three-year-olds hiding in the closet because because this globalist
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:08.720]  boogeyman is real and the only way you're gonna defeat it is admitting it's real
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:12.480]  and get your heart right because beyond physically dealing with it people need
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:16.800]  to know that they need to admit the evils going on to get their heart right if
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:20.000]  they're living in a delusion they're gonna accept the next delusion that
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.160]  comes to take the chip which is already starting in Europe they're making people
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:28.080]  get chips to have jobs that was BBC last week I mean it's here and they and they
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:31.600]  teach Romans 13 in these churches do what government says that's not what it
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:37.720]  says and so people got a choice to make the great delusion is coming and folks
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:42.600]  better get their heart right and God bless you but they're doing that because
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:45.840]  they're scared they don't want to hear from you because they feel powerless so
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:50.880]  I've moved on to folks that want to fight we're on the March the Empire's on the

[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:39.960]  absolutely totally sick of it sniveling anti-gunner Brian Williams there's
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:45.480]  another sign that the dinosaur media is on its last leg and now there's a
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:49.040]  growing storm drudge report has the headline over Katrina tales where he
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:52.640]  claimed he saw dead bodies floating by his hotel they got satellite photos and
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:58.040]  video there was no flooding at all around his hotel as if they would put
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:03.960]  somebody like him in harm's way I mean it's just unbelievable people said that
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:08.640]  Chris Kyle was lying about them wanting snipers to shoot people at Katrina we
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:14.440]  actually broke that and Chris Kyle that was true and Chris Kyle did refuse to
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:18.800]  shoot looters from a distance but what wasn't looters they were shooting people
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.680]  trying to walk out on the bridge they were keeping people in the city and
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.400]  making them go to the Superdome I just a side issue and I'm not defending Chris
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:31.280]  Kyle I just try to find out the truth I try to report the truth doesn't mean I'm
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:35.160]  always accurate but I try to be I certainly don't claim that I was shot
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:42.080]  down in a helicopter in fact I don't tell people half the stuff I did it just
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.760]  doesn't sound believable truth is really strange with the fiction I'm gonna hurry
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:50.600]  through your calls I want to go to a lot of them and land market his report we
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:56.000]  got callers calling in on a bunch of issues vaccines earthquakes let's go
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:04.160]  ahead and talk to Bob in Texas on the earthquakes increasing go ahead yeah you
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:10.800]  need to back off that DNA or that mail force you're going into orbit well I'm
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.360]  not taking more but I'm telling you it does craze me it really but it does
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:16.840]  there's no stuff I don't ever have a side effect from it it's like
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:22.680]  unbelievably delicious I got to get some of that stuff I could use it I'm 62
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:26.540]  look out I mean it took me about a year and a half I would only take half the
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:30.160]  dose now I built a tolerance and probably take more than I should but it's
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:34.440]  it's real I mean it's not a game it's something else that's all I gotta tell
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:38.840]  you well then I'll have to get myself a harem too then I guess no no not for
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.880]  that we're working out being healthy well anyway speaking about stand day oh
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:48.840]  it's hard to talk about his presentation buddy we don't we don't screen
[02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:52.080]  what you say we only get your name where you're going from well I've called
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:57.160]  before on this subject and Stan Dale cleared the path for me today he was
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:00.440]  talking about the panic and chaos that would ensue if people knew that there
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:06.720]  was a natural calamity coming and I had mentioned before that it appears to me
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:12.600]  from my research and other people who validated is that they actually created
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:16.560]  global terrorism to get us under control because they know a big disaster is
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:20.760]  coming a natural calamity and they couldn't tell us that because of the
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:26.120]  chaos is Stan Dale said would ensue so they concocted the global terrorism to
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:29.880]  get us under control take our rights away and then force us into getting these
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:34.360]  vaccines which are probably a binary weapon that will be used in conjunction
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.240]  to reduce well we know there we know there's social engineering chemicals
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:42.200]  in them and they're hurting us but yes there's a lot of evidence that there's
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:47.240]  a binary nature to a lot of it well I guess you're aware that the Sun part of
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:50.880]  what Stan Dale is talking about that the Sun has gone into a quiescent period and
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:58.520]  a fellow named John John Casey who's backed up by PhDs and in
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:03.480]  controversial evidence he's gained over I guess 30 40 years that we are going
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:06.960]  back into an ice age and that's going to cause the eruption of these super
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:10.640]  volcanoes like Stan Dale was talking about that's why they're monitoring them
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.920]  and that basically my point is is that the terrorism was concocted is the
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.520]  cover to get us under control here's why I disagree with that I mean they
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:24.080]  won't control for a lot of reasons including natural disasters but it
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:28.600]  almost becomes a cover story an excuse and I appreciate your call and I'm not
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:32.920]  disagreeing with you in total but they're targeting nuclear families and
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:36.120]  small farms and ranches and people that want to be prepared and small
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.760]  independent solar power and wind power if you have solar they want it in the
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:44.160]  grid they're targeting people being self-sufficient if they knew there was
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:48.440]  going to be giant tectonic stuff and major cities destroyed and you know they
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:54.960]  could kill a billion people or whatever and the breakdown they would be pushing
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:58.880]  and giving tax incentives to get ready the elite are building bonkers are
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:04.560]  building hardened redoubts run for the hills it's because they're engineering a
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:07.560]  global collapse that they get all the wealth and then come in and buy
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:12.160]  everything up and out of that crisis carbon taxes and we're oh my gosh people
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.280]  are poor we need a world government with a hundred trillion dollar taxes every
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:21.240]  ten years to fix it oh you're in a depression grease we'll put you under
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:26.600]  our control and double your taxes to get the rich people when they're giving it
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:31.560]  to themselves so this is just a giant rape operation going on at one level
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:35.800]  with a bunch of mercenary corporate people but up top at bohemian grove and
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:44.000]  skull and bones it's a bunch of weirdo lucifer worshipers and I'm not attacking
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.120]  gay people but I mean that's just what goes on it's a bunch of rich republicans
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:52.360]  and democrats and world leaders having gay sex and believing they're gonna
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:55.280]  merge the machines and live forever I mean that's just what's going on you
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:59.400]  want to get the bottom of the rabbit hole that's what's happening I mean that's
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.920]  just it these people are nuts and they fly on the female hookers to I mean I
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:08.440]  but that's just I'm telling you what they do what they're into what they're
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:14.000]  and they I mean what was the it was in a bunch of headlines yesterday because
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.280]  they were announcing at Davos last week it was remote control mosquitoes that
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:22.960]  forcibly inject you and with vaccines or take your DNA and then then a couple
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.840]  days ago was yes we're gonna merge with machines live forever well you can go to
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:32.320]  endgame like two plus hours into it it's nearly end guys it's on YouTube try to
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:35.920]  find it towards the end it's it's when you see the infinity sign as they warp
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:38.920]  to the universe and I'm reading quotes where they're gonna merge the machines
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:42.120]  and live forever and I've been attacked in the New York Times you name it for
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:47.000]  that of course because that was eight years ago see I'm proven right again but
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:52.040]  I was quoting them there that's why they want to give you vaccines to hurt you to
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:57.680]  dumb you down to medicalize you to put you into their system period that does
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:02.440]  not mean you couldn't take vaccines and get some benefit from them if they weren't
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:10.880]  jacking them it's real simple it'd be like if some guys sold rotten milk on
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:15.920]  purpose tainted and it killed people and we said don't buy his milk and be like
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:19.360]  why are you against milk you do what you don't like milk and I'm like no that
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:27.440]  milk's bad come print a like I'm not against gin but bathtub gin isn't really
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.600]  gin and has a bunch of chemicals and it'll make you go blind sometimes it'll
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.080]  kill you and make your kidneys fail so so I'm like don't drink that bathtub gin
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:38.280]  how dare you you teetotaler tell me not to have a drink I'm like no no not that
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:42.520]  that's not gin that that's come on that's really bad alcohol brewed in the
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:50.520]  bathtub it's really toxic you don't want it to see medical tyranny happens in
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:56.480]  every culture over and over again the Nazis the Soviets used it we're here
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:00.760]  repeating history it's a no-brainer they've got bills to put TSA on the
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:04.000]  streets and not let you travel or have a job if you haven't done what they say I
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.480]  mean this is it can't buy or sell without TSA approval can't have the
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:14.200]  national ID card have we heard of this you should have every preacher in your
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.400]  town should be talking about this but let me tell you the FBI comes to their
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:20.520]  offices the feds come to their offices if you got over 400 people in your
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.160]  church unless they're speaking out against this and that's a minority of
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:27.040]  churches all the real churches are speaking out against this and there's
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:30.960]  probably 10% out there doing it there's a few churches in Austin doing it but if
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:35.080]  they're not doing it they're in infraguard they're in clergy response
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:39.120]  team they're probably getting money we know they get money but some of them
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:42.520]  don't get the money they just get like some federal funds for vans or TVs or
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:47.320]  whatever I mean these are and they are on power trips why they've got the little
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:52.000]  ID card a little FBI ID card little FEMA ID card in there they go to their
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.320]  weekly meetings or monthly meetings and pull into the federal building and feel
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.720]  real powerful they're like the mayor and red dawn who thinks he's really cool
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:04.080]  selling out the people in the town I mean these people don't even know what
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:07.600]  traders they are because it's America's the good government America's run by the
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:13.680]  good guys and well they're in a homeland security meeting and when they're
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:16.640]  first recruited in they're given good missions they're given reasonable
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:21.000]  things or just looking for security because extremists might try to attack
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.480]  your church we don't think it's a target but it's just good for us to have a
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:27.360]  little a liaison with you and here's some al-qaeda training videos look for
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:31.640]  any Muslim extremists below our you know and then next it's like I mean and they
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:37.400]  turn into CIA shy op wagons I mean they've got experts psychologists in
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.280]  these things they get people's wives and husbands to break up they go in and
[02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:44.120]  try to get women to break up with their husbands and then loot their money I
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:53.320]  mean they're basically mainline churches today are what you hear the media say
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:43:00.480]  Scientology does the mega churches are the most predatory mind control viciously
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:05.040]  hateful satanic some of these TV preachers are so evil I can almost see
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.160]  horns and tails on them spiritually when I'm looking at them I mean I can't
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:13.800]  look at it I got to turn it off because I start screaming and yelling because it's
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:20.040]  so ragingly demonic I'm I apologize I said I take a lot of calls and I'm not
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:23.280]  doing it I did it yesterday the day before I just horrible person Carl in

[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:14.360]  that's another thing the GMO they're putting it in us and the fluoride so
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.280]  they we say that but they are hitting us so we've got to do whatever it takes to
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:25.360]  avoid it sorry sorry I hear I hear you on the Facebook last night big deal hit
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:34.000]  the fan there and they said that urban Texas accepted Sharia law and I saw one
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.920]  of the big networks had a video clip on it so I'm assuming it's for real say that
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:46.920]  again a lot of the networks had had a piece on it also so I'm assuming that
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:53.720]  Sharia law in urban Texas has been accepted well yeah I mean what's
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:58.720]  happening is Muslims have their culture we've given up our culture Christian
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:02.840]  culture Americana culture so we have no culture on average we're plastic
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:06.520]  rewritable discs that just do whatever the TV says when you're a mainline
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:10.840]  person and so any outside culture that's still intact will take over an
[02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:15.080]  empty culture so we've been made empty to be dominated but then outside cultures
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:19.760]  come in and then they begin to dominate because I mean we put up with anything in
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:24.920]  this country and so yeah radical Islam is then able to intimidate other Muslims
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:28.640]  into following it as well and it's taking over you can debate Islam all
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:32.640]  day long you can debate anything but undoubtedly radical Islam is on the
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:36.800]  march right out of Saudi Arabia might as well be the eye of Soran over there in
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:43.800]  the Temple of Mount Doom the Mount of the Power as false to do but I'm mixing
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:49.920]  my metaphors there is there a dagger from my back in her hand now I'm quoting
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:56.480]  Max von Sydow but yes sir interesting point anything else no that was it
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:05.640]  all right God bless you you too let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Seattle Ken
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:12.160]  you're on the air welcome hey Alex I got a quick question I saw you guys had an
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:16.080]  article on this but I don't think there's been anything on the show about it
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:21.280]  I was wondering if you guys are gonna follow up any on the creator the main
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:25.720]  creator I guess there's two guys involved of the Gray State project the
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:31.640]  movie that he was apparently found in a murder suicide with his wife and child
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:37.560]  yeah I didn't tell the TV people we've covered it to reach out to them and I
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:40.840]  don't know if we've had any effect on that I know Joe Biggs has been talking
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:46.600]  to them and they were gonna release the film I'm going to one is I know Ben
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:53.440]  Swan's been on top of it I'm on and I think I heard something about Josh
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:57.480]  Josh Stone maybe trying to pick up the project and move forward with it so
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:04.280]  Sean stone yeah Sean stone sir all right well you know getting involved with
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:07.760]  people's movies and their own productions like herding cats so I don't
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:10.080]  usually get involved in other people's productions I can't even hardly get my
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:15.560]  own done and I got a great crew of course as would be suspected of course you
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:20.040]  know a lot of people are pretty much thinking that this was some kind of a
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:24.280]  hit you know like a disguise as a murder suicide yeah that happens that's one
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:27.480]  of their favorite ways to kill people because they demonize who they set up
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:34.120]  when they do it and that undoubtedly goes on but if you expand on that and you
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:38.760]  know really look at all the different angles of what's involved here I think
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.280]  that film needs to come out I mean I was the guy that did crowdfunding sourcing
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:45.600]  for me though I wasn't part of the film most people they come to talk shows and
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:49.280]  say when you do crowdfunding for us you got you you're given a position in the
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:53.520]  film I have people on here crowdfunding and do not take positions people contact
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:57.120]  me and go we want to give you a position I go no if I like what you're doing I'll
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:00.200]  just have you on and promote it and if my listeners like it then then they'll
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:03.000]  support what you're doing but then about other people preaching out saying you've
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.720]  got to finish it now you've got to help them and it's kind of like oh I'm the
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:12.600]  guy that helps them get the money to start making it no so I just I just can't
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:15.880]  even mine my own shop so I'm not gonna be able to try to get that done but I
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:19.800]  will reach out to those folks and maybe get them on the broadcast but then we
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:23.480]  did reach out to them and it became an argument with their people about showing
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:29.160]  clips of it I'm just like you know what's fine go do whatever you want I can't
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:33.000]  investigate everything I can't cover everything I can't deal with everything
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.600]  all I can do is read the inserts to vaccines saying they can give you
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:42.400]  diabetes guion beret neurological disorders permanent convulsions and you
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:47.280]  know epilepsy kill you just go they want to force you to take things that can
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:49.600]  kill you they're now announcing it's mandatory even though it's not
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:53.600]  mandatory to create a foregone conclusion Borg you will be assimilated mind
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:57.120]  control and I'm totally freaking out I'm totally upset I'm totally angry so I'm
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:02.160]  just engaging in some flippancy here I appreciate your call Gordon in Canada
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:10.440]  you're on the air go ahead hello Alex hello Canada Alex I heard John George
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:15.320]  Norrie last night it was fantastic piece well thank you brother okay Alex
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:20.280]  there's something something has shifted up here in Canada in the last few days
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:27.240]  they are going on a full court press for against what they've labeled as these
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:32.600]  anti-vaxxers there's just from the government the media health care
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:37.320]  officials there is a global intimidation bullying push worldwide from
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:43.280]  Africa to Canada from Germany to Japan to force the slaves to take the shots but
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:49.160]  there's something palpable in the air like they keep hammering on this measles
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:55.160]  outbreak in Disneyland Alex this week two young people in Nova Scotia died
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:59.240]  mysteriously of meningitis nobody's talking about that you know why they're
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:03.320]  doing it because they've got vaccines that are killing people they've got
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:06.800]  thousands that have already died last year and going into this month and last
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:11.840]  month from this quote a bizarre neurological disorder it's polio and
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:17.360]  they're almost all kids that were just vaccinated so yes there's a huge vaccine
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:21.840]  death thing going on like the swine flu death epidemic vaccine in the 70s and
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:26.400]  they're covering it up with a double down push that vaccines are perfect and
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:32.160]  never hurt anybody it's definitely a push it's like they have a mysterious
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:35.880]  deadline and they're they're going for it and it's not just people with an
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:39.960]  extreme view for being attacked because they're telling us if your kid is not
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:43.400]  vaccinated now he's not going to be able to go to school and that's a lie they've
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:47.200]  not changed your law the waivers are all there this is their push yes this is
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:51.240]  it this is a full-on war by a pack of liars like Brian Williams they're a

[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:19.800]  bunch of calls about Islam and Sharia law in Texas there's some internet
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:23.340]  news stories about it yeah there's some mosque that have some of their own little
[02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:29.200]  courts but it's not legally binding and they're not locking anybody up and and
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:34.480]  that's just gonna go on and that's not what people have to worry about if we're
[02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:38.520]  about al-qaeda or ISIS being led into attack us so the government can then
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:43.520]  legitimize taking more freedoms but we'll discuss it nevertheless just I
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:45.920]  want to talk about vaccines mainly so we're talking about Sharia law but that's
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:52.960]  okay David in Atlanta Georgia you're on the air welcome hey Alex good to hear
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:57.560]  from you are glad to have my call in the air thank you yeah I just wanted to call
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:55:02.320]  in and say thank you so much for being here and please don't thank me don't
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:08.120]  thank me what's your view on vaccines I I try to stay away from them as much as
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:12.200]  possible as soon as I heard that they were putting mercury in there was brought
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:19.760]  up a big red flag that's kind of racist hey you know try not to be racist but if
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:22.920]  they want to call me that whatever well I'm being sarcastic yeah it's like I
[02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:25.680]  don't want to obama care your races I'll turn my guns in your races just shows
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:30.480]  how mindless it is how they just use that look it's about free choice it's
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:34.800]  about not having to take it look they they claim we're gonna make people sick
[02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:40.400]  but they've already had the vaccine and there's no studies on herd immunity it's
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:47.440]  just total bull yeah I completely agree quickly I my brother actually had a it
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:50.360]  was a chickenpox vaccination when we were kids and my mom's not a
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:54.480]  confrontational person she's kind of said you know I'd rather not give it to
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.520]  him but then they ended up pushing her on it he got it and and just a couple
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:03.000]  days later he had chickenpox worse than anybody had ever seen and I mean he had
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:08.240]  them in his mouth you know it was horrible and he has skin problems today
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:11.360]  I mean this has been years later I know a lot of people have had those different
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.160]  vaccines and pus drips out of where they shoot them up for decades then they
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:19.200]  got a big juicy cancer there but again Brian Williams just said they're
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:22.520]  totally safe and effective and there's never been a problem any vaccine though
[02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:26.640]  the insert says it can kill you just doesn't exist I mean this pack of liars
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:34.080]  is gonna try to bully us now and you're taking hundreds of shots no no no no now
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:38.040]  I completely agree and you know if they said that cyanide was safe to put in
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:43.640]  vaccines people would be taking it one other quick thing if you don't mind about
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.960]  this partial birth abortion there's a video if you can find it online that
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:51.560]  actually shows the procedure and I have never been so angry yeah I've seen the
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:56.080]  videos before years ago I can't watch it it's unbelievable it I've never been so
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:57:00.600]  angry and and the things that we do to our own children is just is horrible so
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:05.200]  well my two things Ryan Williams said it's not a human so and he's a hero so
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:09.720]  black peacock down that we've got a graphic up on infowars.com thank you

[03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:00.480]  calls we're watching Fox News the other night I just I watched that to remind me
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:06.440]  how bad that news actually is Bill O'Reilly believe it or not and he
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:09.280]  actually had just been turned on there he was on there with the interview with
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:13.920]  Alan combs on the the radio the other day oh good and why do they demonize him
[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:18.160]  so bad I don't I just don't get it I mean he makes more sense than you do then
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:22.240]  the name of these idiots on Fox well I hate Ventura because because he wouldn't
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:25.720]  be for the war they had to pay out a six million dollar contract was at nine
[03:01:25.720 --> 03:01:29.560]  million in MSNBC and I don't agree with all of interest politics but he's the
[03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:33.600]  real deal and he really he's a real guy just a blue collar guy you know with
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:38.160]  war hero parents it was I think it's dad like six or seven brown stars in the
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:41.800]  Battle of the Bulge that but all that's a side issue the point is just a good
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:46.640]  blue collar you know family from Minnesota and and they know he's got
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:50.360]  grassroots appeal so they've been busy destroying him because they're scared of
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:55.560]  a third-party run I mean it's on record the CIA visited him his first day as
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:59.640]  governor and basically tried to intimidate him so they know that they
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:03.960]  don't control Ventura so they don't like him they're assassinating him that
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:08.320]  they're assassinating his character and I used to listen to Rush Limbaugh you
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:12.040]  know we're talking 20 years ago he was pretty good back then but he's gone now
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:17.120]  he's so pro-bush pro-Republican I can't listen to listen to the guy anymore you
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:20.920]  know yeah I mean he'll admit Boehner and them have sold out and trying to open
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:25.520]  the borders and all the rest of it but he doesn't I mean he is completely deaf
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:30.040]  he has elect you know a artificial ear he doesn't sound like he used to I don't
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.440]  want to sit there and attack the guy but it's not the Rush Limbaugh that I heard
[03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:39.120]  20 years ago I agree you've done for globalists what he did for liberals
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:43.920]  back then so yeah and I mean you know I'm up against Limbaugh not by choice it
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:47.160]  was Ted Anderson and a guy named Michael Turdo the program director at the
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:52.400]  network I was on at night loved it great callers during the day but
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:56.320]  statistically you just get more folks home that are drunk you know the call
[03:02:56.320 --> 03:02:59.840]  in so you get some bad callers but we have some good ones mixed in but I like
[03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:03.240]  doing a nighttime show I'm really awake then I'm not really a morning guy I
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:05.760]  mean I get up in the morning I feel pretty good but not compared to nighttime
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:10.160]  I'm a nighttime guy I don't stay up real late but I just you know thank my best
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:13.360]  from about five to ten at night and they said no you're going up against Limbaugh
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:16.520]  because nobody else will we can get you affiliates and they were actually right
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:23.000]  it actually worked and in more than 10 cities over the years we've gotten better
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:28.560]  ratings than him on small stations that's unheard of their answer is they
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.080]  always just get bought out and they put sports on or other talk radio so it
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:36.600]  isn't just when it's like I'm a race car driver that with a race car that isn't
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:42.080]  half as good has beaten the champions and then what you get is a boycott
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:46.840]  campaign in the city to shut you off you get their attention oh Alex Jones is
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:51.560]  number one in Orlando Alex Jones is number one in Rochester Alex Jones is
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:54.880]  number one in this Southern California town Alex Jones is number one in you
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:58.800]  know this area and just like clockwork I'm taking off the air so that's what
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:04.280]  you get when you're number one and no doubt you line me up fair shake up
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:09.600]  against any of these people I would destroy them in the ratings it's just
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:13.000]  the fact because I'm real it's it's put I'm not saying I'm not good at talk shows
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.680]  just compared to these people I'm great because people only hear hardcore news I
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:20.440]  appreciate your call and it just shows how they try to suppress liberty it's not
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:24.160]  that I'm popular it's that freedom is popular they just never let it get on
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:28.480]  the market they try to suppress it so people don't know what's out there and
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:31.920]  what's available but if you could ever get freedom in front of people they'll
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:36.360]  choose it they've just been like mushrooms in the dark getting fed poop for so
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.640]  long by Brian Williams who vomits it out like the mama owl to the babies you
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:44.680]  know Brian Williams pooping out his mouth to little baby little little babies
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:48.000]  out there little baby viewers that they don't know they just think you live in
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.840]  the dark and are fed piles of horse manure out of the horse manure horse
[03:04:51.840 --> 03:04:56.080]  butt that is the mouth of Brian Williams and Hillary Clinton I'm sorry to be
[03:04:56.080 --> 03:04:59.360]  gross but I mean this who these people are
