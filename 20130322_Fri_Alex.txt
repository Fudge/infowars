[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.560 --> 00:21.320]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.320 --> 00:47.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday.
[00:47.160 --> 00:57.220]  It is the 22nd day of March 2013, and it's all unfolding every day. It gets more out
[00:57.220 --> 01:05.400]  of control, more insane, more wild, more tyranny, just absolutely out in the open with everyone.
[01:05.400 --> 01:11.480]  They're just admitting that the Pentagon and international agencies and other corporate
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.460]  groups just spy on everything you do, living in a glass house while they make what they
[01:16.460 --> 01:21.000]  do totally secret and arrest reporters all over Europe and the United States that report
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.880]  on corruption when they should get Pulitzer Prizes for it.
[01:26.880 --> 01:33.240]  Now US plans calls for more scanning of private web traffic email. That's out in Reuters.
[01:33.240 --> 01:39.680]  More scanning, it's not snooping, it's not spying, it's scanning. The head of one of
[01:39.680 --> 01:45.960]  the heads of one of the IT areas of this operation, we're now doing a study of it.
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.560]  We're now catching Google. When we begin to type something before we even type it, it
[01:50.560 --> 01:53.960]  knows what we're gonna type. Undoubtedly, they've got it activated. They had a patent
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.920]  out eight years ago on it to have the microphones listening with keyword software to then direct
[01:58.920 --> 02:02.400]  you towards ads and things.
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.560]  That sounds crazy. It is crazy. And we know they have that technology and we're starting
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.220]  to have instances of it with multiple crew members. So now we're going to try to set
[02:10.220 --> 02:15.240]  up cameras and screen capture systems and actually catch this in the act. I mean, they
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.780]  say they've got it, they say they're using it, but it's like just out there.
[02:18.780 --> 02:22.520]  It's kinda like the government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria, but now they're in the
[02:22.520 --> 02:28.200]  news today saying we may need to invade Syria because of Al-Qaeda and we're declaring Al-Qaeda
[02:28.200 --> 02:35.800]  in Syria terrorist while they run them and arm them. And again, we talk about this so
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.360]  much but it just shows how it's all hiding in plain view.
[02:39.360 --> 02:46.960]  In fact, Lou Rockwell is reporting, will the US really condemn terrorists in Syria? And
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.320]  then it basically echoes what I wrote yesterday with Paul Watson, Obama now global head of
[02:52.320 --> 02:57.320]  Al-Qaeda. Will president order drone strike on White House? And of course, that's absurdist.
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.040]  He's not gonna do that on himself. Just as it's absurdist, they're running the terrorist
[03:02.040 --> 03:06.160]  publicly and no one will call them on it, even though it's in hundreds of newspapers
[03:06.160 --> 03:09.760]  that, yes, the West funds them and runs them, but we need to take all your rights because
[03:09.760 --> 03:10.760]  of the terrorists.
[03:10.760 --> 03:14.600]  And by the way, the terrorists are now gun owners and veterans. And the good old boys
[03:14.600 --> 03:18.920]  are still like, well, get rid of my freedom then, I'm Al-Qaeda. I love hating Muslims
[03:18.920 --> 03:25.840]  so much. If you say the Tea Party's with us, with Al-Qaeda, if you say we're with them
[03:25.840 --> 03:34.280]  then arrest me. I mean, it's just Alice in Wonderland writ large and it's getting worse
[03:34.280 --> 03:37.200]  by the minute.
[03:37.200 --> 03:43.880]  Then there's of course video stills that have been released of TSA making a W amputee Marine
[03:43.880 --> 03:51.880]  Corps veteran get up and walk on his stumps. And by the way, I've seen this with old ladies
[03:51.880 --> 03:55.420]  who are clearly going home to die. There's been cases of this in the news where someone's
[03:55.420 --> 03:56.720]  going home to die in Michigan.
[03:56.720 --> 04:01.520]  I've seen them make people get out of wheelchairs where they can't get up and they're yelling
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.040]  at them and they won't help them. And then they make people in line pick them up like
[04:07.040 --> 04:11.640]  it's a prison. And then you see the people are reeling in pain with their back blown
[04:11.640 --> 04:17.200]  out and they rip bandages, colostomy bags and feces sprays everywhere.
[04:17.200 --> 04:27.320]  I mean, this is all on record, urology bags. They'll even rip the urology bags they use
[04:27.320 --> 04:31.080]  actually go into ports in the body and they'll jerk those out of your body. And it's all
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.840]  part of sacraments of desecration of America to train us to be good little slaves. I mean,
[04:35.840 --> 04:41.740]  it's all just entering total and complete cuckoo land.
[04:41.740 --> 04:45.160]  And yeah, you guys just had that article actually pulled up. You can go to the actual article
[04:45.160 --> 04:50.840]  which had the blurb and it has the still that the video still images. Yeah. I mean, go and
[04:50.840 --> 04:54.440]  click on the Washington Times. At least the version I have actually has the video stills
[04:54.440 --> 04:56.300]  on it.
[04:56.300 --> 05:01.440]  But them making the guy get up. All right, we'll be we'll be right back. Introducing

[08:05.880 --> 08:17.640]  Homeland Security. Homeland Security begins with hometown security. It seems apparent that our
[08:17.640 --> 08:24.400]  citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scarring particularly difficult, even with
[08:24.400 --> 08:33.440]  this year's rule changes to recap those revisions. Women are still worth 10 points more than men in
[08:33.440 --> 08:43.520]  all age brackets. But teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70
[08:43.520 --> 08:54.640]  points. The big score, anyone, any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100 points. As always,
[08:54.640 --> 09:07.720]  how fast you move determines how long you live. It's Friday to tyrants is obedience to God. Oh,
[09:07.720 --> 09:18.680]  yeah, it's Alex Jones. Alright, launch primary ignition. Monday through Friday 11am to 2pm
[09:18.680 --> 09:28.680]  Central, 12 to 3pm Eastern, 9am to noon Pacific, 10am to 1pm Mountain or Montana time. We are here.
[09:28.680 --> 09:36.840]  Thank you so much for joining us today. Okay, first off, I tweeted earlier today and made the
[09:36.840 --> 09:48.520]  point that this could be Obama's water lube. This could be Obama's Watergate. This could be Obama's
[09:48.520 --> 09:56.360]  Bastille Day. This could be the end of the Obama cult that the globalists are trying to push here
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.360]  in the United States to bring in collectivism to domesticate the general population while imploding
[10:01.360 --> 10:07.720]  the nation to offshore our wealth to mega rich who are exempt. The very same mega banks imploding
[10:07.720 --> 10:16.040]  Europe signing them on to their debts. And what is that water lube? What is that big battle they
[10:16.040 --> 10:21.560]  can lose? It is the bullets. It is the fact that they bought billions of bullets and tens of
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.560]  thousands of armored vehicles the last four years. It's just 2700 big armored vehicles in the last
[10:26.560 --> 10:34.480]  few months they purchased. And they are domestically deploying them. We have a article up at
[10:34.480 --> 10:41.000]  infowars.com that's on FEMA's website that ties it all together where FEMA is training local police
[10:41.000 --> 10:49.560]  to be federalized for civil unrest, riots, civil war, mass casualty drills. I mean, they're
[10:49.560 --> 10:55.240]  training for all out war. And the Army Times admits they're training for the military to be
[10:55.240 --> 11:00.320]  used for gun confiscation. And there's Army manuals for gun confiscation and Army manuals
[11:00.320 --> 11:05.160]  for FEMA camps and how to process us with the social security numbers. And all our articles
[11:05.160 --> 11:12.760]  are up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com with the links going directly to fema.gov and
[11:12.760 --> 11:17.400]  army.mil. So if you're mainstream media or Congress people that listen to the show,
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.080]  then a lot of them do. And you're saying, where is this? Just type in Army manual for gun
[11:23.080 --> 11:32.360]  confiscation in US. Army manual for FEMA camps for Americans. FEMA manual for federalization
[11:32.360 --> 11:39.320]  of police, urban warfare, preparations in America. It's all there. You can search those terms.
[11:39.320 --> 11:46.280]  And you won't just have infowars.com at the top. Under it will be army.mil, fema.gov. It's all
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.040]  right there. Click it, go read it. And we've written articles about this. And there'll be
[11:52.040 --> 11:56.840]  trolls under the article saying, this isn't for America, move along. And then we show the social
[11:56.840 --> 12:03.000]  security numbers, how it's for America, videos of their own website showing drills for confiscation
[12:03.000 --> 12:18.440]  in America. It is for America. This is program LFFE of FEMA, 2013 field force extraction tactics.
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.480]  That's grabbing people off the streets. That's snatch and grab. We saw him practicing on real
[12:23.480 --> 12:28.360]  people up at the G20 when Rob Do got arrested. The famous footage of guys in military uniforms
[12:28.360 --> 12:35.560]  with no patches jumping out of police sedans, unmarked, and just snatching innocent press
[12:35.560 --> 12:40.280]  and dragging them in. And then we later learned, we said, that's US National Guard.
[12:40.840 --> 12:47.160]  And we got a call from G20, global security, with that number, from the security forum,
[12:47.160 --> 12:53.720]  because our articles got picked up everywhere and said, that is national security authorized private
[12:53.720 --> 12:57.160]  security. And we just want you to know that we have been instructed to tell you that was not
[12:57.160 --> 13:03.000]  the National Guard. And then they hung up on Rob Jacobson. They called his number. I call them
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.440]  back and they go, you've been given your answer? And that is it, and hung up. And it was the field
[13:08.440 --> 13:11.960]  security number. So I called other numbers and they wouldn't talk to us after that. They just
[13:11.960 --> 13:17.560]  called up to say, that is our private security. And it turned out those weren't real people.
[13:17.560 --> 13:21.240]  They were arresting thousands of real people for no reason. They were randomly snatching and
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.880]  grabbing and throwing people into sedans and unmarked vans as a shy op to see what the media
[13:27.880 --> 13:34.120]  would do. They would go to the media area, the authorized media throng, and grab someone.
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.080]  And I called it. I said, that guy is laughing after he's thrown in the back of the police
[13:39.080 --> 13:45.400]  car and doesn't look concerned, that reporter. Guys, for TV viewers, type in snatch and grab
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.920]  Pittsburgh G20, and there's a bunch of footage of it on YouTube with millions of
[13:50.920 --> 13:54.120]  views. Just type that and we can show viewers, but listeners can go look it up.
[13:55.320 --> 14:00.680]  Then in Canada at the G20 a few years ago, they started doing it, but then they shifted live.
[14:01.240 --> 14:07.560]  Some of it was real. And then they started grabbing real people. They went and grabbed
[14:07.560 --> 14:11.320]  people in front of the media to see if the media would say anything. And then when they didn't,
[14:11.320 --> 14:19.400]  they went live. I mean, they have got this scientifically broken down. Yep,
[14:19.400 --> 14:26.680]  here they found some of the footage. Yep, boom, gold sedan pulls up. Men in US Army uniforms grab
[14:26.680 --> 14:32.760]  them, cram them in the back of the vehicle. We noticed that one moment of smiling and giggling,
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.560]  the guy's not really fighting him. Cuz he really would have fought him,
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.680]  he'd have bounced his head off the ground like a bowling ball, or like a basketball with pleasure
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.320]  and extreme prejudice. Anyways, there you go. That's not even one of the best res versions of
[14:47.320 --> 14:50.760]  it. There's a better res one out there. There's a bunch of those. And then now the real black
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.200]  vans show up and they grab real people. See, they tested, can we run a North Korean op?
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.680]  And America said, we love North Korea. They said, we're gonna hammer your butt then.
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.440]  And now in Austin, they go, you don't hand magazines out and you don't have a bumper sticker.
[15:05.960 --> 15:09.560]  Until I came down there and said, I'm gonna sue you. And then the word came down from
[15:09.560 --> 15:13.960]  R.A. Seveda. Now, Aaron called the police, got all the names, what happened, and told him,
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.520]  don't do that, he can hand out magazines. But the point is,
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.600]  I mean, what if I didn't know the police chief? I mean, in America, this is what we've become.
[15:24.600 --> 15:29.880]  And it's like, big deal. You understand how creepy that is? You understand the magnitude?
[15:29.880 --> 15:34.440]  This is their Waterloo. This is how it works. We either gain everything or we lose everything.
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.720]  They're going for it all, we go for it all. You understand that?
[15:38.680 --> 15:43.560]  If they can buy 2 billion bullets, 10,000 plus armored vehicles the last four years. I mean,
[15:43.560 --> 15:50.920]  we've videoed them in Austin, big, giant, black, huge, heavy armor. These things can take heavy
[15:50.920 --> 15:57.400]  rockets, heavy mines, IEDs, big, giant, black FEMA vehicles all over the country photographed.
[15:57.400 --> 16:03.640]  You've seen them, I've seen them. Every major police department's got Korean War, Vietnam,
[16:03.640 --> 16:12.920]  and then now even modern six-wheeled strikers, warriors, all these big vehicles that the
[16:12.920 --> 16:17.640]  military is getting rid of. I mean, I've shot video, I could take you up to the DPS storage
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.800]  yard north of Austin and show like nine of them lined up last time I was there.
[16:21.800 --> 16:26.040]  I mean, these look like the thing on a Red Dawn the Soviets drive,
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.080]  big six-wheeled deals. And they're just like, doesn't exist, doesn't exist, doesn't exist.
[16:31.080 --> 16:35.160]  I mean, that's actually in the news every day. There are no armored vehicles, there are no
[16:35.160 --> 16:40.120]  bullets. There's black helicopter drills all over the country where they blow up part of a building
[16:40.120 --> 16:45.160]  and terrorize people and then go on the news and say does not exist. They've been doing that for
[16:45.160 --> 16:51.160]  20 years. It can be in the Houston Chronicle that a Delta Force helicopter crashes, killing people,
[16:51.160 --> 16:55.720]  a building blows up, and the local news said didn't happen.
[16:58.920 --> 17:02.600]  Didn't happen in the Houston Chronicle, but Soldier of Fortune
[17:02.600 --> 17:06.200]  got the photos and videos from locals and put stills of it in their magazine.
[17:07.160 --> 17:10.440]  By the way, I've had the Colonel on before, we ought to get the head of Soldier of Fortune on
[17:10.440 --> 17:16.040]  sometime, he's an interesting guy. The point is that this is the type of stuff, okay, I mean,
[17:16.040 --> 17:21.160]  look, helicopters were crashing, blowing up, drills everywhere. And I start covering it,
[17:21.160 --> 17:26.120]  the newspaper comes out and says I'm crazy. I mean, that is a shy op, ladies and gentlemen,
[17:26.120 --> 17:33.560]  but here's the deal. If that was a one on a Richter scale in 1996, 97, 98, 99, when Clinton
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.800]  was thinking about martial law and going into police stations all over the country, Delta Force
[17:37.800 --> 17:43.960]  was, and saying, we may bring in martial law. Are you for that? And handing them giant briefcases
[17:43.960 --> 17:52.200]  full of $100 and $1,000 bills. 150, 200,000, police chief, mayor, entire city council.
[17:53.320 --> 17:57.560]  And when I interviewed Chief Alai Philippus, that's online, Alex Jones interviews,
[17:57.560 --> 18:00.840]  San Antonio police chief. He'd been in the military, he'd been in Vietnam,
[18:00.840 --> 18:04.760]  he'd been in army intelligence. He thought it was a setup to sting him or something.
[18:04.760 --> 18:08.520]  And then he said no, obviously, and then found out most of the city took the money.
[18:08.520 --> 18:14.200]  How does Delta Force take over, or how does Special Forces take over in Iraq? They bought
[18:14.200 --> 18:20.120]  off almost all the Iraqi generals before using Nazi blitzkrieg tactics. You're like, blitzkrieg's
[18:20.120 --> 18:23.000]  a lightning war, not buying people off. You don't know about the blitzkrieg, do you?
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.840]  That's actually not true. The blitzkrieg began with a two year program to buy off almost the
[18:28.840 --> 18:38.600]  entire French command and offer them dictatorship position out of the city of Vichy, Vichy, France.
[18:38.600 --> 18:42.920]  And that's why Hitler defeated him so fast. Only the British fought a little bit,
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.680]  and then ran to Dunkirk. See, this is all history. It's in the mainline history books,
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.960]  you're just not taught it. So they're running a Nazi program, a blitzkrieg program,
[18:51.960 --> 18:56.600]  so that everybody's bought off or they know who isn't bought off when they launch their attack.
[18:56.600 --> 19:01.480]  And decapitate governors, legislatures, all of it. And you need to know when the helicopters are
[19:01.480 --> 19:04.840]  hitting the local mayor, and they're hitting the local capital, and they're hitting the local
[19:04.840 --> 19:09.480]  station, and they're hitting it, attacking it, and got miniguns out the windows saying terrorists
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.200]  are in there, that's the takeover. And folks, those are gonna be UN troops in many cases
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.920]  in those craft with collaborators who were so stupid or who were mercenaries and believe this
[19:18.920 --> 19:24.600]  is part of the attack, and believe they're really killing terrorists. Okay, they've already done the
[19:24.600 --> 19:29.720]  buying off, the paying off over 20 years. They believe they've got us, or they think they do.
[19:29.720 --> 19:34.440]  So we either gain everything in this by learning of their sneak attack plan,
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.520]  cuz I'm like a guy in France running around in 1939 going, they're gonna attack, they're gonna
[19:38.520 --> 19:43.160]  attack. And there were people doing that. They're like shut up conspiracy theorists.
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.840]  We either realize the attack, they lose everything in this, or they go hot.
[19:47.960 --> 19:53.000]  And what will precipitate it? Something like a small atomic bomb going off that they'll blame
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.200]  on us. Now I'm gonna break this down when we get back, how to defeat them.
[19:57.240 --> 20:00.840]  If you don't wanna go under new world order control, totally. Well, stay with us.

[22:34.200 --> 22:38.920]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having a lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[22:38.920 --> 22:42.920]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[22:42.920 --> 22:47.080]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson.

[24:20.360 --> 24:29.160]  By the way, I'm not kidding. When I get up here on the air and I break these things down,
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.400]  this is what I really believe. And of course, we're gonna be criticized if we hold all this
[24:35.400 --> 24:42.120]  back and we stop their other false flags. People are gonna say, why didn't they take over?
[24:42.120 --> 24:49.000]  As they slowly take over with the highway checkpoints and the gun restrictions and say,
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.640]  yeah, the NSA is spying on everything you do. That's back on the news today. I'd talk about
[24:53.640 --> 24:59.640]  that a decade ago, 15 years ago, and literally be laughed at. I'd be called in the program
[24:59.640 --> 25:04.440]  director's office and say, Alex, the government isn't listening to all our phone calls with
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.320]  something called Echelon. This actually happened. Now, I'm getting calls about this and you're
[25:09.320 --> 25:14.200]  making stuff up. And I'm like, no, no, no. Here it is. This ABC News reporter's broken it down
[25:14.200 --> 25:19.160]  and it's really happening. And it's had all the phone companies, everything's wired through it.
[25:19.160 --> 25:24.520]  And just Alex, you got a future, but you need to just stop making this stuff up. And by the way,
[25:25.160 --> 25:31.240]  I've gotten some calls by the owners up in Scranton, Ohio, or whatever it was.
[25:32.120 --> 25:36.280]  And they've had some heat put on them. They don't want any more talk about these urban
[25:36.280 --> 25:41.400]  warfare drills, black helicopters and stuff, okay? Just kind of do your conservative thing
[25:41.400 --> 25:48.440]  and drop it. And by the way, don't talk about my Marines ever again. I'm a Marine Corps veteran.
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.880]  And it's unpatriotic for you to, cuz I've gone and shot footage of Marines trying to take guns.
[25:53.880 --> 26:00.120]  And I said, I'm not against Marines, but they shouldn't be told to go do unconstitutional
[26:00.120 --> 26:06.200]  things. Are you concerned? He goes, listen, I'm being nice to you. You're fired. You're fired if
[26:06.200 --> 26:13.960]  you talk about it again. And I'm like, first he's being all smiley. He slaps his hand down and goes,
[26:15.160 --> 26:18.600]  you're fired. You talk about them again. And if you talk about Bill Clinton,
[26:18.600 --> 26:21.400]  or if you talk about Governor Bush, you're done.
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.280]  In fact, I want you to talk about more about relationships. And I'm like, is this a joke?
[26:26.280 --> 26:32.280]  He goes, I'm not joking with you. And I said, but I mean, I'm not saying the German soldiers
[26:32.280 --> 26:37.160]  were bad at first. It was that they were being given bad orders. And he said, get out of my
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.320]  office. And then a few months later, I had the BBC there with me coming to interview me.
[26:42.520 --> 26:47.080]  And I walked in, it was during the day before my nighttime radio show. I had a show six days
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.480]  a week by then because of high ratings. A lot of sponsorship, very successful, huge buzz.
[26:52.840 --> 26:55.560]  National TV covering us all the time because the stories we were breaking.
[26:56.440 --> 27:01.800]  And he walks up and smiles and he goes, get your stuff and get your butt out of here. You're fired.
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.920]  And he just enjoyed it so much and just smiled at me. And
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.600]  that's an example of all the minions in the system that don't even know why they're being
[27:12.600 --> 27:18.520]  told something. He also in the talk said, they're really upset about Jay Leno talking about you.
[27:18.520 --> 27:23.880]  And I said, what's wrong with that? Jay Leno talked about some of the reports I was doing.
[27:25.560 --> 27:29.720]  Did it again recently. And I said, what's wrong with that? I said,
[27:29.720 --> 27:32.040]  I got ratings, people are listening, I'm telling the truth.
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.600]  And he said, look, you're fired if you don't shut up. And then a few months later said, I told you.
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.400]  He's just smiling. He was just like, you're fired, get your stuff, your career's over.
[27:43.400 --> 27:46.120]  And I said, I've already do a show out of my house that's bigger than this. They go,
[27:46.120 --> 27:51.800]  oh yeah, your imaginary show. I was on like 10 stations at that time through a little
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.920]  Patriot network that Ted Anderson was part of. I guess Ted had actually taken it over.
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.160]  The point is, is that I don't know why I'm even getting off into this. It's just that
[28:01.160 --> 28:04.600]  you come face to face with people that tell you you're not gonna talk about this.
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.400]  Because it's powerful, ladies and gentlemen, that the military has been turned against us secretly
[28:10.040 --> 28:14.840]  and is training to take our guns and that that's now public. That's woken the military up.
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.800]  That's woken the veterans up. So the government's saying the veterans are the number one terrorist
[28:19.800 --> 28:23.960]  in all their new reports that are public that we broke, but are now household stories.
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.480]  I mean, think about that. The government runs Al-Qaeda and says they're good, but that the
[28:29.480 --> 28:33.480]  new Al-Qaeda is veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, those that believe in a second
[28:33.480 --> 28:39.400]  coming of Christ. This is all official. That's the bad guys. That's the bad guys. They're saying real
[28:39.400 --> 28:43.640]  Americans are the terrorists. I mean, come on, this should completely backfire on them.
[28:45.240 --> 28:47.480]  And it is backfiring. I'm gonna cover this when we come back.

[29:16.760 --> 29:21.240]  Try it again. There you go. Big Sis refuses to answer Congress on bullet purchases. Now,
[29:21.240 --> 29:27.480]  look at the update right there. 14 members of Congress demand investigation of Obama ammo hoard.
[29:27.480 --> 29:34.040]  What did I say two weeks ago and last week? I said, if we hammer this and you call everybody
[29:34.040 --> 29:39.080]  in Congress and you make a big deal out of this, this is gonna become a congressional hearing,
[29:39.720 --> 29:44.680]  just like Fast and Furious. But this has really captured people's understanding and imagination.
[29:44.680 --> 29:50.120]  We can defeat them with this. This can be their Watergate if you make it.
[29:50.120 --> 29:56.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:57.080 --> 32:03.800]  You can bet your life on e Foods Direct. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food
[32:03.800 --> 32:09.000]  I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally
[32:09.000 --> 32:14.120]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that,
[32:14.120 --> 32:19.800]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are
[32:19.800 --> 32:25.080]  hundreds of great products at info wars team.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped
[32:25.080 --> 32:34.040]  me lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst,
[32:34.040 --> 32:38.360]  and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[32:38.360 --> 32:44.840]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners
[32:44.840 --> 32:50.520]  to go to info wars team.com and to order just three of their products. And you will see the
[32:50.520 --> 32:56.280]  changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately. Start your journey
[32:56.280 --> 33:09.640]  to health and wellness today. Info wars team.com. In the councils of government, we must guard
[33:09.640 --> 33:16.200]  against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought by the military
[33:16.200 --> 33:22.440]  industrial complex. In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in
[33:22.440 --> 33:28.360]  downtown Dallas. The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded
[33:28.360 --> 33:33.720]  by this shooting. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[33:37.160 --> 33:41.880]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion. It just pancakes.
[33:41.880 --> 33:49.080]  Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[34:01.080 --> 34:03.560]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that
[34:03.560 --> 34:06.920]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[34:06.920 --> 34:19.400]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[34:19.400 --> 34:23.960]  city. Global governance at last. Is it one world the central bank is in charge,
[34:23.960 --> 34:27.480]  but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[34:27.480 --> 34:31.400]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[34:33.800 --> 34:38.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[34:43.800 --> 34:46.840]  All right, let me calmly go over the news here.
[34:49.320 --> 34:54.600]  Let me just calmly go over the fact that we have globalist collaborators that have been financed,
[34:54.600 --> 35:00.040]  run for office, put in power, placed for decades as they looted America,
[35:00.040 --> 35:04.760]  as they took over pension funds and invested them in fraudulent derivatives to steal the money,
[35:04.760 --> 35:10.760]  to wreck society, as they militarized police, as they had Hollywood condition us in every movie
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.200]  I go see. There's police checkpoints on the highway, randomly searching everyone to condition
[35:16.200 --> 35:21.880]  you. There's troops on the highway. We watch television, you watch dramas, sitcoms,
[35:21.880 --> 35:27.800]  anti-family messages, anti-gun messages, on record paid for with your tax money. They pay
[35:28.520 --> 35:35.240]  Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, all of them, government, what they call behavior placement money.
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.720]  I call it propaganda placement. They've been doing it for 60 years, but now
[35:42.360 --> 35:45.560]  the budgets in some cases are 100 times what they were.
[35:45.560 --> 35:55.240]  I mean, it is incredible. Bush spent something like $8 billion in media, in fake news,
[35:55.240 --> 36:00.440]  just to get No Child Left Behind through, which was to federalize education. So conservative.
[36:00.440 --> 36:04.120]  Remember just a quarter mill paid to that radio talk show host?
[36:05.400 --> 36:11.080]  Remember that? What was his name? The black radio host and columnist, I've interviewed him before,
[36:11.080 --> 36:16.440]  before that all happened. Quarter mill to have one conservative push it.
[36:17.320 --> 36:21.400]  There was $8 billion spent, they had a congressional investigation, $8 billion.
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.880]  $8 billion just to get one program passed. You're talking about money.
[36:27.880 --> 36:33.400]  That's why you turn on any show. Call CPS, this woman's not giving her child vaccines.
[36:34.120 --> 36:38.440]  She's putting cigarettes out on them to equate not taking shots and putting cigarettes out on them.
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.360]  My wife goes, I'd like to watch some TV sometime, late at night when you're at work or
[36:42.360 --> 36:45.800]  kids are asleep. Cuz I'd like to watch it when I'm on the stair stepper. She goes,
[36:45.800 --> 36:51.480]  it's everything, every drama, every cop show, every medical shows, women love those.
[36:51.480 --> 36:54.200]  She comes and goes, this one, that one, it's so incredible.
[36:55.800 --> 37:03.160]  But the general public is just there basting and marinating up to their eyeballs and having no idea
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.800]  and cops are all TV heads too. So when they pull you over, you got an NRA sticker,
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.000]  they're like, what's that? What are you doing? Are you a terrorist?
[37:11.000 --> 37:19.960]  I mean, this is what's going on. It is incredible mind control. And they've got people so disconnected
[37:19.960 --> 37:25.400]  from reality, the central government run by offshore globalist publicly created Al-Qaeda.
[37:25.400 --> 37:28.840]  You know, I put an article out yesterday about Obama runs Al-Qaeda.
[37:28.840 --> 37:31.400]  He's the Chicheler head of it worldwide, we have all the proof in the article.
[37:31.400 --> 37:38.680]  And I tweeted it, I saw the comments on the Twitter. And one guy was like, Alex,
[37:39.480 --> 37:43.000]  you know, what, you have selective historical memory?
[37:44.600 --> 37:49.240]  It was Reagan that helped create the Taliban and Al-Qaeda to fight the Russians. Our article says
[37:49.240 --> 37:54.120]  that, it was actually Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski. But yeah, it's not about partisan,
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.520]  it's about this is a long term program. The point is, it's never been so massively funded
[37:58.520 --> 38:03.640]  with 10,000 heat seeking missiles plus that can shoot down aircraft given to Al-Qaeda.
[38:03.640 --> 38:08.440]  And then they separately say, we've got to invade Syria cuz Assad's with Al-Qaeda.
[38:09.880 --> 38:14.440]  Our government runs Al-Qaeda, attacks this innocent country, murdering people,
[38:14.440 --> 38:19.080]  chopping Christians heads off, blowing up synagogues, churches and mosque.
[38:19.080 --> 38:23.400]  They just blew up the biggest Sunni mosque there that supports the government and doesn't
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.880]  support Al-Qaeda. That's Sunni out of Saudi Arabia. They just killed him and blew up a
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.240]  bunch of people in the mosque. In fact, type in bombing in Syria. It just happened this morning.
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.000]  And there's photos of just everybody splattered in one of the mosque.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.760]  They sent Al-Qaeda in, the Wahhabis, Sunnis, to blow up Sunnis.
[38:42.440 --> 38:47.640]  And our media is hailing it. It was a victory against Assad, his number one Sunni backer dead.
[38:47.640 --> 38:56.440]  And then I saw another article implying Assad did it. Was Assad have hand in it?
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.240]  I mean, Mohammed Karzai on records, a total opium dealer,
[39:03.240 --> 39:08.920]  UNICAL executive put in by the West. But even Bush, well, four or five years ago,
[39:08.920 --> 39:12.040]  or I guess six years ago now, they're in a press conference. He goes, Bush is like,
[39:12.040 --> 39:19.400]  we need to hit Iran. They're supporting Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. And Karzai,
[39:19.400 --> 39:22.920]  knowing this is gonna be broadcast all over the Middle East and Central Asia,
[39:22.920 --> 39:29.880]  knowing how ridiculous that is, says, sir, your excellency, I apologize for correcting you,
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.120]  but I must. Cuz I mean, it was like saying the Dallas Cowboys, the Washington Redskins.
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.040]  I mean, it was that ridiculous. He goes, sir, respectfully, you can pull this up.
[39:38.040 --> 39:44.760]  And he goes, sir, respectfully, Iran is our biggest ally against Al-Qaeda, sir. They are Shiite
[39:44.760 --> 39:48.920]  sworn enemies of Al-Qaeda. And Bush is like, nope, you're incorrect. He goes, yes, sir.
[39:50.920 --> 39:57.560]  Because I mean, over there, they are incredibly informed about this,
[39:57.560 --> 40:02.520]  cuz they're all killing each other constantly. Shiite, Sunni, Alawites, all little subgroups,
[40:02.520 --> 40:09.080]  the Zoroastrians, all of it. So it was just so ridiculous. But here it's like,
[40:09.080 --> 40:12.360]  we've gotta attack Syria, they're with Al-Qaeda. And now we're told we've gotta
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.520]  invade all of Africa with Afrikaans. Al-Qaeda's got Libya, isn't that horrible?
[40:16.520 --> 40:23.000]  And it's newsflash, Al-Qaeda, Libya, striking US drones to deal with them. Our government put them
[40:23.000 --> 40:30.600]  in. And then good old boys go, Alex, we're just funding the Arabs to kill each other.
[40:30.600 --> 40:34.440]  That's how you get things done. I say the more of them are dead, the better.
[40:36.200 --> 40:40.360]  The New World Order hates you a lot more than they hate the Arabs and the Muslims.
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.520]  Good old boys, you are the number one terrorist. That's what they're training for,
[40:44.520 --> 40:48.440]  is to take your gun and put you in a forced labor camp. Okay, they'd like to do that.
[40:48.440 --> 40:55.320]  That's on record. So get that through your brain real good. And military and all you CIA people
[40:55.320 --> 40:59.720]  and black ops folks, you're all gonna be killed later. You're gonna be long knifed,
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.760]  night of the long knifes. You are the biggest chump idiots there are.
[41:05.480 --> 41:09.720]  I mean, I've seen all these guys with their, the little goatees and the shaved heads and
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.760]  walking around like they're all tough and evil. You're not evil, you're dead. And you're going
[41:14.760 --> 41:23.480]  to hell. How's that losers? You're cozied up to Satan. Okay, take your shots, enjoy yourselves,
[41:23.480 --> 41:29.240]  drink some fluoride, your whole family's cursed. Unless you hit your knees and repent to God,
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.560]  you're pathetic. Real men would stand up for justice and stand up against evil and
[41:33.560 --> 41:39.080]  stand up against the psyops. Believe me, when you go before God, he's gonna say, I know you not.
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.280]  I know a lot of you though, you're into evil, aren't you? And you don't think there's a God,
[41:44.280 --> 41:47.320]  do you? But deep down, you know there is. You know why you know there is?
[41:47.320 --> 41:49.720]  Cuz you've got a personal relationship with Satan.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.440]  And so you know there's the other side of that equation, don't you?
[41:54.440 --> 42:02.040]  Yeah, you know you're scared and you should be. You will be a lot more scared. So I suggest if
[42:02.040 --> 42:07.880]  there's any humanity left in you and any touch of God left in your soul before the door is fully
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.600]  closed to you, that you understand that you're fools and that you've been deceived. I mean,
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.160]  you guys, they trained you to kill innocent Muslims over a million of them and trained
[42:17.160 --> 42:20.440]  you to do all this evil. And most of them come home, get all drugged out, commit suicide,
[42:20.440 --> 42:26.840]  they're so depressed about it. But the rest of you guys get off on it, and now the script is flipped
[42:26.840 --> 42:34.040]  and you just like to kill people. You like to go out to Arizona to that former CIA pilot,
[42:34.840 --> 42:38.760]  greets him and his kids. You're a real tough man cuz you can shoot little kids, I know.
[42:39.400 --> 42:44.040]  You think that's a mark of your strength that you can shoot little kids in the head,
[42:44.040 --> 42:51.800]  shoot little kids in the head. That's easy to do. You people, you like it. That's because you're
[42:51.800 --> 42:58.920]  damned to hell. Not me, I'm not part of any of this and my soul is not in your end of the ball
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.000]  field, okay? I just want that on record, not in my name, I'm not involved in this.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.520]  And everybody else better decide what side they're on. Everybody else better decide
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.760]  what they're gonna stand with for eternity. Let me tell you something right now, folks,
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.560]  stuff's gonna get real serious in this country and real serious worldwide real fast.
[43:15.560 --> 43:19.000]  And if you're not right with God, I feel sorry for you.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  Now most of the military's waking up, but they don't care. The globalists just throw you out,
[43:25.800 --> 43:29.560]  list you as mentally ill, try to inject you with deadly shots when you go to the VA.
[43:29.560 --> 43:32.040]  All their little frontline ponies get taken care of.
[43:34.280 --> 43:37.560]  But I just want that clear to all of you out there that think you're winning. You're not winning,
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.880]  nothing. You're 30 years old and serving the New World Order for a decade, think you're real tough,
[43:41.880 --> 43:44.680]  think you're on the winning team. You're gonna be 60 before you know it.
[43:46.600 --> 43:49.880]  And the shadows are gonna be creeping across the floor at midnight when you wake up.
[43:53.720 --> 43:57.320]  You think I mean people coming to kill you? No, I mean the shadows that really matter.
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.080]  When the grim reaper comes for your soul, that's what I'm talking about.
[44:03.080 --> 44:12.200]  A skinny one. Hope you get ready. All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's continue here.
[44:12.200 --> 44:17.400]  Oh, let's go over the news. I said I'd do it. Here, let's go over how we can defeat these people,
[44:17.400 --> 44:22.520]  okay? They have miscalculated and their giant arms build up against us.
[44:22.520 --> 44:25.880]  And they don't mind some of that leaking out as they think it scares people in the know.
[44:26.520 --> 44:30.440]  But people in the know now understand there's nothing left if we don't stop this. So
[44:30.440 --> 44:34.360]  you better be scared of not doing anything. You better be scared of waiting for them to come for
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.920]  you. You better be scared waiting for them to shut off our power plants and shut down the last of our
[44:38.920 --> 44:43.240]  jobs and put tens of millions more people on welfare to be dependent on their system.
[44:43.240 --> 44:47.480]  To vote out our guns, to vote out our families, to vote in forced inoculations,
[44:47.480 --> 44:53.000]  to vote in total tyranny. And the government tracking everything you eat and sleep and do.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.600]  Look at this headline. Police departments beg and barter for ammo while DHS buys up
[45:00.600 --> 45:10.600]  1.6 billion rounds in the past year. CNS news. Now I thought that didn't exist. And now you've
[45:10.600 --> 45:15.480]  got AP and Reuters, everybody having to admit the bullets. Doesn't that hurt the system?
[45:16.520 --> 45:19.720]  Saying the last year there were no bullets, there were no armored vehicles.
[45:19.720 --> 45:25.400]  By the way, everybody's going off old numbers. It's over 2 billion, it's been over 2 billion
[45:25.400 --> 45:29.640]  for at least two months, okay? There's your facts, okay? And yes, they're doing it to
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.240]  hoard bullets and drive up prices. I mean, they're going to companies and saying,
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.280]  whatever you can make, no matter how much you scale up in the next two years, we're buying it.
[45:38.280 --> 45:41.240]  They've taken delivery of a billion, they got another billion being made.
[45:41.240 --> 45:49.000]  And that's why you can't get the 308, the 223, the 40, the 9 millimeter, all the things they use.
[45:50.040 --> 45:53.960]  So now they bought all that up where you can't get it, literally can't get it in most areas.
[45:55.080 --> 46:01.400]  So now they're making orders for hundreds of millions of weird ammos, weird calibers.
[46:03.320 --> 46:05.400]  If they can't ban your guns, they're going to ban your bullets. I mean,
[46:05.400 --> 46:06.920]  this is what they're doing. I mean, you can watch,
[46:06.920 --> 46:10.600]  hey, I got a little newsflash for you, a bunch of globalists.
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.200]  Checkmate, if you think you got to get the bullets to move on us, we already knew you
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.040]  were coming before you did this. We already got bullets, we already got guns.
[46:25.320 --> 46:28.840]  And again, you're like, well, do you want to have an offensive attack? Absolutely not.
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.920]  My point is they're going to start stuff, okay, out of desperation. That's why we don't want to
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.800]  shoot first. I don't want the shooting to ever happen. I want to try to reach out to people in
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.400]  government, corporate systems, everywhere and say, hey guys, I know you're all on power trips
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.320]  thinking you can't be stopped. Do you really want to go down this road? Do you really trust the
[46:45.320 --> 46:49.720]  people above you? Do you really think getting rid of checks and balances is a good idea?
[46:49.720 --> 46:52.440]  Do you really think butchering the whole bill of rights, the constitution,
[46:53.560 --> 46:59.080]  is going to empower you as the government grows? You're crazy. Once they take over,
[46:59.080 --> 47:03.240]  they're going to shrink the size of the general government, as they always do.
[47:03.240 --> 47:07.160]  And you are going to be fired and you're going to be listed as terrorists. And the guys that
[47:07.160 --> 47:10.840]  have done really dirty stuff, you're going to prison if you're lucky. You're going to be killed.
[47:11.880 --> 47:16.440]  Hell, they even may have a fake revolution where patriots take over and then purge you.
[47:16.440 --> 47:21.640]  I will oppose that without due process. I do think there should be Nuremberg trials
[47:21.640 --> 47:23.880]  for all you guys just for what you planned if we beat you.
[47:23.880 --> 47:29.320]  But if you say you're gonna give people the death penalty, they fight a lot harder. I mean,
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.280]  you know, for those that have done lesser things, you can leave. Just like we did in 17,
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.960]  you know, at the end of the war, 1776, what, four, five, six years later?
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.040]  And then those of you that have committed the actual crimes and stuff, you need to go to prison.
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.560]  We'll release all the potheads out of the jails and all the drug offense people that
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.800]  you sold drugs to, and then we'll put you in there and let you bust some rocks for a while.
[47:51.800 --> 47:57.000]  But I don't have that in a vindictive way. You need to be locked up, because let me tell you,
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.640]  you don't lock these people up. They're gonna regroup and come back at us,
[48:01.640 --> 48:03.880]  so they've got to be locked up, but they've got to have trials.
[48:07.400 --> 48:12.040]  They've all got to have trials with juries, but you're all going to prison,
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.160]  and you need to go to prison. And again, I would say let you leave, but you can't be trusted.
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.040]  I'd like to end this as peacefully as possible, but people have to think big and realize we can
[48:22.040 --> 48:26.440]  beat them first and realize they have outrageously overreached. Look, I told you last week and week
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.760]  before last, in shows just foaming at the mouth, because I realized how important this was.
[48:33.640 --> 48:41.000]  Remember when I called in from the beach when I was off for a week, and it was Mike Adams and
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.440]  Aaron Dykes filling in, and I said, I have a plan to defeat them, we can defeat them.
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.440]  They're scared of this bullet story, that's why they've got 20 or so stories a day saying
[48:50.440 --> 48:55.320]  it doesn't exist, and saying Sarah Palin's insane, and Matt Drudge is insane, and Alex Jones is
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.480]  insane, and none of this exists. Why did Sarah Palin cover it? Because she knows they're scared
[48:59.480 --> 49:03.880]  of it. Look, whatever they're scared of, folks, is where we can get them, because when it comes out,
[49:04.520 --> 49:08.120]  it's in the army manuals. It's all public, they're trying to take our guns,
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.240]  and all the NRA has got to do is bring this out. They're always saying, don't be radical,
[49:13.240 --> 49:17.880]  don't be like Alex Jones, the kook, because I've got the winning game plan, which is just reality.
[49:18.600 --> 49:23.720]  Going all the way, admitting these are bad people. Listen, they denied Fast and Furious for two years
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.960]  until it all came out. Congress is so scared of them, and so blackmailed, they backed off,
[49:27.960 --> 49:31.000]  but it at least came out. They did stage that to blame the Second Amendment.
[49:32.120 --> 49:35.800]  And that's an important thing, because now people know they staged stuff.
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.880]  But on this thing, this has really captured people's imagination.
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.840]  And now up at infoawars.com, link throughout the Drudge Report, we've updated that story.
[49:45.800 --> 49:51.160]  Big Sis refuses to answer Congress on bullet purchases, DHS staying mama's members probe
[49:51.160 --> 49:57.560]  for explanations. Now 14 members, it was two last week, now it's 14 this week.
[49:57.560 --> 50:03.240]  It'll be 30 something next week. I told you exactly this, and you did it. You got the articles,
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.320]  you got them out, you called Congress. And I hope you know what I'm doing right now is,
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.920]  if anything gets me killed, it's this, okay? I mean, I'm really going after them.
[50:10.920 --> 50:16.760]  I know how to beat them, okay? They're a bunch of collaborators like the Vici French with the Nazis
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.800]  before the takeover. And if you don't call them out all the way, it's over. Right here,
[50:21.800 --> 50:27.000]  I'm calling them out, right here. Obama now global head of Al-Qaeda, you see that?
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.680]  You see this right here? Will President order drone strikes on White House?
[50:30.680 --> 50:34.360]  People go, that is outrageous. It is, it's outrageous he heads Al-Qaeda
[50:34.360 --> 50:39.400]  while saying they're fighting Al-Qaeda. I'm pointing it out that it shows the insanity of
[50:39.400 --> 50:43.640]  this. They think you're an idiot, get out of your trance. Let me tell you something,
[50:44.600 --> 50:48.280]  we need to have congressional hearings about the army manuals for gun confiscation,
[50:48.280 --> 50:52.440]  the army manuals for reeducation camps. It says reeducation camp in the document.
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.640]  We need to force all this out, and then they won't blow up a city and blame it on us,
[50:57.640 --> 50:59.640]  and bring in martial law. We got to block them.

[52:06.600 --> 52:13.320]  in 2010. Then I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97 percent of my DNA that scientists have
[52:13.320 --> 52:18.200]  called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in
[52:18.200 --> 52:23.480]  controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with
[52:23.480 --> 52:29.400]  disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100 percent
[52:29.400 --> 52:34.840]  natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn

[54:20.600 --> 54:25.080]  You know I consciously talk about how they could kill me or set me up when I cover this stuff
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.240]  because I know history. I have a real handle on things and I've been physically attacked and told
[54:29.240 --> 54:34.280]  to shut up before. I've had you know gotten phone calls my wife has where they're listening and they
[54:34.280 --> 54:37.720]  tell you what you were just talking about. They do it when you're having a family crisis
[54:37.720 --> 54:41.960]  which means they're listening all the time. I mean I know how real this is. That's why I challenge
[54:41.960 --> 54:46.120]  you to come out and start fighting them. You will experience it at a low level and then really know
[54:46.120 --> 54:50.040]  how much trouble we're in. You don't really know about the vampires till you start going under the
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.080]  castle. And you know now to use that figurative analogy the vampires are coming out folks.
[54:55.080 --> 55:01.160]  They're coming out during the daytime and we need to really understand this is not just politics as
[55:01.160 --> 55:06.360]  usual corrupt politicians. Okay it'll be all right. They're making preparations to bring
[55:06.360 --> 55:14.520]  this country into total collapse and they killed Breitbart. Okay I know they killed him because
[55:14.520 --> 55:20.120]  they announced within 45 minutes of him being at the hospital that it was not foul play.
[55:22.040 --> 55:25.560]  I mean that's a telltale sign right there. They didn't have the coroner report for like a month
[55:25.560 --> 55:30.200]  after but they said it was you know he just out of the thing and you know we know 45 minutes after.
[55:30.200 --> 55:34.920]  I mean that's totally illegal what they did. There's medical examiner laws and then you look
[55:34.920 --> 55:38.440]  at the big announcement he was going to make and all the stuff that was going to come out and then
[55:38.440 --> 55:43.160]  nothing ever came out. It scared everybody over there. Look but see here's the deal if I give
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.640]  into that fear they're going to win and I'm thinking about it. Do I want to let them win
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.040]  all the bad stuff they're doing what they have planned for humanity. It is an honor
[55:55.400 --> 56:00.360]  to not play it safe and go all the way. I mean it is really what I was meant to do as a human
[56:00.360 --> 56:03.240]  and it's what you're meant to do and I want
[56:03.240 --> 56:10.440]  to salute all of you out there
[56:12.440 --> 56:17.800]  who have stood up against evil as well. It's just that I realize that because I've tested
[56:17.800 --> 56:23.080]  this I've seen this we're able to do this whenever we're able to push a TSA story out of the front.
[56:23.080 --> 56:27.560]  We're able to push a bullet story out of the front. We're able to push a gun confiscation
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.560]  report out of the front and make it become the debate and really hurt the system because they
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.520]  need to be able to get all this ready and then roll it out after the crisis after what they stage.
[56:36.520 --> 56:41.880]  They can't have me here telling you the magic trick before it happens
[56:43.720 --> 56:49.400]  and I need your prayers. I mean I'm going to be honest with you because we are effective.
[56:50.200 --> 56:53.800]  I mean we have the White House responding to us routinely. We have their surrogates
[56:53.800 --> 56:57.640]  media matters which has a liberal cover is a very vicious intelligence operation.
[56:57.640 --> 57:01.960]  A disinformation operation whose own memos admit they want to infiltrate alternative
[57:01.960 --> 57:08.600]  media and bring it down. I mean I'm dealing with all sorts of infiltrator groups
[57:09.480 --> 57:13.480]  and this isn't a game. I mean I'm in the Southern Poverty Law Center's top report
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.720]  as a terrorist leader. Here it is right here and they say we are the new terrorist.
[57:19.720 --> 57:25.800]  We are the new big enemy. Show people a document cam shot of that where they draw me to look like
[57:25.800 --> 57:33.960]  a demon. This is the type of garbage. This is the type of garbage that we're dealing
[57:33.960 --> 57:37.560]  with and so I'm just telling you listen this is not entertainment. This is not a game
[57:38.280 --> 57:44.280]  and I'm pushing it. I'm pushing it on purpose. I don't want to be destroyed by the new world
[57:44.280 --> 57:47.880]  order but if that happens it's in God's plan. If they kill me with a heart attack, if they
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.520]  kill me with drugs, I don't do illegal drugs, don't like them by the way. If they set me up
[57:52.520 --> 57:58.440]  whatever it's all made up okay. I just want that on record but it doesn't matter what I've shown
[57:58.440 --> 58:03.960]  you and what we've covered here that can defeat them. You know what to do and they can't get us
[58:03.960 --> 58:09.400]  all. That's why it's so great to know there's Mike Adams and people like Matt Drudge. I'm
[58:09.400 --> 58:13.160]  talking about people that are actually actively hard charging. There's people
[58:15.880 --> 58:20.200]  out there. I mean who else can you really say though that's I mean really prominent and gets it.
[58:20.200 --> 58:24.600]  Um a lot of people pop my head after we go to break but there's only a few dozen people
[58:25.160 --> 58:29.720]  that really get it and go all the way. You see other people just going a third of the way and
[58:29.720 --> 58:34.360]  they know behind the scenes but they're scared and so they just play along. Well we're gonna
[58:34.360 --> 58:47.240]  lose everything if you people act like cowards. This is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio

[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.040]  Ladies and gentlemen for about 45 minutes of the next hour we're going to be joined by Dr. Paul
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.040]  Craig Roberts. We're going to go to him in the next segment so that all the stations can hear.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.320]  We have to say some stations don't care this little five-minute no man's land. I know XM
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:53.000]  has joined us on 166. Just recapping, the Alice in Wonderland world we've entered,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.640]  there's a lot of reasons I want to get the former head of policy that they have the
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.160]  treasuring on. I want to get his take on the Cypriot situation, the different ways they
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:07.000]  rob us here, where he sees the financial system. And then I want to get into the false reality,
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.800]  which is getting crazier where they say there are no drones, but there are drones. There are
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.480]  no bullets, but there are bullets. There are no armored vehicles, but there are armored vehicles.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.520]  And I see it backfiring on them. And is there any way out of this? I mean, is it a good thing Rand
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.920]  Paul filibustered to get answers? We're going to put an article out calling for Rand Paul to
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.080]  filibuster on the bullet subject. We've put a lot of people out there who are going to
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:37.320]  filibuster on the bullet subject. We've pushed, and now it's 14 members of Congress are demanding
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.480]  to know about the ammo purchases and big sis has said no, so that's going to come to a head.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.800]  I mean, look, if we just all start standing up together, getting past our fear, we have
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.840]  a future. I mean, if any common sense is left out there, groveling brings the wolves.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.440]  I even read about a few times a year people get eaten by coyotes now inside major cities
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.280]  of cities. Never used to happen, cuz coyotes need to be scared of humans. Now, it's almost always a
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.320]  small woman. She gets scared, she runs, women have been taught for movies to fall down.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.520]  Cuz you always do that when Jason's coming after you, you run and you fall down and then you beg.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.520]  So that's what's been reported. People run and then it's so much fun because they were taught,
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.480]  they fall down and then the coyotes come and they just roll around while the coyotes eat them.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.280]  I mean, if you went, the coyotes would run in fear. The only thing that will still eat you
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:35.160]  if you charge it is a grizzly bear or a polar bear. I mean, even elephants most of the time,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.520]  unless they've got babies, will back off if you act like you're the king of the hill.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.200]  Cuz they think you got an elephant gun. All they know is those things can knock me down.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.800]  But I mean, people think if I roll over and just beg to be gang raped by government,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.480]  that will protect me. Ladies and gentlemen, if you go out in the middle of the field and
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.760]  play the sounds of dying rabbits, that's how you call in coyotes to kill them.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.680]  We've done it when they're eating sheep and stuff. The point is, I got family that farms
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.240]  and ranches. They didn't really have sheep, our neighbors did. So you go out on a coyote hunt with
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.080]  them and you play audio tapes. I remember reel to reel when I was a kid and they were out there
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.720]  playing them of the squealing, dying rabbits. And in come the coyotes and you put spotlights
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.160]  on them and shoot them. But the point is, is that if you went on the field and played those,
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.720]  then when the coyotes came over, if you got on your back and went, no, please, they would bite
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.120]  your genitals off first. And then if you'd laid there, they would eat your guts out first while
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.960]  you're living. That's their favorite snack. Of course, if you just stood up, they'd run in fear.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.200]  But you won't do that. You will lay down to the government and beg them to rip your guts out.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.520]  You will hand them their children figuratively to rip their intestines out as a sacrament of
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.000]  weakness. And it is because of that sacrament of weakness that you will be destroyed.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.760]  Excuse me, we're gonna go to break and come back with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:53.800]  But I'm sick of it. And I'm launching operations, as you've seen and others are, on the bullet
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.680]  issue. And we are forcing them to cover it and lie about it and bleed out in front of us.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.880]  Now, we're not fighting coyotes, folks. These people, if I can get other people to charge,
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.600]  we can beat them. If we don't, it's the Vici French model. They've already bought off local
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.400]  towns, counties, cities, states. The blitzkrieg wasn't really a blitzkrieg, it was all a lie.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:21.560]  95% or more of the French military stood down because they'd been bought off. And then the
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.800]  traitor, Vici government. It's how Hitler, two days after it was over, took it like a week and
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:32.280]  a half. Dunkirk took a few more weeks down at the coast, went and toured Paris. How did he
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:39.320]  tour Paris? If Hitler conquered Texas and paraded through Austin, I'd be driving down there.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.800]  But see, the police were saluting him and on the radio saying, do what he says, he's gonna help us.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.280]  That's never taught in the history books. It's in the back of the history books, but it's not
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:53.080]  in the pop culture history. It's not on History Channel. They don't want you to know that.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:58.760]  That's the globalist plan, a soft takeover, okay? The lightning war was just the stage.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.440]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law

[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.560]  Well, many financial publications have called him one of the top 10 economists living out there.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.840]  Been the editor of the Wall Street Journal, the head of policy at the Department of the Treasury,
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:46.520]  the father of Reaganomics, Dr. Paul Craig-Roberts joins us. Dr. Paul Craig-Roberts.org or
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:52.360]  Paul Craig-Roberts.org is his website. He's also a research fellow at the Cato Institute and the
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:57.480]  Hoover Institute. And I'm just gonna stop there because his bio is too long. I wanted to get him
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.280]  on, obviously, about what's happening with the looting of the bank accounts, shock therapy,
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:09.160]  the insane wars. And a great article he wrote, as a syndicated columnist, dealing with it can
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:16.040]  happen here. And I would add, it has happened here. And so he joins us to cover all of this
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.960]  information here today. Doc, good to have you on with us.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:31.240]  Doc, what's happening? Yeah, we've lost his audio, of course. Dr. Roberts,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.120]  what is happening in the world economy right now?
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.320]  Are we live, Alex? Yes, sir, we're live.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:52.120]  Well, what's happening is that the handful of rich elites around the world are continuing to
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.320]  steal everything from everybody else. And the middle class in every country is
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:06.840]  disappearing. And the lower class is being pushed lower. And everyone pretends
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.800]  there's some kind of recovery and there's gonna be a happy tomorrow and all that sort of thing.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.280]  Where do you expect this to go, what we see unfolding right now in Europe?
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:32.600]  Well, I would imagine that the members of the parliament or whatever it's called in Cyprus will
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:40.680]  have all their arms twisted and will be told that very dire things will happen unless they
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:52.760]  give the okay to allowing a certain percentage of private depositors accounts to be seized and
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:59.720]  given to the banks. If they hold out against this, they will prove to be stronger than,
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:08.200]  for example, the United States Congress. When the secretary of treasury told them that they would be
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.320]  martial law if they didn't approve this, they'll turn out to be stronger than the Greek parliament,
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:24.120]  which also accepted the dictates from the banks. And if they do refuse to go along with it, then
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:32.040]  it's a hopeful sign. It might strengthen resolve in other countries like Italy and Spain.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:42.760]  Now, if it goes through, of course, it tells people that their private property in banks
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:52.840]  may not be safe in any other country that has similar problems or bankers strong enough
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:12:02.120]  to claim their property. In the United States, of course, the Fed has an alternative measure
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:11.320]  instead of seizing people's bank accounts and giving them to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:17.240]  so on. It simply prints money and gives the money to the banks. That's right. But you see,
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:24.680]  the individual countries that make up the European Union and, of course, Cyprus is part of that,
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:35.080]  those countries do not have independent central banks that can print the money to give to the
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:42.120]  bankers. And the European Central Bank is prohibited by its charter from doing that,
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.800]  but nevertheless has done some of it, but has run up against opposition from Germany,
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:54.760]  which still remembers the Weimar Republic, the inflation, and is just sort of fundamentally
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:01.880]  opposed to printing money. And so the Germans have put some sort of restraint on how much money
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:13.160]  the ECB, the European Central Bank can print. And therefore, there's not enough printed to satisfy
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:20.840]  the bankers and so they're resorted to stealing. Let me ask you this question. We always see
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:26.360]  Germany as a nation being blamed for this. When the way I look at the European Central Bank and
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:34.280]  the parties that are there, it is foreign mega banks, the big six that are using it as a system
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:40.120]  to guarantee all their derivatives debts while blaming the nation states and then blaming Germany
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.400]  as the group conquering the countries financially when Germany is actually having to put the money
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.440]  up and the German people don't want to do it. Is Germany to a great extent being scapegoated
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:58.760]  in all this and who are the real culprits? Well, I think the real culprits, well, of course,
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:06.760]  what you say is correct. The authorities in the United States are concerned that the
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:19.560]  so-called guarantees issued by American banks against sovereign debt would be called if there
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:27.400]  were defaults. And so the United States, of course, is lined up with the European bailout
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:37.160]  scheme, which extracts the resources out of the populations. And so that's true. Now,
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.920]  I don't know that Germany is being blamed and I wasn't blaming Germany. I was just saying that
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:49.880]  the Germans are as comfortable about printing money as a lot of other countries are. And
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:58.840]  we're putting some sort of brakes on it. Basically, what is going on, in my opinion,
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:06.440]  is that the European Union, the bureaucracy that comprises the EU is using the crisis
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:16.440]  to subvert the independence of the individual sovereign states that make up the EU. So the real
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:25.400]  villain here is the EU bureaucracy in Brussels and the European Central Bank, which is in line
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:34.600]  with them, and they're making a power play to simply take over the budgets and the
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:41.480]  authoritative economic decisions of the individual countries.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.080]  Sure, it's a takeover. So what does this, as an economist, someone who's worked the highest levels
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:51.240]  of government, what does it signify? The aggressive standing, things going into high gear,
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.040]  the announcements that the NSA is spying on all of us, the announcements that domestic groups
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.000]  are the new terror threat, the two billion bullets, the starting fights with everybody,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.240]  North Korea now threatening. I mean, I've studied history, you've studied history.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:13.640]  You've taught it and taught trends at major think tanks. Where do you really think it's
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.640]  going? Or am I wrong in saying it seems we've sped up from maybe 80 miles an hour on the road
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.200]  to tyranny to 120? I think it's speeding up.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:35.560]  Clearly, governments are worried about the response of populations who are being
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:43.720]  usurped and made to turn over their limited resources to rich bankers or to the elite.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:54.680]  And that, of course, is the second villain in the process. The point that's being established
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:02.840]  in this European crisis is that if banks or financial institutions make mistakes,
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:09.880]  then it's the responsibility of the citizens of the country to make those mistakes good for the
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:17.800]  banks so that the banks don't fail. And so the rich and the shareholders of the banks
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.000]  don't lose their wealth or money. And back when you were on in 2008,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.200]  the media had to admit we were backing them up, bailing them out. But since then, they've spun it
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.040]  where it's our fault. The average American like myself paying over 60% taxes, that's not enough.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.480]  I'm greedy, I'm bad. And we're in all this debt because, like the head of the IMF said,
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:43.720]  we're not working six, seven days a week. I mean, this is wild.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:52.600]  It is. And so we have the two villains established. And we have also established
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.720]  the fact, I think, that governments are concerned about the response of people.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:06.040]  And in the United States, it looks like that they're acting far in advance of any signs
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.480]  among the population of any kind of resistance. Sure.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:17.000]  So you're right. We now have no civil liberties. It's up to the president whether we have them or
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.760]  don't have them as individuals. Apparently, the Department of Homeland Security has shifted its
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:32.520]  attention away from so-called terrorism toward domestic extremists, which appears to be
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:39.160]  essentially those who disagree with the government. And we see the militarization
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:50.280]  of homeland security, of all the local and state police forces. We see constant invasions of
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:19:00.200]  privacy, all kinds of spying that's strictly against the Constitution. And it continues and
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:09.480]  it deepens. We also have these reports of detainment centers or camps built around the
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:19.640]  country with congressional appropriations. So clearly, they are acting to be in a position
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:27.880]  to control the population in the event that there's some sort of economic or social breakdown
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.800]  in the United States. That's right. When we come back, I want to
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:37.960]  ask about ways to get out of this, ideas for the population to try to change the debate
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.480]  and point out what's happening. And I also want to talk about the Dallas head of the
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:46.360]  Fed and the Kansas City head of the Fed have both recently come out and said, this is crony
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.480]  capitalism. This is going to destroy our future. So is that a positive sign to hear them agreeing
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.960]  with you, Dr. Roberts? So we'll come back after the break and talk about that. I mean,
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.840]  I'm trying to find some silver linings here. But folks, denying this is what's gotten us

[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.680]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.680]  the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that

[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.600]  well, it gives added peace of mind. Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets,
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:14.760]  but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.680]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:25.240]  and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:31.960]  when I'm actually away from home. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and they're so easy to use.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.280]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're so affordable that we have one
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.400]  upstairs and downstairs. Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.960]  I'll cover a lot of the big news that's unfolding on the economy and the entire police state.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.080]  14 members of Congress are now demanding Homeland Security answer their letters and questions about
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.000]  the 2 billion rounds of bullets, the armored vehicles, the domestic checkpoints. The TSA is
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.080]  now making people that are double amputees basically crawl across the floor and take
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:48.280]  their prosthetic legs off. I mean, it's just, but then Saudi Arabians are exempt from the searches.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.680]  I mean, that's mainstream news. It's just all about we're the terrorists. As we predicted they
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.600]  would do, they fully are flipping it now. But here was the question I was asking before the break
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:03.480]  for Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who joins us. Feds Fisher, too big to fail banks are crony
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.000]  capitalists, that's Reuters. And he goes on there to break down the fact that they are
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.200]  practitioners of crony capitalism and they need to be broken up and that it's gonna destroy our
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:19.880]  future if we don't stop them. But again, they hold us hostage and threaten to bring us into
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.320]  total collapse, as you pointed out, Dr. Roberts, if we don't give into them, but then we give in
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:31.720]  and things only get worse. And then their exit strategy, I guess, is martial law authoritarianism,
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.920]  but I don't think they're gonna get away with it. I think they're crazy, Dr. Roberts.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:46.920]  Well, Alex, I don't think we count. And it's very good that two members of the Federal Reserve have
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:55.400]  spoken out. But it was the deregulation that produced crony capitalism. It was the deregulation
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:01.720]  that allowed the banks to consolidate and purchase other banks and become
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:07.880]  too big to fail. And it's also the case that the Secretary of Treasury,
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:17.240]  the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve itself is run by former
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:30.680]  CEOs of these big banks or by their proteges. And so the banks have control of the economic policy,
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:42.040]  not us. And so they're clearly going to use that power in their benefit, not in our benefit.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:51.640]  Now, one problem that the Federal Reserve faces in its policy of supporting the banks at all costs
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.640]  is that we now have three massive bubbles. We have a bond market bubble
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:03.560]  in which bond prices are so high that real interest rates are negative.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:12.040]  In a situation in which the Fed is printing more than $1 trillion new dollars every year,
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:18.520]  and the government is issuing more than $1 trillion in new debt every year. Well, that makes
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:27.800]  no sense to have negative interest rates on bonds when you have massive debt monetization.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.400]  So the bond market bubble is probably the biggest bubble in history. We also have a stock market
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:40.040]  bubble. All of the money that the Federal Reserve is pumping into the banks is not going out in
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:51.720]  loans. It's going into speculation on stock market futures in various derivatives based
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:28:02.120]  on these futures, and that's bid up the stock market. It's not based on demand for products
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:10.040]  or retail sales. Retail sales have gone nowhere for years, not real retail sales. And so we have
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:18.360]  a huge stock market bubble that's based on Fed pouring liquidity into the banks and the banks
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:24.520]  using it to speculate in stock. So bottom line, the real economy is imploding and rotting away
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:31.080]  and being consolidated into the controlled economy that only a very few benefit from
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:38.440]  and I guess maybe Fisher and others are now criticizing the system because they don't want
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:44.840]  to be blamed for it. I mean, is this out of fear that they realize? I think what it is is that,
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.920]  well, it could just be they have some independence of mind and some integrity. On the other hand,
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:56.600]  the Fed now has a huge problem because the third bubble is the dollar itself.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.840]  Sure. So it's the stock market, the bonds and the dollar.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:10.200]  So the Fed can support bond prices by buying bonds. It can support stock prices by having
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:17.160]  the banks buy stock futures. But if the dollar gets in trouble, it can't support the dollar,
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.320]  except by raising interest rates, which would collapse the bond and stock market.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:31.800]  So the problem for the Fed is it keeps monetizing huge sums of debt, creating dollars at a far
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:38.120]  faster rate. The supply of dollars is growing faster rate than the demand for dollars. And
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:44.280]  therefore the dollar exchange rate is unstable. We got to go to break. I can tell you're getting
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.320]  to the key here. We're going to come back and get to that on the other side. Stay with us.

[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:10.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:17.880]  in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:23.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is one of the most successful economists in modern history. I mean,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.800]  he's gotten a lot of his ideas implemented, caused some of the biggest booms and true expansion of
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:33.720]  the middle class that we've seen. In fact, the only expansion of real wealth that we've seen
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:39.480]  since the 60s. From my research, we've been going downhill since the 60s except for a time during
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:45.320]  the 80s with Dr. Roberts policies that have been misconstrued and demonized by the media.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:50.600]  You cut taxes, more money comes in on average. The problem is they didn't then really cut budgets
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.720]  though because the bankers don't want you to get out of that. So we're gonna break that down with
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:00.840]  him and have him recap and finish up the fact that there's no way out of this. We just don't know
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.400]  how it's going to implode or when it's going to implode, but the establishment is certainly
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.640]  getting ready for it. Briefly, remember, this broadcast is listener supported.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:16.200]  I try to sell and promote at infowarstore.com, the very best products. I have a crew of right
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:22.600]  at 50 people pushing us up into Obamacare land. And we are just doing so much good work, as you

[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.960]  click on all our sponsors at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. And be sure and support our
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:11.560]  AM and FM affiliate sponsors. Support those local sponsors. Let them know why you're supporting
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.280]  them. Become a sponsor of your local business, even if it's small. That's how we're getting on
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.560]  more stations. Plus the ratings bring them, but it's gotta have sponsorship. Let XM know that
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:28.200]  you've got an XM subscription because I'm on XM 166. Tell them you want the Sunday show picked up.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:33.080]  You need to take action. You've been demanding the bullet story be covered. Now, 14 Congress
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:37.320]  people are calling for an investigation. It'll be 30 next week. Watch, it'll be 30 next week,
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:43.320]  maybe 30 tomorrow. Well, I guess next week will be Monday when they're back. I mean, I know how
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:47.720]  to beat these people. I've studied history, but you've got to take action. When you move,
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:53.880]  it's our only hope. And lastly, support alternative media like paulcraigroberts.org
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.760]  where his amazing column, sometimes he writes every day, sometimes once a week. It's really
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.280]  invaluable insight from somebody that's been on the inside. And of course, E Foods Direct is
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:09.640]  offering free shipping on all of their incredible high quality, storeable foods. That's who I chose
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:13.400]  first. And I bought a bunch of places and they were the best for the price and the quality.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:19.160]  So I've had them as a sponsor the last six years. Efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex. They've got
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:25.400]  a free meal plan, six free meals and a meal planning DVD, CD, free. It's free when you
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:31.960]  give them a call, 800-409-5633. Take that first step. The security of having firearms and storeable
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:38.120]  foods is a bare minimum. Efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex or link through on the banners
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:44.120]  at infowars.com or 800-409-5633. And they only do this once a year. They always do it March.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.520]  I haven't been plugging it. Just so you know, they do it every March, free shipping. And they
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:53.160]  don't just raise prices and then give you free shipping. It's same prices, very low prices,
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.320]  then free shipping. On storeable food, folks, that's a big part of the cost. They lose like
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:03.560]  half their profit doing that. That is an incredible deal. And it ends in just a few days, 800-409-5633.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:09.480]  Okay, enough of me going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. Recap the three bubbles and then where
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.720]  you see this leading, how long it'll be, how they can prop it up. Can they pull more rabbits out of
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:24.520]  their hats? Go ahead. Sure. Okay, look, all of this is also available in my latest book, which
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:32.120]  became available in English this month as an ebook. You can get it from amazon.com, Barnes
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.880]  and Noble. In English, it's ebook only, unless you're German or Chinese, there's no print version.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:46.520]  But the book explains exactly what the problem is, how we got into it, and why we're unlikely to get
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:55.400]  out of it. And it's easy to read. And it's empirical-based. It's not contingent. It's fact.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.920]  Now, to get back to- And of course, the title, sir, the title is The Failure of Laissez-Faire
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:12.600]  Capitalism. That's right. It's The Failure of Laissez-Faire Capitalism and Economic
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:19.240]  Dissolution of the West. And it's well underway. I mean, you know, the structure is already
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:27.000]  rotted out. The manufacturing capability of the United States is gone. It's moved offshore.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:35.960]  And with it, as I also said, would be the case. And as 20 professors at MIT
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:45.080]  validated recently, when you lose the ability to make things, you also lose the ability to invent
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:53.080]  things. So you lose the innovation when you lose manufacturing. Now, let's stop right there and
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.640]  toot your horn. Not to toot your horn so people know that this isn't a joke what they're hearing.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.720]  You have been beating the drum for more than a decade that deindustrialization,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.800]  that it will never come back. Now China and others have it. And now MIT, basically the DARPA heads,
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.000]  that's the head of this whole military industrial complex, finally are panicking, saying,
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.760]  we've chopped our legs off. I mean, this is insanity. And they're now absolutely concurring
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:27.080]  with you. That's right. And also two years ago, the Nobel Prize winner in economics, Michael
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:35.240]  Spence, he also concurred with me that the United States economy is no longer capable of producing
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:43.480]  jobs that produce export products, either goods or services. We are now locked into
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:54.520]  low-pay domestic service jobs. And so I've had this sort of vindication from very high ranked,
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:01.720]  independent economists that I don't know or have any association with. Now to get back to your
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:07.240]  question that we were discussing before the break, there are three bubbles. I explained the bond and
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:13.800]  stock bubble. The dollar bubble is what is likely to undo the whole enterprise. What has saved the
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:21.640]  Fed so far is the fact that the Europeans are in crisis, largely one we made for them. And that
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:28.040]  keeps the euro in trouble. So as long as there's no real alternative to the dollar, except for
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:34.760]  gold and silver, which the Fed caps the price by selling naked shorts in the paper market to stop
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:45.000]  the rise in price from the demand for the physical metal. So once the dollar goes, and I don't know
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:52.200]  how quick or how slow it will be, but it will go. We already know that the BRICS, large countries
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:41:00.360]  in Asia and South America, and including Russia and China, India, South Africa, Brazil, they are
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:07.880]  making agreements to no longer use the dollar to settle their international trade accounts. This
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:13.800]  reduces the demand for dollar in the international markets. The Japanese and Chinese seem to be
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:20.280]  coming to the same agreement so that they will deal with their trade in their own currencies.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:26.840]  And that's called the move to the exits. What it means is the demand for the dollar drops
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:33.400]  while the supply is pouring out. And so it's very hard for the price to stay where it is.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:39.240]  And when the price of the dollar goes down, given that we are an import dependent country,
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:45.240]  importing all kinds of things that we're dependent on, prices will go up. And yet real incomes are
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:51.880]  not going up. So when the prices go up, everyone's real income goes down, consumer demand falls
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:58.840]  further, the economy sinks deeper, the deficits get bigger. So it's a perfect storm for which
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:07.000]  there are no solutions. So that's beyond stagflation, isn't it? Oh, much beyond. What the
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:14.280]  likelihood is is an inflationary depression. Which is the ultimate nightmare. The ultimate
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:20.040]  nightmare for which there are no policy solutions. And of course, wasn't it believed until the
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.480]  70s, even stagflation was artificial and couldn't be done. But now, in the Alice in Wonderland,
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:32.920]  isn't a hyper inflationary depression, has that ever even happened before?
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:40.600]  I don't think so. Because you've never had this combination of events to produce it.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.880]  Most depressions resulted from a collapse of the money supply.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:53.880]  Or a collapse of the exchange rate of a currency. But you've never had a situation where you have
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:01.640]  no basis for employment, but you've laid the basis for an explosion of prices by creating
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:07.640]  your currency at high rates, while the demand for it is following.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:11.720]  Wow, and then you've got like three different populations, that's oversimplifying. But you've
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.200]  got a very hardworking, lower middle class and upper middle class who will work three,
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.000]  four jobs, have a high standard. You've kind of got a dilettante government and bureaucrat
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  and pension fund, which people earned in many cases, but also these trust fund kids.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.040]  And it's very popular to be mindless and be into being ignorant and to lay around all
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.680]  day. And then you've got the militarized groups out there. I mean, that just sounds like a
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:41.960]  nightmare to be in the middle of a population like that. What do you expect to happen when
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:48.200]  this thing starts imploding? Well, I expect that what will happen when they can no longer
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:52.040]  print money to cover the deficit is they'll go after the remaining pensions.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:58.200]  That's it, yeah. The same way that the banks go after the deposits in Cyprus, here the government
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.280]  will say, well, look, your pensions have been tax free, accumulating tax free. And so we're
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:09.320]  now going to make up for that and take our tax share of your pensions. So they will simply
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:16.760]  seize pensions. And again, it will be a short-term measure. It only worked once when they use
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.920]  the pension to finance the deficit. What do they do the next year? They're going to run
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:28.760]  out of things to steal. And once that happens, there's no way they can stave off the crisis.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:35.480]  There's no way they can stave off the crisis. So they don't want to talk about this. And
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.760]  they don't like people who do talk about it because they're trying to keep it under control
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.000]  as long as they can. Would you call what's coming hyper-stagflation?
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.920]  What would the name be for it? I think I would call it an inflationary depression.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:57.640]  So an inflationary depression. I think that's what I would call it, yes. Now,
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:02.920]  people think that that's a contradiction in terms that you can't have both. But you can,
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:07.800]  and particularly with these types of conditions that have been put in place, which are unique.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:17.880]  So it doesn't do any good. We've known now for five or six years, it doesn't do any good to run
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:24.920]  big deficits and print a lot of money when all the jobs are moved offshore. So the spending doesn't
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.960]  call people back to work when there's no place for them to work.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.960]  All right, let me ask you this question. Let's say we've gone out to see a Shakespearean
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:37.240]  play. There's 1,000 people in the theater. That 1,000 people represents people holding
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.680]  dollars worldwide, governments, institutions, you name it. How many people have gotten up and
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.280]  already left? Because people get up, a few leave, then all of a sudden more leave, and then suddenly
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:51.400]  right before the end, half the people leave. And once half leave, the bottom falls out and
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:57.000]  degenerates very quickly. What point have we gotten to right now with people leaving
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.080]  the theater? Because they are starting to leave the theater.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.040]  Well, they've been leaving for 10 years. If you look at the sharp upturn in the price of gold and
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:11.080]  silver during the Bush years and the first year or two of Obama before the Fed capped it by selling
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:18.360]  naked shorts, you can see the sharp rise up. So people are leaving. And the Fed is trying to
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.600]  break that up by capping the price by selling these naked shorts. I mean,
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:29.720]  whoever heard of shorting a bull market? No one shorts stock market when it's in a bull phase.
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:37.080]  You ride the market up, but they've been shorting a rising gold market.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:42.600]  So it's clearly a control mechanism. Well, you said over and over again,
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:51.400]  they are colluding in Europe and the United States and Asia, I mean, obviously, on the interest rates.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:58.600]  I don't think the Asians are colluding at all. They're watching these fools get rid of themselves.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:03.560]  Sure, exactly. I mean, when I say Asia, I mean Japan. My point is, what does LIBOR
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:11.320]  illustrate for us? It's just another fixation of interest rates. It was a minor one compared
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:18.920]  to the Fed. The Fed is the major fixer of interest rates. And what the banks were doing was just
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:23.400]  aiding the Fed. That's why the Fed didn't do anything about it. They knew about it.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.800]  It wasn't anything they didn't know about. Doc, let's shift gears. What do you make of
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.760]  our government putting al-Qaeda, real al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria, incredible mass murder,
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:38.440]  incredible war crimes, while separately saying now we've got to attack Syria because al-Qaeda
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:44.280]  is there. I mean, that is just a new level of Orwellianville. Where do you see that going?
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.800]  I mean, how do they get away with that? I think this is the Israel lobby forcing
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:59.160]  the senators like McCain and Levin to push Israel's agenda on to Obama. I think that's
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:07.960]  what it is. Clearly, if the Assad government loses in Syria, it will be taken over by extremists,
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:14.120]  because the people who are fighting are the Islamists. They're the ones who are opposed
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:19.160]  to the secular Assad government. They actually wear al-Qaeda uniforms.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:25.000]  That's right. And so, what we would be doing is simply putting al-Qaeda in charge. Now,
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.880]  this suits Israel because it breaks up the country. It'll leave the country in a constant
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:36.920]  state of civil war, just like Libya is, just like Iraq is. So, when a country is at odds
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:45.640]  with itself, it can't present any sort of outward response to Israel. It's to overcome
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.240]  by its internal decision. Sure. I mean, I think we get the Balkanization.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.240]  I totally agree with you. My point is, how are they saying they've got to stick their
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.480]  hands down my wife's pants in front of me at the airport because bin Laden's in there
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  while they run al-Qaeda publicly and gave them 10,000 heat-seeking missiles? I mean,
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:06.040]  this is ridiculous. I mean, what about just the fact that we're running al-Qaeda publicly,
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:10.200]  and it's not even an issue? Wars are profitable for the military-security
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:16.840]  complex, and they're profitable for domestic power. Remember, Solzhenitsyn said years and
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:22.360]  years ago that the main purpose of war is to create a domestic police state.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.040]  And he's absolutely right about that. The late Alexander Solzhenitsyn, I got to tell you,
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.320]  the book, I haven't read it yet. I read your other books, and they're all excellent. And
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.400]  there's a real libertarian system, but this isn't. Because a real libertarian system,
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:40.120]  they wouldn't be too big to fail. They would have been wiped out early on. So it's the laissez-faire
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:46.920]  with the public backing up of their losses. I mean, I agree it's laissez-faire, but it's a-
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:54.920]  Alex, it was the laissez-faire deregulation that produced the crony capitalism. When you remove
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:00.360]  a market from social control, you let the private greed and private power run wild.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:08.200]  And the result is they monopolize things, they concentrate things, and then they are
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:14.680]  too powerful for the politicians to sit on, and they control the politicians. And as we've already
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.880]  said today, who's running the treasury? Who's running the financial regulatory agencies?
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.840]  Sure, no, you're right. You're right. But let's go to the end of the hour then. Let's go to the
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.600]  end of the hour. I've got to go to break. Six-minute segment. Let's debate that. I mean,
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.480]  not really debate it. I understand what you're saying, but my point is, if they weren't too big
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.840]  to fail, I agree, you can't deregulate and then back it up with government. So my point is,
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:41.720]  is that's the perfect storm. It's the unnatural thing, just like a inflationary depression.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:47.240]  So explain it to me, because I know you know more about it than I do, and I defer to your wisdom.
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.000]  But I mean, my whole point is, I am a libertarian. I like it in most areas,
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.040]  and I understand why there was Glass-Steagall. I agree with it. My point is, is I don't think
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.520]  this is pure libertarianism laissez-faire. But explain it to me when we get back.

[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:10.280]  valuable item in a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun,

[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:23.160]  reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:28.600]  have this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.800]  you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.040]  door. But I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:44.200]  for you and your family. Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:49.400]  valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that thousands of

[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:34.920]  you know i get that after the depression they put in rules to show that banks couldn't just buy
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:40.520]  into every level of society and consolidate and create huge monopolies because monopolies we
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.080]  learned of the robber barons were not a good idea and that they could have brokerage banks you know
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.480]  own regular banks and then steal people's savings i mean they knew you need to build bulkheads in
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:54.920]  the ships of one floods the others don't flood and i see this and dr robertson i have debated
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:00.520]  this but i've seen them brag whether it's delusional or not at davos and bilderberg
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:05.480]  that oh we're taking over the world collapse will bring us to power then we'll come out with
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:11.960]  an sdr or something above it so i see this as orchestrated at least they brag it's orchestrated
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.120]  maybe maybe they're not really in control there's one thing i've learned studying history hitler
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.840]  thought he was in control going into russia so did napoleon these guys get delusional so i don't
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:25.480]  think they're infallible i know they're men like us they're women like us uh but dr robertson got
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:31.080]  the floor for the last five minutes explain to me how this is i mean i haven't read the new book yet
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:36.440]  how this is all the fault of laissez faire because how is it laissez faire if government
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:42.760]  is backing it up and back stopping it go ahead well there's no difference between the government
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:54.840]  and the and the private private interests look what uh what libertarians think that we have
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.560]  all this regulation by the government and that the whole reason we had a financial crisis is because
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:06.120]  we got too much regulation but of course this is nonsense so the last 25 years have been not just
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:13.560]  the united states beginning with thatcher in england uh in in uh australia new zealand uh
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:20.280]  canada uh in france i mean i helped the french government privatize the economy we've had
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:28.040]  massive privatizations and massive deregulation particular deregulation in the
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.480]  you need to go over there and check that answering machine
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:41.560]  i should have shut the door people are very invasive um i know how it is believe me i've
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:48.360]  been doing radio interviews and my kids run in so this deregulation is really everywhere but it's
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:55.400]  massive in terms of the financial system it's not just that they uh deregulated or or repeal glass
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:02.280]  steagle they removed all of the restraints on speculation am i wrong in saying that you were
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:08.920]  more laissez-faire 25 30 years ago have your views changed um well i get you know it's just like
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:15.640]  john maynard kane says when you learn the facts what do you do you adjust your views so so are
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:21.160]  you saying reaganomics just a minute alex this has nothing to do with ideology has to do with facts
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:26.840]  church okay and the facts are we had a highly regulated financial system we had no problems
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:34.840]  we completely deregulated and we're in massive collapse for which there's no solution and which
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:42.040]  is threatening the entire western world this is all due to deregulation and so what is laissez-faire
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:48.280]  it is the absence of regulation and so what we have learned is that the absence of regulation
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:57.480]  does not produce libertarian nor vana it produces social instability social insecurity and that is
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:03.880]  why throughout history almost every market is regulated there are very few cases and they are
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:13.800]  short term of deregulated markets because they are unlivable they always produce crisis and that's
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:18.520]  and that's why the regulation comes in it doesn't come in because the government's trying to take
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:24.840]  away power it's because people are trying to have some kind of economic stability and economic
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:30.200]  security sure sure but what about they've got none sure no i mean i i understand that my issue
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:35.720]  is it's government that allowed them to grow this big to begin with i understand it's the laissez-faire
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:39.320]  that caused it but then the backing it up allows them to enslave us

[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:13.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:22.280]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.800]  you know we get ron paul on about once a month and i really respect him and but i'm going to bring
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:34.200]  this up to him because these laws ain't fair and he's going to say but alex we backed up too big
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:38.280]  to fail the regulators were controlled by the bankers and they actually wouldn't let other
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:46.360]  competition come in it wasn't real true deregulation so so so dr roberts i agree that the idea of laws
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:51.000]  a fair capitalism pushed by greenspan everybody we were just talking during the break has led to
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.920]  a lot of this but all i'm saying is now they'll take over with no regulation then put regulation
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:02.120]  on everybody else selectively once they've already showed up the game i mean answer my question on
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:08.760]  that if you uh can i know you can but give me your brief take on my question how is it laws
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:17.000]  a fair if government's backing it up laws a fair is what produced it i'm talking about the failure
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:25.640]  of the system it's now failed yes i get that okay because you remember it was greenspan and rubin
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:34.280]  and uh arthur levitt the head of sec and uh larry summers who went to congress and prevented
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:39.480]  brooksley born from doing her job and regulating the derivatives remember that
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:44.040]  yes she said if we don't regulate these derivatives we have a crisis and they all went
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:48.920]  down there and said don't let this crazy woman regulate derivatives she'll produce a crisis
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:56.920]  markets are self-regulated i remember this was an ideology the ideology came out of the success of
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:02.520]  reagan and the failure of the soviet union and so everybody said oh well it was reagan he was for
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:07.880]  free markets the soviets were for planning and regulation and they failed and we won so let's
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.760]  don't have any regulation that's right you're kind of their guru aren't you it just don't have any
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:22.440]  and so they had done they got rid of it progressively and the result was the monopoly
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:28.200]  concentration the bank's too big to fail the takeover that is always the result of the
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:34.680]  deregulation i'm not you understand it's a process no i got it and we're in the middle of it it's a
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:40.280]  fact and and and now ideology is window dressing in the two minutes we've got left if you were king
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:45.400]  using the constitution what would you do now to try to reverse this or is it too late i think it's
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:55.320]  too late but you know it's too late it's it's going to hit the fan i just don't know when i
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:03:00.760]  can't predict the timing we've got three massive bubbles there's no way out they're going to pop
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.160]  they have to pop and of course one will pop the others so we'll have triple bubble implosion
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:12.120]  if the dollar goes all of them will pop and it'll be the biggest financial wipeout in world history
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:19.400]  and it will we won't be able to recover the chinese are not going to say oh here let us
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.760]  rebuild your economy and give you everything back uh they're in trouble too as well i mean
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.360]  they're they're barely i mean they're growing faster but you know they got their own problems
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.800]  well they have some problems but they don't have ours they don't they're not monetizing a trillion
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.920]  dollars of debt every year they're not printing money faster than sure they're not going to be
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:46.360]  ables what i'm saying to help us why would they help us exactly but even if they wanted to we're
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:53.480]  we're trying to surround them with military bases we're going to cut the social welfare net because
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:58.680]  we don't have any money but we've got plenty of money to attack syria oh yeah and and and
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:05.000]  therein is their answers the bankers are going to start world war three uh the neocons the bank the
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.400]  israel lobby the bankers the military security complex they're going to start world war three
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:18.600]  uh but they won't be able to fight it very long because a nuclear it'll go nuclear and you can't
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:23.240]  fight nuclear wars very long and if it doesn't go nuclear we'll go broke and not be able to wow
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.240]  wow and you were there in the negotiation with the soviets everything i mean i cannot say how
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.240]  much you know sir and how much we appreciate you with us and to hear you saying that when all my
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:35.800]  other experts are saying the same thing i'm pretty smart i see the same thing i see government digging
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.240]  in like it's the end of the world this doesn't look too good they're they're preparing to control

[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:44.600]  going to go away no no no i'll go back to my coyote analogy i remember being five six seven
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:49.240]  years old we did it quite a few times because i begged to go hunting it'd be you know out of
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.840]  season where you couldn't shoot deer my head say okay well coyotes have been eating the neighbors
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:57.240]  uh sheep uh you know we can take you out there and you sit there with varmint tapes playing
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:01.640]  at the sound of dying rabbits and then coyotes come out of the woods you hit them with spotlights
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:07.640]  and shoot them but you read about people now this thing used to happen anybody can type it in woman
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:12.840]  eaten by coyotes it'll be like at the edge of a city park and and the women are preconditioned
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:17.800]  to run and then fall down because they saw it on all the tv shows i mean people have never run a
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:22.600]  few feet and fallen down and going no please you know you're taught how to act like a rabbit humans
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.960]  don't act like that a possum will viciously attack a coyote a raccoon will uh humans will a little
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:32.680]  monkey if you've got a monkey from south america and put it in a room you know with pit bulls it
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:37.960]  would jump on top of and try to bite their eyes out you know but but we the super killer machine
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:43.800]  that fought the cave bears the saber-tooth tigers you know i mean humans with their bear hands
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:49.880]  taking what they wanted killing giant you know prehistoric rhinos running elephants off clips
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:57.160]  i mean we are now sitting there now women women never acted like this women used to be true
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:01.800]  feminists women were tougher than nails now women fall down it's like they taught women they saw
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:08.360]  something scary to faint uh in victorian england as a as a mind control just all the mind control
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:15.080]  and so we've all been taught when we see terry to go or deny it hey that ain't gonna get you out of
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:20.840]  this in every case now in canada and the u.s it's happening every few months now you'll read about
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:25.000]  it's always the same story the woman on her lunch break went to the local park to have a sandwich
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:31.640]  or make some phone calls two coyotes came out she she she she cowered crying calling 911 and the
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:37.480]  coyotes by the time they got there had chewed her throat out and i'm here saying don't call 911 you
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:42.360]  see coyotes coming out of the edge of woods get up and go wow and they're gonna see that predator
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.520]  look that you're just looking at them you're not scared they're gonna run but see what you've
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:56.280]  decided to do is the virtue you think roll over and cry oh no no oh help me oh like in all the

[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:45.240]  eating coyotes have never eaten people not in recorded history with the native americans or
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:50.680]  the settlers coyotes didn't eat people only wolves would go after humans that'd be a human
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:55.560]  alone if the wolves were starving in deep winter if wolves are starving they will try to eat a man
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:01.720]  they know we're tough they got to be starving to try to go after a man starving to death
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:10.360]  now everywhere you go everywhere you go i see signs up on the green belt where's my dog where's
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:17.160]  my cat and i'm like i saw some i saw some coyote crap down the thing it was a dog bones so it ate
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:22.520]  your dog of course i won't tell him that he walked the hiking bike trail and you can see the coyote
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:28.760]  crap of people's cats and dogs i see cat bones a part of partially digested cat skulls everything

[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:38.200]  on the news they're eating everybody's dogs and cats i had coyotes coming out by my house trying
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:45.880]  to eat my uh eat my french bulldogs i just went out there one night with a double-ot shotgun
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:52.760]  baby left some meat out there and it was they're dead tough little buggers i found someone one time
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:59.560]  i shot a coyote in the head a large goblet i mean almost a handful probably half its brain was blown
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:06.920]  out on the ground shot it in the head with a 243 came up to the deer camp or by the trash and that
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:11.720]  was a rifle i just got it 50 yards boom in the head still ran off hundreds of yards couldn't
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:18.840]  find it but anyways folks you're a predator start acting like one stop acting like a jellyfish
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:25.240]  domesticated idiot because the government is the wolves and the coyotes and man you're
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.440]  you're rolled over on your back begging playing a varmint tape that's what they're called varmint
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:38.760]  tapes you're playing varmint tapes by the way the coyotes don't come anywhere around my house
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:45.800]  anymore they don't come anywhere around it in fact they don't even come on the neighbor's
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:49.800]  property because i can see them out there with night vision they won't get anywhere around my
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:55.320]  house and until i finally said all right i'll just hunt them i'm not into shooting stuff just
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:02.600]  to shoot them so i sat up and killed them and the issue is is that they don't come anywhere i don't
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:06.680]  even hear them yelling anymore at night except every once in a while about a mile away on a
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:11.080]  nearby ranch they don't come around my house anymore because i i shot one i know i got one
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:17.640]  and shot at the others as they ran off and again stumbling around at night you use a shotgun with
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:24.280]  double-aught but the point is is that this is what's got to be done politically you've got to
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:27.640]  get up on your hind legs people say what's that mean well a bear gets up on town legs when it's
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:31.800]  really going to go crazy you got to get up on your hind legs and go hey i don't know what the

[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:48.440]  telling others and then the police when we challenged them started writing everyone
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:54.040]  tickets for being out there handing out literature in downtown austin on street corners saying you've
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:58.440]  got to get a permit from us to do that bull your thing's unconstitutional had to call
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:01.640]  there you're like well what's that big fight that's just folks if you can't hand stuff out

[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:12.600]  run the street team we hired off and then they sent thugs when the cops wouldn't do it anymore
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:17.240]  if we would have groveled there would be no free speech left in austin next they'd say
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:21.480]  okay uh give me money like like mexican cops do here here let me have some money now
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:28.600]  you see rolling over what does sheep get eaten by wolves what do wolves do to men they run

[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:38.840]  and that's the old analogy of the sheep dog you're like you're like well i'm not a sheep but i'm not
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:42.840]  a wolf i'm a sheep dog fine you want to be a sheepdog folks we're not trying to be sheep
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:47.640]  dogs because we're trying to be heroes we're overrun by wolves right now ladies and gentlemen
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:54.840]  and we're in a lot of trouble and i see effeminate it's not even fair to men i see estrogen programmed
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:01.560]  men i'm afraid of women to call them feminine i see estrogen programmed on record men everywhere

[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:24.200]  pathetic jellyfish worship they wear it as if it is a cloak of infallibility it is a cloak of
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:32.120]  it is a cloak of shame and that shows style they can make something stylish and people will bring
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:35.960]  their children for human sacrifice and beg their children be chopped up at every culture if it's
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:40.520]  stylish chinese emperors had their wives feet mound they wouldn't even feed themselves they
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:45.000]  were total slaves because they were so elitist they were basket cases that couldn't even wipe
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.800]  their own butts same thing with the british royalty that's style oh you're so stylish you
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:55.480]  don't feed yourself oh you're so stylish you're a jellyfish the sitcom says the guy gets the girl
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:58.920]  if he's a jellyfish but the guys wonder why they're not getting the girl so they act more

[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:39.320]  monday through friday from 11 a.m until 2 p.m central standard time we are here live
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:43.560]  we've had larry alder scheduled we're trying to connect with him on skype we'll see if that
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:49.000]  happens very interesting individual of course radio host there in los angeles and his views
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.120]  on obama and where all this is going but i'll tell you this the power structure is pulling out
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:34:01.400]  all the stops now to just confuse reality and our answer is to get real to get serious and go all
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:06.760]  the way and by going all the way we've gotten in this position because the establishment says be
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:12.520]  mealy-mouthed don't be aggressive compromise that's how you're successful and during the
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:17.800]  sellout of america some people could be successful for a time doing that but now we're getting down
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:22.600]  to the end game folks you've got to realize this is a very bad place we're going to and
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:31.000]  you cannot imagine that you're part of the power structure you cannot imagine that and
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:37.960]  get out of all this because you're not part of the power structure i mean look at this
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:43.160]  citizens tell gun grabbers you are coloring outside the lines of constitutional parameters
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:49.400]  they're suing new york that they can't bar the second amendment so you get back on the offensive
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:53.880]  now 15 members of congress are saying we want to see why you're buying thousands of armored
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:59.800]  vehicles and billions of bullets it's happening fast and furious is getting back out there
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:04.200]  and again we're in deep trouble because both political parties to a great extent are bought
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:09.000]  and paid for by crony capitalist interest that want to use socialism at the grassroots to control
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.760]  us and crony capitalism on the top of the system to absolutely totally
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:25.080]  to absolutely totally and completely get everybody domesticated and i just don't want to live under
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:29.960]  this and i'm told we do have larry elder very exciting i don't know why i've never had this
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:33.720]  guy on or maybe i did many years ago it seems i did i you know it all blurs together we're
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:39.400]  doing radio six days a week but uh he of course is one of the most popular uh talk show hosts
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:43.320]  out in california and i'm thinking sometimes he's been syndicated again i don't have time to follow
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:48.200]  a lot of media outside of what we do and what the establishment throws at us but he's hosted
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:52.520]  larry elder's show for more than 15 years that's right nationally syndicated and i just every time
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:56.600]  i see clips of him it's always just extremely informative and he's been on everything from
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:03.880]  oprah to you name it larry elder.com and i'm very very excited to have him on the broadcast with us
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:09.560]  to talk about the state of the world and how crazy everything's gotten and what he expects
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:14.760]  the collectivist to do i see them trying to play us off against each other as much as they can
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.160]  desperately so that we don't get together and unify around the bill of rights and constitution
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:22.360]  larry it's good to have you on with us thanks for spending time alex thank you so much for
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:28.760]  having me it's an honor it's an honor to have you wow so uh so much so much is going on
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:34.760]  out there in the world what is front and center on your radar screen well alex as i was trying
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:39.800]  to tell mr pence morgan when i was on there a couple of weeks ago if you really want to talk
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:44.520]  about gun violence in america the face of gun violence as horrific as sally hook was is not
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:49.560]  the face of some suburban kid a kid is more likely to be struck by lightning alex and to be killed in
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:54.600]  the school shooting the face of gun violence in this country is a 15 year old girl who performed
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:59.000]  at obama's inauguration who was killed by one of those to whom it made concerned gang related
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.680]  bullets it's a six-year-old latina girl who was sitting on her porch one night in march last year
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:10.520]  alex one of five people to be killed in that hour in chicago chicago is a city right now which is on
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:16.040]  track for two sandy hooks per month if you look at the demographics of chicago the city is roughly a
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:21.400]  third black a third white and a third hispanic however the homicides 70 of them are committed
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:26.520]  by black people and usually the victim is almost always another black person take new york new york
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:32.600]  demographically about 46 are so white about 17 to 20 percent hispanic about that same number of
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:37.400]  blacks however according to police commissioner kelly 96 of the homicides are committed by black
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:42.600]  and brown people almost always alex the victim is another black or brown person now the question is
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:49.080]  why it is going on we have a couple of possible suspects one is racism problem with that is during
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:53.960]  jim crow when we had not only de facto segregation we had legal segregation you didn't find this kind
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:59.320]  of criminality coming from the black community what about racism during uh during the great
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:03.960]  depression 50 of the black adults were unemployed 50 percent you did not find this kind of
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:09.560]  criminality 70 today of black kids are born outside of wedlock that has tripled the number
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:15.800]  back in 1965 today 50 of hispanic kids are born outside of wedlock about 35 of white kids now i
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:19.640]  mentioned that because it's a direct relationship between not having a father in the house and fill
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:23.960]  in the blank of your favorite social ill whether it's dropouts whether it's unemployment whether
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:28.440]  it's just gun homicide a direct relationship between not having a father in the house and bad
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:33.480]  behavior and we've incentivized people into having children without getting married because we've
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.720]  given people money after the so-called war on poverty was launched lynn and johnson alex
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:43.240]  literally sent poverty workers going door to door uh in inner city households letting women know of
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:48.920]  their so-called rights to welfare provided there was no man in the house so from 1965 the percentage
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:53.960]  of black kids born outside of wedlock has tripled as we spent 16 trillion dollars on so-called
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:59.080]  poverty programs we've incentivized people into making bad decisions we've allowed women to get
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:04.360]  food stamps asdc you name it a woman with two children living on welfare is making more money
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:08.840]  than she would if he had a minimum wage job and we've allowed the man to abandon his financial
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.160]  and moral responsibility bill costly calls such men unwed fathers that's what we've done for the
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:17.320]  last 50 years and the left can't come to the conclusion oh my lord what have i done so they
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:24.200]  gotta blame racism sexism and yes high capacity magazines well absolutely i saw you with one of
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:28.760]  our reporters to an interview a few weeks ago david ortiz and that's why i wanted ortiz wanted
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:35.480]  to get you on to expand on all of this because it's so crazy that now you say i don't want
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:42.040]  socialist health care racist i don't want uh you know to have uh all of this corporate welfare
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:47.720]  racist uh i want my second amendment and then the fox columnist and others say well that's racist
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:51.960]  and i go explain to me how it's racist and they go i'm not going to i'm going to throw that out
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:57.400]  to distract the whole debate and then i go back to margaret sanger who said look at these black
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.160]  communities they're becoming wealthy they're self-sufficient we're not going to integrate to
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:05.720]  bring real equality we're going to integrate so we can get rid of these weeds we've got opposed as
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:10.760]  liberals are you familiar i mean you're pretty smart and obviously informed guy but most people
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.320]  aren't that i talk to of her writings and stuff and that i don't think sure i don't think the
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:19.560]  left actually did this on accident a lot of bleeding hearts actually think it's good and
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:24.200]  actually want to help people but the higher ups i mean the democratic party was the kuklas clan
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:27.960]  party but when they couldn't suppress blacks anymore by the 20s and 30s they became the
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:33.240]  democrats the history of the democratic party has been completely skanky uh the members of the
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:37.800]  democratic party formed the clan the clan used to be called the terror wing of the democratic party
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:41.480]  and you're right about margaret singer she was a proponent of eugenics she believed that
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:47.160]  people were socially undesirable and they were usually poor uh young black women uh and you know
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.160]  i've written a book about this called dear father dear son two lives eight hours where i talk about
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:55.640]  the importance of fathers and one of the things i try and do alex is use sources that people can't
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:59.480]  impeach uh you know i could use a heritage foundation they've done all sorts of studies
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.160]  showing the lack of fathers and all the social ill that i mentioned charles murray wrote a
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.240]  wonderful book called losing ground arguably the most important book about the devastation
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:11.160]  to the nuclear intact family by the welfare state that's been written the last 50 years
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:16.200]  so i use people like that well-known neo-con tupac shakur after he died alex it was a documentary
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:21.320]  that came out called resurrection and in the documentary he said i know for a fact if i had
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:25.400]  had a father in my life i would have had some discipline and i would have been more confident
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:30.200]  a man needs to be raised by a man and he proceeded to explain why he joined gangs he wanted protection
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:35.800]  he wanted structure and he wanted values he's saying this i'm not saying this is tupac shakur
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:40.920]  and the only times had a poll back in the 80s and they asked poor people and non-poor people
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:45.400]  the following question do you believe that young poor women often have children to get additional
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:50.520]  welfare benefits the majority of non-poor people said no however when poor people were asked the
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.720]  same question do you believe that young poor women often have children to get additional benefits 64
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:00.360]  said yes so they're telling us we're just not listening and one time i had on my show one of
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:04.840]  these so-called black leaders kawase and fume i haven't been able to get jackson or farah connor
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:09.880]  sharpen on my show in 20 years but kawasi mfumi when he was in the head of the NAACP came on
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:14.040]  and to his credit i asked him the following question mr mfumi asked between the presence
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:18.440]  of white racism which you often talk about or the absence of black fathers which in my opinion you
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:22.680]  don't talk about enough which poses a bigger threat to the black community and without missing
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:28.600]  a beat he said the absence of fathers so they're telling us we're just not listening you're right
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:33.320]  and then they'll say we need fathers but do everything to destroy them and then promote and
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:39.400]  embrace the most destructive uh fake you know gangster culture stuff uh and again the young
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:45.400]  boys don't have a father so then they see MTV and the tough guys that are the male role models
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.560]  you know are these gangster drug dealers i mean look this has been done on purpose i mean there's
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:55.240]  no way and i've got the documents and evidence i've gone over it i covered my film endgame and
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:59.400]  i've actually read quite a few of the blurbs and articles where people picked up some of your
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:04.040]  writings i need to read your books i need to carry them in our bookstore tell us some about
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:09.160]  your books because this is something that can be used you know the knowledge you're laying out
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:13.720]  to empower people and i think i'm gonna read them other people should as well well alex my book dear
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:17.720]  father dear son is about my relationship with my own father which was not good my father was a
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:22.360]  what i called a a junkyard dog dad he was a monford point marine they were the equivalent
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:25.880]  of the tuskegee airman he was the first black marine there were 20 000 of them that trained
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.760]  in north carolina so rough tough guy and i misunderstood his tough exterior for lack of
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:35.800]  love he beat us with a belt with a telephone cord not uncommon the way people were punished in those
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:40.440]  days especially if the if the adult came from the south but i just mistook that for lack of love so
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.760]  when i'm 15 years old my dad and i have this furious fight and we don't speak for 10 years
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:48.680]  and finally i'm 25 years old we sit down and we speak i think that the conversation would last 10
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:53.160]  minutes it lasted eight hours and during that period of time i found out that the name elder my
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:57.480]  last name is the name of the boyfriend who was in his life the longest he never married his mother
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:01.640]  he was an alcoholic who beat my father and his mother my dad comes home from school has a fight
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:05.880]  with the mother's then boyfriend a different man than elder the mother sides with the boyfriend my
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:10.440]  dad is thrown out of the house never to return we're talking about a black kid jim crow's spouse
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:15.800]  age of 13 a year or two before the beginning of the great depression athens georgia and my dad
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:20.600]  never returned home and despite all of his troubles my dad always told my brothers and me this hard
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:24.760]  hard work wins you get out of life what you put into it no matter how hard you work bad things
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:28.440]  are going to happen and how you respond to those bad things will tell me whether or not your mother
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:34.280]  and i raised a man and i would always say not too much pressure dad my point is this he was around
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:39.160]  he was a rough tough imperfect father but he was around and by word and by deed exactly he taught
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:43.880]  me what it's like to be well they say a dad's got to be perfect and you know what your dad gets
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:48.040]  scared you're not doing what you're supposed to do you're not listening you're out of control
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:52.280]  i'll tell you it's better to have brutal discipline than no discipline at all these
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:57.400]  kids are a wreck so they end up in prison they end up dead and it's because they've destroyed
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:02.760]  fathers in america that now what happened to the black community has been done everywhere else and
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:09.800]  it is destroying our civilization and alex the key is hard work the formula is very simple
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:14.040]  graduate from high school don't have a kid before you're 20 years old and get married before you have
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:19.320]  the kid james q wilson said anybody who follows that formula will not be poor if you if you fail
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:22.920]  to follow that formula there's a good chance you are going to be poor so the question is what are
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:27.400]  we doing to incentivize or perhaps more importantly what are we doing to de-incentivize people into
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:32.040]  following that formula that's what's going on here and we know what works alex because in 1996 bill
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:36.600]  clinton reluctantly signed the welfare reform act what happened welfare rolls declined by over 50
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:41.720]  so we know that a bunch of able-bodied able-minded people were on the couch they got off after they
[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:45.720]  realized the jig was up we need to continue that and welfare needs to be done at the state and
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:49.320]  local level the federal government needs to get out of it all together and we need to encourage
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:53.160]  the so-called thousand points of life there are a whole bunch of people in the community doing stuff
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:57.560]  big brothers big sisters i belong to an organization called a place called home where
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:00.520]  i contribute money to an organization that teaches people on computers and
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.600]  and that's what you have to do in the short run because there aren't fathers here you have to
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:09.480]  incentivize people to get into their communities and being mentors for these young people until
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:14.840]  we turn out the culture which is changing policies and letting people know it is not a good idea to
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:19.560]  be an unwed father that's an expression that bill cosby has been using my mother my dad has been
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:25.000]  using oh yeah people think it's so cool to go get young women pregnant and and then just turn your
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:29.800]  kids loose to be destroyed there's nothing more punkish than that and you know when i mentioned
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:33.880]  kawaii and fumi this is a guy who turned his life around alex this is a guy who had four or five
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:38.280]  kids by four or five different women and then turned his life around and has been dedicating
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:41.720]  himself to trying to improve things in the black community the thing that really bothers me about
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:46.920]  some of these so-called black leaders where this farrakhan jackson or um or sharpton they all
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:51.000]  should know something about the importance of fathers because in their own lives their fathers
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.880]  were either absent or bad dads jackson's father was a married man who lived next door to his
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:00.920]  teenage mother got her pregnant jackson grew up in south carolina with taunts jesse ain't got no
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:05.640]  daddy jesse ain't got no daddy it bothered him in the case of sharp and sharp then was middle class
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:10.120]  until his father abandoned the family then down to the ghetto in the case of farrakhan his mother
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:14.680]  was estranged from her husband had a boyfriend took back up with the with the estranged husband
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.600]  got pregnant didn't want the boyfriend to know because he tried to abort farrakhan with a coat
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:23.480]  hanger on several occasions well that's right when you cheat on your wife when you cheat on your
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:27.720]  wife folks you're really cheating on your kids i mean i mean that's the bottom line people think
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:32.120]  it's so cool to cheat they think it's really sexy really fun i'm not judging people that have done
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:36.840]  it we're human stuff goes but the point is it's certainly not something to be proud of the the
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:41.320]  one of the greatest expressions i've ever heard about this alex is the best thing a father can
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.600]  do for his children is to love their mother because when these kids get in the street alex
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:51.160]  with no father they're thin skinned they're angry they're resent adults they have no idea
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:55.400]  on how to resolve disputes in an intelligent way without profanity and without violence that's one
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.160]  of the many things you see when you have an adult relationship in your house with your mother and
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:02.840]  your father you're watching adults resolve disputes you're watching a guy get up and go
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:07.960]  to work when he doesn't feel like it that's what you don't see hard work wins and we're discouraging
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:14.840]  that with our welfare state uh and by incentivizing people into making bad moral decisions now it was
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:19.240]  uh who was the football coach that said uh winners never quit and quitters never win
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:25.320]  sounds like something bombardi would say that's who said it yeah it's so true though i mean i
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:29.160]  i go down to demonstrations and things and we'll have communists and socialists down there and i'll
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:34.680]  walk up they'll go look it's a capitalist and i look at them and i'm like look i mean you really
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:43.720]  think communism is better than than what a free market and freedom creates i said look at what
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:48.760]  communism does they just laugh i mean they really think that when they collapse america into
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:54.280]  communism they're going to have some great time i mean they're just idiots they're just idiots
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:49:00.680]  they're just morons they have no idea what they're doing well you know at 1900 at all three levels
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:05.480]  alex government took about seven percent of the nation's income right now when you put a monetary
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:10.840]  value on so-called unfunded mandates we're talking about federal state and local taking over 40 of
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:15.800]  the people's income one of the reasons america has been so great is that we trusted our people with
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:21.560]  our own money and with our own time we no longer do that we've got a president uh who's now added
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:26.840]  the fourth leg to our welfare state we've got social security medicare medicaid and now obamacare
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:32.040]  until and unless we reverse that we're going to still under produce two percent sucks as gdp we
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:35.720]  should be rocket enrolling at four and four and five percent we should be creating three and four
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:39.240]  and five hundred thousand jobs per month the way we did at this juncture during the ronald reagan
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:43.160]  recovery this is the worst recovery since the great depression it's because of these policies
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:48.520]  well it's not a recovery i mean that's even a hoax well even yeah you're right that last quarter we
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:53.000]  had negative growth although they had revised it up with a little bit uh this is just awful and
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  you look at the percentage of people able-bodied people who've just given up the labor force
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.520]  participation rate is what we ought to be looking at well i think a lot of i know a lot of hard
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:03.880]  working people that are giving up because they're sick of watching lazy people sit around and live
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:08.280]  off them but then that's what happens in any social society finally people working three jobs
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:11.880]  give up and man then things really get bad well that's what mitt ronnie was talking about with
[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:17.400]  the 47 people weren't listening once you get to a point where over 50 of the voters are not paying
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:21.160]  federal income taxes they can march in there and pull the lever for a raise on somebody else's
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:25.960]  dime we are in deep deep well yeah they spun it that he didn't care about the other percent no
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:30.360]  he was saying they're not listening to me they're on the government payroll they don't care they
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  don't care well you mentioned how they spin it and that really is a deeper problem when everybody
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:37.560]  talks to me about the post-mortem what mitt romney could have done it could have done this could have
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:41.240]  done that there's plenty of things he could have done it could have said that might have made made
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:46.440]  him win but you have to go to the main what i call the main screen media alex all these people abc

[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:24.200]  central on stations like 5 90 am here in austin texas we got rosa corey on the other end doing
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:29.560]  interviews for an upcoming film i just ran back over here i tell you talk about working too much
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:35.080]  i'm doing way too much to half the time it's all crazy uh larry elder uh and i've heard him on the
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:39.480]  radio many times and had a chance to read some of the articles that are out there that he's put out
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:46.120]  it's just spot on with the problems that our society uh is facing it's just the collectiveness
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:51.160]  i go back to this i've read their writings they did this on purpose they want to dominate us they
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:55.960]  want to control us they want us dependent and i think we should not call liberals liberals i i
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:55:00.200]  really think whenever i talk to prominent libertarian conservatives like mr elder
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:06.520]  i say look can we please stop calling them liberals because thomas jefferson was a liberal
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:12.040]  these people are not liberals they're authoritarian social engineering eugenicist based monsters
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:18.040]  at the top their writings are public they think we're idiots and and quite frankly i i think it's
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:24.200]  despicable how they are trying to invoke racial division at a level that's cartoonish uh larry
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:28.520]  i mean am i wrong in saying that we shouldn't call them liberals and that the race baiting
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:33.880]  i mean it's obvious who the not even racist are they're just they're just trying to divide people
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:41.160]  like social engineers coldly i mean you turn on msnbc it is absurdist it's so over the top that
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:45.960]  if you don't agree to everything they want you're a racist with with no reason why you're a racist
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:50.120]  well they're the ones who are the biggest the other day on my show i was called out because
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:54.600]  uh there's an lapd officer black officer who's suing the lapd claiming that he's a victim of
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:59.000]  racial discrimination and you look at his complaint alex there's a bunch of you know like
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:04.040]  you know like station house prank somebody put some fried chicken on a cake on his 20th anniversary
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:09.080]  in the forest somebody put a little mock caption on a on a picture of him with stanford and son
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:13.080]  you know bsp this is the kind of stuff that cops do for crying out loud it's nothing more than
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:17.720]  a shakedown this guy calls up he's very angry at me describes himself as white and said how
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:22.200]  dare you you never seem to acknowledge racism et cetera et cetera i said you're the one who's a
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.320]  bigot sir here i am simply outlining my case and you're angry at me because a black person is quote
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.240]  fighting with the wrong guy what does that even mean these guys are the ones who play the race
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:35.640]  card donna brazil is the one who referred to the republican party as having a white boy attitude
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:40.840]  she said this when she was the uh the campaign manager for al gore out here in la there's a
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:46.600]  state senator named diane watson who later on ran and became a u.s congresswoman during the a fight
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:51.560]  to get rid of race-based preferences in california uh the guy who led the fight with a black man named
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:57.480]  ward carterly so diane watson a black woman comes out and attacks him and says let me tell you why
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:02.120]  you're supporting getting rid of race-based preferences you are married to a white woman
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:07.560]  you don't want to be black you are you're not proud of yourself as a black man that's why you
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:12.520]  support this can you imagine anybody republican saying that to anybody and then two days later
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.280]  when a reporter confronted her she said that's right i said it and i don't take it back and she
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:20.440]  ran for congress and got elected i can give you example after example after example of where
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:25.880]  people on the left make the most hideous charges charlie wrangle said of republican congress after
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:30.840]  1994 when they took it over he said they don't say s word anymore a slur for hispanics they don't
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:36.520]  say n-word anymore the slur for for uh for blacks he used the actual slur they don't say s or n-word
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:41.720]  anymore they just say let's cut taxes so cutting taxes is racist charlie wrangle also said george
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:46.920]  w bush was our bull connor for people under 20 years old bull connor was that southern sheriff
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:51.320]  who staked water hoses and dogs on civil rights workers when they were marching with martin luther
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:56.920]  king are you kidding me george bush is our bull connor and furthermore charlie wrangle added and
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:01.640]  if that doesn't make you angry i don't know what will end of quote unintentionally well now charlie
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:07.480]  wrangle who's been on this show before said we must overcome white southerners and so does
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:12.600]  sharpton something similar to get the guns like having guns is only for white people you know
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:17.000]  martin luther king said be colorblind which i agree with and then the opposite they're always
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:22.520]  about the color instead of the character of the deeds and what the person stands for and but for
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:25.640]  the second amendment a whole lot of these civil rights workers and people that were defending
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:30.280]  themselves would be dead you know what let's do a look uh could you do like five more minutes to

[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:22.600]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:29.640]  you know on the issue of corporal punishment i think it's very important and in the few times
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:32.760]  i did things that were really bad like take money out of my mom's purse or something because i
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:38.280]  wanted a cap gun or something you know my dad gave me a really good weapon we got in trouble
[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:42.120]  with the football coaches when we were bad and forgotten you know trouble they give us a bunch
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:47.400]  of pops you notice they've taken all that out and now people just shoot each other but i'm i'm
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:51.480]  already segwaying off because i wanted to with with larry alder the big uh nashley syndicated
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:57.080]  libertarian talk show host and the conservative commentator and best-selling author as well
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:03.000]  and he's all over everything from um from cnn to fox news to you name it but we only have a few
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.320]  minutes left but you were getting into your dad and i understand going too far you know really
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:10.760]  coming from the hard streets and then still trying to be a dad and your kids aren't doing what you're
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:15.400]  saying it's just nowadays they act like if you just spank your child it's criminal when it's not
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:21.000]  and and it's much meaner to not teach someone that hey there's consequences to something if you're
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.480]  not going to listen to me and if grounding you isn't enough i won't apologize for corporal
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:29.960]  punishment i don't have to do it very much but they know it's there and and my wife won't spank
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:34.280]  my kids and so sometimes they don't do what she says or she doesn't do it very often they know i
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:39.400]  will and just from that they won't do stuff like walk out in the street so i'm not but that's a
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:43.480]  side issue i just wanted to see if you had anything else to say about corporal punishment well all i
[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:47.880]  know is if my dad had died with with his estate having money and if the statute of limitations
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:52.840]  hadn't expired alex i could see the sob for excessive punishment based on the way people
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:57.880]  are right now are you kidding me people use the belt in those days people use the telephone cord
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:02.920]  they use whatever they could whatever was nearby but they did it out of love as imperfectly as we
[03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:07.080]  see that right now they just did it out of love and alex my dad worked two full-time jobs as a
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:10.840]  janitor he cooked for a family on the weekend went to night school three nights a week to get
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:15.000]  his ged because as i mentioned he was thrown out of the house by his mom when he was 13 years old
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:21.160]  so the guy the guy averaged maybe four hours of sleep a night for decades so you add that plus
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:26.360]  his background and okay he wasn't ward cleaver cleaver he wasn't warm but it's true the media
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:30.280]  acts like if you even yell at your kid it's abuse that's because they don't want the parent in
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:34.120]  control they're going to put them on ritalin and pros act you know to make them behave which is
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:39.240]  assaulting their brain viciously the truth is dads get mad when they've got to spank their
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:45.080]  child because you hate it so much you get even madder even though you don't show it that that
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:49.960]  that you've got to do this to make them behave and as i mentioned it is important for us to learn
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:56.200]  morals and values in my book dear father dear son i talk about uh with my dad a prison chaplain of
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:02:59.640]  a federal prison who wanted to improve the morale of the prison so he went to one of these major
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:04.280]  greeting card companies and got 500 greeting cards for mother's day took him back to the prison
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:08.840]  and sure enough the men filled them out sent them off to good old mom and and the morale in the
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:12.280]  prison improved so he thought he would do the same thing for father's day you know where i'm going
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:16.200]  with this story caused a riot greeting card company gets 500 greeting cards company green
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:21.000]  cards for father's day not one inmate alex not one wanted to send it out and send it to dad
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.480]  now what does it tell you that you're four times more likely to end up in prison if you don't have
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:28.920]  a dad at home that's right the people who are behind bars three out of four of them had either
[03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:33.720]  no relationship or a bad relationship with their father it's incredible i got a minute left but
[03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:37.400]  the whole issue it's on record that the second amendments would allow the civil rights movement
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:43.000]  to happen the first gun laws were by the clan in the south to to not let newly freed black
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  americans have their guns and people don't realize that the clan as i mentioned we used to be called
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:51.320]  the terror wing of the democratic party uh and as far as the civil rights movement is concerned
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:56.520]  democrats voted unanimously against the 13 14th and 15th amendment that freed uh blacks that made
[03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:00.840]  them citizens right away and that piece on paper gave them the right to vote uh democrats voted
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:05.400]  against that stuff unanimously if you look at the civil rights act of 1964 as a percentage of the
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:09.800]  party more republicans voted for it than did democrats so it puts a lot of this so-called
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:14.280]  southern strategy as being racist what sense does it make to join a party where as a percentage
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:18.360]  more of that party voted for the civil rights act of 54 than the party you left if you're leaving
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:22.120]  because of racial reasons it makes no sense yeah it's not known that republicans voted for the
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:26.280]  civil rights act more than the democrats i know it's just a total fraud it just shows
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:30.280]  that not that republicans have obviously got their big issues too but i mean the democratic
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:35.000]  party is just such a snake-like organization that they're just they're just so over the top
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:38.520]  larry alder thank you that was an amazing interview thank you for your time sir next
