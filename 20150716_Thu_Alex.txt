[00:00.000 --> 00:29.360]  We're live on this Thursday, the 16th day of July 2015, we have a jam-packed global
[00:29.360 --> 00:36.080]  transmission lined up for you today. The corporate media is going into overdrive deceiving the
[00:36.080 --> 00:43.040]  population about what Jade Helm really is. It, of course, kicked off yesterday. We've got a whole
[00:43.040 --> 00:47.760]  bunch of other news about the ongoing collapse of Europe, what's happening with the campaign,
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.400]  the latest on Donald Trump, medical news, and so much more. But first off,
[00:52.400 --> 00:55.840]  Leanne McAdoo on what they're not telling you about Jade Helm.
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.280]  The Jade Helm military exercise kicked off today and already we're seeing media outlets taking the
[01:01.280 --> 01:07.120]  angle of conspiracy nuts thinking Texas is going to be invaded, martial law is imminent, people
[01:07.120 --> 01:13.040]  being rounded up into these underground Walmart tunnels, basically painting genuine concern
[01:13.040 --> 01:18.480]  as nothing more than crazy conspiracy theory. But one thing the media has failed to address
[01:18.480 --> 01:24.000]  altogether is the mastering the human domain angle of Jade Helm. This is something that we
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.280]  covered in depth months ago. I want to bring it back up to reiterate that this is what we need to
[01:29.280 --> 01:34.560]  be concerned with. The battlefield of the future is not going to be taking place between nation
[01:34.560 --> 01:41.440]  states per se. It is literally going to be a war for your mind. It's all about total information
[01:41.440 --> 01:45.840]  awareness and that's what we're going to break down here today. So just to review, in military
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.920]  terminology, the human domain or human domain analytics refers to the global understanding
[01:51.920 --> 01:57.040]  of anything associated with people. Mastery of the human domain results from obtaining total
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.080]  information awareness on a mass scale and we can break it down into four specific categories.
[02:02.080 --> 02:09.840]  Who you are, what you do, who you know, and the context. So I really had the privilege of
[02:09.840 --> 02:17.200]  running a more of a multi-ant innovation cell. The cell's objectives were to use as much non-
[02:17.200 --> 02:25.840]  traditional data from an Intel standpoint, do sense making of data so that not only your analysts
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.920]  but your machine learning, your algorithms you could build would ultimately get to
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.840]  a predictive analysis cell. It's very, very hard to do especially if you don't have all the data.
[02:37.840 --> 02:44.400]  Basically old data is good data, new data is good data and all data is good. Now with present day
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.520]  technology meaning that pretty much anyone can upload a video onto the internet and reach the
[02:49.520 --> 02:56.320]  entire world in a second, the government has not only hyper incentivized the collection of data
[02:56.320 --> 03:02.560]  but also merging all of the relevant agencies and so that's another big aspect of Jade Helm is
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.160]  that we have a lot of these agencies working together with local law enforcement. James Clapper
[03:08.160 --> 03:14.640]  who is the current director of national intelligence said in 2009, activity-based surveillance built
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.120]  on a strong foundation of human dimension analysis will form the intellectual underpinning of how
[03:21.120 --> 03:27.120]  we perform intelligence in the future. A conference on mastering the human domain featured high level
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.840]  military and intelligence officials openly discussing gathering publicly available data
[03:31.840 --> 03:38.400]  to create these detailed maps with layered information. The recognition of the importance of the human
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.640]  domain and that sophisticated understanding of all those things you said, the tribal history,
[03:44.640 --> 03:52.880]  language, culture, it's so significant. So Jade Helm is more than a simple military exercise. If you
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.920]  understand the technology that's involved then you'll see that Jade Helm is more of an intelligence
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.920]  operation using geospatial intelligence mapping. And as information from low-level surveillance
[04:03.920 --> 04:09.840]  technologies such as Stingrays and predictive policing programs are all getting siphoned up into
[04:09.840 --> 04:16.560]  NSA data centers, a detailed global map will continue to grow with near endless stats on
[04:16.560 --> 04:23.040]  all individuals. Jade Helm will not result in martial law rather they are using this geospatial
[04:23.040 --> 04:29.120]  intelligence mapping to build a simulation and that simulation will help them with predictive
[04:29.120 --> 04:34.720]  programming techniques as well as it's going to bring America one step closer to total domination
[04:34.720 --> 04:40.720]  by the surveillance state and the military industrial complex. You understand the question,
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.920]  you understand the needs, potential threats and you're putting that information together in a way
[04:45.920 --> 04:53.040]  that the the sum is significantly larger, more valuable, more useful than the individual parts.
[04:53.920 --> 04:58.800]  Jade Helm is total domination. Leigh Ann McAdoo's report, we're gonna post it.
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.520]  Jade Helm kicked off Wednesday and the establishment media went with the angle that it's just the
[05:03.520 --> 05:09.440]  conspiracy nuts thinking martial law is imminent. But what they won't explain about Jade Helm and
[05:09.440 --> 05:16.640]  what we exposed months ago is mastering the human domain. In military terminology the human domain
[05:16.640 --> 05:23.040]  or human domain analytics refers to the global understanding of anything associated with people.
[05:23.040 --> 05:28.800]  Mastering the human domain means obtaining total information awareness on a mass scale. This means
[05:28.800 --> 05:34.080]  who you are, what you do, who you know and any other contextual information about you.
[05:34.080 --> 05:40.080]  Jade Helm is more than a simple military exercise. If you understand the technologies you'll see
[05:40.080 --> 05:46.400]  that Jade Helm is more an intelligence operation using geospatial intelligence mapping. The
[05:46.400 --> 05:52.480]  battlefield of the future won't be on the ground. There is literally a war on for your mind. Watch
[05:52.480 --> 05:58.000]  the Info Wars Nightly News at 7 p.m. Central. We'll discuss Jade Helm and mastering the human domain.

[08:21.760 --> 08:28.240]  Just look at these headlines at drugsreport.com. Then I'll go to infowars.com. Just look at them.
[08:28.800 --> 08:32.080]  Boom bust micro apartments are coming to the Midwest.
[08:33.760 --> 08:36.560]  Scientists edit genes to produce artificial sperm.
[08:38.560 --> 08:44.720]  We'll generate army of half cloned mice. Robot passes self-awareness test. That's AI.
[08:44.720 --> 08:52.720]  Hindu Muslim couples slit each other's throats in Taj Mahal suicide pact.
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.760]  Vets disability claims ended up in shred bins.
[09:02.720 --> 09:08.240]  Department officials at the Veterans Affairs accused of threatening tweets aimed at whistleblowers.
[09:08.240 --> 09:14.080]  Artificial intelligence to replace family doctor.
[09:18.560 --> 09:25.920]  It's going to stop right there. You notice I told you a long time ago more than 15 years ago
[09:25.920 --> 09:30.640]  that they would edit genes in the egg and the sperm because that had all been announced in
[09:30.640 --> 09:34.800]  research that was already done in the U.S. and England. Everything we see in the news is basically
[09:34.800 --> 09:45.200]  15 to 30 years old when they roll it out to the public. You notice they're talking about artificial
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.440]  intelligence to replace family doctor. Artificial intelligence is already replacing it.
[09:54.400 --> 10:01.200]  There used to be articles by 2050 the entire military will be drones and self-aware combat robots.
[10:01.200 --> 10:08.080]  How about 2025? 2020. Now they're admitting that. They always say it further out so you don't get
[10:08.080 --> 10:14.960]  upset but to condition you. It's a formula. They follow formulas. Criminals follow formulas.
[10:16.560 --> 10:19.440]  Successful people too but not corrupt evil ones.
[10:19.440 --> 10:28.800]  And then there's all the financial news coming in that the economy is in deep trouble.
[10:31.520 --> 10:35.840]  I really spent some time watching Donald Trump's speeches in his interviews.
[10:39.760 --> 10:43.840]  And coming up at the bottom of the hour I'll give you my take on Donald Trump. I've really
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.480]  done some soul searching on the subject and I'll give you my take on whether I think he's a shill
[10:48.480 --> 11:00.720]  or not. Here's some of the news articles that just illustrate things at info wars.com. Video,
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.280]  cop face slams, handcuffed teen girl into the concrete floor knocking on her teeth.
[11:10.480 --> 11:13.680]  And now the police department wants to give him a medal and is calling him a victim.
[11:13.680 --> 11:21.280]  That's the inversion of reality. A new video, Obama supporters advocate tearing down racist
[11:21.280 --> 11:24.240]  Mount Rushmore. We told you that was coming.
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.560]  In fact I said a few weeks ago reporters go out and call for tearing down Mount Rushmore. Well
[11:32.560 --> 11:41.040]  Mark Dice has done it. Star of the Confederate flag theft video to be charged by police.
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.640]  An excellent Leanne McAdoo report what they won't tell you about Jade Helm.
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.120]  Another important article stone cold proof that America deserves judgment.
[11:56.160 --> 12:01.200]  And that's the breakdown of Planned Parenthood's director.
[12:01.200 --> 12:09.760]  One of their major directors of an entire national program.
[12:11.520 --> 12:16.960]  Senior director of medical services for the Federation of America Planned Parenthood.
[12:17.920 --> 12:22.160]  Just talking about selling body parts and how they're trying to get around it to make more money.
[12:22.160 --> 12:31.040]  And sitting there drinking wine at an expensive restaurant, fine dining. And again this is a
[12:31.600 --> 12:39.840]  picture or a video that tells a million words of literally supping paying for expensive wine
[12:39.840 --> 12:48.160]  and Italian food at an upscale restaurant with a paycheck from baby's body parts.
[12:48.160 --> 12:53.760]  And that's why it's in the news that they just take
[12:56.960 --> 13:00.720]  your medical file when you go to the VA and they stick it in a circular file.
[13:01.840 --> 13:05.360]  And it's been in the news for over a year. We were one of the outlets that broke it. I'm not
[13:05.360 --> 13:10.080]  bragging. I'm just pointing out we're a very legitimate operation that breaks tons of news
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.440]  that it wasn't that they just weren't getting around to treating people. They were
[13:15.440 --> 13:20.640]  being told by the computer program run by IBM, the Thomas computer,
[13:23.360 --> 13:24.720]  Thomas Watson computers,
[13:27.680 --> 13:30.400]  to kill people, to give them a death sentence.
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.000]  And then now it's in the news that a year later it's worse than it was. Yeah, because they got
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.800]  away with it. And so now we've played the videos in Texas and other states where you go in you say,
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.520]  yeah, I'm a veteran. I'm here to enroll and they go, sorry, we're not even accepting new
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.720]  applications. See, now it's an application to get health care. And this is what you're going
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.880]  to get under Obamacare. And I was thinking about it this morning,
[14:03.920 --> 14:07.920]  about trying to reach out to the public and to show them how they've been conditioned
[14:07.920 --> 14:19.840]  and to accept just such incredible evil. And how if one man dies as a tragedy of 10,000 diets
[14:19.840 --> 14:26.720]  of statistic, to quote Joe Stalin, if there was a horror movie where there was some evil alien
[14:26.720 --> 14:34.400]  shapeshifter that would hunt down pregnant women and tie them down and then like a vampire suck
[14:34.400 --> 14:41.920]  the baby out of them and eat it, it would be a horrible, you know, R rated film that would just
[14:41.920 --> 14:49.200]  be terrifying. And people would hate that fictional entity with all their instincts and want to kill
[14:49.200 --> 15:00.560]  it. But if it's government funded, globalist funded, clan funded, Hitler supported hardcore
[15:00.560 --> 15:08.160]  institution that solicits money to quote kill black babies, then they're lauded as the most
[15:08.160 --> 15:15.520]  liberal thing since Martin Luther King or whatever. It's like the second coming of Christ or Mahatma
[15:15.520 --> 15:23.200]  Gandhi. And it's, it's, it's wonderful. This woman sitting there, we played the video the last two
[15:23.200 --> 15:28.480]  days, maybe I should play it again, as she smacks her lips and enjoys it and clearly gets off
[15:28.480 --> 15:37.920]  on talking about baby parts while she's slurping fine red wine. And I agree with Jakari Jackson
[15:38.960 --> 15:47.680]  when he co-hosted the show Tuesday in overdrive when he said, I laud the camera guy with a
[15:47.680 --> 15:53.200]  hidden camera because I couldn't sit there with a straight face. I couldn't either. Actually,
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.200]  I have an investigative report because it's so important to complete the mission. But I mean,
[15:57.200 --> 16:03.840]  I want to slap that woman upside her head. I mean, have some reverence, at least if you're a body
[16:03.840 --> 16:09.920]  snatcher, at least, but she can't even do that. It's not enough they're rendering these babies
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.800]  down like they're a pig getting gutted at a slaughterhouse. Where are the animal rights
[16:14.800 --> 16:22.240]  activists caring about humans? Well, you find out PETA is a eugenics cult. The head of PETA is a
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.440]  follower of Peter Singer who says, go ahead and kill kids up to age three, kill old people. The
[16:27.440 --> 16:32.320]  government or a computer should decide when your quality of life is good and then cap you. And they
[16:32.320 --> 16:38.320]  sell it like a right to die movement. And I don't like suicide, but I understand people do when
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.960]  they're in so much pain. I don't judge people to commit suicide. And I don't think God does either.
[16:42.960 --> 16:46.800]  I can't speak for God, but just at my gut level in my spirit, I think if somebody's in
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.280]  excruciating pain or their kids have died in a plane crash and they're distraught and I understand
[16:51.280 --> 17:00.880]  jumping off a cliff, I wouldn't personally do it. But selling assisted suicide and eugenics and
[17:00.880 --> 17:07.200]  euthanasia as if it's just some choice of somebody who's in great pain is not what's happening.
[17:07.200 --> 17:11.680]  This is about devaluing human life and having the state remove people
[17:11.680 --> 17:21.040]  like THX 1138 or Logan's Run or the island. You go see the movie, The Island,
[17:21.760 --> 17:27.440]  that's based on a famous novel and they've got these people that think they're
[17:28.240 --> 17:37.200]  contestants on a game show in the future after a biological war and they're going to get sent
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.720]  to this wonderful island. And the truth is they're just a clone of a famous person and then they get
[17:42.720 --> 17:50.240]  rendered down for their organs when it comes time. But then when it's really happening,
[17:51.200 --> 17:58.240]  you don't hear a word out of any. This story's been out for three days. It's getting millions
[17:58.240 --> 18:04.160]  of reads on infowars.com, millions of reads at Daily Caller and scores for other libertarian websites
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.640]  and the mainstream media won't even cover it other than having the Washington Post
[18:08.640 --> 18:14.640]  and Salon basically come out and say it's not true. Just like world government isn't real,
[18:14.640 --> 18:18.880]  just like fast and furious isn't real, just like Benghazi didn't happen,
[18:18.880 --> 18:23.520]  just like raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit, just like two plus two equals five,
[18:23.520 --> 18:28.880]  just like you can keep your doctor, just like you didn't build your business. You people are not
[18:28.880 --> 18:40.560]  liberals. You are placeholders to neutralize the left that historically was some type of check
[18:41.200 --> 18:47.680]  against out of control fascist activity. And now you are the fascist. And then you got the
[18:47.680 --> 18:54.800]  Republican leadership working with you on ending the country, on open borders, on bankrupting the
[18:54.800 --> 19:03.200]  nation, on blocking GMO labeling, on Obamacare, again written by megacorporations as a galactic
[19:03.200 --> 19:09.520]  screw job to double and triple prices and take doctors out of the mix where computers make decisions,
[19:10.080 --> 19:16.160]  diagnostic systems that get their parameters from the federal database. People say, oh,
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.960]  a robot will be impartial. That's the most ridiculous statement ever. I could program a
[19:20.960 --> 19:28.080]  computer to say, don't give care to anybody. And they have liberal movies like Elysium,
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.120]  where they reprogram the computers and the robots to give everybody care. But in the real world,
[19:33.120 --> 19:38.560]  they just programmed everything to not give you care. Again, it's inverted reality.
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.480]  Take Jade Helm. Eisenhower says, there's an incredible threat military industrial complex.
[19:44.480 --> 19:48.720]  Don't have military operations domestically. The funding needs to be cut. It's taking over.
[19:48.720 --> 19:54.160]  That's common sense. Now we have a militarized police, we have a federal government out of control,
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.400]  and we say, hey, this giant unprecedented drill, we should look at it, and they misrepresent that.
[19:59.200 --> 20:03.680]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader,
[20:03.680 --> 20:08.800]  My Patriot Supply. Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you have made

[21:16.320 --> 21:21.760]  because they are not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100% organic or because

[22:01.440 --> 22:05.760]  the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now, you've heard our commercials about wallets that
[22:05.760 --> 22:09.920]  protect you from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards
[22:09.920 --> 22:14.320]  from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a
[22:14.320 --> 22:19.280]  built-in radio chip called RFID. I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion
[22:19.280 --> 22:24.640]  of privacy. Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, US passports,
[22:24.640 --> 22:30.000]  hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.640]  ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of
[22:34.640 --> 22:39.600]  misconceptions out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[22:40.320 --> 22:44.960]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to
[22:44.960 --> 22:49.600]  protect your personal financial data. You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales
[22:49.600 --> 22:54.240]  model, you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets. It is as though the protection
[22:54.240 --> 23:01.040]  is free. Visit idstronghold.com today. Hey, Berkey guy here. Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?

[23:51.520 --> 24:21.360]  I'm going to give you my bottom line. Take on Donald Trump.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.200]  It's similar to what I said earlier, but I want to revise and extend my remarks to use
[24:27.200 --> 24:36.080]  a congressional parliamentary term. And then coming up, the latest lies from the corporate
[24:36.080 --> 24:42.000]  establishment media about Jade Helm attacking this talk show host. I mean, they say that we say
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.200]  Walmart are secret death camps. We are the ones that debunked it. They say that we are saying
[24:49.200 --> 24:56.480]  that it's called homeland eradication of local militias. We never said that.
[24:57.760 --> 25:02.080]  And they don't show a link or where we said it. It's like when MSNBC goes,
[25:02.080 --> 25:06.720]  Alex Jones is deeply racist. Alex Jones influenced the Boston bombing and then they just stop. It's
[25:06.720 --> 25:13.040]  like saying Donald Trump is from Pluto and the spacecraft took photos and then not showing the
[25:13.040 --> 25:19.360]  proof. It's just feeding on their audience. It's incredibly arrogant. But first, I want to go to
[25:19.360 --> 25:25.840]  the latest Mark Dice video. It's up on info wars.com. An article Paul Watson wrote about it.
[25:28.320 --> 25:35.680]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, now the trendy Obama supporters want Mount Rushmore to be torn down
[25:35.680 --> 25:42.480]  and being replaced with something gay. Here it is. President Obama has decided to tear down Mount
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.960]  Rushmore, this racist white supremacist monument. We just took down the Confederate flag. Now,
[25:48.960 --> 25:54.640]  Mount Rushmore is being taken down, deconstructed. You think that's the right decision? Should we
[25:54.640 --> 26:01.200]  tear down the racist white supremacist Mount Rushmore monument to continue eradicating these
[26:01.200 --> 26:09.680]  symbols of racism? Absolutely. Racism is bull. As well as gay marriage not being legalized. It's
[26:09.680 --> 26:15.120]  now legal in 50 states and I think the racism thing is. Do you think maybe we should replace
[26:15.120 --> 26:23.680]  Mount Rushmore with some positive historic with some homosexuals? Possibly or even anti-racist
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.400]  anything? Okay, so you do support President Obama's plan to tear it down? Absolutely. We're just
[26:28.400 --> 26:34.320]  checking. They finally took down the Confederate flag the other day, the racist symbol and it's
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.080]  big controversy. They finally took it down. So Obama has now suggested that we take down Mount
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.920]  Rushmore as we continue eradicating these racist symbols from America's past. Do you think it's
[26:45.920 --> 26:53.200]  time to destroy Mount Rushmore to move forward with the new world order? I don't know, you pay me,
[26:53.200 --> 26:58.960]  I'll do it, I need money. I'm not that f***ing mountain down. What do you think about President
[26:58.960 --> 27:04.880]  Obama deciding to reconstruct Mount Rushmore with some black people? I think that will probably be
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.480]  pretty cool. When are they gonna probably start that? As soon as possible they're getting the
[27:08.480 --> 27:14.080]  he just signed the executive order and the deconstruction is beginning immediately. That's
[27:14.080 --> 27:22.000]  cool. Where's that located at? In that where they found all the national treasure? President Obama
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.600]  is now working to remove Mount Rushmore to deconstruct the monument. Do you think that's
[27:27.600 --> 27:33.040]  the right decision? Should we continue with the deconstruction of Mount Rushmore to eradicate
[27:33.040 --> 27:40.960]  these symbols of racism that are spread throughout America? Good question. I don't know, I think
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.560]  that we're just kind of changing with the times and we don't really get a say in what happens.
[27:47.760 --> 27:51.440]  They're gonna take them down if they want to take them down, but as far as you and me are
[27:51.440 --> 27:57.840]  concerned it's not really... The point is really that Mount Rushmore is all white slave-owning men,
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.040]  the founding fathers of America. Sure. So Obama has decided to take down Mount Rushmore
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.040]  to continue eradicating these symbols of racism. Do you think that's the right decision?
[28:09.040 --> 28:18.400]  Uh, it's, uh, I don't know. I don't know, man. Maybe. Maybe.
[28:21.040 --> 28:27.840]  President Obama has issued an executive order to deconstruct Mount Rushmore as we continue
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.560]  to remove these racist monuments. You think that's the right... Way too smart to fall for this. He
[28:32.560 --> 28:41.920]  didn't issue it. Good for you. Good for you, bro. Yeah, that's good. Thank you. So that guy knew
[28:41.920 --> 28:48.000]  what Mark was doing. It's like, I'm not falling for this. And that's the whole point. We want to
[28:48.000 --> 28:54.240]  alert our fellow Americans that the general public is dumbed down or in a trance. And if you say for
[28:54.240 --> 29:00.400]  Obama, people will support it. Like foreign insurance companies with the most corrupt
[29:00.400 --> 29:07.280]  Republicans, fat cats, riding Obamacare to let them cut the quality of care, have computers control
[29:07.280 --> 29:14.160]  everything, massively increase prices, bankrupt the country, and increase in the last two years,
[29:14.160 --> 29:23.360]  global insurance company profits. This is Wall Street Journal, 47 percent. How do you get liberals
[29:23.360 --> 29:28.800]  who normally, you know, hate big rich capitalists to accept a corporate welfare deal like that?
[29:28.800 --> 29:35.520]  You tell them racists don't like it. Racists hate Obamacare. Alex Jones is racist. He hates Obamacare.
[29:35.520 --> 29:40.240]  And that's what they said over and over again. Other people are racist. And they said, okay,
[29:40.240 --> 29:47.440]  I support it. It's like, good, good idiot. You're a good moron now. The IBM Nazi computers can now
[29:47.440 --> 29:53.120]  kill the vets. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Breaking down Donald Trump. Alex Jones and
[29:53.120 --> 30:04.480]  the GCN radio network. Did you know that only six corporations control 90 percent of what millions
[30:04.480 --> 30:11.520]  of Americans see here and read every single day? It's the illusion of choice. Think about it. The
[30:11.520 --> 30:17.920]  mainstream media is owned by only a handful of mega corporations with vested interests. But on the
[30:17.920 --> 30:24.560]  other hand, the internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources. So you can research
[30:24.560 --> 30:31.600]  information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read
[30:31.600 --> 30:37.520]  in the mainstream media. Never questioning what you are being told. This gives you a false sense
[30:37.520 --> 30:42.880]  of reality. I mean, do you actually know what you think you know? Or have you been programmed to
[30:42.880 --> 30:49.040]  accept someone else's version of events? Think about it. This is Darren McBreen, and I want you
[30:49.040 --> 30:56.400]  to break the matrix at infowords.com and prisonplanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones show because
[30:56.400 --> 31:01.120]  there's a war on your mind. Hey, how you doing, Alex? Good, brother. I just recently started using
[31:01.120 --> 31:05.840]  your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[31:05.840 --> 31:09.600]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here. Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds
[31:09.600 --> 31:14.080]  our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality. Super male vitality
[31:14.080 --> 31:20.960]  was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[31:20.960 --> 31:26.320]  We did the super male and the super female vitality. Big changes, a lot of energy. We've gotten
[31:26.320 --> 31:31.840]  off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big amount of money there. Sourced from powerful
[31:31.840 --> 31:38.240]  organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[31:38.240 --> 31:42.720]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[31:42.720 --> 31:47.360]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[31:47.360 --> 31:52.720]  goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting, and I love it. Visit infowarsalife.com today
[31:52.720 --> 31:57.280]  to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[31:58.400 --> 32:02.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors
[32:02.400 --> 32:07.680]  on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website infowars.com because the
[32:07.680 --> 32:12.800]  companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable
[32:12.800 --> 32:18.880]  as they should be, so I refused. Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then,
[32:18.880 --> 32:25.440]  about six months ago, we get contacted by head down firearms, hdfirearms.com. Own and run by a
[32:25.440 --> 32:30.080]  bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their patriots, their listeners
[32:30.080 --> 32:34.560]  of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast. It's always about security, whether
[32:34.560 --> 32:39.920]  it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones. Go to their website, hdfirearms.com, buy right off
[32:39.920 --> 32:44.480]  their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice. You can pick it up at the
[32:44.480 --> 32:49.920]  gun show, you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store, whatever you do, get your head down
[32:49.920 --> 33:05.840]  firearm today. The spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[33:05.840 --> 33:15.760]  Ralliant Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[33:36.480 --> 33:42.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[33:45.280 --> 33:50.480]  Coming up when I start the next hour, I've got four or five examples just today of this,
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.800]  and I want to play some of these video clips and go over it, not to defend myself,
[33:55.520 --> 34:00.880]  but to just give you a textbook example of how psyops and disinformation work.
[34:00.880 --> 34:07.120]  Salon has come out with a new article and says that Alex Jones anti-PC
[34:07.120 --> 34:14.160]  rants could get gay people murdered and basically says that I'm calling for violence with no proof.
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.600]  Just like they said, Donald Trump says all Mexicans are lazy and don't work
[34:21.600 --> 34:24.960]  when that's not what he said. They just misrepresent.
[34:24.960 --> 34:32.800]  And then we've got another one here out of the New York Times.
[34:34.400 --> 34:41.440]  That's the New York Times today saying Alex Jones and Info Wars with no link, no proof,
[34:42.800 --> 34:47.520]  says that Jade Helm is a plan for the total eradication of local militias.
[34:47.520 --> 34:54.000]  I mean, never said that, and they don't show where we said that.
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.400]  And then there's another one here, and I'm going to go over these. It's video.
[35:00.960 --> 35:05.280]  Alex Jones' Marine Toys for Tots clip proves he's a moron,
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.360]  and it's not our website, it's not our YouTube, it's not my voice,
[35:12.320 --> 35:15.120]  purported to have me saying I hate the Marines and they're the enemy.
[35:15.120 --> 35:22.000]  And all over the country, I'm getting calls. Whatever the top local AM or FM stations are
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.400]  with the shock jock morning guys, they'll go on air and just say announcement, announcement.
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.120]  I don't know why Alex Jones wants cops dead. I also don't know why Alex Jones says that the
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.880]  kids at Sandy Hook deserve to die. And I don't know why Alex Jones says cocaine should be legal.
[35:38.880 --> 35:47.440]  But I tell you, he's a problem. They're being given scripts, folks. And it's because we know
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.480]  exactly what the globalists are up to. They've dissolved our borders. They're bringing us into
[35:52.480 --> 35:59.040]  world government. The Pope is calling for world government. We decipher the fraud. I mean,
[35:59.040 --> 36:04.960]  I give you hundreds of examples. Here's Bloomberg. They don't tell you, Patricia Clark,
[36:04.960 --> 36:10.080]  that Bloomberg is funding hundreds of millions of dollars with a nationwide initiative with a
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.760]  real estate group to pay off local governments to change zoning where they can raise property
[36:15.760 --> 36:22.000]  taxes two, three times and make most of your apartment cost or home cost be property tax.
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.960]  So they give you less so they can get more of your income. That's the admitted UN treaty
[36:28.960 --> 36:35.360]  agenda 21 plan. Now, do you think they like the fact that I came on the air 10 years ago,
[36:35.360 --> 36:39.440]  eight years ago, six years ago, five years ago? I mean, I've been covering this for 10 years.
[36:39.440 --> 36:44.240]  They're micro apartment plan. They're running the scam in Austin. They're running in San Francisco,
[36:44.240 --> 36:50.000]  New York. Now it's hitting Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City. Do you think they like just on that
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.120]  one subject that I know every one of their scams and will come out and then announce it and do
[36:55.120 --> 37:01.600]  video reports and show you where they admit it? No, they hate me. They're a group of crooks
[37:02.400 --> 37:06.640]  stealing our freedom, running every scam you can imagine, selling off our infrastructure
[37:06.640 --> 37:12.480]  pennies on the dollar. I know their game plan. I know their fraud. I'm straight shooting. They
[37:12.480 --> 37:21.120]  can't stand it. And they are now assassinating me big time. My name, who I am, ahead because
[37:21.120 --> 37:26.640]  they've got actuaries. They've got demographics. They've got graphs. They know we've hit the
[37:26.640 --> 37:31.360]  megazite guys. I mean, it is exponential. When I told the story last week about how I took my
[37:31.360 --> 37:39.120]  kids down to the hiking bike trail where there's a big luscious Creek, Barton Creek on the city
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.960]  owned Greenbelt, the population owned Greenbelt, just giant city parks, basically 40,000 acres
[37:44.960 --> 37:51.360]  of them to be precise. And there were like 30 something people standing around at the waterfall
[37:52.080 --> 37:58.000]  there in the creek. And all of them were pointing at me saying that's Alex Jones, all of them.
[37:58.720 --> 38:05.040]  And about 10 or 15 of them came over. Five years ago, maybe 10 of them would be staring at me and
[38:05.040 --> 38:13.200]  five would come over. I walked out of a restaurant a few nights ago and was walking to get an Uber,
[38:13.200 --> 38:21.120]  maybe 200 yards and every group of people that walked past me downtown, every group said that's
[38:21.120 --> 38:27.120]  Alex Jones. Now, I don't know how we're reaching this many people. We don't see the numbers on the
[38:27.120 --> 38:32.960]  website. We don't see that. I mean, we see huge numbers, but nothing like this. This show is
[38:32.960 --> 38:37.840]  loved all over the world now. Governments listen to it because I'm just a straight shooter. And we
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.040]  have a very accurate history. And I can't believe I'm still alive. Please pray for us. But they are
[38:43.040 --> 38:50.320]  assassinating us right now. I mean, they are just coming out and going, he hates black people.
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.120]  He hates Marines. He wants to kill cops and then showing no proof.
[38:57.360 --> 39:03.520]  Because they know that as the demographic shifts and as we continue, they know that our demographic
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.160]  is showing we're going to basically end up reaching most people. They want a precondition
[39:08.160 --> 39:13.840]  so that when you say, hey, listen to Alex Jones, tune into info wars.com or watch this video,
[39:13.840 --> 39:19.760]  they go, the guy that wants to kill Marines, the guy that made up Jade Helm was going to be
[39:19.760 --> 39:26.080]  eminent martial law, the guy that, that helped the Zarnab brothers bomb those people, the guy that's
[39:26.080 --> 39:32.800]  glad kids died at Sandy Hooker. I mean, are you telling me the guy? And that's what they're doing.
[39:32.800 --> 39:40.000]  And it is a great honor. I'm not freaked out by it really. I mean, I am at certain levels,
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.200]  but at the same time, this is what I asked for. This is what I prayed to God for many times,
[39:45.200 --> 39:51.040]  that if I was worthy that I'd be used as a vessel against those that would hurt innocence.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.600]  And I don't think I'm anybody special. I've just prayed for 20 years, at least intensely every
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.840]  night to be able to reach billions of people and to have the strength and the focus, which I
[40:06.560 --> 40:11.200]  don't think I even have yet, but I think I'm on trajectory to grow into a role if God allows
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.480]  me to live that long. And I don't have selfish prayers. It's whatever God's will is, I'm sure,
[40:16.480 --> 40:19.360]  and the great plan will turn out the way it's supposed to be.
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.960]  But I'm telling you, if you'll just say that prayer and ask God to use you to stand up against
[40:26.960 --> 40:35.120]  corruption, that the doors will open and you will get a chance at first on a small scale
[40:36.560 --> 40:42.000]  to fight corruption. At least in my case, it was like I was in training. Every trial, every
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.400]  tribulation, things now that I could easily deal with that I could barely handle 20 years ago,
[40:46.400 --> 40:52.320]  15 years ago, is just building in boot camp for the even greater stresses I'm going to have to go
[40:52.320 --> 40:57.920]  under. And I'm telling you, God will answer your prayers. God doesn't answer these phony prayers,
[40:57.920 --> 41:03.280]  these glitterbug preachers, these tax collector preachers have where they get up there and say,
[41:03.280 --> 41:06.720]  pray you're going to be rich and you're going to be rich, God will deliver it. Just give me all your
[41:06.720 --> 41:10.640]  money, a seed money, and then God will give it back to you, the widow's might. Yeah, that happens
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.360]  sometimes, but she wasn't given the widow's might back because she wanted to be rich.
[41:15.360 --> 41:24.880]  That was because she did it selflessly. And so God rarely in my view, in what I've seen,
[41:24.880 --> 41:28.960]  answers selfish prayers unless it's part of some larger plan. But if you really want to
[41:28.960 --> 41:32.720]  be thrown in against the New World Order, God's going to answer your prayer.
[41:34.960 --> 41:40.400]  So you want to suit up on this planet and really fight evil? There's plenty of targets now and
[41:40.400 --> 41:46.400]  stuff's getting really dark. And they know as the lights go out, people are going to be scrabbling
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.320]  and looking for answers. And there's not many people out there putting out the answers because
[41:50.320 --> 41:57.520]  I'll tell you why. The reality of the globalist assault is so overwhelming, so mega massive evil,
[41:58.160 --> 42:07.120]  so completely given over to death that the average person can't even basically see it
[42:07.120 --> 42:14.160]  because it's so alien to their nature, to their fundamental nature of being good people.
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.040]  Being failed, being sinful, but at the end of the day, their hearts pointed towards God
[42:21.040 --> 42:28.320]  and they just can't see the devil right next to him. So watch what you ask for though, because
[42:28.320 --> 42:36.160]  I'll tell you, all I'm offering is the truth to quote Morpheus. You take the blue pill,
[42:36.160 --> 42:42.240]  you go back, you wake up, this never happened. You take the red pill, you go to Wonderland,
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.000]  and I'll show you how deep the hole goes. But remember, wait, wait, you're about to eat the
[42:46.000 --> 42:56.640]  red pill? All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more. But it is freedom. It is freedom.
[42:58.640 --> 43:04.240]  But the greatest evidence of how right we are is not just the fact that what we keep talking about
[43:04.240 --> 43:09.840]  keeps unfolding, but the fact that the enemy is attacking us. So I'll get into that. But I mean,
[43:09.840 --> 43:13.280]  the new level of putting out fake videos and saying it's me,
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.960]  and again, people wouldn't do this in the past involved with mainstream media and government
[43:20.960 --> 43:27.120]  because they knew they could be sued and beaten. They don't care anymore, which shows us that there
[43:27.120 --> 43:34.320]  are no holds barred, pedal to the metal, fully committed, not backing down. This is a war.
[43:36.880 --> 43:43.040]  And you're under attack. You can be delusional all day. If you work at salon or raw story
[43:43.040 --> 43:44.880]  or at other White House outfits,
[43:49.280 --> 43:49.680]  you can
[43:49.680 --> 43:55.360]  feel like you're protected because you're in a cult. You're not.
[43:58.560 --> 44:02.960]  I mean, that's why White House run outlets call me a unstoppable monster.
[44:05.440 --> 44:06.640]  That was just up on screen.
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.600]  And that's why they say I'm dangerous, need to be shut up now. How liberal is that?
[44:13.600 --> 44:20.240]  Shut me up when I'm calling for human unity and to build a world for humans,
[44:20.800 --> 44:25.760]  not for the elite and their new machine kingdom when they're in the news five times a day. I mean,
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.960]  I see five or six articles a day in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, you name it,
[44:35.680 --> 44:42.160]  admitting that, oh, the future without humans has been designed and planned,
[44:42.160 --> 44:46.560]  and we're going to be phased out. Isn't it great? And yes, you're not going to be driving your car.
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.120]  And yes, you're going to be sterile. And yes, you'll get a license to have a kid.
[44:51.120 --> 44:54.640]  And people can argue, well, look at all these lazy dumb people. Let's do it.
[44:55.360 --> 44:56.880]  This is targeting everybody.
[45:00.080 --> 45:03.120]  Artificial intelligence to soon eliminate the family doctor.
[45:03.120 --> 45:08.800]  Tech post. I mean, it's here. How many times have you told, heard me tell you that the last decade?
[45:08.800 --> 45:14.320]  It's here. This is a plan, boys and girls. And if I hear one more yuppie go,
[45:14.960 --> 45:20.560]  but the computer will be nonbiased. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[45:21.760 --> 45:25.040]  That computer is programmed and parameters are set by people.
[45:26.160 --> 45:32.000]  It's like saying an electronic voting machine is nonbiased. No, it's not if it's got a hacker in it.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.600]  I look at how soft people are.
[45:41.920 --> 45:46.480]  I wish Mark Dyson's videos and our videos here in Austin were a distortion,
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.840]  but we can go out on the hiking bike trail and say the hydrogen monoxide is all over the place.
[45:53.440 --> 45:56.960]  And we just need to have it banned for the earth.
[45:57.680 --> 46:01.600]  And eight out of 10 people and they'll go, oh, yeah, I've got a degree in chemistry.
[46:01.600 --> 46:04.720]  Lee and Mackie is like, you're so smart in the guys. Yeah, I got a chemistry degree from
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.920]  Cornell. He's like, how you doing, baby? I'm pretty tough. Aren't I helpful?
[46:10.800 --> 46:15.040]  Yeah. We need to ban the hydrogen monoxide. It's water folks.
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.840]  You can go out and call, let's ban sodium chloride. Yeah, let's ban sodium chloride.
[46:21.840 --> 46:24.960]  And, you know, Bloomberg does want to restrict sodium chloride table salt.
[46:24.960 --> 46:34.000]  And they just are helpless. All they know how to do is act confident and cool.
[46:35.520 --> 46:39.680]  And it's great if you're smart and have built something and then you want to dress nice and act
[46:39.680 --> 46:45.520]  cool. But, you know, quite frankly, I don't even want to associate with people that want to know
[46:45.520 --> 46:51.760]  me or be my friend because I act cool on an elevator or I act cool at some dinner because
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.000]  all the really cool people I know are hiding out with a few of their friends, wanting to be left
[46:56.000 --> 47:03.120]  alone, wanting to stay away from everybody else. And I just cannot believe how stupid
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.720]  people are and how they think it's a shield against reality because it's not. When you got
[47:08.720 --> 47:19.600]  Planned Parenthood's director of their science operations sitting around eating fine meals,
[47:19.600 --> 47:27.360]  the director of medical services, sitting there at a, I mean, how archetypal, how incredible,
[47:27.360 --> 47:35.440]  gobbling food and drinking red wine, talking about gutting babies and how to keep them as whole
[47:35.440 --> 47:38.720]  parts to, you know, when they're chopping them up because, you know, they don't want to tell the
[47:38.720 --> 47:43.120]  woman, hey, we want to do a caesarean to keep the baby alive. In China, they do that. They'll grab
[47:43.120 --> 47:49.040]  women, take them, they're having their second or third kid, gut them, get the baby up and keep the
[47:49.040 --> 47:56.080]  baby alive until the harvesting is prepared and the people are lined up and flown to Japan. They
[47:56.080 --> 48:01.120]  don't really fly into China. You fly into Japan, then they gut them on the runway in a mobile
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.680]  execution van. If you're a new listener, I'm not joking. Just type in mobile execution van.
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.960]  They've got mobile rendering vans for the babies as well and they just drive up because they know
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.160]  a woman's pregnant. They wait till about eight and a half months. They come in, they grab her,
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.560]  they put her under, they unzipper, they get the baby, they feed it, they give it for me, look,
[48:18.560 --> 48:23.200]  get it ready, then call the different folks, blood test type. They'll fly in six, seven,
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.320]  eight people that want a liver, want kidneys, want a heart. You know, they rendered the corneas,
[48:28.320 --> 48:35.280]  the blood, everything and then they fly. You fly into Tokyo and then a jet lands one hour
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.600]  after the baby's been gutted and you're in surgery two hours later.
[48:41.600 --> 48:47.840]  I mean, does anybody feel safe with that going on? You think your life matters? See,
[48:47.840 --> 48:51.440]  if you don't stand up for those kids, nobody's going to stand up for you.
[48:53.840 --> 48:56.720]  I don't have to worry. All you people that serve evil will be judged.
[48:57.440 --> 49:01.120]  And what's sick about you is most of you are unconscious and just think you make a joke
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.040]  about everything and giggle about it and drink some more red wine because you're a trendy.
[49:05.040 --> 49:11.840]  I mean, you support Caitlyn Jenner. That's what's moral. And what did Caitlyn say? Whoopty-doo,
[49:11.840 --> 49:19.680]  a guy has makeup and a wig on like I care. But because you've got that token power
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.240]  and you watch the different shows and the sitcoms and everything's cutesy and funny,
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.120]  that's just the cloaking device for this devilish takeover. You think you're protected.
[49:32.560 --> 49:35.680]  I'm going to go to break and come back with a Donald Trump info and give you my take on that.
[49:35.680 --> 49:39.440]  And there's so much news and we got two big guests coming on. I'll tell you about that coming up.
[49:39.440 --> 49:45.040]  Briefly, we are going to sell out a super male vitality and super female vitality within the
[49:45.040 --> 49:51.040]  next week. We should have some in two to four weeks. Super high quality MSNBC makes jokes
[49:51.040 --> 49:56.400]  about it. It's just, I don't know, what is it, 12 or so super powered known herbs that help get
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.840]  your glands going and block estrogen, mimickers and nature knows best. And it's just really
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.960]  amazing and high quality. It helps fund our operation. Survival Shield X2 is also selling
[50:06.960 --> 50:10.960]  out. Don't know when we'll get more of that super high quality, the good halogen your body needs.
[50:10.960 --> 50:14.960]  So they make big jokes about that. That's selling out. We've got a lot of other products like the
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.040]  prostaguard is back in after being sold out for two and a half months. The highest quality
[50:19.760 --> 50:26.480]  prostate health formula out there with high dosages of the different compounds that are
[50:26.480 --> 50:31.600]  admitted to be good for your prostate. Just massively things like the salt,
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.960]  palmetto, berry powder and lycopene. That's just two of the 10 ingredients that are in there that all work
[50:36.960 --> 50:47.920]  synergistically together in FullWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139. And basically I'm here challenging
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.800]  the gladiators in the ring under full attack. And if you fund us, I'll gear up even more and
[50:52.800 --> 50:59.760]  head them even harder. I'm going 100% and suggest support us. So I asked my buddy Mark,
[50:59.760 --> 51:05.360]  where does the name ghost gun come from? You know, the ghost AR1580% rifle gets ghost. What's
[51:05.360 --> 51:10.240]  a ghost gun? He says, duh, they killed ghosts. I said, really? Ghosts? He said, yeah. As a matter
[51:10.240 --> 51:15.840]  of fact, they're guaranteed to kill ghosts, Sasquatch, space aliens and any other paranormal
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.720]  force that might come your way. So they just appropriately named them ghost guns. And I said,
[51:20.720 --> 51:24.800]  okay, that's a big problem in my neighborhood. So where do I get one? He said guns80.com. I said,
[51:24.800 --> 51:33.920]  where? Guns80.com. Okay, then I'm headed to guns80.com. We are a survival company. We manufacture

[54:05.280 --> 54:15.760]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[54:16.640 --> 54:22.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[54:27.600 --> 54:29.280]  You see, they've got to discredit us.
[54:29.280 --> 54:38.960]  Big time because we told you world government was coming. We told you it was three mega regions.
[54:38.960 --> 54:43.440]  We told you they would take over the infrastructure. We told you they would limit resources.
[54:44.320 --> 54:48.320]  We told you they would have driverless cars and what their plan was and now it's all happening.
[54:48.880 --> 54:54.640]  So what do they do when infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and my reporters and writers and myself
[54:54.640 --> 55:01.760]  have been chronicling this for 20 years and others before us. Well, they just come out and
[55:01.760 --> 55:05.280]  they misrepresent what we're saying and what we're doing and they've done the same thing
[55:05.280 --> 55:12.400]  with Donald Trump. Now this weekend and then throughout the week I watched hours of Donald
[55:12.400 --> 55:18.640]  Trump videos on CNN, NBC, Fox News, the lengthy 20-30 minute interviews he does.
[55:18.640 --> 55:25.600]  And I went back and did research on Donald Trump. He has supported assault weapons bans.
[55:26.480 --> 55:29.520]  He has supported Democrats more than Republicans in the past.
[55:32.400 --> 55:36.800]  He does own casinos and I'm not judging him. I'm a libertarian. You can do that. I don't
[55:36.800 --> 55:41.440]  think it should be illegal, but I have a right to say I think it's degenerate for most people.
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.640]  I'm not a gambler. So, you know, I mean, I've been to Vegas for video shoots before and
[55:46.640 --> 55:50.160]  gone to a roulette wheel, played some back blackjack, won money, lost money, but
[55:50.720 --> 55:56.560]  watching the people there totally enamored in a cult I thought was sick. And knowing that I was
[55:56.560 --> 56:02.320]  being chumped, it's kind of like I smoked marijuana a couple times a year to actually see what the
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.680]  latest stuff does, not because I like it, so I can report on it. Well, the five or six times I've
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.960]  gambled was so I could experience it. True experimentation. And I can tell you I don't
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.680]  like marijuana and I don't like gambling. That doesn't mean you should be thrown in jail for
[56:17.680 --> 56:24.560]  marijuana. It doesn't mean you should be stopped from gambling. But I'm kind of digressing here.
[56:24.560 --> 56:31.760]  I've done deep research into Trump and I think he is a self-made person. I think he's very articulate,
[56:31.760 --> 56:38.480]  very charismatic, very smart. I agree with about 95% of what he has to say. When he says bomb the
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.040]  oil fields, that's common sense. I said that a year and a half ago when they first took over,
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.880]  I said blow up the oil fields, fix them later. But our government wants them to have those oil
[56:46.880 --> 56:56.080]  fields. It's a proxy army of Saudi Arabia. So see if Trump went further like Rand Paul and said that,
[56:56.880 --> 57:02.320]  then I would really support him. Rand Paul is better, but Rand Paul should be turning up the
[57:02.320 --> 57:09.600]  heat and being a little more like Trump. He should be quite frankly as radical as Trump because
[57:09.600 --> 57:13.840]  Trump's not being radical. And Gary Johnson, I want to get back on the show, former New Mexico
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.560]  governor has probably been in studio five, six times, probably been on 15 times. And I really
[57:18.560 --> 57:23.360]  disagree with his political points. He's trying to get saying that Trump is catering to racists.
[57:23.360 --> 57:29.760]  In fact, we'll put the actual quote on screen because I'm here it is. Donald Trump is appealing
[57:29.760 --> 57:34.080]  to racist voters says former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson. I don't want to have anything to do
[57:34.080 --> 57:40.000]  with it says Johnson. It's embarrassing to me. And you got Jeb Bush, everybody else saying the
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.040]  same thing embarrassing to say the illegal aliens have a lot of hardcore criminals amongst them.
[57:45.600 --> 57:50.560]  And they're committing crimes and Mexico is dumping its criminals on us. That's what Cuba did.
[57:52.160 --> 57:58.720]  That's what areas of Eastern Europe. It's a fact. And again, it's this attack on reality. So I'll
[57:58.720 --> 58:04.080]  say this, I'm going to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt because he hasn't backed off and he
[58:04.080 --> 58:08.720]  has lost some money and lost some TV shows over this. And he does say he doesn't care about the
[58:08.720 --> 58:14.560]  money. Now he doesn't want to lose this country. And it's good to see an old fashioned, a patriotic
[58:14.560 --> 58:20.320]  Yankee like Donald Trump and a guy like that could unify this country. The problem is,
[58:20.960 --> 58:24.240]  I don't trust him as far as I could throw him, but he's got to be given the benefit of the doubt
[58:24.240 --> 58:31.440]  because he's saying what the other Republicans won't. So I'm going to stop attacking Donald Trump.
[58:32.080 --> 58:37.760]  I've warned, but that said, he's better than anything else we see right now. So what he's
[58:37.760 --> 58:41.280]  saying has to be supported and defended. Thank you for listening. It's more important than the man.
[58:41.280 --> 58:46.480]  It's the idea. But I think he's going to betray us. That's what my gut tells me. And Spidey's never wrong.
[58:48.720 --> 58:53.440]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been
[58:53.440 --> 58:58.240]  told not to drink the water. Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency. Did you know
[58:58.240 --> 59:04.800]  that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day? If
[59:04.800 --> 59:10.160]  there's a water emergency, will you be prepared? Panicked residents forming long lines throughout
[59:10.160 --> 59:15.600]  the day. We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[59:15.600 --> 59:21.280]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water,
[59:21.280 --> 59:26.480]  water which will not be available at your local grocery store. There's a mad dash on right now

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:21.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.040]  All right, I want to finish up with the Donald Trump analysis. Then we're going to come back on
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.920]  the latest on Jade Helm. Is that kicked off yesterday and the hit pieces in the news?
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.240]  Then we're going to get into the latest on Planned Parenthood,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.880]  the new joint strike fighter that's cost $400 billion and is already 15 years old.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.200]  Total boondoggle. That is coming up.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:58.000]  And so much more. New immigration wave coming. Census Bureau predicts 1.24 million more immigrants
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:06.240]  will enter the U.S. in 2015 and get everything for free. But I got to hand it to Latin American
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.080]  immigrants. They get free stuff and go get a job on top of it. So then you could actually live a
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:16.000]  pretty good life. Oh boy, that's what Walmart for about three years recommends their employees.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.760]  Oh, we pay you below the poverty line so you can get food stamps and assistance,
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.520]  which is a subsidy to Walmart. But folks don't get when they go to Walmart why all the other
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:34.640]  jobs go away. And it's because it's a leveraged takeover. But I guess
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.600]  all the Chinese slave goods were good while they lasted, weren't they?
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:53.520]  So I think former New Mexico governor has come out with, we have a term in Texas, I think other
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:02:01.200]  places, chicken SH bleep tea. I'm sorry that to be a little, little profane and not use the
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.640]  king's English there. But that's why you have those words. Sometimes they're descriptive.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.920]  Donald Trump is appealing to racist voters as former New Mexico governor, Gary Johnson.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:21.440]  What a load of manure. And here's that clip. He is appealing to a segment that I'll just label
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.320]  racist and, and it exists and it's out there. And you know what, I don't want to have anything to
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.400]  do with it. I don't want to have anything to do with it. It embarrasses, it embarrasses me.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:39.440]  And like I say, I think that the electorate will paint the entire Republican Party with
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.800]  with a broad brush as a result of Trump and it won't be a positive. And because he's deported
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.240]  the Mexicans, they'll have to paint the round. He employs tens of thousands of people and he's
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.920]  in the service industry. How many of those are immigrants? Let's stop right there. That you
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.560]  know, they sell this idea and I don't dislike Johnson. I like a lot of his ideas, but he is
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.240]  the type of libertarian that just says, get rid of all the borders. Hey,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.160]  like you've been in the studio, Johnson, you can't do it when they can have babies for free
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.680]  and get welfare. We're going bankrupt. There's seven billion, basically third world people.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.600]  The country is already in trouble and the statistics are there that of the illegal
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.440]  aliens from all over the world, whether they're from Russia, Germany or Mexico,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.560]  that a lot of criminals come here and change their names and then commit crimes. I mean,
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:39.040]  that's a 101. We are the dumping ground for criminals. I mean, next he'll say Australia
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.520]  wasn't colonized as a penal colony. We're like a penal colony of Latin America now.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:53.840]  And let's go to the other clip that I was mentioning where Donald Trump says it like it is
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.360]  and says bomb ISIS oil fields. He said this a week ago and they go, how preposterous!
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.840]  Next he's going to say you need a scuba tank at 100 feet underwater that you're not a fish.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:10.160]  Here's the clip. The situation with ISIS has to be dealt firmly and strongly.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.360]  When you have people being beheaded, I would love not to be over there. That's not our fight.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.880]  That's other people's fight. He was against Iraq war. That's whatever you want to call it.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.800]  I would do things that would be so tough that I don't even know if they'd be around to come to
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.280]  the table. What sort of things though? I would take away their wealth. I would take away the oil.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.280]  But wouldn't you be destroying the wealth of Iraq? No, no. There is no Iraq. There is no Iraq.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.760]  Their leaders are correct. Excuse me. There are no Iraqis. They've broken up into so many
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.800]  different factions. You don't think bombing Iraqi oil fields, which are now the control of ISIS,
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.840]  but bombing Iraqi oil fields is going to anger huge numbers of people. I would bomb the hell
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.200]  out of those oil fields. I wouldn't send many troops because you won't need them by the time.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.440]  That's right. The troops aren't allowed to target anything.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.960]  Russian parliament member Yagivne Fedorov claims that Russian oligarchs are in negotiations
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.440]  with top American corporations and the White House to foment an astroturf revolution that will
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.840]  lead to the ouster of President Vladimir Putin and the collapse of the Russian Federation within two
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.000]  years. They are conducting a negotiation process with the Russian elites for the extradition of
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.720]  Putin. We know the objective is the destruction of the Russian Federation. After August through
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.160]  the winter, I think by the drop of living standards, they will be able to bring out
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.840]  several hundred thousand people into the streets simply because with the help of the government,
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.280]  they will severely crash people's living standards. And this would be especially felt
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.240]  after winter. Fedorov added that spring 2016 could be the time period in which the coup is
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.440]  initiated. He also identified John F. Teff, the United States ambassador to Russia as being the
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.160]  figurehead behind the conspiracy. Also, Russian hackers have released what looks to be a staged
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:51.360]  ISIS beheading video that the hackers claim they got off a John McCain staffer while he was in
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:56.240]  the country. To read more about this, go to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com. Rob do reporting.

[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.480]  jesse's take on because he's in the same boat where they assassinate your character before they kill
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:43.040]  you salon says alex jones anti-pc rand's could get gay people murdered and then they don't show
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.720]  where i said anything against gay people i'm a libertarian i just said why is it the new national
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:55.280]  obsession i mean you know what did kaitlyn jenner do it just gets a little weird that that's all you
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.600]  ever hear it's just it's just i don't think our national mascot thought it was a bald eagle not a
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.240]  guy in a dress i mean i don't care it's just like i mean force fed this stuff so then they say i'm
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.480]  going to have gay people murdered and they don't show proof on another one top secret writer says
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:17.520]  alex jones marine toys for tots clip proves he's a moron and it says basically our reporters out
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.480]  there not a reporter it's a guy saying i respect the marines this is propaganda recruit kids well
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.960]  that's not even us and that my voiceover then talks bad about the marines and says they're the enemy
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:35.360]  and the video doesn't even say that and it's not me on the video and there is no voiceover
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.680]  here's another one there's five of these this is the new york times a report on info wars website
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.680]  operated by alex jones libertarian leaning talk show host from texas suggested the name jade helm
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.040]  was an acronym for homeland eradication of local militias and then it goes on to say that we say
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.400]  imminent martial laws coming and that the troops are going to kill people this is dangerous they
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.200]  don't link to us saying this we never said this we said it's ongoing conditioning for a police state
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.680]  the militaries and stars and stripes everywhere admitting their training for domestic operations
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.640]  i mean jessey ventura's tv show covered this three years ago and got banned the show on the
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:21.200]  threat fusion centers and fema which is now admitted army dot mill admits they prepared quote
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:28.160]  reeducation camps that's a paul watson article and then there's two more stories today where they say
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:36.400]  i did something and show no proof and used to this happen once a month it's now every day
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.280]  and i don't even watch a lot of mainstream tv but anytime they mentioned jessey ventura i've
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.080]  been on the elliptical like two weeks ago just randomly yeah jessey ventura the guy that's you
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:53.040]  know suing widows and the guy that's glad troops are dead is is appealing and then actually they're
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.480]  appealing i mean here's what i'm saying i've been doing this 20 years jessey ventura has been a
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.120]  talk show host mayor governor for longer than that and a tv entertainer movie star longer
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:10.960]  i've never seen levels of lying at this level and whether it's ron paul or rand paul or jessey
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.960]  ventura alex jones and even though jessey ventura and rand paul are different on some issues when the
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:24.080]  enemy media is assassinating someone you better believe they're good now they're not really
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.280]  assassinating trump in my view they're just building him up but what he said is true a lot
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.960]  of criminals do come over here a lot of criminals run from the us to mexico but the point is they're
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.160]  giving him attention not just assassinating and then shutting up they're building him up for
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.200]  some other reason we'll get venturas take on that as well and and get the latest on his appeal were
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:55.600]  33 media giants you know news core uh the new york times time warner are suing him in court to overturn
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:03.680]  his libel defamation uh unjust enrichment that didn't affect chris kyle or his wife all lies
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.520]  hundreds of millions have been made they've made tens of millions ventura filed suit after uh this
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.480]  happened they wouldn't back off before kyle was killed in dallas tragically and i see this meme
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:22.240]  he's the guy that sued a widow no he didn't he sued chris kyle chris kyle died but see they want to
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:28.240]  kill jessey ventura's name and have him lay down and crawl into a political grave well you know what
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:32.800]  i'm not crawling to grave either but governor we're in the same boat here why do you think they're
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.800]  intensifying these lies so bad that i quote say marines are the enemy uh they've got talk show hosts
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.160]  saying all over the country locally so i know it's a talking point that i want cops dead when i'm
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.200]  the opposite and they know cops listen to this show and i'm trying to stop a race war civil war
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.760]  i mean why do you think they're doing this so intensely right now well obviously you and i
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:04.000]  have had an effect on them otherwise they'd ignore us alex if we weren't dangerous to them they would
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.200]  ignore us but clearly we present a danger to whatever their agenda is or whatever they're
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:19.360]  trying to accomplish you and i are flies in the ointment and so they they will choose different
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:25.680]  methods of dealing with us uh whatever that method may be i mean i you know i'm listening to what
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.120]  you're talking about in the attack you're getting now and i fully have all the sympathy in the world
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.040]  for you because i've been there done that then for three and a half years in my court case over the
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:44.080]  american sniper book which the chapter written about me was a complete fabricated lie and we
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:51.360]  proved it in court to a jury we proved it to a federal judge and uh apparently the media
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:58.800]  uh doesn't they want to be able to libel or slander anybody and make it a business that
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:04.960]  they'll see they're in the entertainment business also too and so they want to be able to make profits
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.760]  and then yeah they'll pay a little off for slander but they'll make 10 times more and they don't want
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:19.040]  this unjust enrichment which has been the law since 1960 they want it changed so that they can
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.760]  profit and the person hurt cannot get any of those profits from them and that'll make it a business
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:32.560]  you know it's much like when Howard Stern was on regular radio and he would get fined
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:39.680]  ten thousand dollars by the FCC well the station was happy to pay it because in return Howard would
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:46.640]  make them a hundred thousand so it would be and what business wouldn't pay out ten to get ninety
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.560]  nobody wouldn't do that and that's what the media is trying to do in overthrowing my case
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:59.840]  they want to make it so that you if you are slandered will never get enough money to make it
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:07.440]  worthwhile to go to court because court is not it's unbelievably expensive it's unbelievably
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:15.440]  drawn out i mean my case should have been done with two years ago oh listen i mean i can't imagine
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.360]  what you've gone through and again it's not about us it's about the truth this affects everybody but
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:27.040]  it's a microcosm i have a pretty good friend who barely knew chris call but i'm shooting with him a
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:36.320]  few times here in texas and just over my relationship with you and defending you he's like you know what
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:44.000]  alex i just really don't want to hang out anymore and let's still be friends but not friends i mean
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.160]  that's cult like where people buy into a lie and then buy into the fact uh that you either choose
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:58.800]  one side or the other when a jury found very hard to prove libel as you know and slander and you
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.960]  proved it i mean you know chris kyle lie it was it was obvious i mean we had photographs of me out
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:12.560]  there i had no marks on me we had eyewitnesses that i sat with all night long who were there before i
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:22.560]  got there and i left before they left and nothing happened i went to a big uh uh graduation next
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:29.600]  day i had no marks on me i had nothing to end and the whole thing what was interesting in the case
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:37.120]  get this how they they they keep the truth out i wasn't allowed to say that i'm on way for it
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.920]  blood thinners all i could say was i i was on blood thinning medication i was not allowed
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:50.640]  to say what it was but you do not drink how many how long has it been since you had a drink uh since
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:58.800]  2002 2002 2003 right around in there would be the last time that's when they put me on blood
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:05.120]  thinners for life and you cannot drink alcohol and take the medication because it throws your
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:11.200]  levels off and see they didn't know i was on blood thinners but yet i wasn't allowed to say in court
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.840]  what type of medication i was on but i have sat many times with you in a restaurant late at night
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:23.280]  after a shoot or whatever on an airplane and you're drinking water and i'm and i'm having a beer i mean
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:29.440]  you just you do not drink i mean i've witnessed it so not at all and get this kyle's budget that
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:37.360]  they were they had a thousand bucks to spend in that bar that night on booze a thousand dollars
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.840]  now that buys a lot of booze especially when you're getting a navy seal prices
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:49.280]  sure you know you're in mcpese which is the navy seal bar and you're buying pigs and all that
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:55.040]  they're giving discounts on it there because you're the team guys so they you know these guys were
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:01.920]  all drunk they were they were ridiculously drunk and and it showed up in the testimony in court
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:08.720]  it got embarrassing for me as as a former navy seal to sit there and watch these guys try to
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:16.240]  cover for their body and and and it was so blatantly obvious not not one witness testified
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:22.400]  they heard me say anything derogatory and not one witness testified that they saw me get hit
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.760]  so in essence none of them should have even been allowed to testify but they were allowed to
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.800]  because they were all hearsay they didn't see anything or hear anything they had nothing to
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.640]  testify to but they still got up on the stand and attempted because he was their buddy and their
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.640]  stand and i you know if you if you'll die for someone you'll certainly you know lie for them
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.760]  absolutely when we come back i want to shift gears and and and get into the current state of the

[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.400]  us naval recruiting building a police officer was shot just last hour at a navy recruitment
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:41.280]  building in chattanooga tennessee nbc affiliate wrcb reported it was not clear whether the gunman
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.760]  was on the loose and see in the future they'll just say that i'm happy that happened i'm not
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.080]  happy that happened but they would just say why is alex jones happy that's an example of media
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.920]  lying that we're seeing happening the us navy confirmed a shooting at one of its buildings
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:25:00.640]  and said officers including atf agents were investigating the scene uh they called a horrific
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:07.360]  incident but had no immediate details so we'll track that as it unfolds that's from the associated
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:16.160]  press and now now two this just broke it's up on drudge we'll get it on info wars dot com
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.360]  two military facilities attacked in tennessee at least two military facilities in tennessee were
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.120]  attacked in shootings thursday that sounds like ices folks including one of the navy recruitment
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:32.560]  building officials said chattanooga mayor andy berks said at the news conference that it was a
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.520]  very terrible situation police have set up a command post us navy said in a tweet that there
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:43.840]  was a shooting at navy recruitment building uh in chattanooga law enforcement officials told
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:49.040]  recruiters at a facility seven miles away that old lee highway had also been attacked by a shooter
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:54.800]  in a car could have been the same person then it might not be terrorism and we will continue to
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:00.000]  track this as it unfolds here at info wars dot com this is a short segment long segment coming up
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.960]  i want people to be able to call in and talk to jesse ventura the toll free number is 800
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:12.160]  two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one specific questions
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.680]  or comments for jesse ventura but in the time we have you just said something that made a lot of
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:23.760]  sense about the mexico's situation during the break uh and uh some of the freeloading that is
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.760]  going on i don't think it's racist to say there's freeloading going on uh but at the same time it
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:35.120]  certainly does get inflamed by the media so elaborate on where you stand on the donald trump
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.320]  situation well first of all you know if mexicans come up here illegals and get on our welfare
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:49.680]  system if indeed they do that then blame the people who created a system that allows that to happen
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:56.640]  which is your democrats and republicans if they're if they are able to do that and i don't know if
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.640]  they are or not but if they're able to do that blame the system that allows it to happen instead
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.800]  of blaming the poor person second of all i get irritated because i'm off the grid down there i
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:15.760]  live 900 miles in mexico and whenever somebody with the statue of donald trump makes us statements
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:23.440]  like he has believe me we as americans down there feel the repercussions of that all of a sudden
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:31.280]  mexican people stare at us all of a sudden you know uh hassles start happening maybe the
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:39.520]  federales pull you over more whatever it might be but it does nobody any good because what donald
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:46.160]  trump is saying does nothing but anger mexican people because you can't paint them in a broad
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:52.880]  brush certainly there's criminals in mexico just like there are criminals here we ought to talk about
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.640]  the fact we have more people in jail than any other country in the world sure so therefore don't we
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.560]  have the most criminals well jesse i mean i i agree with your point that we shouldn't blame the tsa
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.000]  we should blame our congress for doing it and then congress sits around criticizing the tsa when
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.720]  they shut it up and control it so so i totally agree with you i get your point that said i don't
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.440]  trust donald trump because he supported assault weapons bans gave money to hillary clinton but i've
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:25.040]  actually watched his full speeches and he said they're not sending they're good people that have
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:30.160]  money in many cases that are illegals he says a lot of more criminals fleeing justice than the media
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.520]  said donald trump says mexicans are crooks so i think some of that is the media spinning things
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.800]  to make it worse well that may be true too because you know as we both know the media is in the
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.760]  entertainment business and the more entertainment spin they can throw on anything sells copy you
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.600]  know look at the trash they give us on tv and make us focus on things that are completely irrelevant
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:58.080]  i agree but just real quick you personally have seen a backlash in the last month and a half from
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:06.000]  this trump thing have i well have i personally to me yes no other than people know that i know
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.480]  donald and they'll ask me and i just say look i don't answer for donald but i think what he's
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:17.920]  saying is utterly preposterous and stupid i said that you know that to state 20 states and i said
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.280]  i don't think i care to you know to have a president that would say things like that about
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:31.440]  people of another country you know that's not very good diplomacy in my opinion now i hear your point
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:37.600]  overall the problem is you're in a nice area of the bahá a lot of mexico has collapsed and so that
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:44.160]  is a larger problem i i wish mexico well but um we'll be right back with jessey ventura your phone

[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:16.640]  what we exposed months ago is mastering the human domain in military terminology the human domain

[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:05.920]  nazi fascists are running around right in front of us and being worshiped by tabloid television
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:14.320]  that's coming up uh briefly ladies and gentlemen i wanted to give you a third party review we have

[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:36.000]  reviews from tennessee he says i've been taking x2 that's pure reolt nason iodine for two weeks i
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.040]  normally wake up not wanting to hear my alarm clock now i get up 15 minutes before it goes off
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:47.040]  and get aggravated when my alarm clock for going off when i'm in the shower my wife is more full of
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.640]  life i have seen a big difference in her attitude towards projects around the house two thumbs up
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:57.280]  we will definitely be trying other products i normally use supplements and have lately stopped
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:02.320]  all my workout supplements to try the info wars life product line exclusively no other brand will
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:08.880]  be used will be making more reviews as i progress bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:16.800]  we're linked to major highly respected third party review sites you can go read it for yourself
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:24.080]  no one went out and found drilled from the earth pure iodine you take the stuff that's produced
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:30.560]  our labs here in the us and it turns into gas on top of a stove you put it on 100 degree stove top
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:37.520]  it turns into purple gas i mean that's how pure it is and it your body's full of fluoride and
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.640]  bromine and bromide that fill the glands make you sluggish you see thyroid problems off the chart
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:49.840]  the warning here is i got i felt like crap two weeks into it for about a week not not too bad it
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.840]  felt like i was detoxing that's why i've lost so much weight i'm still got another 20 pounds to
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:59.280]  lose but i've lost 60 plus pounds the last few years and it's been in force health.com products
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.080]  beyond tangy tangerine it's been some of the other stuff but super male vitality survival
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:10.880]  shield it's all natural the super male vitality is not testosterone mimicers it just goes in and
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.760]  gets your glands to start producing like you're supposed to men have sperm counts down almost
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.800]  90% what they were in the 50s testosterone for a 40 year old man on average look it up
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.600]  is about half what it used to be so you don't need to take testosterone in my view
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.640]  personal view you seem to get your own body producing what you're supposed to have and
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:36.560]  that's what i've done and it's dramatic we're going to sell out of x2 the next week we're going to
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.640]  sell out of super male the next week and it'll be a while till we have x2 only about a month or so
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.080]  or less till we have super male and super female but those are selling out uh prostagard but as a
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.640]  saw palm meadow and the lycopene and eight other ingredients that was sold out for two and a half

[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:39.040]  only drink water and work out yeah you call it the drink water diet tell us about that all right no
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:45.440]  the only liquids i consume is water it's a simple thing it's back in the old days of bodybuilding
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.640]  back when the early days they would always tell you if you're gonna get your calories get your
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:58.320]  calories from what you eat not from what you drink and if you simply drink water it eliminates so
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.960]  many calories to lose weight that's that's the only thing i've done when you remarked on how
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:09.040]  thin and good and i worked out hard you know you got to exercise so you train hard i eat
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.560]  anything heck the other night you know i'll eat pizza i'll eat anything but if you simply drink water
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.680]  that's all that that'll be enough i think this is the skinniest i've ever seen you even when you
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:25.200]  were i'm the weight i'm the weight i was when i got out of the united states navy right now i'm down
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:35.600]  to 230 wow and you're a big guy well six four so you know i'm the weight i was when i got out when
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.960]  i got out uh on the united states navy because i've been pumping iron for about two years and i'd
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:47.200]  bulked up from 212 when i got out of buds and i probably put on another 18 pounds pumping iron
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.920]  and getting older you know i was then 22 and a half years old i was filling out but enough of that
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.840]  uh but first of all i want to thank if i can for a moment the people that have sent in to my post
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:04.640]  office box uh the letters have been phenomenal even if the what's touching me more than the
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:11.680]  finance the financial help is the little notes and things that people send with it uh it's given
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:18.240]  me the will and the desire to keep the fight going it's giving me that to know that there are the
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:24.320]  people out there the silent majority is out there and it's giving me the will to continue the fight
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:30.720]  and so i want to thank everybody on behalf of me and my family for that and i will forever be
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:38.400]  embedded as such but uh going to iran let me just state this alex if i was an iranian i wouldn't
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:46.240]  like us either well write down your view on the iran situation well look at let's look at iran
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:53.440]  way back they had an elected president elected by their people and the only thing you wanted to do
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:59.280]  was nationalize the oil well that's something you don't do talk to the late hugo chavez well
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.400]  you can't anymore but if you're if you're an elected president in the foreign country and you
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:10.160]  decide to nationalize your oil you will incur the wrath of the united states government and
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:17.520]  military probably and that's what happened in iran they had an elected president we led a coup
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:23.760]  d'etat with the cia overthrew the elected president and put in the shaw who was a brutal
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:31.840]  dictator operation ajax 53 they did it with a uh false flag operation whatever but the point is
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:38.960]  we overturned an elected president in that country and put in a dictator who was one of our puppets
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:46.560]  and that went on for 20 some years until i ran finally overthrew the shaw and you got what you
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:53.360]  got today in there but the point is if i were an iranian i wouldn't like us either imagine in the
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.800]  united states it seems to me we did that to britain and called the revolutionary war didn't we
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:05.520]  well i'll tell you a foreign country in our country dictating to us what would happen
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:12.080]  and well imagine if that happened today i agree with you for that of course not well let me give
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.040]  folks the rest of the story on iran anybody can look this up it's truly sick then the shaw started
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.920]  wanting to build reactors even though he's a bad guy and had the savoc and all those guys torturing
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.640]  people then he started wanting to build his country up so they basically took him out he
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:34.160]  died of cancer in two weeks uh they're in england and then magically they fly in the iotolo-humani
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:39.920]  out of paris and let him get in and then do a secret deal with the cia to give him weapons the
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:46.960]  true sickening thing is our criminal government helped put radical islamists in as a way to curse
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:54.000]  iran with with a nasty political regime just like we're putting isis and al qaeda in control of libya
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.480]  syria and in other areas what is your view on how nakedly they're openly funding isis and then
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:06.640]  claiming they're fighting them well i'll tell you how i feel about it all in this next presidential
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:14.400]  election if i'm not involved in it i'm normally not a one-issue person alex normally i look at the
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:22.640]  big picture and i make a decision that way but in this 2016 election i will only support candidate
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:28.800]  or will vote for a candidate who will get us militarily completely out of the middle east
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.680]  let the middle east do under the middle east whatever they want to do under themselves
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:40.320]  we're not going to be party to it anymore we're getting the hell out like ronald reagan got the
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.000]  hell out of lebanon when our marines were hit with the with the truck bomb over there he didn't go to
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.920]  war he got the hell out of there and uh that's what i uh that's who i'm going to vote for who
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:57.360]  and right now there's only two candidates that i know of that are espousing that position and
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:04.320]  that's rand paul and bernie sanders that's right and the media is really lined up against rand paul
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.600]  who was the leader until about a month ago well they're lined up against bernie too and bernie's
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:16.800]  drawn 12 000 15 000 people everywhere he goes well he says a lot of great stuff against the big
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:22.240]  banks and the bailouts the problem is socialism doesn't work i don't i don't like it well that's
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:28.880]  true alex and and you can take that but you gotta remember this neither does pure capitalism you
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:34.960]  have to have a balance of both we've been able to see that you see the pure socialism don't work
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.120]  the soviet union they fell apart you also see the pure capitalism don't unabated don't work
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  2008 right here in our own country what you've got to have alex is a balance of both
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.840]  well i mean i understand if you're super wealthy you can take care of poor people and stuff and
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:47:00.000]  that's fine that's the welfare clause but this is corporate welfare was the 2008 bailout i don't
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.280]  think that was capitalism so see how they've escaped capitalism running amok with their hand
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:12.480]  comes off they took away all the regulations that ran wall street and they let pure wall street
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:19.680]  capitalists do whatever the hell they agree doing and look at the result of it it bankrupt our
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:25.920]  country damn near i agree i want to go to some calls blind and none of them went to jail none of them
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:31.360]  and eric holder's gone to work at the same law firm that legalizes it all it's truly amazing
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:35.520]  let's go ahead and go to caron in colorado you're on the air with jesse ventura
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:42.880]  hey it's jesse alex thanks for taking my call i appreciate it thank you go ahead sure go ahead
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:51.760]  uh mr ventura my husband's are 21 or so years in the military he was uh stationed over
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:59.840]  after the uh basnia heard the govina conflict i suppose you could call it he was uh he called me
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:10.000]  frantic and he had been interrogated and he never could fully divulge to me exactly what happened
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:17.440]  but uh one of the things that he said to me was well i guess my brother's not my keeper anymore
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:26.320]  so with all of the um with all of the um attacks against you um i i went through
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.680]  four cars from yesterday just kind of curious to see what's going on with uh the jade health
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:36.800]  15 and how things are changing went by the ones that take motorpool sure i mean you're throwing
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.520]  a lot of stuff ma'am i appreciate your call and we are tracking it there's been two attacks in
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:47.440]  tennessee shooting attacks on military bases at least one person's been shot uh and we're
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:53.040]  going to follow that and see if that is indeed a isis attack or something uh but i think you know
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:59.360]  here's the deal al qaeda was completely synthetic made up in my view the problem with isis is it's
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.680]  a couple hundred thousand people they've allowed to be recruited the west is using it as a saudi
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.520]  arabian proxy army uh and so where do you think this is going governor ventura because you were
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:14.400]  saying off air earlier the real issue is criminals from around the world are coming up through
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:20.960]  mexico so why did trump make it about mexicans yeah i mean the the point is most of the immigration
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.440]  coming to our southern border are not mexicans they're coming from central america because of
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.880]  the wars and things that have been fought there a lot of them are children you know because they're
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.800]  they don't have parents anymore they're all dead and they're coming they're trying to get here
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.640]  they're trying to get anywhere but that aside you know to me this whole thing isis wouldn't even
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.560]  exist today if we hadn't invaded iraq to begin with our policy in the middle east has been
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:54.720]  disastrous we've spent 1.7 trillion dollars in the war on terror since 9 11 and what the hell
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.120]  do we have to show for nothing all right let's get another question we'll get the answer after
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:06.320]  the break mike in north carolina go ahead yeah governor ventura um i wonder if you have any
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.200]  advice for people that are in the military today the men and women uh what would you
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:18.000]  advise without to do uh if they should receive an illegal order and also i was wondering if you
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:25.280]  had a chance to uh read the book methodical allusion by rebecca ross uh answer that first
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:33.040]  no i have not second of all my advice to anyone in the military is remember this when you went
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:40.800]  into the military you hate you raised your hand and you took an oath to protect the constitution
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:48.400]  in the and the bill of rights always remember that was your oath that's what you swore to do
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:55.520]  protect the constitution in the bill of rights and if they're asking you to do things that fall
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:01.440]  and then violate the constitution in the bill of rights then they're asking you to break the oath
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:07.440]  that you took when you enlisted in the united states military you took that oath so did i
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:12.560]  so did every veteran in this country you took an oath to defend the constitution in the bill of
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:17.360]  rights that's a great answer mike i skipped the network breaks i'm going to allow you a come back
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:24.400]  on that but i loved listener chuck and guest chuck norris's uh response to this is mr military
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:28.880]  you know his brother died in special forces over in vietnam he was a military policeman
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:34.160]  himself uh chuck norris came out and they said oh chuck norris is anti-military now and the
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.360]  democrats are fundraising on that how ridiculous it's not the military we don't trust it's that
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:45.120]  those that are leading them commanding them it's political we know it's in north com documents
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:50.000]  it's in stars and stripes that they want to have domestic operations chuck norris said it's good
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:55.440]  to question your government it's i mean that's patriotic isn't it jesse absolutely and remember
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:01.520]  this the knuckle draggers the guys who are actually out in the field doing it they cannot
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:07.600]  question anything they're given orders and they're required to carry out their mission they need us
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:15.200]  to question for them and watch their back it is our job as citizens to question what we're doing
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:21.600]  with our young and men that are serving and wearing the uniform and it's patriotic don't
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:27.360]  let anybody tell you different if you stand up against a war of putting our men and women in
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:35.600]  danger that is not an act of treason it's an act of patriotism well i agree with you and
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:41.680]  they don't have their rights to question they need us to protect them what do you make of the fact
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:46.800]  that it's been a year now admittedly where they put people on don't treat list at the va that have
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:54.480]  operable conditions and they use a ibm watson ibm watson computer they go it's okay the computer
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:00.160]  said don't give them treatment so they program the computers remember ibm was using the holocaust
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:07.200]  to to deny care well nothing surprises me once they're finished with you when you serve in the
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:13.680]  military you believe here's another i'm coming on with a new book of american conspiracies alex
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:20.560]  dealing with our p o w m i a when you enlist they put into your head that no matter what if you're
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:26.000]  in a combat zone and you're left behind our government will do everything and anything to
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:33.440]  get you back baloney and i show that my next book that if you become a political liability
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:40.160]  forget it they ain't gonna do nothing to bring you home and people that need to know that and go
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:46.160]  in with a clear mind about that when you join the military that that's a bunch of hogwash that
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:52.000]  they're gonna do anything and everything to get you home well they become a political liability
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:58.800]  you because you know scott spiker they named the base after him he was alive for over 10 years in
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:05.040]  iraq and they didn't care because dick cheney at the time was the secretary of defense in the first
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:12.240]  golf war in 91 and cheney declared him dead so it was politically embarrassing and they left
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:21.440]  that guy over there for 10 years until he finally did die absolutely they used the honor of the
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:25.840]  military and the people that actually do the fighting you do have courage as reflected glory
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:33.040]  stolen glory uh whoring them out for themselves a bunch of chicken hawks like dick cheney it's
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:40.240]  truly truly sickening yes it is it's horrible and the and people guys that go when you go into
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:48.080]  serve your country don't go in blind understand what you may be asked to do as that earlier caller
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.360]  always remember you take an oath to protect the church institution in the bill of right
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.160]  mike anything else the caller from north carolina that asked the question
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:02.800]  yeah thank you for your service governor please read the book uh methodical allusion by rebecca
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:11.360]  raw thank you all right good plug thank you for your service all right who's up next here harman laura
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:19.200]  in missouri you're on the air go ahead hey alex and uh jessey thank you so much for uh letting me in
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:26.320]  i'm uh very concerned about some things that we've been learning uh this week and i was wondering
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:34.160]  um what you all have heard about it or if you have they're talking about um a large shipment
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:45.280]  of these um portable um morgue being sent to missouri arkansas tennessee and kentucky who's
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:53.280]  talking about it and uh they've uh it's been on online um we've seen it for the past couple
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:57.440]  okay i'll look into it i mean there's constant rumors i'm not saying this is a rumor but i mean
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:01.760]  look listen north com admits they're preparing for mass casualty operations they admit they've
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.720]  ordered tens of millions of body bags they admit there's a huge gear up for collapse look at what's
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.240]  happening in china in greece it's in the mainstream news that elites are getting armored redoubts
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.600]  that's a great question in general uh with north com saying they're preparing to quote stabilize the
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:23.440]  us what do you think of the world economy and china and and in greece and capital controls
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:29.760]  and all this creepy stuff that's happening well you're asking me alec yes sir well to me the whole
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:36.480]  idea of all this debt is going to come home to roost everybody's in debt to everybody when you
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:43.440]  look at our national debt it's astounding when a child is born today and already has is 50 000 in
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:50.640]  the hole and won't even work for another 18 years so the dems and republics have created and whoever
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.560]  a debtor's society of doing everything on debt it's interesting because i was brought up and my mom
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.680]  controlled the finances we got a new car every four years she traded in the old one and paid
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.600]  cash my mother never had a car payment her life because she had a different after living through
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:15.760]  the depression she she didn't get debt and didn't live with debt today we have a society that's built
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:22.000]  around everyone living in debt making you subservient and making you in your own in its own way a slave
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.640]  and people like like it's like free money to to to get a loan i mean i don't operate that way
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:31.200]  either people look at me where you go you could borrow tens of millions do it i'm like no i'm
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.000]  not going to that's just not how we operate we're trying to build something truly sustainable here
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.560]  i want to jam in one more call john alabama quick question for jessie ventura uh well actually
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:47.520]  alex is uh it's not a question but uh i could make it a question for mr ventura mr ventura
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:52.640]  what are your thoughts on this operation jade helm i mean i've been following it briefly and then
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:58:00.160]  my father uh who travels a lot has seen jade helm or what he what he swears is jade helm vehicles
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:04.480]  everywhere and all right let me stop you there the governor's got to leave in a minute i'm going to
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:10.080]  come back to you i gotta tell you i'm ignorant to this what what is this about well it's a complex
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.960]  issue but they're having military drills all the time they announced it they misrepresented it to
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:19.360]  say that we say it's martial law we didn't say that and then now there is military equipment
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:24.400]  and all sorts of activity everywhere so we're not sure exactly what it is governor it's a mystery
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:31.840]  well you know i i've always felt that when when the defense bill allowed that amendment that levin
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:37.520]  and mccain put on that said that the united hold on 70 seconds i gotta come back to you we gotta go
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:42.800]  to break 70 seconds jessie don't hang up we'll come back and finish up the 70 seconds this is gcn

[01:58:55.680 --> 01:59:01.440]  info wars dot com because the companies i've been approached by were not the highest quality
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:07.440]  and they weren't as affordable as they should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers

[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:15.920]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:23.600]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones all right jesse ventura got cut off we're talking
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:27.680]  to john maybe have time to go to d on an eric for he goes we've got five minutes in this segment
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:32.000]  and i will break down the latest on jade helm after governor ventura leaves us governor you
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  were making a great point it's in the defense budget since 2007 and suffice subsequent ones
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.600]  to get rid of posse commentatus it's in the army times i mean they're admitting there's already
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:48.960]  been a takeover so so we're not saying this is an imminent takeover they've already gotten rid of
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:55.120]  posse commentatus elaborate on that well john mccain and carl levin the democrat from michigan
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:00.960]  in the senate put an amendment to the defense bill which of course nobody can vote against the defense
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:08.160]  bill or you're anti-american right that's right so uh you know we all know that and so uh they put
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:14.080]  this amendment on that allows the u.s. military to operate freely inside of our country which
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:20.400]  has never been allowed before and so that went through that defense bill so anything that's
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:26.400]  happening now is not surprising to me i remember i went to the local cbs affiliate i walked in there
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:31.520]  as the former governor and said why aren't you reporting on this amendment the reporter took
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:35.840]  it all down looked at me said well it'll go upstairs we'll see if it gets on and it never did
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.760]  mainstream media didn't say a word about that amendment that mccain levin did that turned
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:48.320]  loose the american military inside our country and jade helm is this simple they take a big drill
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:52.720]  that's very mysterious that they say we'll be simulating illegal things we'll be in plain
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:58.080]  clothes in 10 states we go wow this is all part of the militarization of police eyes and how we're
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.600]  warned and they go alex jones says they're gonna kill locals and they just keep saying that without
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:08.800]  showing me saying it so that when they don't kill people they go see it's okay to have military
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:16.160]  on the streets it turned out okay that's the siob well it it's not okay to have military on our
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:22.480]  streets that's supposed to be police and civilian the military is the military and they should not
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:29.760]  be operating inside the confines of our country i think that's far more dangerous than building a
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:35.120]  wall between us and mexico absolutely well jesse uh i know you're not a really technical you know
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.800]  what maybe that's why they're building the wall alex so we can't get out that's what ron paul said
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:46.720]  anybody ever think about that think about that for a moment people do they want this wall down
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.800]  there so you can't escape actually actually they're changing with capital and currency controls
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.400]  and making it where you can't get your money out of the us right now that's actually admitted
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.480]  i don't know about anything about that but all i know is people should always remember a wall
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:09.440]  works both ways no i know but i'm saying i agree with you people in i agree with you that's actually
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:15.680]  what they're going to use it for you know all right well let's get a final comment from john
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.920]  and alabama john you just you just heard his take on it you're saying your dad's seeing a lot of
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.560]  military operations around the country go ahead and he actually did to the other day of one of
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:32.640]  these vehicles in a po done close to where i grew up i mean there's not even a thousand people in
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:37.840]  this town where he he took the picture of this vehicle but the real reason i called um i'm currently
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.560]  and i'm probably about to be on my way out of this town um i'm currently living in ozark alabama

[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:33.280]  more free when the persian army demanded king leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:38.640]  the outnumbered king shouted molon lube or come and take them even though leonidas was
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:44.240]  eventually defeated by a much larger adversary he is not remembered for his loss he lives in
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:50.880]  history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense the desire to disarm the people is nothing new

[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:21.120]  alex jones and the gcn radio network so i have five different news articles
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:26.800]  the new york times salon top secret writers and others
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:34.000]  coming out and misrepresenting what we're saying in some cases completely
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:44.400]  salon says that alex jones anti-pc rants could get gay people murdered and then show no example
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:55.600]  of me saying anything the new york times in an article titled as jade helm 15 exercises begin
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:03.120]  texas keep watch and it says that i believe that it's a plan to exterminate and kill malicious
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:11.120]  and then don't link to it and then this article is is is one of the biggest
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.040]  fabrications i've ever seen you talk about preying on your audience
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:24.240]  you talk about manipulating your audience the new york times says with a big photo on
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:30.800]  the front of their article warning the door you are about to break down is loaded
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.280]  for your and then it's got an image of an assault rifle
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:49.920]  and implies people are just waiting to kill troops and then goes and quotes us saying
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:56.080]  the military is coming to exterminate you and then don't link i mean how do you read the
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:58.400]  new york times and then there's no quote
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:04.480]  that doesn't put it in quotes they just say alex jones and info wars
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:11.520]  believe that it's a plan to exterminate the militias and then don't show where i say it
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:19.120]  i mean if you're at info wars dot com there'd be multiple links where they say it i mean if we
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:27.280]  say lewis fair con has come out and said something we show it or we say rush lembaugh said something
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:35.120]  we show it but again they it's like rachel madow and then those shows going alex jones is deeply
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:42.240]  racist alex jones is behind the boss bombing and then they they don't show it and the new
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:50.000]  talking point we've heard it locally every day and then i'm told it's going on in every major
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.360]  city there is a talking point to say i used to like alex jones but you know he wants cops dead
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:04.080]  yeah or i used to like alex jones but he uh he he he he he he's glad the kids died at sandy hook
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:10.400]  stuff like that and then you find out you know you you discover it is a literal hit piece and
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:16.640]  they have this new one alex jones marine toys for tots clip prove he's a moron
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.320]  and then it goes on to say that i say the real criminals and the enemy is the marines
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:34.400]  the clip is accompanied by a voiceover by alex jones talking about it's his right to film the
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:43.840]  real criminals so they say it's me in some other city talking about how toys for tots is a scyop
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:48.960]  and it's a ballheaded guy who looks like he's 55
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.640]  and he doesn't even really say that he says i support the military but this is a scyop to get
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:02.880]  kids you know involved i mean obviously it is and then you go there's not even a voiceover
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.200]  it's not even me and and this is what i deal with
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:12.080]  on a daily basis now
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:22.320]  and if you go back two years ago the headline was pentagon promises to stop lying because of drudge
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:27.680]  and it's a 45 minute long speech by the undersecretary of defense
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:35.280]  and they've got this huge auditorium full of scyop people civilian and and enlisted and in brass
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.400]  and they go we promise to stop lying now we're going to engage in every city in town with
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:46.800]  military working with your newspaper your website and your news to make sure the truth gets out
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:50.480]  and everybody looks totally freaked out with their head in their hand because
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.000]  they've done this in iraq they've done i mean this is a rollout takeover
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.320]  and when they say because of drudge and other alternative media we can't lie anymore and then
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:05.280]  like people that aren't part of the scyop enlisted a little non-commissioned officers get up and
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.600]  start going you mean i don't have to lie anymore because i don't like lying when i and they're
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:17.600]  like thank you ma'am no you're done speaking thank you because it's some of those powerful
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:22.080]  video ever if you know what you're seeing they're rolling out the domestic takeover and the scyop
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.800]  which they just legalized last year by an act of congress saying you can now engage in lying
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:33.040]  domestically that was even in the washington post cia propaganda now legalized and that's
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:37.360]  what it is that's why they want to overturn the courts and say they can lie about people and just
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.640]  get on the news and say alex jones is a pedophile or i mean let me tell you when they get up there
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.800]  and say i'm behind the boss in bombing i mean do you want me to play that clip again or i'm quote
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:54.640]  deeply racist and don't play a clip or i want gay people to be killed anyone that listens to this show
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:14:01.040]  knows that is a complete lie and then i've decried folks going out and attacking people for their
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:09.200]  sexual preference but it doesn't matter because maybe 80 of the public in this country doesn't
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:15.280]  know who i am in some pockets it's like 60 70 percent do but still even if the people know
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:21.840]  who i am it's kind of like oh he really said that here's what's happened they've been caught lying
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:30.480]  so they've tripled and quadrupled and quintupled and infinited down with lies and so now as i told
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:37.120]  you i said when jade helm starts the 15th you are going to see them everywhere say the laughable
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:44.000]  nut alex has been discredited jade helm was not martial law nothing happened when we never said it
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.360]  was going to do that it was further conditioning and they will just sit there and assault their
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:59.520]  audience with fraud while they get away with taking hundreds of thousands 280 plus thousand
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:06.320]  troops have died in the last decade not getting treatment that's leaked va documents and here's
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:10.080]  the good news there are people inside the va leaking the truth here's the bad news they're
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:17.680]  trying to arrest whoever leaked it now see in the past you get a medal for leaking information
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.640]  when tox plumbing did it in the 70s in the 80s if you expose criminal activity or it's 238 i
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:28.880]  and i inverted the number i've flipped it 238 thousand us veterans died waiting for healthcare
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:39.120]  leak document and that's just what the va says and it's on purpose they aren't going to give you
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:49.840]  healthcare and it's operable oh you got skin cancer 97 percent operable if we cut it off
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.600]  come back in six months oh joe biggs you got blown up in two armored vehicles
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.280]  so your esophagus is burned by the smoke and the fire and you cough up blood everywhere
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:07.840]  we're not going to fix it here's some pills i don't want pills uh hey my leg got blown up
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.880]  up and my knees out again and you didn't do the surgery on my foot right where his foot got blown
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:16.080]  up and they just go we're not giving you surgery now get out of here
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:19.840]  that's what they tell them
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:29.120]  oh but if you're illegal you get the surgery or you get to have your baby for free and we're not
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:34.400]  against these people but why is it free for them and not for the vets who've earned it
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:41.120]  it because the vets are already here and they're done with you they want new people because we
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:47.280]  aborted 50 plus million of our kids so we do need new people here so social security doesn't
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.440]  collapse but they're not even doing that they're already rated social security
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:56.720]  i mean these are facts
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:06.320]  now john and alabama finish your point you said you were you said you're there in alabama

[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:15.360]  the economic meltdown happening worldwide and on donald trump he knows him well but john in alabama
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:23.200]  i'm not saying i disbelieve him i mean he sounds like a real person but he also sounds really freaked
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:31.440]  out which would be normal but then he's not that clear um when were you just answer my questions
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.560]  very simply because this is a big deal if it's true when were you tackled by who
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:44.240]  john from alabama when were you tackled and by who
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:53.120]  harmon did you put him back on he's back in can you hear me john john
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:59.040]  okay well you got his number calling back at home he'd probably hung up the line's dead
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:01.760]  yeah he dropped see i'm right he dropped off calling back
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:09.200]  but it's paying attention to stuff like this that's important i've had the military take
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.800]  footage from me in san antonio at gunpoint so i know this goes on delta force
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:19.600]  going around buying everybody off so i know this stuff goes on i know there's un
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:27.600]  officers all over our military is under the un treaties i know they're involved in domestic
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:33.040]  psyops saying i hate the marines and they're the enemy i better watch it they'll edit that together
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:39.760]  but people know they're lying uh and that i want to kill gay people and that uh jade helm was imminent
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:43.440]  martial law and they're going to kill everybody they'll probably take that and edit it and put
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:49.840]  it on cnn because this is an enemy force people and they've got to keep the public in the dark
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.960]  they've got to keep the public ignorant about this operation jade helm why conspiracy theories
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:03.920]  theorist fear the us is invading texas see we're not saying they're invading texas but they can
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:09.440]  find anybody probably their operatives online saying that it's an imminent takeover and then
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:14.240]  projected on to us when the takeovers already happened so see we have an incremental takeover
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:18.960]  happening how do you discredit people that are trying to stop that you lie and say that they
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:24.320]  say it's imminent so that when it's not all happening at once or complete then it legitimizes
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:31.600]  whatever else happens after they have us crying wolf they cry wolf for us so that people don't
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:38.240]  listen and see what's already happened it's a false flag crying wolf jade helm
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:43.440]  is a false flag crying wolf operation
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.640]  they're going to say what the conspiracy theorists believe
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:54.720]  then they quote me this is just a cover for deploying the military on the streets
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:59.920]  said jones i've hardly ever heard of something joint like this unless they're planning an
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:07.120]  invasion and that's true in context but not out of context i'm talking about for overseas
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.400]  operations because i went on i mean i remember this was when we first talked about it with joe
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:20.400]  biggs i went on to say so this is a conditioning operation fears have also been stuck by a public
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:24.720]  letter allegedly written by texas ranger to the common sense show the letter has been shared
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:29.600]  widely and is treated with huge respect by a conspiracy theorist then they show no evidence of
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:36.480]  that so they're betting a lot on this and i meant to give this to the guys in fact i told them this
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:44.640]  morning and i i need to give it to them um it's in the david jones my dad screenshoted it for me
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.960]  in the text give it to buckley this is going to happen right now this is newsworthy the democrats
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:54.400]  are using jade helm lies to raise money and my parents are on some democrat mailing list
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:00.400]  because my mom gave money to an environmental group to save the springs they don't save the
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.120]  springs they still private property and then build mansions on it later but but she admits
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:08.960]  that she was wrong this like took 25 years ago so that's how they're on the democratic party
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:14.240]  mailing list so i guess that's a good thing but you know that we get all this intel and it screens
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:19.200]  shot it in there uh and and then it just goes on from there i mean i'm in hundreds of news articles
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:25.600]  a day the last two days just lying about what i stand for lying about what's going on and this
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:30.720]  is so again anybody questioning militarization of police the military on the streets of america
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:35.360]  remember the end deposit commentators would never come there'd never be troops now they admit
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.440]  they're domestically prepared to quote take on the tea party and gun owners and veterans
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.400]  they leave the border wide open and we say see we told you something big's coming
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:51.280]  and then they freak out about it john and alabama is back john we're going to break here
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:59.520]  here when were you arrested

[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:05.040]  the establishment media went with the angle that it's just the conspiracy nuts thinking
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:10.640]  martial law is imminent but what they won't explain about jade helm and what we exposed
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:17.200]  months ago is mastering the human domain in military terminology the human domain or human
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:23.600]  domain analytics refers to the global understanding of anything associated with people mastering the

[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:41.520]  simple military exercise if you understand the technologies you'll see that jade helm is more

[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:22.320]  like george will said well i mean you know john bainer's a democratic party shill for as far as
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:27.920]  i'm concerned uh then more importantly world financial meltdown how serious is it with
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:33.920]  greece and china and the rest of it separately i never said jade helm everybody knows this
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:38.720]  who listens to this show was imminent martial law i said it's part of the militarization
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:42.640]  the end of posse common taught us that everybody's talked about they have hundreds of articles
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:47.280]  they're back they haven't done this in a few weeks hundreds of articles a day saying that i want to
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:51.760]  kill gay people with no proof the new york times that i believe it's an imminent plan to murder
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:59.440]  texans and they show no link they just say a plan to eradicate the public uh and uh just a whole
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:04.560]  bunch of other craziness that i want to kill police and then i mean they're really assassinating my
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:11.360]  character right now at a level i've never seen all of this is actionable for defamation libel
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:19.200]  slander the problem is i can't sue them all so it's a court of public opinion defend me pray for me
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.080]  get the word out but this is them getting rid of the propaganda ban for the pentagon and cia
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:30.400]  domestically this is what they do this is hard core our government's been seized by criminals
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:37.760]  they're using the powerful organs of propaganda against me against ran paul uh and against others
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:43.680]  and it is unprecedented and i see it happening in donald trump and want to defend him because
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:50.000]  what he's saying is true and he's being misconstrued and taken out of context but i know he was with
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.720]  the assault weapons ban he supported hillary and dr coursey years ago talks to trump a lot and and
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:02.960]  had his concerns so he joins us now to cover the waterfront from wnd.com doctor thanks for taking
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:08.080]  time out hi alex it's always a great pleasure to be with you thank you yes sir so you've got the
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:13.200]  floor what do you want to tackle first well i mean this this follow-up on uh donald trump in
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:19.600]  your comments on donald trump i mean first of all i think donald trump is uh this time i think is for
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:25.680]  real much more than before and and what the only thing that's the real question the real question
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:32.880]  is that donald trump has moved the debate of the presidential election on to a ground that is one
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:39.440]  telling the truth and saying things directly not worrying about being politically correct
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:45.520]  that's drawing down trump a very big audience and secondly on immigration he's put the immigration
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:53.600]  topic on the front burner and he's he's really ignited the topic such that even hispanics can say
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:38:00.640]  look we're not for a round of illegals that are criminals we are not invading the company country
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:07.280]  to take it over with you know with with criminals and undesirable people i think that this is the
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:15.040]  proper time to call the obama administration for failure to enforce immigration laws and donald
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:21.120]  trump is on that agenda he's doing a good job and i support his efforts i think he's really leading
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:26.080]  the debate and i'd say quit worrying about if he's going to stay in the debate or where it's
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:31.920]  going to go the fact is he's doing a good job right now and he's probably likely to continue that
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.480]  as long as he's winning support and gaining attention and i don't see any end to this
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:42.320]  well i sure hope he's for real because he's really smart he's charismatic
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:49.360]  i think he'd make a great president if he won't come after our guns if he'll really cut taxes
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:55.280]  because let's face it you couldn't hold this country back if they just cut taxes the system
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:00.240]  wants a cloward and piven they don't want us to become wealthy they want to control us they want
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:06.880]  us poor so yeah anybody could fix america if they went back to our basics but in your gut
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:13.600]  do you think he's going to step down later and let jeb bush slide in and beat a rand paul or somebody
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:20.560]  else well i mean we he's got a ross perot factor going right now the frost bro had stayed in the
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:26.720]  race we may never have had bill clinton as president and i think this time around trump
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:33.520]  sees the opportunity trump could actually emerge victorias this year i think that's
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:38.160]  in 2016 i think i'll be a great surprise i think he's going to be in the
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:46.240]  gop debates he's going to set the agenda and my guess is trump is not going to want to pull out
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.400]  he's going to want to stick it through this time and i'm certainly hoping and pulling that he does
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:40:00.480]  in the immediate the change that he's registering in the presidential campaign is extremely positive
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:06.080]  because putting on the agenda questions that those of us who oppose this new world order
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:12.320]  this this entire loss of america which alex i've joined you in fighting against
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.640]  this is something down trump is championing and i want to see him continue but i let's let's
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:24.480]  move on to if there's so many topics to talk about um you've raised you you just laid out a good
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:31.200]  agenda i mean iran i mean i cannot believe how fast the obama administration i predicted
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:37.520]  when i wrote atomic around 2005 that john carrey would be the one who would actually negotiate
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:45.520]  a way to give iran nuclear weapons and here 10 years later most of the book in 2005 john carrey
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:53.200]  has pulled the same jimmy carter bill clinton that was done with north korea and saying why don't we
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:58.640]  give them you know and risk uranium and let them have a nuclear industry on the promise that they
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.440]  won't make by the way i got an erupt how on earth when he was nowhere near the position he is now
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:09.600]  our secretary of state how did you predict that he'd be the man 10 years later to do this
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:15.040]  it was an instinct i mean i i knew he was when i wrote the book he had just lost the presidential
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:21.360]  campaign and i wanted to make it clear you know that it was john carrey who was pushing this agenda
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:26.880]  that we ought to trust iran the way we were trusting north korea and it was your book that's
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:32.400]  credited as shooting him down yeah what was the unfit for command which i co-authored with john
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:40.800]  o'neill was the book that destroyed carrey's uh presidential opportunity in 2004 by 2005 i was
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:47.680]  on carrey because i knew he was going to carry was being paid and by the iranian government
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:55.200]  through this uh asan namazi who's now in federal prison he was the i always believed asan namazi
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:01.280]  was an agent of the mullahs and he was here supporting hillary clinton supporting uh john
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:07.520]  carrey he's in federal prison for violating bank lending laws he was a criminal to begin with
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:13.680]  and i pointed this out when i wrote atomic iran i just figured john carrey got paid to
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:18.960]  make sure that iran would get nuclear weapons so you're saying john carrey's really a foreign
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:24.960]  operative i'm saying john carrey from the from the time he ran for president was happy to accept
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:30.960]  iranian money through asan namazi and he knew that his mission was to allow iran to get nuclear
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:36.080]  weapons i'm saying i've said that about john carrey since 2005 well it's clear they're letting
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:40.960]  him get him but for my military sources special forces people pretty high up even six seven years
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:46.720]  ago i'm on record saying the saudi secretly have some nukes and then iran already has nukes
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:51.200]  they just want to be able to have this nuclear program to then come out and claim later they
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:57.360]  made them themselves what's your intel ron wants to be able to make its own weapons so it doesn't
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:03.120]  just have one no it doesn't just have one or two ron wants the world so hold on your sources
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:08.480]  confirm then or or you think there's validity that they have a couple weapons oh they could easily
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:13.440]  anytime they want to they've been able to do that for years but they want to be able to have
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:20.400]  more than one when they actually use it so that they could have a threat to retaliate against
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:25.120]  other countries that are going to retaliate against them iran is planning a nuclear war
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:31.920]  what obama has just put into place with this agreement is the certainty now that we will have
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:37.840]  a nuclear war in the middle east it's only a matter of time and the iranians wait until they
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:43.920]  have enough weapons to be able to retaliate against anyone who counters them for dropping a dozen
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:50.080]  nukes on israel and only takes one or two nukes to destroy israel and we have a quote
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:57.760]  iranian obsession but also a saudi obsession with iran don't these two groups sheites suny
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:03.600]  hate each other even more than the west i've been writing and if you take a look at a book i called
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:09.760]  a world called you know israel can't wait israel and saudi arabia have been working together
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:16.960]  including on military exercises i think for at least the last five years now planning a strike
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:26.960]  on iran uh i think israel realized i certainly told israel told the top government in 2008 2009
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:33.040]  it was over there when obama gave his speech in kairu i was delivering the message to top leaders
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:38.720]  in the israeli government that obama was going to turn on israel and abandoned israel i remember
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:44.080]  you said that on this show and i just didn't believe you i gotta say this you have been probably the
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.280]  most accurate person other than like a ron paul that we've ever had i mean you really know your
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:55.280]  stuff i'm not kissing your butt it's just true it's almost like you got a crystal ball well it's
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:45:00.000]  you know i was giving me the ability to kind of look at things and be able to assess them i would
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:06.640]  have been i i sometimes feel like the books that i write it takes 10 years for them to happen
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:11.600]  and then they happen america for sales also gonna happen that's another book so i'm saying
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:20.320]  the agreement between iran between israel and saudi arabia against iran is a certainty
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:26.960]  and when israel attacks iran which i think it almost inevitably will do it will be with the
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:32.560]  assistance of saudi arabia with the obama administration of its still in power actively
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:38.800]  opposing israel and the jews in america who have any allegiance left to israel better realize that
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:44.880]  obama is an enemy of israel well that's my next question six years into this strategy to overthrow
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:51.840]  qaddafi overthrow egypt overthrow syria overthrow allies or neutral groups to then put in saudi
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:57.120]  arabian backed headchoppers like that's twilight zone i know our government's got corruption
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:02.080]  and problems but you know obama's cousins and people and funding the muslim brotherhood
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:08.320]  this is an insane strategy well obama has been muslim brotherhood from the beginning and hillary
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:18.160]  clinton has huma abedin was her uh i'm convinced lover and her top associate for years and the
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:25.120]  two of them have been muslim brotherhood hillary and obama have been the greatest gun runners in
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:32.400]  american history and they are secretly and have been secretly going back to when christ stevens
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:41.040]  was first sent into bin gazi it's been hillary and obama running guns to the al-qaeda affiliated
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:45.680]  militia and into syria all in favor of the muslim brotherhood because these groups have
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:52.800]  muslim brotherhood origins and you know this is what i said was the cause of christ stevens
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:56.400]  death he was trying to take the weapons back they were looking for the well that's my next
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:00.720]  question and kernel shaver said it within a couple weeks of it i've had tosh plumley cia
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:06.320]  whistleblower they've all confirmed it uh why would the clinton send in stevens if they had
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:11.360]  to whack him to cover up the weapons transfer well first see the initial idea was that stevens
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:16.560]  was going to go in and provide these covert guns which by the way they're now prosecuting mark
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:21.920]  terry for the deal partner justice setting up mark terry i'll be writing about that probably
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:28.880]  next week but mark terry is innocent the clinton's have framed him and they prosecuted him with the
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:34.960]  cooperation of obama and loretta lynch in the department of justice to be the fall guy in a
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:41.840]  scheme that was really hillary scheme running guns through christ stevens and then the after qaddafi
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:47.520]  fell which was you know a destabilizing move in favor of the muslim brotherhood with insane
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:55.680]  move because remember qaddafi had been funding reverend right and lewis ferrican when obama
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:01.920]  was a politician in chicago obama was benefiting from qaddafi through ferrican and reverend right
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:07.760]  obama turned on qaddafi because obama wanted to destabilize qaddafi in order to put the muslim
[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:14.080]  brotherhood in now the guns that were being run were getting out of control and they lost a bunch
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:19.760]  of these man pads and hillary began worrying and have airlines taken down by weapons that could be
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:25.600]  traced back to qaddafi and ultimately to her and to obama they're trying to have chris stevens
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:31.120]  and in september with the two thousand with a 9 11 event occurred they attacked on ben gazi
[02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:36.240]  chris stevens was trying to work with turkey to get these weapons found so they ordered him
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:41.600]  basically taken out stood down had the ben gazi security force that they had paid who were a bunch
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:47.840]  of al qaeda people come in and slaughter him well and about as stevens was expendable at this point
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:54.000]  and in their strategy if stevens had been captured and i'm convinced stevens was alive
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.760]  when he was found in that compound uh that he could have been exchanged for the broad blind
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:05.200]  sheet and that was another one of the plans that obama had in the works that stevens would be
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:12.480]  set up attacked captured and did they have a prisoner exchange for him in the meantime but
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:16.480]  the radicals got mad when two navy seals from down the street came in and wiped a bunch of
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:21.200]  amounts so they flipped out and killed everybody well and also that they got mad because stevens
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:26.240]  was trying to take the guns away he was trying to find the man pads you know terrorists are fine
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.560]  if you want to give them weapons we'll start taking their weapons away they get a little bit mad
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:34.400]  and they decided it was time to wax stevens because they didn't like him or going out
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:38.400]  to find the man pads and get them back sure because whoever got those they said we can
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:43.680]  sell these off for 10 times the money or use them and hold the entire west hostage a black
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:48.720]  mailing hillary that she gave us these precisely and that's what the obama administration has been
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:53.120]  trying to hide with Benghazi from the beginning they're still trying to hide it they won't let you
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:50:00.320]  see hillary's emails they won't you realize that hillary set mark terry up to be the fall guy
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:06.160]  in a gun running stream through through a cutter you know judge napolitano wrote an article and
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:12.560]  said the same thing i'm saying right here i had the pictures we published at wnd the photographs
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:19.680]  of the weapons that were seized in that qatari the two boats from qatari trying to bring european
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:25.600]  made weapons in delivia that had been arranged by hillary clinton hillary clinton's one of the biggest
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:31.040]  gun runners in the world do you think he can get away with all this no ultimately i don't i think
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:37.200]  hillary clinton clinton's are going to face a major defeat within the next few months and their
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:44.480]  foundation may actually be closed very exciting to see these criminals fall plus you and i both
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:49.440]  know they're after us uh just the sooner sooner they're politically destroyed the better uh this

[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:30.080]  think you've got two things going on one is that grease is absolutely in freefall and this agreement
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:37.920]  is really greece's loss of sovereignty it's a german bank takeover of greece greece's gonna have to
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:44.720]  sell major assets the the german banks are going to move in and own um grease this is going to be
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:50.320]  worse than the nazi occupation as far as the greeks are concerned and it won't last long you're
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:56.960]  going to see riots in the street uh streets of greece you're going to see panic once the greek
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:03.040]  population realizes the controls that are under uh greek is going to go bankrupt again uh the european
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:10.080]  union the germans are not going to keep sending a socialist country like greece more money so that
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:16.000]  you know people who are not working can get free food germany's not going to do it for long and this
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.560]  is going to collapse this is the beginning of the collapse of the euro it's the beginning of the
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:27.200]  end of the dream of the european unity and entity it won't work this is a draconian
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:34.560]  banker driven central bank solution to a problem created by the central bankers to take over a
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:40.720]  country and it's not going to work the greek people are going to be reduced to poverty they're
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:45.680]  going to be suicides they're going to be looking for food in the streets i mean this is a disaster
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:53.520]  of major proportions uh second major crisis is that the uh chinese stock market is suffering
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:58:00.400]  1929 like losses and it's going to continue because that's a stock market again built by debt these

[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:16.480]  going to try to keep prop greek up greece off they're going to try to prop the stock market up in
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:21.760]  china they're both going to collapse and it'll be the beginning of a major world by the second

[03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:12.640]  and total lie so this is what they're running using the incremental military takeover as a way
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:16.800]  to then discredit people that pointed out and of course it used to be the democrats that were
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:20.320]  worried about a military takeover i mean any country should be worried about that that's what
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:24.160]  happens all the time around the world put eyes on how we're warned about and it's fair well
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:31.200]  addressed but the act like it's weird now john and alabama thank you for holding if folks just
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:38.400]  joined us you live in alabama outside an airbase and you're in there at walmart at one in the morning
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:44.400]  a few days ago and they grab you take you to jail but don't charge you and say come back later i've
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:48.560]  seen that with demonstrators before and you were there and there were guys with un named tags with
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:54.800]  the guy in a black uniform and they tackled you and the police came and took you to jail um amazing
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:02.320]  and and if this is true it's incredible what else can you tell us about this what did the police
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:08.640]  say to you in the squad car was anything else said to you well uh alex i i don't know about
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:14.240]  how censorship is on your shows i i'm pretty sure i can't quote them verbatim but uh in a nutshell
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:19.600]  they told me that i asked up but i wanted to get picture happy with my iphone and you know i told
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:25.280]  him i was just i mean i could be wrong but i just i told him i was exercising my first amendment right
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:32.000]  freedom of speech freedom of press freedom of assembly and they didn't care like my iphone is
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:37.840]  probably no more but wait they didn't even give you your iphone they didn't give you your phone back
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:43.440]  no no when when i left the city jail uh they told me that i could pick my iphone up when i picked
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:50.560]  my paperwork up and you know i'm i'm like i told you earlier you know before you went to break earlier

[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:59.040]  charged you're supposed to get paperwork as soon as you get kicked loose whether it's you have to pay
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:04.080]  to get out or you get a recognize bond a property bond what have you and they give you your property
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:10.800]  back well sir here's the deal i would call the local media and i would say troops stole my iphone
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:16.560]  at the walmart they won't give it back that's a news story and if they won't cover it we'll come up
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.240]  there and i'll go in there with a video camera to the police department and say give them his iphone
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:26.000]  back and let them try to arrest me that's fine if they do uh but i believe you i've had similar
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:31.200]  things happen to me this is incredible describe these un troops for us how were they dressed
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:36.960]  what the uniforms look like where were they in the walmart break it down for us okay um the the
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:42.400]  men that i saw in the walmart uh the the gentlemen that i'm presuming are bodyguards because they're
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:47.120]  the ones that pulled i'm what i'm assuming is glock 17s because that's standard issue sidearm
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:52.640]  oh wait they pulled firearms on you yeah yes yes they drew down on me in walmart while two of
[03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:56.560]  there was there was a total of six four of them drew down on me and covered me while two of them
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:03.040]  took me to the ground well that's unprecedented armed armed troops pulled a gun on you armed in
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:07.520]  plain clothes and i'm assuming that they were protecting the two men in the suits with the
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:12.480]  badges on their lapel and like i didn't mean them any harm you know i mean i understand it was
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:17.840]  sometimes the diplomats or something to think they're god yeah so what happened next all right
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:23.280]  well uh they you know they took me down with no resistance at all because i'm we're almost out
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:28.800]  of time what else happens what else happened okay uh well uh you know they detained me and held me
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:33.040]  on the ground one of them had a knee in my back holding both my hands behind my back and i let it
[03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:38.800]  go on and then the city police arrived and they carted me off the jail and you know i got out a
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:43.840]  couple hours later on what they said was a recognize bond you know i in good faith i'll show you
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:48.400]  rather here's the deal i'm gonna send a reporter up there i believe you we need to go back to walmart
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:55.760]  recreate it we need to go to the police department this is huge armed un forces tackling and then
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:05:01.760]  robbing a citizen's iphone and taking him to jail
