[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.520]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.520 --> 00:26.320]  Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is the 14th day of
[00:26.320 --> 00:32.200]  January 2009 Wednesday and yesterday we told you Bernanke said that more bank
[00:32.200 --> 00:37.600]  bailouts were needed well today it's pretty much gonna be I give it a 48
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.280]  hours until Citigroup folds Citigroup's death throws may take pandit
[00:42.280 --> 00:47.560]  to you see Paulson also told you after you handed over $700 billion which
[00:47.560 --> 00:51.320]  really equals to about what what is it like seven and a half eight trillion is
[00:51.320 --> 00:57.040]  what Bloomberg's reporting he was still gonna close some banks some of them
[00:57.040 --> 01:02.440]  weren't gonna make it and Citigroup it's over I mean it was less than six
[01:02.440 --> 01:05.680]  months ago that they started talking about that they were gonna have problems
[01:05.680 --> 01:08.520]  and I think it was two weeks after that that they said they were gonna need the
[01:08.520 --> 01:15.120]  bailout then these packages put were put forth some people in Congress stood up
[01:15.120 --> 01:17.800]  to them at first and then they were threatened with martial law and
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.000]  bamboozled by Obama you know some of these guys were actually told by Obama
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.880]  that if he was elected he would make sure that this money is gonna go towards
[01:26.880 --> 01:32.040]  mortgages and the people well I don't see that happening let's read some of
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.680]  this it's off MSNBC.com as Citigroup nears the end of the decade long
[01:36.680 --> 01:42.360]  experiment see the bank is an experiment now your money is an experiment it's
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.720]  funny it's funny to them to create one-stop shopping for financial services
[01:46.720 --> 01:50.960]  it's chief executive Ikram Pandit may be running out of time to turn the company
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.000]  around it'll probably be absorbed by Chase Manhattan give rock fellers a
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.760]  little bit more power I could definitely see that happening CNBC's Charles
[01:58.760 --> 02:02.560]  Gospirno reported Wednesday that Panda is coming under increasing pressure from
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.720]  the bank's Giants board and from the federal government for quick results
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.840]  yeah okay yeah they're gonna get quick results by taking your money so expect
[02:12.840 --> 02:16.240]  some banks to close this week I expect that that you know that'll probably put
[02:16.240 --> 02:22.200]  just enough fear into the Congress that they'll pass another bailout and only
[02:22.200 --> 02:27.760]  representatives Paul and Kacinich will dare speak out against it in truth you
[02:27.760 --> 02:31.400]  know they're I'm not giving everybody credit there there were a few others that
[02:31.400 --> 02:35.160]  did speak out against the bailout but when Kacinich you know what I want you
[02:35.160 --> 02:39.600]  to pull up the Kacinich the Federal Reserve is as federal as federal
[02:39.600 --> 02:47.080]  Express that's a that's just a golden couscous line right there by the way and
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.760]  I believe it in the second hour top of the second hour we're going to have
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.240]  Michael Rivera of what really happened dot-com on we're gonna be doing that via
[02:54.240 --> 02:59.720]  webcam so all you prison planet dot TV subscribers can tune in and see that live
[02:59.720 --> 03:05.760]  via the web you know a little later on I guess I'll introduce the story now I
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.480]  want to talk about human micro microchips and I've been talking about
[03:09.480 --> 03:14.240]  this for quite some time but one of the positions I've taken is that I don't
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.680]  think it's gonna be like oh they're gonna put microchips in you forcibly at
[03:17.680 --> 03:20.400]  least not at first I don't think they're gonna line everybody up up here's your
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.880]  chip they're gonna make it fashionable it's the cool thing to do and I've
[03:24.880 --> 03:28.080]  always thought that the easiest way to do this was to go after your children
[03:28.080 --> 03:34.200]  your kids the teenagers people like myself who are into technology who like
[03:34.200 --> 03:37.840]  to sit down and play halo or Mortal Kombat or video games in general the
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.960]  video game generations my generation and I always thought that the next gen
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.040]  systems would try and incorporate microchip check technology and this was
[03:47.040 --> 03:51.480]  reported was this December so over a month ago I noticed this so I just
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.200]  remembered it today and I wanted to print it out interested in microchip
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.120]  implants for gaming Sega's you Suzuki is venerated Sega developer you Suzuki
[03:59.120 --> 04:03.960]  you know the guy did Virtua Cop hang on change the way people played his titles
[04:03.960 --> 04:07.120]  have been revolutionary regarding how players interact with arcade games and
[04:07.120 --> 04:11.680]  arcade game cabinets but Suzuki thinks there's more that can be done like like
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.160]  arcade game players getting chipped as in getting some sort of more motion
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.040]  controlled implant will be more than just motion control by the way it'll it'll
[04:21.040 --> 04:25.600]  read your thoughts at least somewhat while interviewing Suzuki for arcade
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.040]  many he told us about the interest in new ways of interacting with games in
[04:30.040 --> 04:33.440]  medicine you have artificial hearts or people that have some sort of chip in
[04:33.440 --> 04:37.600]  their body to be able to keep track of vital signs so it's a scary thing but
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.560]  not that scary when you want a game all right it's the Alex Jones show I am

[06:04.360 --> 06:08.360]  recent bailout international bankers and power brokers have engineered the
[06:08.360 --> 06:12.640]  current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour
[06:12.640 --> 06:16.400]  but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis will be on a
[06:16.400 --> 06:20.760]  scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty shelves will spread
[06:20.760 --> 06:24.280]  fear and panic across the land the insiders have discovered that they must
[06:24.280 --> 06:29.240]  control two things to seize total power phase one is a one-world currency which

[07:03.640 --> 07:08.360]  what seriously my memory and attention span is terrible I read something and
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.080]  forget I forget people's names I hear all this great information on the radio
[07:12.080 --> 07:16.920]  and I want to tell people but I forget I okay slow down poor attention and memory
[07:16.920 --> 07:20.760]  loss is not your fault factors like fluoride in the water aluminum and
[07:20.760 --> 07:25.320]  deodorants genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you
[07:25.320 --> 07:28.920]  it's all meant to dumb you down you know I can remember everything now even
[07:28.920 --> 07:33.480]  entire books what how there is this website called school of phenomenal
[07:33.480 --> 07:37.080]  memory their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory
[07:37.080 --> 07:41.000]  improvement in fact they guarantee that every single person will be able to

[07:51.560 --> 07:57.960]  back guarantee wow what's the website now don't forget it's P memory net the
[07:57.960 --> 08:03.320]  letter P memory net the genesis communications radio network probably
[08:03.320 --> 08:14.040]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:14.040 --> 08:18.840]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we were talking earlier about city group and
[08:18.840 --> 08:22.440]  it appears that they're already merging with Morgan Stanley so I mean it's
[08:22.440 --> 08:26.520]  already dead the question is when is it going to get to the point when people
[08:26.520 --> 08:32.840]  start running on their banks and under collapse is imminent I mean Paulson
[08:32.840 --> 08:37.240]  told you more banks were gonna go under after the bailout and I guess after the
[08:37.240 --> 08:40.280]  bailout when who did go under it might have been a little bit before I can't
[08:40.280 --> 08:44.360]  remember when it was bought up I guess you haven't seen any really faces of
[08:44.360 --> 08:47.880]  banks and your money being taken outright yet but it's really being taken
[08:47.880 --> 08:51.240]  because we're supposed to pay back this bailout which isn't seven hundred
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.080]  billion it's really in the trillions and trillions of dollars if you if you
[08:55.080 --> 09:00.600]  want to uh understand that more intricately I suggest you listen to
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.040]  the Chodosky interview that jones did a couple weeks ago I know what's up on
[09:04.040 --> 09:11.800]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot TV Bernanke CNN money yesterday more bank
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.000]  bailouts needed so again I predict more mergers will happen more banks will go
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.040]  under and they'll take more of your money but you know what
[09:22.040 --> 09:27.240]  president bush says this this is not the main thing that the administration
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.480]  should be worrying about the most important job I have had and the most
[09:31.480 --> 09:34.200]  important job the next president's going to have
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.280]  is to protect the American people from another attack
[09:38.280 --> 09:42.120]  and of course that was bush yesterday on larry king but I have other video of
[09:42.120 --> 09:44.760]  it all over where he basically says that the next
[09:44.760 --> 09:48.920]  administration is going to do the same thing don't worry
[09:48.920 --> 09:53.480]  newsweek is promoting how obama shouldn't give up any of the executive powers
[09:53.480 --> 09:56.440]  that we're giving him given to him under the bush and cheney administration
[09:56.440 --> 10:01.720]  don't worry we can we can trust the obama administration
[10:01.720 --> 10:06.520]  and what less than a week out from the end of the bush administration
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.160]  official guantanamo detainee was tortured and this is out of fox news by the
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.240]  way fox news is now reporting that there's actually torture going on at
[10:15.240 --> 10:19.400]  guantanamo bay really fox it seems like you're only about
[10:19.400 --> 10:25.560]  seven years behind the curve but of course you know they spin the article
[10:25.560 --> 10:28.760]  they needed to torture him because he was involved in the september 11th
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.880]  plots I hate to tell you but honestly
[10:33.880 --> 10:38.680]  um your buddy cheney there the guy who's uh supposedly the second commander in
[10:38.680 --> 10:44.440]  chief no no he was involved at any at a captain's type
[10:44.440 --> 10:49.480]  level in the 9-11 attacks it's just unbelievable
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.480]  all right I said I would play that uh clip of kucinich calling uh
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.360]  the federal reserve nothing more than federal express see some people are
[10:56.360 --> 10:59.240]  getting hip to their tricks and Dennis kucinich is one of them
[10:59.240 --> 11:05.560]  let's play the clip in 1913 the money power of the country was
[11:05.560 --> 11:11.080]  taken away from the people by constitutional privilege it belongs
[11:11.080 --> 11:16.120]  with the congress but it was given up in the federal reserve act
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.680]  federal reserve is no more federal than federal express
[11:20.680 --> 11:24.360]  but yet it has the power to determine the direction of use of money in our
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.600]  economy all right there you go Dennis
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.200]  bravo I really wish we could get the couscous on I mean
[11:32.200 --> 11:35.960]  he's on the floor he's the one saying you know what uh we don't need the federal
[11:35.960 --> 11:38.280]  reserve and uh this is part of the problem
[11:38.280 --> 11:42.040]  oh why are we only talking about just giving bankers money that doesn't seem
[11:42.040 --> 11:45.880]  like a great idea no I don't think it it seems like a great idea either Dennis I
[11:45.880 --> 11:51.880]  think it's a morbid and terrible idea in some of the more mainstream news I
[11:51.880 --> 11:56.760]  thought I'd go over today court okay sex between teachers
[11:56.760 --> 12:00.200]  and 18 year old girls now what's the problem with this well let's
[12:00.200 --> 12:03.880]  just start off by saying it's a huge problem
[12:05.080 --> 12:08.120]  you know when you get into college I guess it gets a little more blurry I mean
[12:08.120 --> 12:11.400]  these are 18 year olds they're adults when you when you meet them but these
[12:11.400 --> 12:14.440]  are kids that you've known sometimes since they were in kindergarten and
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.680]  smaller school districts okay uh so at the very least I think
[12:18.680 --> 12:22.040]  that teachers that you know have affairs with their students 18 or
[12:22.040 --> 12:25.560]  otherwise should be fired and under 18 they should be
[12:25.560 --> 12:29.880]  prosecuted to the fullest extent of law I don't think that's too much to ask it
[12:29.880 --> 12:33.880]  happens a lot more than you would think and now that the court has okayed
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.520]  this is at an AP watching the state law does not bar teachers from having
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.760]  consensual sex with 18 year old students and appeals court ruled Tuesday in
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.120]  dismissing a case against a former high school teacher
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.680]  unbelievable of course the teacher had three kids you know and a wife
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.280]  but uh no big deal no big deal he's having sex with 18 year old students
[12:54.280 --> 12:57.320]  come on and chances are that this was taking
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.880]  place before she was 18 just my two cents
[13:01.880 --> 13:05.080]  we're gonna take your calls after 30 minutes and then remember at the top of
[13:05.080 --> 13:08.600]  the second hour we're gonna have michael revero on prison planet dot tv via
[13:08.600 --> 13:11.560]  webcam I really want to get his take on the
[13:11.560 --> 13:16.040]  obama uh staff administrations or uh staff picks because
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.720]  his chief of staff um a rob manuel is calling for a draft he's he's openly
[13:21.720 --> 13:24.840]  talked about this service 18 to 25 three months
[13:24.840 --> 13:28.200]  of basic training two years mandatory service
[13:28.200 --> 13:31.320]  um it's going to be featured in the new obama picture that's coming up
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.760]  you know working hard on right now and uh
[13:36.760 --> 13:40.360]  you know I think he I don't want to call him too much of an obama cheerleader
[13:40.360 --> 13:42.920]  but obviously he was for him in the election
[13:42.920 --> 13:46.520]  and yesterday I heard him on his radio program saying that he was already
[13:46.520 --> 13:49.880]  unhappy with a lot of the pics yeah me too he's keeping robert gates on
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.000]  he's talked about putting more troops into afghanistan you see it's just going
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.160]  to be a redistribute it's a redistribution of troops from iraq into
[13:57.160 --> 14:00.680]  afghanistan that's all it's going to be where our presence in the middle east
[14:00.680 --> 14:03.720]  isn't going to go anywhere
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.000]  man on a global scale but you know what people are really paying attention to
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.240]  they're not paying attention to this you know geopolitical
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.680]  strategy that's you know going on through our banking systems
[14:16.680 --> 14:19.800]  and through our military apparatus they're paying attention to the fact that
[14:19.800 --> 14:25.560]  some girl is selling her virginity online for 3.7 million dollars
[14:25.560 --> 14:28.680]  and you know what i'm going to talk about it for a second because number one
[14:28.680 --> 14:31.480]  it's absolutely ridiculous the girls not doing anything illegal it's going to be
[14:31.480 --> 14:34.280]  held at the bunny ranch so everything sanctioned
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.800]  but first of all she's 22 now do you really believe
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.640]  that a 22 year old virgin is going to be the type of girl
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.880]  to sell it on on so i don't know what auctioning network it is
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.880]  for 3.7 million dollars now she's probably a liar
[14:51.880 --> 14:55.240]  and you know what the guy that pays you know four or five million for it gets
[14:55.240 --> 14:58.840]  what he deserves i mean it's absolutely ridiculous it shows you
[14:58.840 --> 15:02.680]  how degradated the entire society is when
[15:02.680 --> 15:06.920]  that's one of the top stories and yes she's being bashed in the media but
[15:06.920 --> 15:10.120]  just the fact that somebody's willing to pay millions and millions of dollars
[15:10.120 --> 15:14.040]  for that should let you know that there are sickos out there
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.960]  that are willing to pay even more for child snuff films or even worse
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.200]  you know to be with a child barney frank um you know and then
[15:22.200 --> 15:28.360]  still stay into uh congress and push the bailout you know you know what barney
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.640]  frank really does need to be exposed more and more and more i mean when

[15:51.800 --> 15:55.400]  and administrations that plant other you know
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.800]  male prostitutes in the white house james gucker james gannon
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.040]  and have them pose as members of the media fake right wing blogs
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.440]  under assumed names and then you know beyond four or five
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.120]  you know am towards the white house what's going on there
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.760]  well it's pretty obvious what's going on there but the uh the public can see that
[16:16.760 --> 16:21.160]  on the mainstream it can be on you know cnn headline news and in the news but
[16:21.160 --> 16:23.640]  you know it's a big joke no one can put two and two together
[16:23.640 --> 16:28.840]  boy those reporters are pretty dumb when they want to be huh
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.760]  you know that's why we need your help here and uh
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.760]  right now tyranny crusher one is over the fifty thousand dollar

[16:41.640 --> 16:45.480]  i think it's about 13 hours away from from totally
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.720]  done this now there's probably going to be a lot of fake bids on there because
[16:49.720 --> 16:53.480]  people think they're funny uh you know people want to hurt this
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.720]  operation and you know the guys that are running
[16:57.720 --> 17:01.000]  aren't the most savvy on ebay so they don't know how to just immediately
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.880]  block somebody when it's obviously a fake bid
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.400]  you know if you've got two rating or a one rating
[17:07.400 --> 17:10.920]  you're not for real we know that but there are plenty of people with
[17:10.920 --> 17:14.280]  you know ratings in the hundreds that are bidding on this
[17:14.280 --> 17:16.840]  and we hope that you guys can take it to the next level

[17:23.800 --> 17:27.720]  but uh it's it's a short staffed operation and the money bomb really helped
[17:27.720 --> 17:30.920]  i mean the difference in the two offices
[17:30.920 --> 17:35.240]  here are night and day i mean night and day
[17:35.240 --> 17:39.160]  from what they were only six months ago when i first

[17:54.360 --> 18:00.360]  mantelpiece it really is a piece of history
[18:00.360 --> 18:03.800]  this story also caught my eye today man really blitzing through the news
[18:03.800 --> 18:08.920]  in the first 20 minutes courts try to decide what to do with manwell
[18:08.920 --> 18:14.440]  noriega now remember manwell noriega 26 year
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.080]  cia veteran helped us ship in the cocaine from panama in south america
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.240]  that guy and then as soon as it started going public what did we do we went in
[18:23.240 --> 18:26.440]  we got him we treated him like the enemy as soon as he tried to
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.480]  really get under the grips of united states control he had a cup he held a
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.040]  couple summits with other south american leaders
[18:36.040 --> 18:40.360]  and uh basically was saying you know how can we get away from these guys what
[18:40.360 --> 18:44.680]  what what can we do and the u.s didn't like that and now he's been demonized
[18:44.680 --> 18:48.360]  and he's been held for about 16 months longer
[18:48.360 --> 18:54.920]  than uh than his sentence commanded but they're asking what what
[18:54.920 --> 18:58.680]  what should they do with him well number one
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.200]  they probably never want to let this guy speak in a public forum again because
[19:02.200 --> 19:05.080]  he knows too many of the american players i'm surprised they haven't killed
[19:05.080 --> 19:10.040]  him he's 74 years old in fact have we ever seen noriega on television ever
[19:10.040 --> 19:16.120]  in any type of trial or hearing since they got him in the 80s
[19:16.120 --> 19:19.880]  you know i'd love someone to call me in and call into the show and let me know
[19:19.880 --> 19:24.200]  because i don't think we have noriega was captured in panama by u.s
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.080]  military forces completing his prison sentence for drug trafficking and
[19:27.080 --> 19:30.600]  money laundering in september of 2007 but remains in prison until the courts
[19:30.600 --> 19:35.160]  can decide where he should go so many people want a piece of them
[19:35.160 --> 19:39.320]  but they don't want to openly speak about working with us intelligence to
[19:39.320 --> 19:41.960]  ship in cocaine i'm sure that's not on the agenda

[33:05.960 --> 33:18.040]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[33:18.040 --> 33:22.760]  so i pulled up this new global elite newsweek cover
[33:22.760 --> 33:26.200]  we'll be showing it later when we broadcast on prismplanet.tv remember we
[33:26.200 --> 33:30.520]  have microvaro coming up in less than 30 minutes
[33:30.520 --> 33:36.280]  and we also have um reba govern in the following hour
[33:36.280 --> 33:39.320]  now i guess this isn't what you know the regular weekly issue
[33:39.320 --> 33:42.360]  it just has obama in it i can definitely see what he's talking about with the
[33:42.360 --> 33:45.400]  moloch resemblance in the two eyeballs but it has a lot of duality
[33:45.400 --> 33:50.120]  basically it's a it's a mirrored image the left side is the right side mirrored
[33:50.120 --> 33:53.480]  um text mars would probably have a ball with it
[33:53.480 --> 33:56.600]  and i hope he checks it out you know someone shoot him an email
[33:56.600 --> 34:00.760]  i'm not a huge expert i do read you know i read the books they carry here i've
[34:00.760 --> 34:05.320]  read codex magica mysterious monuments is in my bathroom right now
[34:05.320 --> 34:09.000]  another great way to support us get get a copy of those books i think text does
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.120]  great work so later on we'll be showing that newsweek cover it is awfully
[34:14.120 --> 34:17.480]  bizarre but uh right now before i go back to your calls
[34:17.480 --> 34:21.560]  i'd really like to play let's let's play this msnbc clip first
[34:21.560 --> 34:26.440]  and then we'll play what was on fox and friends two days ago
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.920]  tuition of the military draft should be considered
[34:30.920 --> 34:35.800]  and has always been an option on the table a pentagon spokesman frontly
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.680]  rejected the idea today saying that the military is giving the idea quote
[34:40.680 --> 34:46.760]  absolutely no consideration unquote but is it time to revive conscription for
[34:46.760 --> 34:50.600]  the first time since richard nixon back to discuss it our democratic
[34:50.600 --> 34:53.320]  strategist stephanie cutter and editor of the
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.160]  washington times editorial page tony blankly
[34:57.160 --> 35:00.360]  tony uh just seemed to be political year
[35:00.360 --> 35:03.240]  nobody's going to recommend a return to the draft
[35:03.240 --> 35:07.400]  but is the draft a good idea or is a partial draft a good idea
[35:07.400 --> 35:11.720]  we got five thousand troops in the army it is breaking according to the army
[35:11.720 --> 35:16.760]  chief of staff on the basis of two small guerrilla wars
[35:16.760 --> 35:20.360]  now is the u.s army big enough and strong enough
[35:20.360 --> 35:23.320]  to handle all the commitments this country's got it's not going to happen
[35:23.320 --> 35:28.200]  on bush's watch because it's not time for for for that debate to occur
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.840]  but the military clearly is not big enough to do the job that's going to be
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.720]  required of it uh in a world that we live in today
[35:35.720 --> 35:39.880]  and into the into the foreseeable future as you say all right right there
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.480]  all right right there he says not going to happen
[35:43.480 --> 35:47.480]  on bush's watch because it's not time for that debate yet no the time has come
[35:47.480 --> 35:52.360]  when we have obama saying that everybody needs to give a new service
[35:52.360 --> 35:56.200]  a new sacrifice for the united states of america
[35:56.200 --> 35:59.640]  and now our good our good buddies at fox and friends
[35:59.640 --> 36:03.080]  are now promoting this man's book which is on the shelves two days ago a little
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.080]  over a year later and it's called grit i believe
[36:07.080 --> 36:10.440]  and i'm sure it's going to be a new york times number one bestseller and
[36:10.440 --> 36:14.040]  what's he calling for let's hit the clip welcome back everyone seven minutes
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.240]  before the top of the hour can america's power last forever and how do we
[36:17.240 --> 36:21.720]  achieve a new nationalism that puts our country's survival first those
[36:21.720 --> 36:24.760]  questions and more are addressed in a brand new book by tony
[36:24.760 --> 36:27.880]  blankley comes out today it's called american grit what will it take for
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.680]  america to survive and win in the 21st century and join us for his
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.520]  first tv interview about the book is tony blankley tony good morning to you
[36:36.520 --> 36:40.360]  good morning thank you you know uh if you read some of the european papers
[36:40.360 --> 36:43.800]  they're talking about america is finally in decline
[36:43.800 --> 36:48.600]  they're getting what they've had coming to them all along do you believe that
[36:48.600 --> 36:52.920]  well it could be so we have it in our power not to be in decline and that's
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.320]  what my book's about i do believe that for the first time in our history if we
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.880]  don't do a lot of things smart and tough we could get overwhelmed by the rise of
[37:01.880 --> 37:04.760]  china the rise of india the rise of radical islam
[37:04.760 --> 37:09.400]  we've failed to exploit our energy uh... well educate we're not paying enough
[37:09.400 --> 37:11.560]  attention to what our kids are learning bill
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.440]  airs is actually a senior person in guiding the curriculum design of america
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.400]  that started just this last march so i but we have it in our power right i try
[37:21.400 --> 37:24.440]  to write some tough proposals for what we need to do
[37:24.440 --> 37:27.720]  so that our grandchildren live in a country strong enough to protect our
[37:27.720 --> 37:30.840]  freedoms just as we do yeah tony your books can get a lot of attention
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.520]  because there are some controversial bold suggestions
[37:34.520 --> 37:37.640]  the first one obviously that caught my eye was that you're calling for a
[37:37.640 --> 37:41.960]  universal draft which would mean that all eighteen year olds in america
[37:41.960 --> 37:47.160]  would have to serve for two years yes look i don't like it i i love the
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.080]  volunteer army i've got a son who's a second lieutenant in the volunteer
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.840]  army i know the young men and women who serve they're the greatest
[37:54.840 --> 37:58.840]  young kids we we've ever produced but we don't have enough troops and it's
[37:58.840 --> 38:02.280]  manifest that we don't buy several magnitudes for instance
[38:02.280 --> 38:06.440]  when uh... george bush wanted to have the search he was told
[38:06.440 --> 38:09.960]  by the senior generals we have a right there see it look at all these
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.480]  excuses i love the volunteer army i'd rather have that but we just can't
[38:15.480 --> 38:19.080]  surge and stop wars without more people
[38:19.080 --> 38:21.960]  no it's never going to be enough there's always going to be these backdoor
[38:21.960 --> 38:26.920]  excuses it's a total doublespeak uh... we could have been in and out of our
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.720]  racket any moment any moment but that wasn't the plan the
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.800]  plan is to build a eurasian union so we're going to stick it out
[38:35.800 --> 38:42.440]  and uh... as we de-escalate troops over there we're just going to re-escalate
[38:42.440 --> 38:47.800]  troops in afghanistan maintaining our united states military presence
[38:47.800 --> 38:54.680]  in the middle east i mean it it's so simple
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.680]  and then you're going to have goons like this guy just i wish we could keep that
[38:58.680 --> 39:01.720]  that same military and the cover story of the regular news and
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.040]  newsweek not the new global elite issue with obama and all this symbolism on
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.920]  the cover is the article we covered here yesterday
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.880]  obama's cheney dilemma it says cheney uh... you know we just admitted on fox
[39:15.880 --> 39:18.920]  news that we torture people in guantanamo bay and
[39:18.920 --> 39:22.360]  maybe these powers aren't the best thing ever but
[39:22.360 --> 39:25.880]  don't worry the obama administration is going to use these powers well we're not
[39:25.880 --> 39:28.840]  going to get rid of any of
[39:28.840 --> 39:32.600]  and that's literally what this three page article is talking about
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.080]  it's it's probably even more in the magazine
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.720]  um... but it you know it's unbelievable
[39:41.720 --> 39:44.920]  it is a liberal shibboleth that torture doesn't work
[39:44.920 --> 39:49.080]  that suspects will say anything including lies to stop the pain
[39:49.080 --> 39:53.880]  but the reality is perhaps less clear obama keep the torture
[39:53.880 --> 39:59.560]  it's unreal i guess i guess it's not
[39:59.560 --> 40:02.920]  i guess it's not surprised it was called on this show
[40:02.920 --> 40:06.760]  but you know they're like oh he's gonna have to face these difficult choices and
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.080]  we really we really need obama to face these difficult choices with all these
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.080]  powers because these powers are important
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.560]  unbelievable unbelievable
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.240]  all right we're gonna go back to your calls i mean of course the obama
[40:23.240 --> 40:25.240]  administration is not going to get rid of this
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.520]  this stuff of course the wars are going to keep going in the middle east of
[40:28.520 --> 40:33.240]  course there's going to be more of a consolidation of of power by the bankers
[40:33.240 --> 40:37.320]  all right let's go to mike in ohio mike what's on your mind
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.000]  okay man well noriega let me tell you what i recall about all that i was
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.440]  serving in the military at that time uh... here with somebody now keep in
[40:46.440 --> 40:49.400]  mind i've studied uh... this thing the globalism
[40:49.400 --> 40:52.840]  since about nineteen eighty three is when i uh...
[40:52.840 --> 40:55.640]  had a look at things and started looking at things oddly
[40:55.640 --> 41:01.000]  he was a sidebar player in all this i can remember looking watching NBC news
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.400]  uh... the news media ramped up on him about uh... ten days prior to their
[41:05.400 --> 41:08.360]  invasion which means troops were already getting ready
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.280]  to go down there uh... with an evening uh... a weekday evening
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.720]  uh... maybe a monday evening he was on uh... they showed him
[41:15.720 --> 41:18.520]  behind a podium giving a speech to his people
[41:18.520 --> 41:21.720]  and he was waving the saber around you may recall seeing that he said i'm going
[41:21.720 --> 41:26.200]  to tell the world what george bush is about who he really is
[41:26.200 --> 41:28.840]  he got up the next morning turned on the television there were twenty seven
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.480]  thousand troops on the ground and they're in Panama
[41:33.480 --> 41:36.520]  and uh... that's how they went no you've never heard anything
[41:36.520 --> 41:39.560]  out of him they've stuck him in a prison in miami somewhere you've never heard
[41:39.560 --> 41:42.680]  him uh... in front of a judge telling his side of the story
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.360]  nothing that's how far back they put him in there so what do you think is going
[41:46.360 --> 41:49.720]  to happen now i mean uh... france is asking for his extradition they're
[41:49.720 --> 41:53.480]  claiming that the geneva conventions uh... entitle them to this
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.000]  of course his liars are saying hey he just served his sentence
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.600]  and this is a non wartime uh... charge and he served his sentence so what why
[42:02.600 --> 42:05.960]  isn't he being extradited home of course they don't want a story out what do you
[42:05.960 --> 42:08.600]  think will will come of uh... manuel
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.120]  i think that uh... he'll probably go to europe uh... bf
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.520]  i'll be let go there uh... just like other people it's have to in the past
[42:16.520 --> 42:19.160]  he'll be in france will turn him loose you'll never hear anything about him
[42:19.160 --> 42:22.360]  because the news media will not cover him uh... he'll be
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.440]  as i said given some sidebar status uh...
[42:26.440 --> 42:30.440]  uh... in the media and uh... you'll you'll never hear from him period
[42:30.440 --> 42:33.320]  uh... you might hear something about him in the european media
[42:33.320 --> 42:36.760]  but the people here in in this country really speak a single language anyway
[42:36.760 --> 42:39.800]  so it won't matter anymore
[42:39.800 --> 42:44.360]  and besides that it's twenty some years in the past if you know what it's still
[42:44.360 --> 42:47.960]  it's still matters in fact that we can expose it and let people know there's
[42:47.960 --> 42:51.080]  still a lot of people in denial they don't realize that the united states
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.800]  government runs the hard drugs in this country i thank you for the call i'm
[42:53.800 --> 42:58.520]  glad somebody did call on topic today and what do you know on topic phone calls
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.520]  and uh... i have to agree with him i i think that he might get
[43:02.520 --> 43:05.960]  extradited to another prison in france though france might just get their turn
[43:05.960 --> 43:08.440]  at him and what what the french will do will
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.200]  they'll uh... they'll purge him for intel that they don't have they'll try to
[43:12.200 --> 43:15.320]  piece some of the pieces together on the lower
[43:15.320 --> 43:19.480]  levels that happened in the eighties not that it isn't an international
[43:19.480 --> 43:22.680]  intelligence organization at the top because it completely and totally is
[43:22.680 --> 43:25.640]  but yeah i mean you're i don't think you're gonna hear from me there i'm
[43:25.640 --> 43:29.160]  kind of shocked that this is even in the news it's it was updated just before i
[43:29.160 --> 43:34.280]  got into the studio all right let's go to brad in california brad what's on your
[43:34.280 --> 43:35.000]  mind
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.280]  hey shout out from chico here in california
[43:38.280 --> 43:43.160]  i just wanted to update uh... you guys on some things that are going on here and
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.880]  the yesterday show reminded me of this about the farm people getting raided
[43:47.880 --> 43:51.880]  uh... about a year and a half ago i lived on the property of a church here in
[43:51.880 --> 43:58.040]  chico that was raided by the police uh... for no reason they had no warrant
[43:58.040 --> 44:01.880]  uh... fifteen to twenty armed men came on the property some of them dressed in
[44:01.880 --> 44:03.560]  riot gear
[44:03.560 --> 44:04.680]  uh...
[44:04.680 --> 44:06.920]  roustous all out of the house
[44:06.920 --> 44:11.400]  took our ideas and and uh... just scared the crap out of us basically
[44:11.400 --> 44:14.680]  and why did they do this with what was there and what they said that there were
[44:14.680 --> 44:16.600]  known felons there
[44:16.600 --> 44:17.640]  okay
[44:17.640 --> 44:22.040]  and the church it's a registered you know church and everything
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.200]  is run by kind of radical local guy and it was just basically is it turns out
[44:26.200 --> 44:30.280]  just to shake down to scare him he was running for congress at the time
[44:30.280 --> 44:32.920]  really so nobody actually got charged with anything
[44:32.920 --> 44:35.400]  nobody got charged with anything at all
[44:35.400 --> 44:39.560]  wow all of our information took all of our ideas made us all come out of the
[44:39.560 --> 44:41.640]  house they didn't come in the house
[44:41.640 --> 44:44.040]  but it's a good idea to have a warrant
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.040]  yeah it was a fifty acre property and they they came and took all of our info
[44:48.040 --> 44:50.120]  and that's just one incident
[44:50.120 --> 44:54.920]  i mean recently there was a riot here at chico state with the students
[44:54.920 --> 44:56.600]  i'm hearing about that
[44:56.600 --> 44:58.480]  uh... you can see it on youtube
[44:58.480 --> 45:01.560]  really and what it would have were they're writing about what doesn't stop
[45:01.560 --> 45:05.240]  there are they that the police that they the city council passed a local
[45:05.240 --> 45:09.400]  ordinance here prohibiting large gatherings of people
[45:09.400 --> 45:13.160]  and so what they went and did is broke up all the parties around campus all at
[45:13.160 --> 45:14.520]  one time
[45:14.520 --> 45:17.320]  so they flushed about fifteen hundred drunk
[45:17.320 --> 45:21.160]  college students into the street all at one time
[45:21.160 --> 45:25.160]  and lo and behold they show up all in riot gear with the fire truck spraying
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.000]  everybody down and everything what a coincidence
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.760]  really miss on youtube
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.640]  yeah it's on youtube police right yeah just just check chico riots and you'll
[45:33.640 --> 45:34.360]  see
[45:34.360 --> 45:37.560]  well we're going to check that out maybe we can have air into a story on it
[45:37.560 --> 45:40.000]  yeah look here doesn't stop there
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.440]  that after the riot
[45:42.440 --> 45:48.840]  the chico police associations posted it on youtube a propaganda video
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.920]  it's saying how proposition two fifteen causes crime and how they need more
[45:52.920 --> 45:56.320]  police officers because of the local riot
[45:56.320 --> 45:59.720]  it look at it also basically they're trying to turn this incident to more
[45:59.720 --> 46:02.360]  funding for them not a shock i thank you for the call brad
[46:02.360 --> 46:05.160]  hopefully dice can take a look at that with you know he's got so much on his
[46:05.160 --> 46:05.880]  plate but
[46:05.880 --> 46:09.480]  i have not heard about that chico state riots and uh...
[46:09.480 --> 46:11.880]  i will be looking into that later in the afternoon
[46:11.880 --> 46:15.520]  alright let's go to our next caller let's go to jimmy in michigan jimmy
[46:15.520 --> 46:16.720]  what's on your mind
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.360]  hey how's it going uh... just to uh... let's just listen to your show and at
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.880]  the end the gentleman was talking about buying a cow
[46:24.880 --> 46:28.960]  uh... if you're right if you live in my i live near an arbor if you live in an
[46:28.960 --> 46:31.760]  arbor apartment you can't have a car
[46:31.760 --> 46:35.160]  you know if you got on your college
[46:35.160 --> 46:36.680]  and uh... but
[46:36.680 --> 46:41.480]  what what they did did here in washington county is you own the cow
[46:41.480 --> 46:43.400]  in indiana
[46:43.400 --> 46:44.880]  and then they
[46:44.880 --> 46:48.600]  when you paid for the milk you didn't buy the milk you were just paying for the
[46:48.600 --> 46:50.760]  feeding and care of the cow
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.440]  you got the milk and the cheese for free
[46:53.440 --> 46:56.560]  and they got raided and busted by the u.s.p.a.
[46:56.560 --> 46:57.720]  because of
[46:57.720 --> 46:59.120]  interstate commerce
[46:59.120 --> 47:02.720]  wow you know i would love you to send us that story because that's a great that
[47:02.720 --> 47:03.320]  is
[47:03.320 --> 47:04.480]  first of all that's a
[47:04.480 --> 47:07.240]  an ingenious way of having a co-op
[47:07.240 --> 47:10.120]  when you don't live next to you know farmers you know when you don't live in
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.800]  that type of community i think that's a that's genius
[47:12.800 --> 47:15.560]  uh... but of course they're gonna go after you i'm sure
[47:15.560 --> 47:18.800]  might might not have been in michigan they've been all right but because the
[47:18.800 --> 47:22.280]  college we're in indiana and across the line
[47:22.280 --> 47:26.040]  the i cc in the u s d a dot
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.040]  you know on my way over here i i believe i was listening to the fact that uh...
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.400]  now they they they're trying to pass a ruling where
[47:33.400 --> 47:35.360]  will be a new marking on me
[47:35.360 --> 47:39.800]  and no longer will it just be u s d a grade beef it'll be
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.720]  be from all or produce from all over the world and just have a new sticker on it
[47:43.720 --> 47:45.680]  saying it's other country
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.440]  and if we're going to start shipping and yeah other other countries
[47:49.440 --> 47:53.280]  me which i think is a completely insane idea
[47:53.280 --> 47:54.600]  number one is it'll kill the
[47:54.600 --> 47:56.800]  the farm here number two is being you know
[47:56.800 --> 47:58.640]  it probably won't be as healthy folks
[47:58.640 --> 48:02.800]  um... i can totally see that it's it's unreal what we've gotten into and uh...
[48:02.800 --> 48:05.720]  i hope that you know we can fight this and we can reverse those laws because
[48:05.720 --> 48:06.440]  that is
[48:06.440 --> 48:09.720]  an interesting way to have a co-op when you do have an apartment i think for the
[48:09.720 --> 48:10.480]  call
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.520]  alright let's go to brian in pennsylvania brian what's on your mind
[48:15.520 --> 48:16.120]  hello
[48:16.120 --> 48:16.960]  yes sir
[48:16.960 --> 48:18.480]  a jason uh...
[48:18.480 --> 48:21.040]  uh... one of the column
[48:21.040 --> 48:23.560]  i appreciate you cori and
[48:23.560 --> 48:24.400]  all of the
[48:24.400 --> 48:26.480]  bill and the work you guys did on
[48:26.480 --> 48:27.880]  um... loose change
[48:27.880 --> 48:29.880]  thank you as a great americans
[48:29.880 --> 48:31.360]  that's first thing on
[48:31.360 --> 48:34.880]  my question though is um... kind of a two-part question um...
[48:34.880 --> 48:36.280]  now um...
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.120]  you know a whole lot about ron paul in particular
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.280]  sure i hate to get off topic here but i don't know i'm sure yeah i know
[48:44.280 --> 48:45.840]  quite a bit about mister paul
[48:45.840 --> 48:49.960]  okay um... now i've been following mister paul and um... i'm a big supporter
[48:49.960 --> 48:53.720]  i've read his book um... i've actually went out to several people to
[48:53.720 --> 48:55.840]  read for themselves to hopefully
[48:55.840 --> 48:59.240]  get them to realize you know i mean a good politician and what a good
[48:59.240 --> 49:01.440]  politician stands for but um...
[49:01.440 --> 49:04.320]  i was just looking around on youtube this morning and um...
[49:04.320 --> 49:06.400]  i'd seen this video about um...
[49:06.400 --> 49:07.280]  ron paul
[49:07.280 --> 49:08.840]  and free masonry
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.000]  uh... now i know there's different lot of this information out there but i
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.760]  guess i try to continue to do more research on
[49:14.760 --> 49:17.460]  free mason handshakes and free mason signals
[49:17.460 --> 49:19.560]  but different signs they make and
[49:19.560 --> 49:24.760]  uh... i think they have a consensus view that
[49:24.760 --> 49:27.000]  the signs they were shown on youtube
[49:27.000 --> 49:27.760]  seem to be
[49:27.760 --> 49:30.160]  the sonic sign
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.880]  i've heard this room or two it's been posted on my youtube page and uh... you
[49:33.880 --> 49:36.920]  know i don't i don't give much credence to have seen the videos i've never seen
[49:36.920 --> 49:40.800]  him interacting with somebody else and throwing up a a sign i mean he's he
[49:40.800 --> 49:43.000]  apparently he's got some arthritis in his hands
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.560]  i mean i've thrown up the hook em horns and not because i'm a texas fan
[49:46.560 --> 49:49.920]  because i was an ignorant kid at rock shows you know i mean i i'm not my son
[49:49.920 --> 49:50.880]  like at all
[49:50.880 --> 49:52.560]  um...
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.880]  you know when i see world leaders doing it when you know when i look at you
[49:56.880 --> 49:59.640]  know tex marz information that i plugged earlier today
[49:59.640 --> 50:02.960]  i give him about first of all he comes at it from a massive christian
[50:02.960 --> 50:06.440]  perspective you know i i don't think that he is able to
[50:06.440 --> 50:08.520]  come in from a
[50:08.520 --> 50:11.400]  you know kind of like a blind perspective he he does take the christian
[50:11.400 --> 50:14.760]  but at the other other end of it he does know a lot of these babelonian symbols
[50:14.760 --> 50:17.000]  these masonic symbols these
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.520]  mystery religions
[50:18.520 --> 50:19.760]  things that
[50:19.760 --> 50:23.600]  you know i'm not as familiar with so i i i take that stuff with a grain of
[50:23.600 --> 50:26.660]  salt i think there's no doubt when you see somebody like pat robertson on the
[50:26.660 --> 50:27.800]  cover of uh...
[50:27.800 --> 50:31.680]  time magazine throwing up the bear claw that he's throwing up the bear claw
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.720]  you know and i think a lot of these
[50:33.720 --> 50:36.800]  george bush and family rock in the hook of horns
[50:36.800 --> 50:40.440]  and uh... the inauguration ceremony eight the hook of horns
[50:40.440 --> 50:44.520]  i don't think you know ron paul is on team the mason's he's done too much to
[50:44.520 --> 50:45.600]  fight
[50:45.600 --> 50:48.960]  the power structure campaign for liberty is an ingenious idea we've got

[55:29.480 --> 55:30.480]  Alright, let's go to Vic in Michigan.
[55:30.480 --> 55:33.480]  Hey Jason, how's it going?
[55:33.480 --> 55:34.480]  Good man, how you doing?
[55:34.480 --> 55:35.480]  Not too bad.
[55:35.480 --> 55:43.880]  Hey, I was just playing in Photoshop with that download from Newsweek, and I did some
[55:43.880 --> 55:52.080]  pixelization distortion, and I'll send it to you on email, but it definitely has the
[55:52.080 --> 55:55.520]  big worlds on the top right hand side, I saw it.
[55:55.520 --> 56:01.200]  It's also, it's a mirror image from the middle, which is kind of popular right now in t-shirts
[56:01.200 --> 56:08.760]  and even artwork, and again, just the outline of Obama himself with the little, you know,
[56:08.760 --> 56:12.080]  I mean they are promoting this, he's on the cover of everything, did you see the Rolling
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.200]  Stone cover, by the way?
[56:15.200 --> 56:20.080]  They made him out to be God, I mean that's what he is, he's in the clouds, he has like
[56:20.080 --> 56:25.560]  a lightning ominous glow, I just don't like how somebody who's unproven, somebody who
[56:25.560 --> 56:31.680]  is a state senator for most of his career, somebody who comes out in 2004 gives the Democratic
[56:31.680 --> 56:38.000]  National Convention keynote address, he's then put into the actual Senate, and he serves
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.520]  less than four years in the actual Senate in 2007, is when he actually, and believe
[56:43.520 --> 56:46.640]  me it was planned before 2007, he was going to be running for president, but he announces
[56:46.640 --> 56:52.480]  it in 2007, and he wins, and it's not just vote Obama, vote Obama, it's again, you see
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.640]  this stuff in the hip hop stores, I'm glad you said that because I had one of these guys
[56:57.640 --> 57:03.320]  I talked to on Myspace, he does custom artwork for shoes and hats and stuff, so he does painting
[57:03.320 --> 57:08.600]  and stitching, and he's getting tons of Obama orders, and he's like, look Jason I can't,
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.000]  I can't turn this away, this is how I make my living, and he was telling me how one of
[57:12.000 --> 57:19.880]  his associates just charged $400 for a pair of Obama custom converse, it's insane.
[57:19.880 --> 57:26.560]  It's just amazing, but hey I'm also, I just want to let you know, I'm an electronic engineer,
[57:26.560 --> 57:32.360]  I think I talked to you on Monday, but anyways, I know you guys are building a new studio,
[57:32.360 --> 57:38.080]  and I would like to offer my services to you guys, I am an electronic engineer, I can design
[57:38.080 --> 57:42.320]  all kinds of audio equipment interfaces, and I've got a lot of stuff to tell you about.
[57:42.320 --> 57:45.920]  Tell you what, send your information over to erranfowars.com, he's the one that's going
[57:45.920 --> 57:50.960]  through all that, I thank you for the call Joshua, erranfowars.com, I mean I know that
[57:50.960 --> 57:57.000]  Aaron gets a ton of stuff, but he really is the conduit for which all this takes place.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.040]  Alright last caller before the break, let's go to Tom in Colorado, Tom what's on your
[58:01.040 --> 58:02.040]  mind?
[58:02.040 --> 58:04.320]  Tom are you with us?
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.840]  I'm running the inauguration today, what about the inauguration?
[58:08.840 --> 58:14.800]  At least Obama's supposed to be tested, I'm wondering whether they're going to test him
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.160]  or go ahead and kill him off and go ahead and start the race war.
[58:19.160 --> 58:24.560]  Alright of course we just couldn't help but have that token racist phone call here at
[58:24.560 --> 58:25.880]  the end of the hour.
[58:25.880 --> 58:31.280]  Folks, they're not going to start any race war with Obama, they like him a lot, he reaches
[58:31.280 --> 58:35.000]  out to the people, he moves people, it's about a movement, we have Mike Rivera on the other
[58:35.000 --> 59:01.480]  side, it's the Alex Jones show, PrismPlanet.com.
[59:01.480 --> 59:24.560]  Let's
[59:24.560 --> 59:29.960]  or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com, visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the
[59:29.960 --> 59:33.960]  final list of high-quality freeze-dried dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[59:50.320 --> 59:58.720]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:12.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:23.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:31.880]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. It is the 14th day of January, Wednesday,
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:36.000]  2009. I am not Alex Jones, I am Jason Burma sitting in all week. Welcome
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:42.680]  to PrismPlanet.tv, subscribers. Right now, we have a guest who's had one of the most
[1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:46.480]  effective websites for truth out there over the past decade or so. I think it's
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:49.520]  even, it might even be more than 10 years old right now. It's one of the first
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.640]  things I found when I started looking into the truth, whatreallyhappened.com,
[1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:58.000]  Michael Rivera. And he's got a radio show as well, and he even appears in my
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.760]  little film, Fable Enemies, that came out in September. And we thank you for
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:05.960]  joining us, Michael. Well, thank you for having me on the show, Jason. Definitely
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.400]  a pleasure to be with you again. Awesome. And we love the new video cam. I mean,
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:16.040]  the technology is going up. Hopefully, we'll have a real station soon, like a
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:20.080]  real TV station. More people can get our information, but it is exploding. As the
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:23.720]  market crashes, I see more and more visitors, more and more people actually
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:28.560]  listening to what we have to say. And I really want to talk to you about what
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:32.960]  you think is going to be happening in the next six to 12 months in this country.
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:37.280]  Well, unfortunately, I think we're heading into a very, very dark time
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:41.160]  economically and politically. And what you said about more and more people
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:44.440]  tuning into the alternative media, Genesis Communication Network, our
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:48.960]  various websites on the blogosphere, is a continuation of a trend as more and
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:53.640]  more American people and basically around the world come to understand that
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:58.960]  the corporate media is really a disinformation channel. They're turning
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:01.880]  away from it. They're turning to the alternative media to try and find out
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:05.920]  what's going on. In a lot of ways, this mirrors what we saw leading up to the
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:11.160]  decline and fall of the former Soviet Union, where the Russian people became
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:15.000]  very dissatisfied with what they were getting from Pravda and Isvestia. They
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:18.920]  began to realize there was a lot of lying and deception going on. They created
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:23.800]  their own populist media, the Samistat, to get information around. And ultimately,
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:27.960]  when the government lost the trust of the Russian people, it was no longer able
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:32.200]  to function. And that was basically, at that point, we knew the Soviet Union was
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:35.480]  going to collapse. And I think we're kind of in the same situation right now here
[1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:36.920]  in the United States.
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.920]  Where do you think all this bailout's going? I mean, we had Bernanke yesterday
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:44.040]  saying, look, we need more bailouts. Before that, Paulson said the bailouts that
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:48.400]  have come through, we're going to have more banks closed down anyway. And we
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.720]  still have not heard what the Obama stimulus package is going to be. We're
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:56.880]  now six days away from him coming into office. I mean, personally, I'm not too
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:59.600]  thrilled with this chief of staff, pick Robert Manuel. This is a guy that's
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:05.320]  calling for mandatory conscription of 18 to 25 year olds. So, I mean, when you
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:08.160]  saw his speech and he said, you know, this is going to be a time of great
[1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:11.320]  sacrifice and service for you, the people, do you think that that's in the
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:14.520]  cards? You think that we might have conscription? And where do you think all
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:19.120]  this banking mess is going to go? Well, as far as the conscription is concerned,
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:23.160]  it should be very obvious that Israel is trying to kick off a major regional war
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:27.600]  in the Middle East in which the United States will find itself mired. And once
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:31.640]  again, young American men and young American women are going to be playing
[1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:36.400]  bullet catchers for Israel's expansionist policy. So that's definitely in the
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:39.960]  works. Rahm Emanuel is very much in favor of that. He's very supportive of
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:44.480]  Israel. He's one of these individuals where we have to ask, where do their true
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:48.720]  loyalties lie? And if it's not with the United States, why isn't he in such a
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:53.840]  position of power? As far as the economy and the bailouts, it is, it's running
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:58.000]  absolutely out of control. But you need to understand that the whole point of the
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.160]  bailouts isn't so much where the money is being spent. It is merely that it is
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:07.000]  being borrowed and created, because if you look at the way our Federal Reserve
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.440]  operates, money does not exist until somebody is there to borrow it. When you
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:16.360]  sign that loan document at the bank, the bank literally creates the money you
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:21.560]  borrowed out of thin air. That's how the Federal Reserve system works. So what
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:26.760]  happened this last year is that the American people prudently stopped
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:31.240]  their borrowing. They slowed down because as our manufacturing jobs left to other
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:35.640]  countries, Americans realized we don't have the money to pay these debts, so we're
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  not going to borrow as much. We're not going to use our credit cards. We're not
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:45.360]  going to buy the bigger, flashy, gear car. So the government is borrowing on our
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:48.840]  behalf. That's what the bailout is. And we'll be paying it back, but we're not
[1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.960]  going to have any jobs to pay it back, so we're going to be in an interesting
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:57.840]  situation. It's the Alex Jones show, infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv.

[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:06.040]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:11.160]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the
[1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:15.760]  enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to
[1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:20.320]  Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:24.480]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some
[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:28.360]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:34.480]  spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:39.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:42.480]  Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war

[1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:09.560]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:18.880]  All right, folks, we are back. It's the Alex Jones show and a couple of other key
[1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:22.760]  appointments that we should really mention in the Obama administration
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:28.680]  that have occurred over the past couple of days. The fact that John Kerry is on
[1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:33.560]  board as the head of the Forum Relations Committee. And you know, some people
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:36.880]  might think that's the greatest thing since breakfast. I don't think it's the
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:41.040]  greatest thing ever. I mean, obviously, you know, Kerry was a front in 2004 to
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:44.920]  throw the election to Bush. I mean, he won the election. He didn't demand a
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:48.280]  recount. He didn't demand they even really count the votes at all. And then
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:52.960]  his new climate czar. His pick is global warming czar because we need a
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:58.920]  czar for global warming. Carol M. Browner, one of the 14 leaders of the
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:02.120]  Socialist Group Commission for a Sustainable World Society, which calls
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:06.080]  for global governance. Of course, when the Washington Times printed this article
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:10.280]  and people got wind of it, it was taken off within hours. So really not
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.520]  impressing me so much with the cabinet. I mean, he actually cracked jokes during
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:17.360]  the debate that he was going to have Hillary Clinton on his squad. Then
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:25.440]  him and Hillary snuck away together in DC, snuck away together in DC on the
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:29.000]  weekend of the Bilderberg meeting. And Gergen actually talked about that
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.080]  meeting. You know, they said there was a secret meeting. First, it was at
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:35.960]  Clinton's house. Then later they said it was at Diane Feinstein's. My guess is
[1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:39.400]  that it was probably with members of the Bilderberg group. I kind of want to get
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:43.240]  your opinion on that, too, Michael. But Gergen called it and said that they were
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:45.520]  probably talking about what her position was going to be, whether it was
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.600]  going to be secretary of state, or possibly somewhere else in the
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:53.240]  administration. What do you think about these backdoor secret meetings with
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:56.320]  Hillary Clinton? Do you think that they were over at the Bilderberg group? I
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:09:58.400]  mean, what's your opinion on that, Mike?
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.400]  Going on, and I think at the point where Hillary realized that she was not
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:08.640]  going to be able to win the nomination, she wanted to make the best deal for
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:13.920]  herself with Barack Obama and held over his head the nuclear option of getting
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:19.920]  her supporters to back John McCain. And I think up until the point that McCain
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:25.160]  picked Sarah Palin as his running mate, it was a credible threat. But I think
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:28.960]  John McCain aired on that, or maybe he was just looking at the way the
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:31.640]  country is headed and decided at the last second. Maybe he didn't want to be
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:36.200]  president after all. And I said, let's get a vice president that will end my
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:40.400]  candidacy, you know, graciously. And I'll take the rest of my campaign,
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:45.480]  war chest, and retire quietly. But yeah, there's obviously been a lot of deal
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:50.960]  making going on. Barack Obama obviously has made a lot of deals, which is why
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:55.480]  we have so many of the old Clinton cronies showing up in his administration.
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:59.720]  And it is very distressing for people who wanted to listen to his message of
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:05.000]  change that we can believe in, because we're not seeing change. Yeah, the guy in
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.240]  the Oval Office is different, but everything around him basically harkens
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:12.800]  back to the 1990s. And I'm very distressed by Hillary Clinton coming out and
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:17.400]  saying that she's just not going to negotiate with Hamas, because like it
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:21.440]  or not, Hamas is the elected government of another country. And that's the
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:26.040]  Secretary of State's job, is to talk to the elected government of other
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:29.680]  countries. And Hillary is starting out saying, I'm not going to do my job.
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.680]  Let's just drop bombs and get it over with. So that's a warning sign.
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.360]  Well, I'm glad you brought up the Middle East. How do you feel about the policy?
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.520]  I mean, Obama is openly talking about a redistribution of forces into
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:44.000]  Afghanistan. I mean, yes, we're going to see a de-escalation in Iraq, but he says
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.160]  we're going to send more troops into Afghanistan. I mean, I feel like all
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:51.840]  they're doing is keeping their presence there as more stabilization occurs in
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:56.560]  Iraq. I feel like the big plan is the Eurasian Union. Obviously, Israel is
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:01.400]  our ally. Saudi Arabia, we're still pretty much doing positive dealings with.
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:05.400]  The only rogue in that region is really Iran. I mean, Pakistan and India, you
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:09.640]  could argue, but Biden's out in Pakistan trying to smooth things over this week
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:16.760]  after the Mumbai attacks. Well, I feel like he's over there basically to see
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:21.360]  how much he has to cover up for our end. I mean, obviously, Biden is
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:24.840]  well aware of the ISI. He knew about the funding of the hijackers. We cover that
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:28.160]  in fabled enemies. There's no doubt about it. He was on the floor on the 12th
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:32.600]  talking about pretending to be our friend in Pakistan, yet he's meeting with the
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.440]  head of the ISI at that point. He knows of the dealings there, and so he goes
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:41.280]  there now after the Mumbai attacks, you know, lead back to an ISI asset, a CIA
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.920]  asset, and the governments of India are openly saying that Pakistani intelligence
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:49.880]  was involved, so he has to go over there. I don't think that we really want to
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:52.880]  bomb Pakistan, although that's been in the news lately, too. What do you think?
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:57.320]  You think we're going to bomb Pakistan? I think we're probably going to go into
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:01.240]  Pakistan, or we're going to support India going into Pakistan, because if you
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:06.240]  look at the geography of the region, you have got Afghanistan to the north, which
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:10.680]  is pretty much under US control nominally. You have India, which is very much an
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:15.480]  ally of the United States. For China to be able to send pipelines through to
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:20.240]  Middle East oil, they must go through Pakistan. So if we can turn Pakistan into
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:25.200]  a war zone, then that cuts China off from one of the resources they need
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:29.440]  industrially, and I think that's why there is so much pressure on Pakistan
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:36.680]  right now. It's kind of a repeat of what we saw the US try to do in Georgia and
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:41.320]  Ossetia, because that land corridor between the Caspian and the Black Sea was
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:46.400]  the only route by which Russia could militarily support Iran by ground convoy.
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:50.680]  And I think the goal there was to get a border war going, which would basically
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:56.120]  blockade those tunnels and prevent Russia from supporting Iran, but when that
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:00.160]  war didn't work out so well, I think that's when the push to invade Iran began
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:04.440]  to wane when they couldn't keep Russia out of the region. So they shifted over
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.000]  to Pakistan. Now Israel is talking about a bombing attack on Iran's nuclear
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.320]  infrastructure again. It's definitely a lot of chaos, and as I like to tell my
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:18.160]  own listeners, we're in a very awkward stage in our planet's history, where all
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:22.520]  of our immediate future is basically being determined by whichever world
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:26.600]  leader is the least mentally stable, and we've got some real nutcases in power
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:31.080]  right now. I agree with that. So you think that Iran is relatively going to be
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:36.440]  put on the back burner, and that the real conflict may be in Pakistan? I hope
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.640]  you're wrong. I hope that installing a new dictator will at least, you know, wave
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:43.880]  that off. You know, I figured that's what they were trying to do, do it
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:48.440]  diplomatically, but the rhetoric is there. I mean, they're talking about them
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:52.760]  being the new big enemy, and I think that just one type of terror event, either
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:57.240]  here or in Europe, being blamed on Pakistan, could be the catalyst to send,
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:03.000]  you know, our forces or NATO forces or UN forces in there, and that would be a
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.080]  total and complete nightmare. That might be, you know, most people were saying the
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:10.280]  Iran conflict was what was going to spark, you know, World War III, but a
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:15.600]  conflict with Pakistan could very well do the same. You're absolutely correct
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:20.520]  here, and the issue here isn't whether we want to go into Iran or we want to go
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:24.640]  into Pakistan. There are numerous players and numerous factions, and each has
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:29.320]  their own agenda. Israel still wants us to attack Iran. The US, I think, has
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:32.640]  decided they can't do it because they can't keep Russia from intervening
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.160]  militarily. So now they're looking at Pakistan, if for no other reason, then to
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:41.080]  block off China's access to Middle Eastern oil and force them to come do
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:45.120]  business with the United States for their petroleum. And, you know, again, it's
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:48.800]  that chessboard around the oil fields that's really in play.
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.880]  You think that Russia is unhappy with its place in the world? I mean, obviously,
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:58.040]  there was a play, like you said, in that South Ossetia-Georgian conflict, to see
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:02.120]  what kind of a world power they still were. Do you feel like they feel like
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:05.120]  they don't want to be a second world nation in this global order? I mean,
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:09.040]  that's how I feel like the play is, you know, I mean, you had Putin and Bush
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:13.160]  sitting next to each other at the Olympics as this conflict's going on. I
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:17.560]  don't think that Putin is very happy with the way that he was treated, and I
[1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:21.520]  don't think that he's very happy with, you know, the U.S. basically trying to
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.400]  build the North American Union here at home, and I really do believe trying to
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:28.400]  build a Eurasian Union right around the corner from their home.
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:31.560]  Well, I don't think it's a question of whether Russia wants to be number one
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:36.840]  or number two. I think Russia, certainly looking at what Putin was doing right
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:40.560]  after he got rid of the oligarchs, I think he wants peace and prosperity for
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:44.520]  his people because his own political fortunes are dependent on that. But he
[1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:48.000]  lives, unfortunately, in a time when there are some very belligerent nations
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.680]  who see their own fortunes greatly improved by major warfare. I mean, setting
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:57.480]  aside for the moment Israel's obvious push for war and Lebanon war in Iran,
[1:16:57.480 --> 1:17:01.640]  war against Syria, war against Jordan, the list goes on, we have in the United
[1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:05.600]  States a large number of people who are looking at our economic problems and
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:10.540]  thinking that a major war at least will disguise the symptoms, give them some
[1:17:10.540 --> 1:17:15.120]  thing to blame it all on. I mean, Americans will put up with the lack of food,
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:18.480]  lack of clothes, lack of fuel if they think there's a war going on and they
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:22.120]  have to rally around the flag. And if you look back at the history of America's
[1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:26.640]  participation in major wars, each one happened just as the United States was
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:31.640]  dealing with the major depression. There was a depression in the early 1900s. We
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:35.720]  got out of that by going into World War I, with that whole deception over the
[1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:40.600]  Lusitania. We were in the Great Depression just before Roosevelt got us into
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:43.760]  World War II with the Pearl Harbor deception. So now we're in serious
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:47.760]  economic trouble. People are saying this is a new depression and sure enough we
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:51.280]  have the US government that's out there saying let's kick off a major war and
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:55.080]  crank up the defense industries and make bombs and just, you know, at least
[1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:58.640]  everybody will be distracted from how bad things are because there's a war on
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:02.200]  and we've got to rally around the flag. And I think that's their thinking and
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:05.920]  it's not going to work this time because, first of all, because of the
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:09.640]  alternative media, the American people know they're being lied to about these
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:13.080]  situations. They're not going to trust the government's story about any new war.
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.920]  Second of all, the United States is not the industrial powerhouse it was for World
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:23.520]  War I and World War II. We can't sustain the kind of manufacturing output it takes
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:28.840]  to support a major global war. And our economy is already in the shambles. I
[1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:32.800]  think a new major war will be the end of the United States. I agree with you and
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:37.680]  I think what it'll do is restructure us, Canada and Mexico together. My
[1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:41.400]  fear is, all right, let's say that the dollar totally and completely collapses
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:45.160]  in the next six months and it's no longer the World Reserve currency, that
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:49.680]  alone could probably start some real military conflicts. And like you said,
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:53.000]  we're not, we don't have the factories that we once had. We can't just take a
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:56.400]  factory and take the workers there and suspend whatever product they were
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:18:59.440]  making because they don't make anything here anymore. You know, you can't make
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:02.800]  weapons in a factory that's not fit to make shoes because we don't make
[1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:06.920]  anything. The last thing we made here were cars and that's about to go under
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:12.320]  as well. I mean, we're spread so thin militarily. Is this going to be like the
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:16.080]  first United States military defeat? I mean, people could argue Vietnam and
[1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:20.800]  everything, but I'm talking about on the global scale. I think it very well could
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:24.040]  be because if you look at the historical precedent for the decline of
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:29.000]  all the Roman Empire, Rome began to decline when they spread their legions
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:34.320]  so thin they only had to lose one up in Germany and then they could no longer
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:39.160]  police their global empire and the little fringe nations began breaking away
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:44.360]  and the revenues to Rome dropped and Rome sank into debt and collapsed.

[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:08.560]  financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen

[1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:32.400]  on the cam. We're gonna take your calls after this segment. Let's try to keep it
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:37.040]  on topic. I'd appreciate if we could keep away from the spooky hand signals and
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:43.680]  the race wars. Some people, man, I mean they're just unbelievable. We got real, real
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:49.760]  issues to talk about here. We got a new administration coming in in six days.
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:53.840]  We've got people like Colin Powell, Joe Biden, and Madeline Albright all warning
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:58.360]  us about a crisis. Now at first I didn't give much credence to this. I thought it
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:01.560]  was political rhetoric, especially on Biden's part to try to get him
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.840]  elected. And you know I didn't take much stuff from what Albright said, but
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.360]  when Colin Powell gave a date of the 21st or 22nd, it definitely spooked me
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:13.360]  out. Some people have tried to point to the fact that he said that before the
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:18.760]  economic crisis hit television, but I really, I don't know. Do you give any
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:21.560]  credence to that, Mike? Do you think that there's gonna be something coming up on
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:26.000]  the 21st or 22nd? I mean it could just be the announcement of more bank
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:33.400]  collapses. Who knows? I'm very hesitant to name a date like the 20th or the 21st,
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:37.400]  and again this gets back to the comment about so many different factions right
[1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:41.840]  now each pushing their own agenda. And I am certain that there are some people who
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:46.200]  are thinking that a new 9-11 is going to advance their particular situation. They
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:51.240]  are being balanced by, I hope, a larger majority who are saying that the American
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:54.440]  people are already suspicious of the first 9-11 and a second one is going to
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:26:01.000]  be a very reckless and very dangerous and risky proposition. But again, you know,
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.040]  it's not like the government is operating in a united monolithic sense.
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:09.080]  There's a lot of different players and they're all doing what they think is
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:12.800]  going to be in their own best interests. You know, I agree with you there, and you
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:15.480]  know, people say, well why do you keep bringing up 9-11? It's because the
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:20.080]  mainstream media constantly brings up 9-11. Today on Fox News, FoxNews.com
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:23.600]  admitted that they torture people at Guantanamo Bay, but of course the guy
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:28.280]  they were torturing was a suspect in the 9-11 attacks, and he later confessed
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:34.920]  that he was involved. So it's okay, you know, and it just blows my mind.
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:40.200]  Yeah, I love it. It's, you know, we've tortured him into confessing, therefore it
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:43.480]  must be true. And then you've had those military tribunals that have made the
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:47.000]  news in the past couple months of these supposed 9-11 suspects outside of
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:51.440]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Of course, we'll see nothing more than transcripts
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:56.520]  about that, and people will buy into it, you know. Mickey Rourke just won the
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:00.600]  Golden Globe for The Wrestler. I actually watched it. I like the movie. I think he
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.520]  actually might even deserve an Oscar for it, but then he gets interviewed, and
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:07.440]  what's the headline? It's not, oh, Mickey Rourke wins the Golden Globe.
[1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:11.200]  No, Mickey Rourke says Bush did the right thing after 9-11 to the terrorists.
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:15.640]  Of course, Mickey Rourke is going to weigh in, and the sad thing is, Mike, more
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:18.360]  people are going to listen to him because he's in the movies and on
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:21.120]  television than are going to listen to you or me, because that's the kind of
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:26.200]  society we live in. Well, I think that was the conventional wisdom of a long
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:30.760]  time ago, but I'm not certain that's true anymore, first of all, because I think
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:39.120]  thanks be to people like Paris Hilton and her ilk, people are realizing
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:43.600]  that celebrities may look very good and make a very hot weekend, but they're not
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:48.000]  necessarily really up to date on what's going on, and to balance them, of course,
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:51.680]  you have people like Charlie Sheen and Willie Nelson and Rosie O'Donnell, who
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:57.160]  have laid their careers on the line to speak truth to power, and these are
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:02.240]  being viewed as modern-day heroes and heroines, and so I think Mickey Rourke
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:06.480]  may ultimately in the long run have marginalized himself with that comment.
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:10.880]  Well, I hope you're right, but it leads me to the sheeple-like
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:14.600]  mentality of people that, you know, they're more interested. I mean, Paris
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:17.840]  Hilton can have how many, like, six or seven reality shows, and people still
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.040]  tune in, she still makes money on television just being her regular
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:25.960]  idiotic self, and people worship that and glorify it, and I think that's why
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:29.880]  we're in the situation we are with the banks in the Middle East, is because
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:34.080]  people aren't paying attention. I was impressed that most people weren't for
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:38.160]  the bailout, but, you know, when I'd be in a bar and I'd be talking to, you know,
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:42.400]  the local, you know, Republican business owner, oh no, man, if we don't have this
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:46.440]  bailout, we're gonna go under, it's explaining every single great thing
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:50.480]  about the bailout that the news media was using as talking points three months
[1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:54.840]  ago, and now when the news media says, oh my god, we're in the worst economic
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:59.840]  situation since the Great Depression, they're still saying, well, we need
[1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:04.120]  another bailout, that's what the news told me, we need another bailout. How are
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:09.200]  we gonna get past that? Well, you have to remember that the Republican Party was
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:12.680]  actually emailing these talking points out to business owners, because I own a
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:16.200]  small business and I actually got one of these myself, and it is simply
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.680]  propaganda, because everyone is always debating about who's gonna get the tax
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:23.720]  burden in the next administration, so the GOP wanted to keep the tax breaks
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:29.320]  George Bush gave them, the Obama supporters want the tax breaks to go
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:33.120]  to them this time, and what they need to do is unite and say, look, taxes on
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:36.280]  everybody are too high, and we need to back off, that's how you save the economy.
[1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:39.320]  All right, it's the Alex Jones show, we're gonna be taking your calls on the

[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:09.160]  think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:12.840]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water, that's why I'd

[1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:08.000]  course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:13.400]  enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his
[1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:17.560]  M.O. We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled
[1:31:17.560 --> 1:31:21.440]  Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:25.800]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:31.280]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm
[1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:36.040]  aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to
[1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:40.400]  the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the
[1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:44.360]  Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[1:31:44.360 --> 1:31:49.960]  much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high

[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:21.360]  Is it getting better? It's the Alex Jones show. It's so hard to interrupt Johnny Cash
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:26.240]  when he's doing this thing. I love the cash. We're gonna be taking your calls in
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:29.720]  this segment, myself and Mike Rivera of whatreallyhappen.com. We're gonna go to
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:34.840]  Paul, Rocco, Todd and others. But there's a new bin Laden audio tape that's hitting
[1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:39.440]  the waves in the media. I read about it this morning, but I couldn't get a hold
[1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:41.840]  of whether it actually hit the news media, whether it was an audio or a
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:46.480]  videotape. And of course it's an audio tape and he's unhappy about what's going
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:51.040]  on in Gaza. And hell, I'm unhappy about what's going on in Gaza. The problem with
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:54.480]  that is, you know, of course he's probably taking the Palestinian side and
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:59.360]  that automatically demonizes people like myself and Mike that try to point out
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:03.040]  that the Palestinians aren't really the ones in the wrong here. It's Israel that
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:06.960]  is encroaching on their space. They're the ones that have the military on their
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:11.760]  borders constantly and are one of the main causes of the civil unrest over
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:16.920]  there. But now bin Laden has a new audio tape. We haven't seen him in years. I think
[1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:20.760]  the last time we actually saw him was Blackbeard bin Laden and that was just
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:25.600]  such poor video quality. It's amazing. I'd like to get your take on the
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:30.520]  new bin Laden tape prior to us going to calls. Mike, what do you think? Well,
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:34.840]  you're absolutely correct. The whole reason for dragging bin Laden or bin
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:40.240]  Laden light in this case out of the closet is to tar anybody who is speaking
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:44.080]  against Israel in this situation. I mean, the reality is Hamas is the elected
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:49.360]  government of Palestine. Hamas had basically followed the ceasefire for
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:54.280]  the last six months. Israel now admits Hamas was not firing rockets into Israel
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:58.560]  at the time when Israel broke the ceasefire on November 4th by attacking
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:03.640]  Gaza. So Israel is clearly in the wrong here. And again, if you go back to
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:08.240]  United Nations Resolution 242, Israel is supposed to be out of the occupied
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:12.520]  territories, not building new settlements and going in and just behaving
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:17.040]  very rudely. So they can't win on points of international law. They can't win on
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:21.040]  morality. They can't win on the facts. So they're going to drag out bin Laden and
[1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:25.720]  use him to basically tarnish anybody who is speaking out for peace. The problem
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:29.800]  with that is that more and more people are well aware that Osama bin Laden
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:35.320]  appears to have actually died in December of 2001. And every Osama since
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:40.720]  then appears to be some permutation of wag the dog video production. And yeah,
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:45.360]  they're using the dead guy one more time. Yeah, it's unbelievable. And you
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:49.160]  know, there's a movie out there about Jimmy Carter. And I'm not a huge Jimmy
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:52.120]  Carter fan, but Jimmy Carter came out with a book not so long ago called
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:56.040]  Peace Not Apartheid. And it was all about the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:36:01.000]  And there's a documentary that just goes through his book tour. And it's
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.640]  something very palatable for the mainstream for somebody like your uncle
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:08.200]  or your aunt or your cousin that doesn't really know about this stuff, but knows
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:12.440]  who Jimmy Carter is. And I suggest people get that. All right, let's go to
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:17.600]  calls. Let's go to Paul in Florida. Paul, what's on your mind? Paul, are you with us?
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:22.400]  Yes, sir. I'm so happy to be able to get through today. I'm a first-time caller,
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:27.640]  but I've been listening since the beginning of the Alex Jones way back.
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:33.440]  I've listened to Genesis before he was on. Awesome. What I want to talk
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:36.840]  about is the first thing you mentioned with this new guest is the
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:46.440]  conscription. Can I read you the 13th Amendment? It's one sentence. All right,
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:52.280]  go for it. It says, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:57.600]  punishment for or for a crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:04.080]  shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:09.840]  Does this not make conscription illegal? Is that not involuntary servitude? I
[1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:13.360]  would say it makes it constitutionally illegal. Unfortunately, the people that
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:15.960]  are running the show right now could give a damn about the Constitution and
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:20.680]  Billarites. What do you think, Mike? Well, yeah, the way they get around that is
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:23.800]  during the military draft, there's a point where they say all of you who
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:29.360]  choose to serve the United States step forward, and they construe this to mean
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:33.960]  that you are volunteering, therefore the 13th Amendment does not apply. But yeah,
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:38.080]  we have a government that is absolutely ignoring the Constitution, which in my
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:42.720]  point of thinking delegitimizes them already, along with all the obvious
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:48.080]  lies. And we also need to go back to that little brochure that the FBI
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:51.680]  has distributed to police departments around America that anybody who's
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:55.840]  talking about the Constitution or the Bill of Rights needs to be reported as
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:59.440]  a potential terrorist suspect. So obviously, our government really isn't
[1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:03.560]  paying attention to the Constitution. It's just something, as George Bush says,
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:07.760]  it's a blank blank piece of paper. Absolutely. And it reminds me of the
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.200]  days that my history teacher used to carry a pocket Constitution around all
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:15.760]  the time, and he was very proud of this fact. And he would whip it out whenever,
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:17.880]  you know, there was a question he'd say, well, actually, this part of the
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:22.360]  Constitution says that I don't have to do that. And now he's supposedly a
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  potential terrorist. Geez, I just thought he was someone who was trying to
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:31.400]  help. All right, let's go to Rocco. Rocco, what's on your mind? You there, Rocco?
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:35.480]  Yes, sir. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. How are you? Good. Hey, listen, that's what I
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:40.080]  remind the folks out there, you know, about this new administration coming in
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:45.720]  and what their future plans are for this country. And you know, I'm extremely, I
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:51.840]  guess, hopeful and optimistic that Obama is not going to end up being who, you
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:55.640]  know, everyone fears he might be, but you never really know until, you know, you
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.520]  guys in office and you give him a try and you see what he actually does. Sure.
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:02.720]  But, you know, one thing that I'm really concerned about is, you know, a lot of
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:07.400]  freedom and a lot of rights in this country. And, you know, I mean, how much
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:15.000]  freedom did we have against the terrorists of 1770? People were actually, you know,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.480]  on the streets shooting themselves. And then we forget that in the 1800s, the
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:22.960]  British actually came and burned Washington, DC and didn't have the
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:26.600]  Patriot Act. We didn't have all of our rights taken away. We weren't having our
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:30.120]  phone calls, listened in on and everything else. So, you know, I feel like
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:34.960]  there's a bigger agenda going on. I also, you're kind of cutting it out, so we're
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.160]  gonna let you go. But I also feel like there's a bigger agenda going on. And in
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:43.320]  fact, the cover story of Newsweek is Obama's Cheney Problem. And Newsweek is
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:46.480]  pointing to all these executive powers that the Bush administration has passed
[1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:51.120]  over the last eight years. But they're making a case that Obama will not misuse
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:55.520]  these powers, so there's no reason to get rid of them via executive orders. What's
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:40:01.960]  your take on that? I think that is a very, very dangerous article that came out.
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:05.720]  It's a very dangerous idea. I think if Obama really wants to bring about change
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:10.000]  we can believe in, he has to start reversing many of those executive orders,
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.880]  because this whole idea that, yeah, these orders are dangerous to the liberties
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:17.880]  of the American people, but trust your leaders, they won't abuse them. I think
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:21.040]  that's absolutely ridiculous. The whole reason for having a Bill of Rights in a
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:25.400]  Constitution was the recognition by our founding fathers that people in
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:28.440]  positions of power are just human beings and they're subject to human
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:32.760]  frailties and weaknesses, and power attracts the very kind of people who
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.520]  ought not to have it. And so in point of fact, it is dangerous to allow these
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:41.680]  executive orders to stand. And Obama should rescind them all immediately.
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:45.120]  Yeah, I wish that he would rescind them all immediately. What really
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:49.400]  gets me is the tone of the article where they're defending torture in many cases,
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:53.480]  where they're saying, you know, it's basically making every excuse in the book
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:40:57.760]  to keep these orders, and because it's a new face, it's not a problem. No, it's a
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:02.760]  problem because it gives people in the executive branch an obscene amount of
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:06.440]  power when we were supposed to have checks and balances in this country.
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:09.640]  That's why there's three branches of government folks, okay, judicial,
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.760]  executive, and legislative. But the executive has just gotten so out of
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:18.640]  control with its powers. I mean, the line is not only blurred, it's gone.
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:22.360]  All right, let's go to Todd in Florida. Todd, what's on your mind?
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.200]  Hey, Jason, what's going on, bud?
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:28.760]  Not much for town. Nothing. I actually had to send a picture from a
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:33.520]  picture from a camera phone to Aaron. And I have somebody that's very close to me
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:37.800]  that is in the postal service. And they recently had to deliver, they had
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:40.320]  three or four of these packages on their route, but I'm pretty sure they're
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:45.800]  mass distributed. And big, huge package and is a survey and on the front of it
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:52.200]  and big, huge letters. It said 2009 National Survey for North American Union
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:58.680]  and NAFTA Supertrade Highway. Now, it's a survey. It's a mass survey going out.
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:01.720]  Do you know who's sending it out? What's the outgoing address? Did you get a
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:04.880]  chance to look at that? I'm not sure. I sent the picture to him. He might be
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:07.800]  able to pick it up off the picture. I wasn't there at the time. They had to take
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:10.600]  the picture and drop it. You know what? Send it to my MySpace, too. Can you
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:14.960]  send me a link to my MySpace? It's www.myspace.com. Jason Bermas, because Aaron
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:19.040]  does get quite overwhelmed. I do try to read all the messages that I get. I may
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:22.600]  not reply to all of them, but I'd love to see it as well. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:26.120]  much in the open. Even, you know, Dobbs, one of the few people that actually
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:30.440]  reports what's going on in this country, recently did something about the
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:34.360]  securities and part prosperity partnership, and the Obama administration is
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:39.240]  opening talks again. You know, it's just like the trans-Texas corridor gets
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:42.840]  reported last week that it's dead. No, they just renamed it. It's under a
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.400]  different project. They're not going to tear the road down that they've built.
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:49.560]  They're going to continue to build it. So, you know, this is just more expansion,
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:54.000]  more advancement, and these surveys that they send to people, it's to feel them
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.480]  out to see what they like and what they don't like, what they feel is
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:00.600]  positive, so that when they do run a commercial, you're going to be more
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:04.360]  apt to say, you know what, that's a great idea. We do need that. All right, let's go
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:09.720]  to our next caller. Let's go to Brian in Iowa. Brian, what's on your mind?
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:15.680]  Hey, Jason, nice to talk to you. I wanted to thank you and the loose change crew
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:21.520]  for turning me around about three years ago. Thank you, man. I'm calling from
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:27.120]  prison camp Iowa State. They recently had a protest going on against the
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:32.040]  Gaza invasion, and yesterday they had it going on in front of the Memorial Union,
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:35.600]  I guess, and one of the administrators came out and told them, sorry, you can't
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.520]  do that here. If you do not move to one of the designated free speech,
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:44.800]  you will be arrested. Mike, why don't you talk about these designated free
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:48.000]  speech zones? Because most people think, oh, we have free speech in this country.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.200]  We can talk about whatever we want, but as soon as we talk about anything that
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:55.960]  matters in this country, or anything that matters about Israel and Palestine,
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:44:00.320]  all of a sudden we don't have those same rights, do we? No, we don't. This free
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:05.080]  speech zone, it's an absolute joke. It's a slap in the face of every American
[1:44:05.080 --> 1:44:09.000]  whoever died defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights through all the
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:12.360]  wars we fought up to this point. And basically what it means is you have
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:15.800]  freedom of speech, but the government reserves the right to put you in a
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:20.360]  special free speech zone, which means you're away from the press, you're away
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:23.560]  from the public, and you can say whatever you want as long as you're in these
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:28.520]  places where nobody can hear you. And it's a very disingenuous way of handling
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:32.920]  the situation, because the whole point of free speech is that you are to be heard.
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:38.200]  It isn't necessarily the right to speak out what you're saying. It is a right to
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:42.240]  share your thoughts and your ideas with your fellow Americans, whether that's in
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:46.840]  the public square, on TV, in the newspapers, or here on the internet. And
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:51.720]  the idea of the creation of the free speech zone, it is simply an attempt to
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:55.680]  corral up dissidents and put them in a place where they could say, yeah, you
[1:44:55.680 --> 1:44:58.960]  can say anything you want over here, but we have the right to make sure nobody
[1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:01.840]  else can hear what you're saying. And that's what the government is
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:06.440]  aggregating to itself right now. And basically it hamstrings the
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:09.800]  First Amendment. We really don't have a right to free speech if the government
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:14.360]  can tell us where we can exercise that right. And this was really born right
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:18.000]  before the 2004 elections when the Democratic National Convention, the
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.960]  Republican National Conventions, were coming to big cities like Boston and
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.320]  New York, and they didn't want a visible protest outside. So they create these
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:30.160]  pens, you know, miles away or two miles away. It's unbelievable. I thank you for
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:35.720]  the call. And that's why Alex Jones has used his bullhorn, Kearney Crusher 1, to
[1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:38.440]  circumvent these kind of things. When they won't let you near him, well, you're
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:42.480]  gonna hear his voice anyway. And we're happy to say that that has reached over
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.760]  $50,000 on eBay, and today is the last day you can bid on that. Remember, folks,
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:50.240]  all that money that comes in from that is really going to be to expand the
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:54.520]  studios here in Austin, Texas. And from what they were when I came down to make
[1:45:54.520 --> 1:45:59.320]  my film, Fabled Enemies, in April to the new studios now, it is like night and
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:03.800]  day. And there's Kearney Crusher 1 in Scanner Darkly. I mean, it's the same
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:07.200]  exact bullhorn. It's signed by Alex Jones. It truly is a piece of history. We
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:11.280]  really hope that you support us. All right, let's go to our next caller. Let's
[1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:13.960]  jump to Fred in Philly. Fred, what's on your mind?
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:21.960]  Hey, it's good to hear from you again. What do you think about the possibility
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:28.120]  that there's no country in the world that really isn't bankrupt at this point?
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:32.560]  Well, first of all, hold on. Before you get there, first of all, countries that
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:36.440]  still make things that have factories, they're not really bankrupt because they
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:40.480]  can still make goods and have goods and services in that country.
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:44.880]  Secondly, some countries still have precious metals that are always
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:48.880]  going to retain value. Not so much the countries, but the leaders of
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:52.680]  those countries and the elites in those countries. Silver, gold, platinum,
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:55.720]  this is stuff that's retained value for thousands of years, so that's not going
[1:46:55.720 --> 1:47:00.400]  to go anywhere. As far as countries already being bankrupt, what's the
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:03.120]  debt right? What's the deficit in this country right now, Mike? Is it almost a
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:07.560]  trillion dollars? Yeah, it absolutely is, and it's going to be way more than
[1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:12.080]  that next year. I think what the caller is talking about is the fact that when
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:15.520]  you have a monetary system that is based on debt, as we do in the United
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:19.720]  States with the Federal Reserve, the problem with such a monetary system is
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:24.960]  that more money is owed than actually exists. The system will work as long
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:28.480]  as there's always a new young generation of borrowers coming in at the bottom of
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:31.960]  the pyramid to prop up the system. But what happened here in the United
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:35.760]  States and is happening around the world is you don't have those new borrowers
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.520]  coming in, and so the whole system's beginning to collapse. You thought Bernie
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:44.000]  Madoff had a really ugly pyramid scheme, but the entire Federal Reserve system
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:49.240]  is a pyramid scheme as well, because it can only exist and perpetuate as long as
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:54.280]  there are always more and more borrowers coming in at the bottom of the system to
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:57.520]  allow the creation of new revenue. Alright, let's jump to the next caller.
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:01.000]  Let's go to Mike in Wyoming. Mike, what's on your mind?
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.520]  Hello, gentlemen. I wanted to follow up on something Mike Rivera said about
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:14.200]  getting around the 13th Amendment, which was true as far as he went.
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:19.680]  Basically, you do volunteer in. I heard this from an old Air Force buddy of mine.
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:24.160]  The way you get around it, at least in the past, and I think this is still
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:30.120]  probably valid when they ask you, all right, everyone who volunteers to take
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:34.160]  two steps forward or whatever, you do an about phase and take three steps
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:39.240]  backwards, and probably you're going to have a sergeant in your face for the
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:44.440]  next 48, 72 hours barking at you and trying to make you feel like you're the
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:49.960]  scum of the earth, but they can't force you to volunteer is the bottom line.
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:55.080]  Yeah, but the thing is that they're going to file charges against you.
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:48:58.640]  No, they're not going to file charges against you. They may try to
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:05.400]  get you into some kind of other conscientious objector type status
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:12.360]  and do some kind of charity work, but they can't force you to volunteer.
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:16.680]  I think it's just like that argument of common law and the IRS,
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:20.200]  the people out there, I mean, there is no real law in the book for the
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:24.560]  federal income tax, but they're going to come after you with the IRS
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:27.880]  and the military. I'm just saying if they come out with a mass
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.040]  conscription for people where they say conscription's happening and you get in
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:34.680]  line, you say, I'm not going to do it, they're going to throw you in the brig, man.
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:39.000]  I mean, I find it hard to press that they're just going to let you go, and
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.800]  we know that they want to build a domestic civil force. I mean, that's what
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:45.600]  Homeland Security was about being brought in after 9-11. That's
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:49.760]  just one facet of it. We have Homeland Security offices right around the
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:53.720]  corner of the new office. I mean, it's an expanded bureaucracy, so I can see them
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:57.880]  giving you the choice of whether you want to serve in the armed forces or you
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:01.200]  want to serve domestic surveillance at home, but I don't think they're going to
[1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:04.960]  give you the choice to just walk away. It won't be just, I don't believe like
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:10.400]  they're just going to try to, you know, convince you to take one or the other. I
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:13.920]  think that they're going to basically say you do this or you're going to jail
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:17.280]  or you're going to military prison or you're going to regular prison. Mike,
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:21.480]  what's your view on that? Yeah, I think looking back at the case of Aaron Wattata,
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:25.960]  he was absolutely legally in the right to refuse to serve in a war that he felt
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:30.280]  was illegal. That was a league principle. It's in the US Uniform Code of
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:33.800]  Military Justice. It is the principle that came out of the Nuremberg War Trials,
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.040]  and yet they kept prosecuting and prosecuting and prosecuting them,
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:41.240]  just trying to wear them down. Exactly. They have unlimited funds and it doesn't
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:45.280]  matter to them if they're going, if you're going to have to, you know, spend your
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:48.360]  car payment or your house payment to try to fight these guys. They'll fight you
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:52.080]  tooth and nail. It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back after this. Infowars.com,

[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:05.000]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.480]  economic turmoil and food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:12.440]  sanity. Your answer may be at hand. Author Linda Runyon lived off the land
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:16.920]  isolated from civilization. She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:20.640]  be plenty of free food all over God's green earth. Perhaps the only sane
[1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:24.960]  insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost of learning is minimal.
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:28.720]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere. It's every bit
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:32.840]  organic and more nutritious than our modern diets. Well respected in her field.
[1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:36.600]  Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video
[1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:40.760]  with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy. Learn how to
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:45.400]  identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it. Go to

[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:08.280]  impossible.
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:11.080]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:15.120]  How do the American people know that not 11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you,
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:18.360]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR?
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:24.840]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:27.200]  despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:31.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening is
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:40.000]  taking place. An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.720]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:46.400]  treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:51.800]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of my life.

[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.080]  revolution to the next level.
[1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:05.600]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:09.240]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:13.880]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:18.520]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:24.760]  It's a documented fact. 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:30.000]  internal parasites and parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:35.280]  metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:41.000]  powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage once a day. FPP is now available

[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:26.480]  Alright folks, we are back. It's the Alex Jones Show with us, Michael Rivera, of WhatReallyHappened.com,
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:31.360]  streaming live from the web over at PrismPlanet.tv. Again, I love the new office. I love how
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:36.200]  we're expanding. It's just the coolest I get to sit in for Alex Jones for a week anyway.
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:40.040]  Then we get to have these great guests on and the technology just keeps getting better
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:46.160]  and better and better. Mike Rivera also in my latest film, Fabled Enemies. You can get
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:51.200]  that over at infowars.com or if you're a PrismPlanet.tv subscriber, you can watch it free, streaming
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:55.600]  the web, download it, burn it to disk. Hand it out to your friends. I think it's an important
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:01.880]  film. It really lays out the International Intelligence Agency that carried out 9-11.
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:06.840]  It goes away from the physical anomalies. It shows that there's another story out there
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:10.560]  other than control demolition in World Trade Center Building 7, although that's obviously
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:14.280]  part of it. Mike, in the final segment we have you here,
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:19.800]  I'd really like you just to go over the Gaza situation, the latest updates and what's happening
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:27.360]  there and basically how we can put pressure on our government to really try to solve what's
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:32.280]  going on there. Instead of just taking the side of the Israelis blindly and promoting
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:37.120]  all this expansionism and imperialism, how is it that our voice can be heard?
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:42.160]  Well, that is a very, very difficult question because I think it's been made very clear
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:46.800]  to the United States people that Congress is not listening to us anymore. They certainly
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:53.600]  didn't with the bailout. This last week, both houses of Congress stood up and nearly unanimous.
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:56:00.000]  It was unanimous and the Senate voted approval for what Israel is doing and the bottom line
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.800]  as far as Israel and Gaza is concerned is Israel likes to pretend they own that land
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:11.440]  in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. They do not. It belongs to the Palestinians, United
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:17.160]  Nations Resolution 242 has ordered Israel out of the occupied territories and Israel
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:22.120]  does not want to go because they covet that land. Now, the bottom line is for the last
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:29.880]  60 years we've had all of this tremendous misery, war, killing, tremendous upset coming
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:36.280]  out of the Middle East and it all comes down to one and only one cause. Israel demands
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:43.400]  for itself the right to exist and the right to a state but denies that same right to its
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:49.240]  neighbors and that is really the heart of this entire conflict. Israel will not grant
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:55.200]  to others that which it demands for itself. All Israel has to do to bring peace to the
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:57:01.440]  Middle East is simply grant to the Palestinians their right to exist and their right to a
[1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:06.560]  state. That was the original plan in the United Nations partition plan for there to be an
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:12.480]  Israeli nation and a Palestinian nation and Israel said we will not go along with that.
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:19.080]  David Ben-Gurion then proclaimed Israel to be in existence and said we do not acknowledge
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:22.720]  Palestine's right to exist. We're upon the other Arab nation said well if you're not
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:26.400]  going to acknowledge Palestine's right to exist, we don't acknowledge your right to
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:34.160]  exist and that is the root cause of all of the unhappiness from then until now. Israel
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:39.600]  has a double standard. They want to exist fine. They want a nation that's fine but they
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:44.400]  won't give it to the Palestinians and that is really the root cause of all of the problem.
[1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:47.720]  How do you see it all ending? What do you think it's going to be? Do you think it's going
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:52.640]  to be a global conflict in the Middle East where Eurasian Union is born and really Israel
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:58.600]  has the central role in governing that area?
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:02.880]  I know that's certainly what Israel would like to see happen and I think Israel would
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:07.520]  not mind at all if the United States and Russia got into a mutually destructive war which
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:12.760]  left Israel with its nuclear arsenal able to project power over that half of the world
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:18.800]  at least. As to what's really going to happen, time alone will solve that mystery.
[1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:22.520]  Michael Rivera, thank you so much for spending an hour with us. It's what really happened
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:26.720]  at GCCN.com. Folks, we're going to be back at the top of the hour with Ray McGovern,
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:31.560]  26-year CIA analyst. We're going to continue to take your calls. In the final hour, it's
[1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:36.040]  the Alex Jones Show. I am Jason Burmese. Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[1:58:51.160 --> 1:58:54.760]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:59.160]  be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:02.800]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your
[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:06.640]  own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:10.680]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[1:59:10.680 --> 1:59:14.880]  family in the final equation between you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to

[2:00:14.440 --> 2:00:23.760]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome,
[2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:32.280]  ladies and gentlemen, welcome. It is the beginning of the third hour of the show. January 14th,
[2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:39.360]  2009. I am Jason Burma, sitting in all week for Alex Jones. And our guest now is Ray McGovern,
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:45.240]  former CIA analyst for over 25 years. And really what I'd like to talk to him about
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:50.880]  today is the incoming Obama administration. We're six days away. Some of the appointments.
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:56.360]  I know that Mr. McGovern is no fan of Robert Gates, who will be staying on as Secretary
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:01:02.480]  of Defense. And I want to get his take also on his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel. You've
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:08.400]  definitely been very outspoken about the Gaza-Israeli situation. So I'd really like to hear what
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:12.440]  you think about that appointment. And of course, I want to talk about this new book called
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:17.840]  American Grit, which is calling for conscription. One of the lead editors over at the Washington
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:20.160]  Times. Mr. McGovern, how are you today, sir?
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:22.160]  I'm doing fine. How are you, Jason?
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:27.200]  Good, good. So right off the bat, are you happy with most of the appointments of the
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:31.080]  Obama administration? Are you not happy? What do you think?
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:38.560]  Well, I guess my attitude is wait and see here. I was unhappy for quite some time. And
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:44.520]  then I was quite happy with Leon Panetta's naming as the new CIA director, because for
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:52.160]  once we have a person there with a certain clout, as Obama himself said, and they will
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:58.960]  earn reputation for impeccable integrity. And those are the things that have been missing
[2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:07.680]  for low these, let's see, 1980s. So that's, what, 28 years? And we dearly need to have
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:14.000]  it back. Admiral Stansfield Turner, who was appointed by Jimmy Carter to be his director
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:19.160]  of central intelligence, is the last person who combined not only personal integrity,
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:25.160]  but with a managerial sense and was able to manage that very floor-flung operation.
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:30.360]  And for people not familiar with Panetta, Panetta was Clinton's chief of staff, correct?
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:37.280]  He was for a couple of years, but his real claim to fame was nine terms or eight terms
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:43.520]  in Congress from California. He became head of the budget committee. He was also head
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:49.800]  of the Office of Management and Budget for a while before that. And this is interesting.
[2:02:49.800 --> 2:02:56.000]  He was a Republican working under Nixon in the Civil Rights Department of the Health
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:02.600]  Education and Welfare Department. And when it became clear to, when it was made clear
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:09.440]  to the Panetta that civil rights, this was not really the thrust of what Nixon wanted
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.920]  to achieve with his so-called Southern strategy, and that Panetta really ought to lay back,
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:19.960]  you know, sort of take vacation like a very long four-year one. Panetta, to his great
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:27.960]  credit, up and quit, and actually later became a Democrat, ran for Congress from the Monterey
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:32.120]  part of California, and by all accounts, did a bang-up job.
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:38.120]  And he and his wife, I believe, run an institute right now, too. So I guess that is one of
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:42.200]  the appointments that you're looking forward to. What about the Gates situation, though?
[2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:46.600]  It looks like he's going to stay on for at least another year. Obama himself has talked
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:52.000]  about a redistribution of forces into Afghanistan, says we need more troops there as we de-escalate
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.640]  in Iraq. What's your view on that?
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:04:02.520]  Well, Gates has always been a problem to me, not only because he's such a rank and careerist,
[2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:08.600]  but also because his substantive sense is not good. Witness the fact that when he was
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:15.800]  working for me, he had his PhD in Russian history, and yet he didn't get it when the
[2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:22.240]  Soviet Union started to fall apart. And he and his mentor, William Casey, then the director
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:30.080]  of the CIA, thought and told Reagan that though this fellow got a bit chuffed, he's just
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:35.240]  a commie, like all the rest of him, the Soviet Party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:39.880]  would never lose its place. So don't worry about him. It's going to be the same. He
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:42.240]  missed the big one.
[2:04:42.240 --> 2:04:46.480]  Alright, we're talking to Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst. It's the Alex Jones show. We'll
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:05:08.840]  be back after the break. Infowars.com and live streaming video at PrismPlanet.tv.

[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:05.320]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that
[2:07:05.320 --> 2:07:09.320]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:13.520]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:18.520]  absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:23.440]  water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the
[2:07:23.440 --> 2:07:29.080]  growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:34.040]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water
[2:07:34.040 --> 2:07:38.760]  treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:45.120]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99

[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:27.960]  All right folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show. We're sitting and talking to Ray
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:35.960]  McGovern over at PrismPlanet.tv right now. And Mr. McGovern, to get away from Gates,
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:41.760]  let's talk about the Israeli situation right now. I'd like you to give an overview of what's
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:46.520]  happening in Israel over the last few weeks all up until today when there's a new tape
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:52.080]  out of supposedly bin Laden taking the plight of the Palestinian people. And I believe that's
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:58.840]  put out there. For anybody that speaks out against Israeli aggression, they're automatically
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:02.160]  associated with the boogeyman Osama bin Laden. What are your views?
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:07.760]  Well, that's an interesting observation. Certainly those who oppose what the Israelis
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:13.480]  are doing now can easily be rhetorically linked to the baddest of the bad.
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:22.840]  Yeah, just today. The whole business here boils down to the fact that the Israelis could
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:29.120]  not do any of this without the full support of the Bush government. And that is the saddest
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:34.760]  thing on earth here. What's happening is a massacre there. People talk about the Gazans
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:40.520]  running out of water. I just got a message here from Gaza saying there is no potable
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:47.040]  water in Gaza, period. There's a small aquifer, and it's very small. It's too polluted to
[2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:53.400]  drink, and it's used to irrigate with little agriculture that is left. That the 1970s era
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:59.840]  treaty with Sadat, Begin, and Carter, that gave the Israelis the sole right to supply
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:06.440]  Gaza with water, as well as with electrical power, and the Gazans are out of both, period.
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:16.280]  So this is a pogrom of massive precautions. And here we are supplying the F-16s, the
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:24.280]  helicopter gunships, the tanks. The caterpillar bulldozers made in Bury, Illinois, and we
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:29.880]  are doing that. And what we are doing is not only massacring the Gazans or making it possible
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:36.880]  for the Israelis to do that, but it's on TV every night to 1.3 billion, and I repeat,
[2:10:36.880 --> 2:10:44.960]  billion Muslims in the world. And this is not the way to curb the so-called war on terror.
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:51.320]  This is the excellent way to make the recruiting lines before al-Qaeda and every other terrorist
[2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:54.880]  organization longer than they have ever been before.
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:58.520]  Well, it's interesting that you brought up the war on terror, because that was my next
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:05.520]  point. The new cover story over at Newsweek is Obama's Cheney Problem. And just from the
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:09.800]  web article that I printed, it's over three pages long, and it basically takes the stance
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:15.520]  that Obama should not give up any of the executive privileges that were given to the Bush administration
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:20.360]  under Bush and Cheney. All these, we can torture, we can do this. I mean, it literally
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:24.680]  makes the case for torture being a good thing. It says, well, the lines are pretty gray,
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:29.360]  and you can sit there and say that you can't get real information, but that's not exactly
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:33.720]  so. Do you think that this incoming administration, first of all, will rescind any of that power,
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:35.720]  or should they?
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:43.040]  Well, what I'd like to do is clarify what I could see to be the situation here, Jason.
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:50.280]  It's not a matter of rescinding that power. That power was illegally employed. There's
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:56.440]  no constitution or other statutory authority for torture or for eavesdropping of the kind
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:12:01.560]  that took place right after 9-11. And so it's not a matter of rescinding things. There
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:07.320]  is one thing that Obama should actually rescind. It's not the word again, but he should issue
[2:12:07.320 --> 2:12:14.320]  a new executive order, which says we will abide by Geneva. We will not torture people.
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:21.120]  We will not condition or abiding by Geneva on other extraneous factors, and we will
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:25.960]  close Guantanamo. He needs to do that. He needs to do that right away. And one of the
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:31.320]  good things here, and one of the pluses of Panetta being named as head of the CIA, is
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:40.080]  that he is outspoken in saying what everybody believed before eight years ago, and that is
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:46.800]  we simply can't suspend American ideals here in the name of supposed national security.
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:52.240]  You know, are we to believe in the dignity of the individual and the rule of law and
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:58.360]  the prohibition of cruel and unhuman punishment, or we don't? There isn't any middle ground.
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:04.880]  And so what I hope Obama will do is make that clear from the outset that everybody from
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:09.640]  the vice president on down, that we'll have clear standards to guide themselves by, which
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:12.760]  has not been the case for the last eight years.
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:17.800]  Well, I hope and pray that you're right. I don't know if that is going to be the case.
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:22.440]  I mean, with Rahm Emanuel coming in as chief of staff, this is a guy that's called for
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:28.440]  some type of military conscription, basically saying people 18 to 25 will do three months
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:33.880]  of basic training, and then what military outfit they'll be put into, whether it's
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:36.600]  the army or something domestic is another question.
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:41.200]  But you now have a new book by one of the Washington Times editors, American grit where
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:44.680]  he's calling for the same thing. And he's been calling for this now for the last couple
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:53.560]  of years. He was on MSNBC in 2007, saying what's that? Tom Blankley. And he was talking
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:58.720]  about how they needed conscription. And then he said that it would not happen under this
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:01.880]  administration, meaning the Bush administration. I can understand that because there was such
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:09.480]  an outcry, Congress had like a 13% approval rating. I'd say 70%, 80% of the population
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:14.720]  knew that they were just being lied to outright. Most people don't think, including even Letterman,
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:20.000]  that Cheney gives a damn about America or people in this country. But under Obama, there's
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:26.560]  this certain hope and he has this positive persona in the media. Do you think, number
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:32.080]  one, that it's dangerous having Rahm Emanuel as the chief of staff? And number two, that
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:34.200]  conscription is likely under his administration.
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:43.880]  Well, on this kind of thing, Jason, I defer to the domestic politics experts here. People
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:49.040]  tell me without any hesitation that the conscription, the draft, renewal of the draft is out of
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:54.920]  the picture, it can't be tolerated domestically. Now, I don't know what that says. And speaking
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:59.520]  of the American people, if there were another Hitler to arise, I would hope that the American
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:05.520]  people would rise to the occasion. But that seems to be the accepted political or conventional
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:11.640]  wisdom. And we'll just take that for what it is. Now, I will sort of append a little
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:20.640]  carol right there. I have always been unalterably opposed to the so-called volunteer army. I
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:26.280]  served in the army for two years. I served together with doctors and lawyers and Indian
[2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:33.400]  chiefs and everybody from Georgia to the hallowed sanctums of Harvard. We were all put in that
[2:15:33.400 --> 2:15:40.560]  mix together. We were Army officers, infantry, intelligence. And we were defending the country
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:46.240]  in relative peacetime just before Vietnam started. But we were all born there together
[2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:51.320]  and we all recognized that we had this duty to spend two years doing this. And there's
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:58.680]  a melting pot effect there. There's a real disincentive to get involved in wars, witness
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:04.600]  the fact that we were in Vietnam. A lot of the opposition came from members of Congress
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:10.080]  who had sons or cousins or brothers or they themselves were in Vietnam and saw what was
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:17.960]  going on. Once you farm this out, so to speak, once you contract it out to folks who do not
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:23.160]  have the opportunities, most of us do, the ones from the farms, the ones from the cities
[2:16:23.160 --> 2:16:30.320]  or towns less than 50,000, which is the majority of our armed services personnel now, then
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.280]  you have a totally different situation. You have kind of a hired hand approach to this
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:40.040]  thing of people who join for reasons other than protecting the country. I don't fault
[2:16:40.040 --> 2:16:45.520]  them for that, but that's just the reality. And so there's a little pitch for me as to
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:54.080]  why conscription ordinarily or draft or obligatory two-year service should be part of our woodwork
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:55.080]  here in this country.
[2:16:55.080 --> 2:17:01.120]  So that's kind of like, before I go back, that's kind of like the Charlie Rangel approach
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:06.160]  where he was trying to pass a bill to have conscription by saying the war in Iraq would
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:11.960]  end because Congressmen's sons and daughters would be eligible for the draft. That was
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:13.440]  kind of the position he took, yes?
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:17.520]  That's exactly right. And he was being a little cynical there because he knew that
[2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:25.400]  would never fly. But if that were the case before the war in Iraq, and real people, people
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:32.720]  from various parts of life here, people who have experience in academia and business and
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:38.760]  law firms and so forth, if everyone's equally vulnerable or liable for this draft, you would
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:44.760]  have real second thoughts about sending people willy-nilly off to a God-forsaken unnecessary
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:45.760]  war.
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:52.200]  So, yeah, I think Rangel's embarrassed everybody by making that point. And I think it's a point
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:57.280]  that really needs to be made because, you know, if you look at the people making decisions
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:18:03.440]  for this war, who are they? They're a bunch of very privileged, very rich, very wealthy
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:10.640]  and very well-connected people, all except for one person, who, Lisa Rice, says she's
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:15.480]  a woman, she looks like a woman, but she doesn't much act like one. What you need, what you
[2:18:15.480 --> 2:18:20.640]  need are mothers, mothers with actual children, flesh and blood children who know what it's
[2:18:20.640 --> 2:18:26.920]  like to lose a child. Mothers up there in the cabinet helping to make these decisions,
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:32.520]  and I'll tell you what will happen. There'll be much less frivolous decision-making in
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:38.640]  terms of going to this or that war or throwing this group of paratroopers out this window
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:44.080]  and so forth. And that's what Obama should do now, in my view. He should convene a council
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:48.920]  of not just wise men, as we used to always say, but wise men and women, women of the
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:56.400]  kind I just mentioned, not of the kind of Madeline Albright or Cornelisa Rice. Mothers,
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:19:00.600]  people who would get together and piece through what it really means. What are stakes in Iraq?
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:06.840]  What are stakes in Afghanistan, if any, really are? And then, trim the policies accordingly.
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:13.040]  All right. Well, there you go. You segue into my next question. You said, if any, in Afghanistan,
[2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:18.840]  Obama says we need to send more troops there. We've set now a supposed real-time table to
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:24.480]  get troops all the way out of Iraq, I believe, by the end of 2011. I don't think that's
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:28.680]  actually going to happen, but I do think there'll be a de-escalation there. But I really see
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:33.240]  most of those troops moving into Afghanistan. What's your view on that? Oh, hold on. We're
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:38.200]  about to go to break, Ray. I thank you so much for joining us. Folks, it's Ray McGovern,

[2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:27.000]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:33.760]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:37.720]  have been detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:42.480]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:49.160]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com,

[2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:18.040]  All right, folks, we're back. It's the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Bermas, sitting in
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:23.200]  all week long and my latest film is Fabled Enemies. You can get it right now over at
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:28.200]  infowars.com. You can also get other great titles like Endgame and 9-11 Chronicles, Truth
[2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:36.480]  Rising. Right now we're discussing what the future holds for Afghanistan with CIA veteran
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:42.280]  Ray McGovern. And again, in my viewpoint, it really looks like a redistribution of forces
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:48.720]  in the Middle East. I really just don't see U.S. power leaving there completely, especially
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:54.000]  with the rising tensions in India and Pakistan especially. What's your take on what's going
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:25:01.360]  on over there, Ray? I think you're turning in the right direction there, Jason. People
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:08.880]  asked me during the campaign, why is it that Barack Obama is so eager to make Afghanistan
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:17.560]  his, well, he doesn't realize it, but make it his Vietnam, his Iraq. There's no percentage
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:23.120]  in it at all. Why is he doing this? Well, I'm no expert on domestic politics, but I guess
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:27.680]  I figured, well, he thinks he needs to say those things to win the election. Well, now
[2:25:27.680 --> 2:25:33.120]  he's won the election. They are trimming their sales a little bit. I do hope that they will
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:39.480]  convene this kind of commission or study group or group of wise men and women to reassess
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:44.960]  what our equities there, what our objectives are. But I hope too that they'll look into
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:52.080]  the history of Afghanistan because what people should know, people who admire warriors and
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:58.240]  conquerors like Alexander the Great, you know, he tried Afghanistan. He was just trying to
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:03.560]  get to China, right? But as soon as he came to Afghanistan, he got such a bloody nose
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:09.160]  that they drove him back, these insurgents, you know, these militants, they drove him
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:17.440]  back. The year was 329 of the common era, okay? And I have to do a play on words here.
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:23.280]  It was a common error too, because since then the British, the Russians, and now we and
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:32.640]  NATO are trying to repeat the same era that happened in 329 of the current era. Now, what
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:38.200]  happened of course was he was trying to get to China, but he couldn't get through Afghanistan
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:44.680]  because the same incredibly ferocious folks who don't like their landed data were there
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:49.720]  at the time. Then you fast forward to, oh, how many centuries here we're talking now,
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:56.520]  1800, so now what, 1500 years later, the British decide, well, they're going to do it. Why?
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:27:01.760]  Well, because the Emir or whoever it was that was ruling some of Afghanistan, they're in
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:07.440]  Kandahar and Kabul, they seem to be a little too close to the Russians. And that would
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:12.560]  imparel the British dominion in India. And so the British, you know, they could do what
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:20.240]  they wanted in the 19th century, so they sent 16,500 troops into Afghanistan. And guess
[2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:25.320]  what? They didn't prevail, and this white stuff started coming down from the sky and
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:30.480]  was very, very cold. And it was just like Napoleon going into Russia. They tried to
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:36.960]  get out of Afghanistan. And guess what? Every one of those 16,500 men were killed, saved
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:46.640]  one who lived to tell the tale. So we're talking now, not 329, we're talking 1839, okay? Now
[2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:51.200]  after that, the British kept going back in there, there were huge reprisals, lots of
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:56.080]  people massacred in Kabul, and they played around with this right through the First World
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:01.640]  War. After, into the Second World War, the RAF was still bombing places in Afghanistan.
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:08.600]  And what did get them? Zilch. The Russians, as we all know, spent a decade trying to prevail,
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:14.040]  whatever that means, in Afghanistan, but finally driven out. And that was a contributing
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:20.320]  factor to the implosion of the Soviet Union. So now, we're going to go into Afghanistan.
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:27.040]  We're going to go in there with the, oh, now we're not 32,000, but maybe 30,000 more, 62,000?
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:31.520]  Give me a break. Look at that country. You know, if you flattened Afghanistan, you know,
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:38.080]  how big it would be? Big as China, for Pete's sake. It's an incredibly mountainous place.
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:43.240]  It's incredibly difficult to, quote, prevail in Afghanistan. So what I dearly hope, what
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:47.880]  I dearly hope is that Obama will sit down with people who know something about the area,
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:53.840]  the roboticists of this world, the people who have lived there and tasted Afghanistan,
[2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:57.960]  sit down and learn what's really going on there. And that depends on people like Bobby
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:02.800]  Gates. You know, I'll tell you a little bit yet when he was my analyst there for the Middle
[2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:09.600]  East. Sometimes he had a little sense of humor and he'd say, you know, with Afghanistan,
[2:29:09.600 --> 2:29:17.960]  I remember, I remember CW Fields, what he said when, you know, I spent two weeks in
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:26.000]  Afghanistan one time, lost McCorks Drew, terrible country, terrible time. Okay. Well, you know,
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.440]  that's a symptomatic of what it is when you get there, whether you lose your squawk screw
[2:29:30.440 --> 2:29:34.760]  or not, you're going to lose your rear end and they got to stay out of there and tamp
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:36.080]  down that conflict.
[2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:39.040]  All right. It's the Alex Jones show. We're going to be taking your calls on the other
[2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:51.920]  side for Ray McGovern and myself info wars.com, prisonplanet.tv.

[2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:07.240]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra
[2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:12.920]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:17.640]  film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:26.640]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:31:26.640 --> 2:31:31.400]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[2:31:31.400 --> 2:31:35.800]  take action against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was
[2:31:35.800 --> 2:31:42.800]  getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom,
[2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:47.200]  boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising
[2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:54.680]  at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:58.360]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[2:31:58.360 --> 2:32:03.760]  and bring in martial law. Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases
[2:32:03.760 --> 2:32:09.000]  cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment, but as you know, most people are overly acidic
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:14.640]  due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:18.960]  and perfect health as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they
[2:32:18.960 --> 2:32:24.080]  drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight. It was intended
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:28.480]  for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are
[2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:33.480]  overly acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:32:33.480 --> 2:32:37.920]  That accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[2:32:37.920 --> 2:32:43.600]  it. Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now. Alchivision plasma pH drops
[2:32:43.600 --> 2:32:48.200]  contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:53.680]  up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops. Order your bottle of Alchivision plasma pH drops

[2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:21.160]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones show. Lots of breaking news, big articles
[2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:26.360]  over at infowars.com right now and of course we're streaming live via the internet at
[2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:32.320]  prisenplanet.tv. Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst, is my guest. We're gonna go to your
[2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:36.280]  calls this segment. Hopefully you will stay on topic and I won't get any wild ones like
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:41.840]  I did in the first hour. Alright, let's go to, I believe, we are on Mike in Wyoming.
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:48.360]  Mike, what's on your mind? Maria in Germany. Maria, what's on your mind?
[2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:54.880]  Hi, yeah, thanks so much for your show. I'd like to talk about the bloodlines of Dracula
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:58.440]  and the ongoing left. Alright, that'll be for another day. Thank
[2:33:58.440 --> 2:34:04.560]  you so much. Can we stay on topic here, folks? I'm begging you. Someone give me something
[2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:10.480]  on topic. We've got a new administration coming in six days. We've got a possible world war
[2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:14.640]  about to erupt in the Middle East. I mean, we're talking about not only the Israeli-Palestinian
[2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:19.360]  conflict but we've got Joe Biden overseas trying to smooth things over with Pakistan
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:23.560]  after the Mumbai attacks led back to Pakistani intelligence. This is what I want to talk
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:30.000]  about. I want to talk about what's going on. Not the bloodlines of Dracula. My God. Alright,
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:32.920]  let's go to TD in California. TD, what's on your mind?
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:41.320]  How's it going? Yeah, I got a question and a comment on topic, I hope. Question, if we
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:48.080]  do pull out of the war, and God willing, everything works out, what happens to all those well-trained
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:55.440]  intelligent, armed, educated soldiers when they come home and we don't have jobs out
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:35:00.040]  here? That's a good question. I mean, I'm wondering, first of all, I don't think that
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:03.800]  we're going to pull out of that many military conflicts that won't redistribute our troops
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:07.920]  anyway. But what do you think? Say we do pull out of the war and there's no jobs here.
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:13.440]  But what is going to happen, Mr. McGovern? Well, with all that money that we have already
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:19.280]  given to Wall Street and are now giving to other folks, including the auto companies,
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:25.840]  we create jobs. I mean, this is possible. We have to get out of this war mentality and
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:31.680]  we have to get the military-industrial complex, which is very real, by the way, which is very,
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:39.280]  very real, get them to retool. God knows we need alternatives, sources of energy, we need
[2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:48.200]  wind, solar, we need smart ways to build cars so they don't use up so much fuel. And there
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:52.520]  are all kinds of ways that our economy would keep going and actually be buttressed for the
[2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:59.560]  long run by a huge public works expenditures and other ways to put people to work.
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:04.000]  Are you optimistic that the economy is going to recover? I mean, we got Bernanke yesterday
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:09.440]  calling for more bailouts. A city group, they're saying it's in death rows, but its mortgage
[2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:15.720]  department has already been absorbed by Morgan Stanley. I see a consolidation of banks and
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:19.320]  I see a consolidation of power for the people that print the money in the Federal Reserve
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:23.640]  system. Consentage being on the floor saying that the Federal Reserve is as federal as
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:30.120]  Federal Express is dead on and I'm pretty worried that we might get suckered into yet
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:34.280]  another bailout and there isn't a lot of hope for our economic future.
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:40.960]  Well, you're talking about the old crowd and the one additional reason for concern, of
[2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:46.000]  course, is that some of the old crowd has, for whatever reason, insinuated itself into
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:53.400]  the Obama crowd. We'll just have to see on that. The country is really and truly in dire
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:59.680]  states and I think that what is called for here is the kind of leadership that a new
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:05.920]  person, a person who has won an overwhelming mandate, might be able to lead us into and
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:10.080]  we'll just have to see. I'm not an expert on the economy, but just to see how it works
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:11.080]  out.
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:13.040]  All right. Any other points, TD?
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:18.920]  Actually, on interpreting that metallic video yesterday, I thought it was a lot less about
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:24.840]  Russia even though it gave concrete evidence about Russia. Just to tie it in with the end
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:28.360]  of radio stuff or the newsreel after the newsreels they played, sure.
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:33.320]  Yeah. Just to tie it in with that, I think it's a lot more. It just reminded me of Cobra,
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:36.600]  man. First, they try to be like us, then they attack us.
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:40.760]  I got in so much trouble just for playing that Metallica song on the air. I had some
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:44.120]  of the Christian affiliates out there just can't take a little bit of metal, but when
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:48.960]  you have a video that's not only talking about the eugenics aspect, but then also brings
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:53.280]  chemtrails into the mix by the number one metal band of all time and really one of the
[2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:56.760]  number one rock bands of all time. Metallica, I think it's worth playing. I thank you for
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:01.240]  the call, TD. All right. Let's jump to Ken in Texas. Ken, what's on your mind?
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:02.240]  Hey, Ken.
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:03.240]  Thank you, Jason.
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:04.240]  Yeah.
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:08.360]  I want to make a comment and then ask Ray McGovern a question if that's all right.
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:09.360]  Sure thing.
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:14.640]  Well, we keep talking about the Obama administration. Not only your show, the show I listened to
[2:38:14.640 --> 2:38:22.880]  before, and his administration, as I said. Attorney Philip J. Berg has proved definitively
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:31.640]  on ObamaCrimes.com that Obama is definitely not eligible to be president of the United
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:37.080]  States. Ray McGovern, could he be blackmailed by other countries?
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:40.760]  What he's referring to, obviously, and I'm sure you've heard this. I mean, you're on
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:45.800]  the talk radio circuit somewhat, is whether or not he was born in Hawaii and why he wasn't
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:50.120]  able to show his birth certificate. There is some controversy. He may have been born
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.840]  in Kenya. And I'm sure you've looked around that. I mean, what are your views on those
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:55.840]  theories?
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:01.400]  Yeah. Well, Jason, this is not the kind of thing that I waste a lot of time with. It's
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:08.200]  a crisis for me to hear that this has been looked into. And people I respect indicate
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:13.760]  that there are some peculiarities with the way Hawaii handles original copies of birth
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:18.320]  certificates and that it's just a fluke that is not readily accessible.
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:24.720]  I hear you. I mean, I think more to the point is the fact that, you know, I think what works
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:28.800]  against us possibly with the Obama administration and himself included is that he does take
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:33.840]  more of an internationalist point of view. You know, I was watching a couple of his interviews
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:38.920]  with CNN, and this is a guy that's grown up around the world. And I'm just not sure that
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:42.800]  he's going to have just the United States best interests at heart. I mean, the media
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:47.400]  has called him the next global president the way he's been deified on the cover of the
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:53.160]  Rolling Stone, his speech in Berlin. I think that stuff is a lot more relevant than whether,
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:57.120]  you know, I mean, we could sit here and argue all day whether he's a natural citizen or
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:40:01.440]  not. I think, you know, let's see if the proof is in the pudding. I'm disturbed that it was
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:06.640]  a state senator, you know, who got into the Senate for one term. And by 2007, he had already
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:10.960]  announced his candidacy for the president and won. And this is virtually an unknown.
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:16.080]  This is guy who's not proven. And I guess we're going to see in six days whether he's
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:19.920]  the leader that all these people voted for or not, or just another front man. I mean,
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:24.360]  some again, Rahm Emanuel makes me quite uneasy. All right, let's, let's jump to the next
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:30.200]  one. Let me, let me just turn there, Jason. You know, there are all kinds of ways of looking
[2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:36.720]  at the being a internationalist or not. The way I look at it, you can take it for what
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:42.760]  it's worth is that in this day and age, one needs to have a certain sensitivity to what's
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:49.680]  going on in the rest of the world. And, you know, maybe in a shorthand slogan, I can simply
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:56.600]  say that it would be really neat if when Obama has finished his speech on Tuesday, he finished
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:02.840]  with not God bless America, but God bless America and the rest of the world too. Because
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:08.000]  that's the attitude we need to adopt, you know, we can't be sitting here and watch the
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:15.820]  Israelis kill over a thousand now cousins in a kind of shooting pool and not be concerned
[2:41:15.820 --> 2:41:20.840]  about that and not move to stop it. And yet we Americans have been kind of educated to
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:25.840]  say, well, you know, we're, we're America first people and we only care about our interests
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:30.160]  and you know, it's too bad about those guys as well. That's not the proper approach in
[2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:35.160]  my view, not only morally, but politically. And I just need, I felt I needed to say that.
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:38.720]  Yeah, no, I agree with you there. I think that, you know, a lot of the dehumanization
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:42.840]  that occurs for people outside of this country is just plain wrong. But at the same time,
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:47.080]  I am an America first guy in that I really think that we have to clean up the mess here
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:51.920]  before we go into an Afghanistan, you know, full force again or no quarrel there. Yeah,
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:57.440]  yeah. And you know, it just, it to me, again, we'll see. But the way that he's talking about
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:01.760]  global citizenship, sacrifice and service, I really, I really feel like we're getting
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:06.760]  set up for something here. Maybe I'm wrong. All right, let's jump to Michael in the Netherlands.
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:11.160]  Michael, what's on your mind? Hey, how you doing? Jason, I want to thank
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:15.280]  you for taking my call. Although for the Alex Jones show, I think you're going a little
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:19.080]  bit soft on Ray McGovern. Yeah, you know, one CAA, always CAA.
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:25.400]  Oh, come on. You know, Michael, hold on. Let me, let me, let me, let me cut you off
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:29.760]  for a second. You know, Ray has done this show on many an occasion. He's given me a
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.320]  personal interview a couple years ago. He's one of the most outspoken people I've seen
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:39.360]  in the anti-war movement in years. He confronted Rumsfeld for God's sakes. And I know that
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:43.920]  Ray's heart is in the right place. And you know, anybody who doubts that, listen, I know
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:48.080]  that one CAA, always CAA, that's not always the case. You know, there are a lot of good
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:54.440]  people that work within these intelligence organizations, not only the CAA, but the FBI,
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:59.200]  the NSA, and they really are trying to work for our best interests. It's only the upper
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:05.280]  echelon, the top of the cream that really does some of this revolting tyrannical stuff.
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:09.800]  And I mean, you know, Mr. McGovern, you worked in the agency for years and years and years.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:13.040]  Isn't that the case? Aren't most people really looking out for the best interests of the
[2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:14.440]  people in those organizations?
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:20.440]  Most of the people down the line, as you explained it, certainly are. It's the corrupt leaders
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:26.600]  that have been hoisted upon us, those involved in things like prostituting the intelligence
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:32.400]  process, corrupting the product. And we're still torturing people, kidnapping them and
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:37.680]  putting them in black holes without telling their wives or children or even the Red Cross.
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:43.200]  So yeah, there have been abuses. There are lots of us still around, and some still in
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:50.400]  the agency who are trying to correct those abuses. And the naming of Leon Panetta is
[2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:55.760]  a milestone in this, and I dearly hope that he can get the agency back on track.
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:59.080]  And personally, I'm just thankful that we can get all sorts of views. I'm thankful that
[2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:03.240]  Ray McGovern will do this show because I'm here to hear all voices. They may not agree
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:07.840]  with me 100% on every nuance, but that can't be expected because I don't agree with Alex
[2:44:07.840 --> 2:44:12.080]  Jones on every nuance. We're all different people. I think when we stop listening to
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:16.680]  other people's opinion, that's the real danger. I thank you for the call, Michael.
[2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:19.800]  Let's go to John in California. John, what's on your mind?
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:26.280]  Hey there, how you guys doing? Good. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up on people
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:30.880]  that don't believe in this collapse of the dollar. My mother recently came back from
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:36.360]  Mexico and she went to three different banks that would not take her dollars anymore. So
[2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:41.080]  you have to go to private school houses to exchange your dollars.
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:46.480]  I think that once you saw, I think it's now almost a year ago, when you saw the dollar
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.160]  go on parody with the Canadian dollar, and now the Canadian dollar is just worth slightly
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:55.480]  more, and you saw how much less you got in Mexico when you brought American dollars
[2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:59.600]  down there. You better believe people are going to stop taking that currency. Listen,
[2:44:59.600 --> 2:45:03.760]  that's why it's important to get hard currency. I'm a big gold and silver guy. Personally,
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:08.440]  I can't afford gold, but silver I can afford. Midas resources, man. Protect yourself. We've
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:13.400]  been preaching that for years and years on this show. I remember when I was just a listener
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:20.000]  to this show back in 02 and 03, and gold was still at 300, some odd dollars an ounce, and
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:25.200]  it's more than doubled that in less than 10 years, and really less than six years. It's
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:29.760]  amazing to me. So it's always good to be protected. I would not be keeping a whole lot of money
[2:45:29.760 --> 2:45:33.960]  in the bank right now. I mean, that's just the way it is. Who knows what's going to
[2:45:33.960 --> 2:45:37.760]  be announced in the next couple of weeks? Who knows how many bailouts will pass? What
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:42.480]  banks will go under? I mean, the depression actually happened. There were runs on banks.
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:46.360]  It's happened in the past, and if there's anything I've learned is that we tend to like
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:51.840]  to repeat the past because we don't know about it, and most people remain so ignorant about
[2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:55.920]  how the financial process currently works that I think that's what we're in store for.
[2:45:55.920 --> 2:46:01.360]  All right, let's jump to Michael in Massachusetts. Michael, what's on your mind? You with us?
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:04.720]  Hey, I am. How's it going, gentlemen? Hi, Michael.
[2:46:04.720 --> 2:46:12.960]  Hey, Ray. I wanted to kind of ask you a question. I listened to what you say, and a lot of what
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:17.640]  you say is interesting. I saw that Rumsfeld confrontation, and Mark went down for the
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:22.440]  good guys. That was definitely embarrassing towards him, and it fired me up. But when
[2:46:22.440 --> 2:46:29.520]  I hear you talk about saying, oh, I want to see Obama get a group of wise men to really
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:34.800]  go over the problem and see if we can figure something out, it almost seems like you don't
[2:46:34.800 --> 2:46:44.320]  know about Bohemian Grove and all the totally ludicrous banana morals that these people
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:51.400]  are working on. Do you understand that it's like a Machiavellian thing where they don't
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:54.480]  give a damn about people and justifies the means?
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:46:58.840]  All right, let me ask you that question. Obviously, you do these radio shows. You've
[2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:03.080]  heard about the secret societies. Outside of Bohemian Grove, I'm sure that you wouldn't
[2:47:03.080 --> 2:47:10.640]  argue that when people go to these Bilderberg conferences or Davos or even trilateral meetings,
[2:47:10.640 --> 2:47:14.760]  these are meetings that aren't often made public or the results of which aren't often
[2:47:14.760 --> 2:47:17.880]  made public and decisions are made there. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. McGovern?
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.800]  Sure. I mean, you're absolutely right. The question is whether Barack Obama would ever
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:28.600]  be invited to Bohemian Grove. I know the guys that went there because they used to brief
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:37.280]  him, and that includes relatively well-balanced people like George Schultz of all people.
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:41.160]  Yes, George Schultz is a member, absolutely. So they go up there and they covork the nude
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:49.080]  and I don't know what else they do. And Bilderberg, yeah, that's exactly right. The question is
[2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:56.960]  whether Barack Obama is in that coterie of privileged, wealthy folks. I want to believe
[2:47:56.960 --> 2:48:02.600]  that he's not. I think his whole past shows that he's not. And I take great encouragement
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:08.040]  from that to think that when he convenes a little wise men and wise men and women circle,
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:11.880]  it won't include these guys. It won't include people like us, people who know which end
[2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:18.240]  is up in Afghanistan, in Iraq, academics, people from the press, not from the fawning
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:25.160]  corporate press here in the States, but from the international press, and get himself educated.
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:31.280]  And so I take your point, Michael, but I had the foggiest notion that any of those folks
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:37.400]  would resemble in any way, shape, or form the Bohemian Grove or Bilderberg kinds of folks.
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:42.120]  Well, I know my listeners will yell at me if I don't make you aware, but this year it
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:48.600]  does appear that when Barack Obama ditched his press entourage right after he had got
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:53.200]  the nomination, that he and Hillary Clinton were meeting in a secret location in D.C.
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:57.200]  first to be said, Hillary's house, then it wasn't Hillary's house, then later it was
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:02.680]  Diane Feinstein's house, five miles away from where Bilderberg was held this year. You take
[2:49:02.680 --> 2:49:07.640]  it for what it's worth. I don't trust them. But then again, I don't trust most of the
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:11.440]  establishment these days, and I don't think that, especially people listening to this
[2:49:11.440 --> 2:49:15.840]  program, but I don't think most people do. You want to be optimistic. You want to hope
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:22.040]  that this is the great change that everybody's talking about it. But just like you, I try
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:25.080]  to take everything with a grain of salt, and we'll see when the proof is in the pudding.
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:30.240]  Guys, we're six days away. Like you said, Mr. McGovern, you'd like to hear him reach
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:34.840]  out to the rest of the world in this inaugural speech. Do you think that's happened? Do you
[2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:38.680]  think that there is a chance that we can reach out to the rest of the world and maybe solve
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:41.080]  some of the problems we've had over the last eight years?
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:47.640]  Well, the world is waiting. That's clear. I mean, never before has it been such a one-sided
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:54.960]  acclimation of a newly elected president. It's just mind-boggling. We can't hope to understand
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:50:00.160]  what it means for people abroad, and the question will be really whether he can break the shackles
[2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:05.320]  of the establishment here in a way that will not derail him, in a way that will not get
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:11.360]  him shot, in a way that will allow him to make political progress here. I think the
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:17.240]  jury is out. It's very appropriate to be skeptical, and particularly if someone like
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:24.640]  Hillary Clinton, who has earned that kind of skepticism, Obama, for me, is kind of tabula
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:29.720]  rasa so far. I mean, he's got a lot of good stuff, a lot of questionable stuff, particularly
[2:50:29.720 --> 2:50:35.560]  with his appointments to the defense sector. But let's see what he does, and I think it's
[2:50:35.560 --> 2:50:40.720]  reasonable to be hopeful as well as reserved and cynical.
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:43.280]  Thank you so much for joining us this hour, Mr. McGovern.
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:51.200]  Thank you so much, and we take the hard questions here. We take the callers. It's the Alex Jones
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:51:02.280]  show. We'll be back after this infowars.com and prismplanet.tv.

[2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:08.200]  Today, unlike any other, in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy
[2:52:08.200 --> 2:52:13.800]  struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. We see his M.O.s.
[2:52:13.800 --> 2:52:17.840]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies
[2:52:17.840 --> 2:52:22.480]  is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:27.560]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:33.800]  much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have
[2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:36.880]  been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the
[2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:41.920]  hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:46.640]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:52.120]  DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles

[2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:25.680]  save some cash.
[2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:40.080]  All right, folks, we are back. It's the Alex Jones show. Look, I feel bad for cutting
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:44.960]  off that woman in Germany because she's from Germany. If you want to talk about Dracula's
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:48.680]  bloodlines, we'll talk about it. You can call back in. We're taking calls for the next hour
[2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:56.200]  here on the Alex Jones show. Yes, it appears that both Bush and Kerry on some level are
[2:54:56.200 --> 2:55:05.880]  descendants of basically the guy who Dracula's based on. It's true. Great. All right. That's
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:09.680]  not what I want to talk about when I have Ray McGovern on. I want to talk about intelligence
[2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:14.080]  issues. I want to talk about global politics. If we had Tex Mars on, that's great. We can
[2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:18.560]  talk about that. If we had someone like Fred Springmeyer, 13 Bloodlines Lee Illuminati,
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:26.800]  you can get that at infowars.com. It's interesting info, but come on, folks. I feel like because
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:31.640]  I'm in for Alex Jones, the attack dogs are coming on. I have people talking about race
[2:55:31.640 --> 2:55:35.840]  wars. Let me tell you a little something about the race wars. It's not going to happen, genius.
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:42.320]  If you're still caught up in race having anything to do with the world elite or the power elite
[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:47.360]  and we need to kill the blacks or the Jews or anybody who's not white, this isn't the
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:52.680]  program to call into because I don't want to hear that nonsense. It's total garbage.
[2:55:52.680 --> 2:55:57.800]  If you're a part of that organization, one of those neo-Nazi organizations or one of
[2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:01.960]  those anti-Semitic organizations, one of the hardcore ones that really does hate people
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:07.280]  based on their race, it's time to look in the mirror and really see why you hate yourself,
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:12.480]  you retard. How can you have hate for somebody not based on the content of their character
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:17.080]  but the color of their skin? I'm a Martin Luther King Jr. fan. I don't know about you.
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:21.080]  I feel like you should get to know somebody before you automatically dislike them. Call
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:28.560]  me nuts. All right. It's open phone lines for the next hour. Let's go to DeWitt in Texas.
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:33.480]  DeWitt, where's that Dwight? Okay, Dwight, what's on your mind?
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:39.040]  I was calling to make a correction about something you said on the show yesterday in regard to
[2:56:39.040 --> 2:56:44.640]  the Mythbusters article. Okay, yeah. The article is actually a hoax printed on the web, so
[2:56:44.640 --> 2:56:52.240]  that's not going to happen. If you go to the Mythbusters forum, it says that it's inappropriate
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:56.120]  to talk about those comments. I also just wanted to bring up something since you just
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:00.640]  said that you need to get to know somebody before you really hate them. I was trying
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:06.040]  to bring up an article that I saw on the Loose Change forums. It was entitled, It's Snowing
[2:57:06.040 --> 2:57:11.400]  in Hell and it was right after Tony Snow had passed away. It was a really scathing article
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:17.600]  that you posted yourself. It was two paragraphs and you can bring it up. It wasn't scathing
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:24.240]  at all. I think it's my entitlement. Well, I did it. It was like a first of all scathing
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:31.720]  article. It was a two paragraph blog line. Tony Snow is not a good person, bro. Tony
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:39.280]  Snow was a Fox News anchor who then got appointed to Bush's press secretary who spewed lie after
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:45.560]  lie, not only in the press on the podium, but when I would tune into Bill Maher on HBO,
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:49.160]  he'd spew lie after lie there. Look, Tony Snow, not a good person. I'm not cramming
[2:57:49.160 --> 2:57:50.160]  over stuff.
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:52.920]  It was so inappropriate that you had to remove it from your blog immediately.
[2:57:52.920 --> 2:57:54.680]  I didn't pull it. Someone else pulled it.
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:58.240]  Okay, so other people that do, yeah, so it was so inappropriate that it wasn't able
[2:57:58.240 --> 2:57:59.240]  to stay on your blog.
[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:02.840]  Listen, no, no, no, not true at all. I don't think it was inappropriate one bit. I based
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:08.080]  my article by the content of that man's character, not the color of his skin, not his position.
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:13.400]  All I'm doing is posting what I felt about a person who lied to the American people
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:18.120]  and lied to the world and caused thousands and thousands of people overseas. And guess
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:24.240]  what? In this country too, yes, military forces to die, to die. He is not a good man. Although
[2:58:24.240 --> 2:58:28.240]  I do like calls that challenge my position. Thanks for the call Dwight. We're going to
[2:58:28.240 --> 2:58:43.240]  keep taking your calls to see Alex Jones' show, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:51.520]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:55.240]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[2:58:55.240 --> 2:58:59.520]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:03.200]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your
[2:59:03.200 --> 2:59:07.040]  own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of
[2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:11.040]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[2:59:11.040 --> 2:59:15.520]  family in the final equation, but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
[2:59:15.520 --> 2:59:20.320]  horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports. And
[2:59:20.320 --> 2:59:26.080]  they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633

[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:48.400]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Take action today. The first step is getting
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:59.400]  extra horrible food. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:22.840]  Alex Jones show I am. Jason Burma is sitting in all week. We have cut transmission over
[3:00:22.840 --> 3:00:28.200]  at PrismPlanet.tv. But remember, if you missed any of the show today, you can retune in an
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:32.280]  hour from now and we'll be re- Broadcasting all four hours. Really a GMPact show. Michael
[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:39.240]  Rivera via the webcam. Rainbow govern. Boy, the callers just today are just unreal. They're
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:45.120]  like darts in the chest. They're looking to peg after the guests and the hosts. Before
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:49.640]  I keep taking your calls, we're going to take calls for the entire hour, open phone lines.
[3:00:49.640 --> 3:00:55.080]  Hopefully, we'll stay somewhat on topic, but I'm more open to other calls. Alex Jones'
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:01:01.320]  Tyranny Crusher won a bullhorn over $50,000. Of course, there are some people who are trying
[3:01:01.320 --> 3:01:05.800]  to spoil the pot and put in fake bids. Please don't put in fake bids. I know there are some
[3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:11.480]  people out there who have some deep pockets who listen to this program and not only do
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:18.400]  you get just an extraordinary piece of memorabilia, but you help this operation grow and expand
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:25.800]  and bring the truth to more and more people. You want to hear inside information from a
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:32.560]  guy who worked with Robert Gates. You get that on this show. You want information about
[3:01:32.560 --> 3:01:36.600]  what's going on on the Gaza Strip. You get it on this show. You want to know what's really
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:41.640]  going down with the endless banker bailouts that we're having to endure. It's on this
[3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:49.640]  show. It's not some mindless creed like, yes, we can. No, we have. That's what it is. No,
[3:01:49.640 --> 3:01:55.360]  we have. We've done it. We have continuously been at the tip of the spear, the forefront
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:58.240]  of the Info War, and we'd like to continue to do so.
[3:01:58.240 --> 3:02:03.600]  All right. Let's take our first caller of the hour. Let's go to B in Illinois. B, what's
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:07.520]  on your mind? You with us, B?
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:08.520]  Hello.
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  Yes.
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:13.040]  Something on your mind, sir. Yes.
[3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:14.040]  Chicago.
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:21.240]  You guys were talking earlier about Obama being from Kenya. If the guy was from Hawaii, we'll
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:28.480]  say hypothetically he was. You can look up online November 23rd of 93, Clinton signed
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:35.520]  a public law 103-150, which basically acknowledges the illegal actions of the United States over
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:41.000]  throwing a legitimate government, which means that Hawaii is not a state. Basically, even
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:46.360]  if he is from Hawaii or was born there, he's still not eligible as far as the Constitution
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:47.360]  goes to be president.
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:51.960]  Well, I don't think he was. First of all, whether or not he's eligible is almost the
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:57.640]  moot point, because let's say that the Constitution says he's not eligible. Some court rules in
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:02.320]  favor of Phil Berg. I think that what they'll do is they'll have a constitutional amendment
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:05.120]  so that other foreigners, I don't think they're going to get rid of the guy no matter what.
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:10.640]  I think they'll further use it to progress their agenda, and you'll see somebody like
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:16.360]  Arnold Schwarzenegger suddenly be available to run for office. This guy is their cult
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:21.640]  leader. There's a reason he's on the cover of Us Weekly, a rag for women. There's a
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:27.000]  reason he's on the cover of Rolling Stone posed as a deity, because he is to be our
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:31.520]  next leader. He's our next leader. I love Ray McGovern to death. I'm glad he does the
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:35.640]  show. I'm glad he'll come on and discuss a lot of this stuff with me, but I really think
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:40.600]  he is being somewhat naive with the Obama camp. Again, he's trying to stay optimistic
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:41.600]  and positive.
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:46.020]  I'm sure in a couple of months when this administration has proven himself as nothing
[3:03:46.020 --> 3:03:52.200]  but a tool of the elites that he will come in and denounce them. Let's say it's true.
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:54.880]  I don't think it's going to make much of a difference in the long run. I thank you for
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:59.680]  the call. Let's go to Matthew in New Jersey. Matthew, what's on your mind?
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:03.360]  I just wanted to tell you that I agree with you. I think it'd be nice to hear a little
[3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:09.960]  bit more about the fact that it seems to me that we are being set up here with the Joe
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:15.320]  Biden speech about to mark my words and all that garbage that he was talking about, and
[3:04:15.320 --> 3:04:22.160]  then you got basically the Colin Powell January 21st crisis when the news reporter that sat
[3:04:22.160 --> 3:04:27.000]  there didn't even bother to ask him anything more about it, and he didn't bother to even
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:32.120]  explain it to the people what that crisis may or may not be. It came to my attention
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:37.480]  that apparently we all know that these guys are into astrology and numerology, and it looks
[3:04:37.480 --> 3:04:44.160]  like the 21st happens to be some planetary alignment in astrology that has to deal with
[3:04:44.160 --> 3:04:47.120]  a four horseman and tragedy and all kinds of other stuff.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:52.920]  Wonderful. Well, you know they are into this esoteric stuff. They believe in it. These
[3:04:52.920 --> 3:04:58.240]  people that you think are Christian conservatives are really occultic paganists. It's the Alex
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:01.840]  Jones show. We'll be back after this infowars.com.
[3:05:01.840 --> 3:05:06.120]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is
[3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:10.280]  going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar powered generators are
[3:05:10.280 --> 3:05:15.440]  now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:19.960]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:25.000]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:29.480]  for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run
[3:05:29.480 --> 3:05:34.200]  some pumps, short wave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether
[3:05:34.200 --> 3:05:38.440]  it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through
[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:43.040]  painful power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar powered
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:48.880]  generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid
[3:05:48.880 --> 3:06:00.680]  today. That's mysolarbackup.com today. Or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait.
[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:01.680]  Call today.
[3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:07.160]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:06:07.160 --> 3:06:08.660]  against this country.
[3:06:08.660 --> 3:06:12.880]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:17.960]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:06:17.960 --> 3:06:22.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:25.240]  networks inside the United States.
[3:06:25.240 --> 3:06:29.680]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:06:29.680 --> 3:06:31.880]  in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:35.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.480 --> 3:06:41.000]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:45.040]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[3:06:45.040 --> 3:06:46.040]  much more.
[3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:51.680]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with
[3:06:51.680 --> 3:06:54.760]  hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:07:21.880]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:07:21.880 --> 3:07:22.880]  We'll snap out of it.
[3:07:22.880 --> 3:07:24.280]  We now have a deadline.
[3:07:24.280 --> 3:07:26.560]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[3:07:26.560 --> 3:07:31.200]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press, and pointed to about
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:35.960]  January 22 as the time a major international incident would force the new president to
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:38.360]  make unpopular decisions.
[3:07:38.360 --> 3:07:42.680]  While I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession,
[3:07:42.680 --> 3:07:48.440]  prior to the inauguration, contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline
[3:07:48.440 --> 3:07:49.960]  for disaster.
[3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:54.240]  Ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon, or too little too late?
[3:07:54.240 --> 3:08:03.240]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:08:03.240 --> 3:08:09.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:14.080]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:21.240]  Alright folks, remember, the rebroadcast begins at infowars.com at the bottom of the hour.
[3:08:21.240 --> 3:08:25.480]  And if you missed any of it, the news blitz that came in the first hour, I mean we talked
[3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:31.680]  Bella, we talked Citigroup, we talked Pakistan, we talked Bernanke, we talked Noriega, we
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:37.000]  talked Kerry, we talked about the new global warming czar for a moment, yes.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:39.760]  The World Socialist Group, that's good.
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:42.000]  We call for global governance.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:45.880]  And of course, there's no problem with her being on the Obama administration because
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:48.040]  that's what they'll be calling for.
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:51.080]  Something I didn't bring up with Ray McGovern basically because he probably didn't know
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:08:55.640]  who that appointment was and it's probably not up to date on that one.
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:09:01.240]  But you have Newsweek's cover story saying Obama's chain dilemma, you know, I'm just
[3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:05.840]  going to keep all of these executive orders and, rightfully so, McGovern got that debt
[3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:06.840]  on.
[3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:11.640]  He said that there's really nothing to rescind since all these laws were unconstitutional.
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:15.200]  Alright, let's jump to our next caller.
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:17.480]  Let's go to Michael in Texas.
[3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:19.480]  Michael, what's on your mind?
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:28.480]  Hey, Jason, I want to say I'm a big fan of yours back when I was first away from your
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.800]  movie Loose Change was one of the first movies that I'd seen.
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:40.840]  Also, to get your idea or your thoughts on the constitutional convention and let the
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:45.920]  odds are that actually passing, I know there were only two states away from having the
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:49.080]  opportunity to rewrite our constitution.
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:55.440]  You know, con-cons are difficult and there's definitely that threat, that possibility that
[3:09:55.440 --> 3:09:56.920]  they would use that.
[3:09:56.920 --> 3:10:01.880]  But I have found that we really haven't had many constitutional amendments lately and
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:07.160]  the way that they circumvent that is they just pass executive orders and through the
[3:10:07.160 --> 3:10:14.600]  National Security Act they get things like the Patriots 1 and 2 passed, the Military
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:19.320]  Commissions Act which is just disgusting in every way shape or form so I don't know if
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:25.440]  we're going to need a constitutional convention to get some of these pieces of legislation
[3:10:25.440 --> 3:10:28.760]  in place or ideas in place or laws in place, whatever you want to call them.
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:33.760]  I think that they're going to just keep circumventing that and the only way that you'll see a constitutional
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:40.200]  amendment in this country is if for some reason Barak is out, it is a non-natural citizen
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:41.880]  but I really don't see that in the cards.
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:47.400]  I mean these guys do what they want, I cannot see that, you know, being on ABC and NBC News
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:50.560]  but maybe I'm wrong, you know, I'm not right all the time.
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:51.560]  Anything else, Michael?
[3:10:51.560 --> 3:10:55.440]  No, that's all I wanted to see.
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:59.320]  Alright man, thank you so much for the call, let's jump to Tom in Pennsylvania, Tom, what's
[3:10:59.320 --> 3:11:00.320]  on your mind?
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:01.320]  Hey Jason.
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:02.320]  How you doing?
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:03.320]  Good.
[3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:08.320]  I got caught off air yesterday, I know you were running out of time but I was talking
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:15.400]  about this on the milk and I'm sorry to be off the topic on that but when I was talking
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:18.880]  about you buying the cow, I'm not talking about you taking it home, I'm talking about
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:24.360]  you buying it from the farmer, he keeps the cow, you get a percentage of the milk, he
[3:11:24.360 --> 3:11:29.640]  uses the remainder of the milk, you get about eight gallons a day out of the cow, he takes
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:35.200]  the remainder of that milk, sells it or does whatever he wants to maintain your animal
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:42.480]  for you and that way when you go to the farm to get your milk, you're getting your milk,
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:44.360]  you're not buying milk from him.
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:47.560]  You know, that sounds like a great idea too, did you listen to the, there was a caller
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:52.480]  in the first hour of the show that actually was part of a program, I believe he was in
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:58.240]  Michigan and the program was in Indiana or Illinois and what you did is you bought the
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:04.000]  cow and the farmer tended to it and then he would ship them the milk and cheese from that
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:08.680]  cow but again, that was stopped because he was selling it from state to state and the
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:10.680]  same groups went after him as well.
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:15.440]  Oh, I missed that but you know, I've been buying my milk from the same guy for the
[3:12:15.440 --> 3:12:18.520]  last 18 years, something like that.
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:21.480]  And I bet you're pretty healthy, you're not worried about getting sick because it's not
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:22.480]  pasteurized, are you?
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:27.240]  Oh, I'm fifty-some years old and I get around pretty well for all the broken bones I've
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:32.160]  had over the years but I want to thank you for taking my call.
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:35.560]  Hey, you got it man, hey, I think that's a great idea, I thought that the caller earlier
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:38.960]  today talking about that, you know, that's awesome.
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:44.000]  That is a way to try to get around it but it just seems like the powers that be are
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:48.040]  going to keep going after the independent farmers no matter what loopholes you think
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:53.240]  you're going to find and it's just like the IRS man, they've got an unlimited amount
[3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:58.280]  of funds and resources to come after you so they are going to make it as difficult as
[3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:03.960]  possible for you to try to defend your constitutional rights as an American citizen.
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:08.160]  The right to life, liberty and happiness.
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:12.280]  And they're really going to challenge not only your will but your wallet and sometimes
[3:13:12.280 --> 3:13:16.160]  your wallet can't sustain that especially in the economic times we're in now.
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:19.760]  Alright, let's go to Darrell in Texas, Darrell, what's on your mind?
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:24.320]  Hey Jason, it's Darrell man, I met you down there with Alex right after you had your
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:25.320]  tooth done.
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:26.320]  Okay, alright, cool.
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:31.600]  Hey man, hey I wanted to bring up an interesting topic on this race, you know in the election
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:39.520]  with Obama, I believe about half of the white people voted for him whereas I think 90 percent
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:44.280]  of people who are African Americans voted for Obama which I think begs the question
[3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:48.240]  then who's really racist.
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:53.720]  That's a good point, you know, well you know what, I find that these provocateur groups
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:58.560]  always seem to, like today I got the call, you know, when they kill Obama the inaugural
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:02.880]  address is the race war going to kick off, there's no race war going on, there's never
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:08.320]  going to be a race war in this country, I think that that time of ignorance has passed,
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:13.080]  you know there still remain a lot of racists out there but you know I really, I mean you
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:19.040]  may disagree but I really see the push of Obama into the youth culture, you know not
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:23.720]  only with the magazine covers but with the clothing line as a way to get us ready for
[3:14:23.720 --> 3:14:27.440]  some kind of new national service and I think that's where me and Mr. McGovern are going
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:31.600]  to disagree, I don't think it's a great idea to have any kind of mandatory conscription
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:36.000]  whether or not it's for the armed forces or a domestic unit, yeah you're going to build
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.560]  camaraderie with, you know, other people from other cultures but can't we find a better
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:45.480]  way than enslaving, basically enslaving us and saying this is the enemy, you know he
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:50.400]  said well I hope that, you know, if another Hitler arose that we would have the common
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:54.160]  sense to have conscription, I hate to tell him but I feel like another Hitler arose in
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:59.200]  the last eight years and although it wasn't Bush it was under the guise of that administration
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:03.240]  and that same force, that same entity is going to be pulling me at strings with the same
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:07.120]  administration, this new one, the Obama administration, you think I'm off on that Darrell?
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:11.720]  Oh I think you're right, I think this is what we could affectionately call government grad
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:15.760]  school, I mean they're going to indoctrinate our kids in the public school as well as then
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:21.440]  continue that education and indoctrination in the social service of the government and
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:26.960]  I think it's going to be a lot easier to do, you know I was watching the Obama Youth Brigade
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:30.960]  video for the first time this week as I was gathering footage and this isn't something
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:36.800]  that was a national program, this was a teacher at a public school who got all of his students
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:40.720]  to do this little youth march, in fact we should bring that up, hopefully they'll get
[3:15:40.720 --> 3:15:44.840]  the Obama Youth Brigade thing and we'll play it in the next thing, but these guys were
[3:15:44.840 --> 3:15:50.640]  saying, you know basically saying their life goals because of Obama they can now do it
[3:15:50.640 --> 3:15:55.720]  and they're all wearing Obama t-shirts and fatigues, it shows you the mindset of some
[3:15:55.720 --> 3:16:00.200]  of these disenfranchised youth, you know this is the new leader.
[3:16:00.200 --> 3:16:05.640]  Hey I did want to mention one other thing, I'm sorry to kind of get off topic here but
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:10.640]  you know a while back in the first debate between Obama and McCain, they asked McCain,
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:17.280]  are we safer today than we were the day after 9-11 and he said and I quote, Joe Lieberman
[3:16:17.280 --> 3:16:22.560]  and I started the 9-11 commission and we were stymied and stifled by the Bush administration
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:26.680]  and it wasn't until the families came forward demanding there be an investigation that one
[3:16:26.680 --> 3:16:30.640]  went forward, so I just kind of want to put this call out there to all the people who
[3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:34.640]  like yourself or Luke or other people with We Are Change or you know who are interviewing
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:39.840]  and if you happen to run into McCain, you might quote him on that, you know, come in
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:44.160]  and then ask him, did Bush say why he stymied and stifled that investigation?
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:48.280]  I mean that begs the question, why wouldn't you want to investigate the biggest terrorist
[3:16:48.280 --> 3:16:52.320]  attack of all time, the same act that caused us to go to war in two different countries
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:54.440]  with billions and billions of dollars?
[3:16:54.440 --> 3:16:58.760]  I have to agree with you there and I thank you for the call Darrell, in fact in 9-11 Chronicles
[3:16:58.760 --> 3:17:04.200]  Truth Rising when Luke does get ahold of McCain and he's talking to him about the 9-11 commission
[3:17:04.200 --> 3:17:09.360]  and he says, well the 9-11 commissioners themselves said they were set up to fail and you can
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:13.760]  see the look on McCain's face, he's like, oh you do know that, well you got me there.
[3:17:13.760 --> 3:17:18.880]  So that's on YouTube and of course you can get a hard copy over at infowars.com right
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:19.880]  now.
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:24.400]  Alright, let's go to Ricky all the way from Taiwan, Ricky what's on your mind?
[3:17:24.400 --> 3:17:32.000]  Hey Jason, yeah I just wanted to talk about an idea for how to fight this new world order.
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:43.200]  Okay, you're still with us Ricky, we're going to have to drop them, okay okay, go ahead.
[3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:51.000]  Yeah, hear me, yeah it's about identifying the enemy and you know it's like everybody
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:56.640]  just always says you know they are the new world order or you know the powers that be
[3:17:56.640 --> 3:18:03.480]  or whatever and certain people like we are change you know they get out there and confront
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:11.760]  a lot of people and stuff but you know I think it's time to start putting some names
[3:18:11.760 --> 3:18:17.720]  and faces to the people who are doing the things like we are changes in the right direction
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:23.880]  but there's something to help them and this is the idea to like have a database or something
[3:18:23.880 --> 3:18:30.040]  of people in there and what they've done and things that you can confront them about because
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:36.240]  like I've seen we are change when they do confront people and some good people they
[3:18:36.240 --> 3:18:44.960]  confronted like Richard Haas and even Henry Kissinger, yeah but they sort of, I've seen
[3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:50.120]  a lot of opportunities where they kind of waste the question and they don't get, like
[3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:57.160]  I asked Richard Haas about why does the FBI not list Ben Laden as his wanted crime for
[3:18:57.160 --> 3:19:05.920]  9-11 you know and you know if there was somewhere you could, you know if they could, somebody
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:11.480]  could get together and build a database of people and names and faces and what they've
[3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:17.320]  done and maybe like a top 10 list of questions, well maybe we need like a global elite.org
[3:19:17.320 --> 3:19:21.920]  or something, I have to agree with you, I mean a lot of the times I'll get a call from somebody
[3:19:21.920 --> 3:19:25.160]  and we are changed when they're about to go confront somebody and they ask me what questions
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:29.480]  they should ask and sometimes I have a good question, sometimes I don't, I'm one of those
[3:19:29.480 --> 3:19:34.880]  big firm believers and you catch more flies with honey so often when I approach these
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:38.640]  guys and it's been a while, I haven't had a camera in a while, you know I try to ask
[3:19:38.640 --> 3:19:43.080]  something not from a softball perspective but one that they can relate to so I can get
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:47.640]  a real honest answer, I definitely think that more people should put websites out there,
[3:19:47.640 --> 3:20:13.600]  it's infowars.com and prismplanet.tv, we thank you for the call, truthnews.us.
[3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:26.160]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[3:20:26.160 --> 3:20:28.200]  to grow at our own door.
[3:20:28.200 --> 3:20:33.480]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:20:33.480 --> 3:20:37.080]  An inside job, how dare you.
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:43.560]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason.
[3:20:43.560 --> 3:20:58.640]  Truth rise, download the film at prismplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:20:58.640 --> 3:21:03.200]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:08.160]  Hi this is Ted Anderson, have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:11.040]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:21:11.040 --> 3:21:16.960]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the financial
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:22.040]  industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[3:21:22.040 --> 3:21:28.240]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs,
[3:21:28.240 --> 3:21:30.160]  yet no word about IRAs.
[3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:34.280]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[3:21:34.280 --> 3:21:35.640]  you in paper.
[3:21:35.640 --> 3:21:41.520]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:21:41.520 --> 3:21:46.040]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments,
[3:21:46.040 --> 3:21:48.920]  call 800-686-2237.
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:54.880]  Make sure that you secure your future, call 800-686-2237.
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:22:03.440]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:03.440 --> 3:22:09.120]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:11.400]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[3:22:11.400 --> 3:22:13.840]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[3:22:13.840 --> 3:22:17.560]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:20.840]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[3:22:20.840 --> 3:22:26.120]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:29.160]  law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:30.280]  Need something more?
[3:22:30.280 --> 3:22:34.360]  The Stinger Keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.

[3:23:01.720 --> 3:23:05.160]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[3:23:05.160 --> 3:23:07.100]  Only to find the one that you have is broken.
[3:23:07.100 --> 3:23:09.800]  The batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough.
[3:23:09.800 --> 3:23:11.360]  You need the pack light.
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:16.400]  The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market and simply snaps onto any 9 volt
[3:23:16.400 --> 3:23:19.640]  battery and uses two high powered LED lights.
[3:23:19.640 --> 3:23:23.160]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket car garage and home.
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:25.600]  The pack light can survive severe impact.
[3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:27.960]  It can be frozen solid and still work flawlessly.
[3:23:27.960 --> 3:23:31.920]  The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them and has been featured in the
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:34.320]  New York Times and Backpacker magazine.
[3:23:34.320 --> 3:23:39.000]  The pack light comes with a 25 year warranty and prices started just $12.99.

[3:23:55.800 --> 3:24:16.600]  Alright we are blasting through your calls here at the Alex Jones show, I am Jason Bermas
[3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:23.080]  sitting in all week for Alex Jones, tomorrow we're going to have a guest host with myself
[3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:29.680]  in studio, Bob Dacey, I've done his local access Austin show many a times, a little bit
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:35.000]  more of a refined viewpoint from him, I'm kind of all over the place, I'm sure Mr. Dacey
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:38.720]  will bring a nice balance to the show, now before we go back to your calls I do want
[3:24:38.720 --> 3:24:42.840]  to thank a couple of our great sponsors, they make this show possible.
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:49.840]  MySolarBackup.com, the number is 877-327-0365, that's MySolarBackup.com, no mystery here
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:54.480]  folks it's solar power, it actually works, it cuts down your bills, many people are
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:59.200]  using solar power right now, I mean Jesse Ventura basically powers his entire Mexican
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:03.400]  home from solar, so if you're interested in lowering your electric bill, getting your
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:11.360]  dependency away from the grid, MySolarBackup.com, or call 877-327-0365, and then of course
[3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:16.280]  AkolaBlue.com, AkolaBlue is really the only water I drink out here, makes about 8 gallons
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:20.760]  a day, it's absolutely delicious, and here's the best part, it pulls the water from the
[3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:25.800]  air, so you don't have to have a rig, if like me you have rusty water, I can't even drink
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:29.800]  the water in my house because there's rust particles in it, you don't have to worry because
[3:25:29.800 --> 3:25:34.880]  this pulls the water out of the air, makes about 8 gallons a day, filters it, gets all
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:42.000]  the fluoride and disgusting out, it's AkolaBlue.com, that's E-C-O-L-O, Blue.com, or call the toll-free
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  number at 866-585-4044, that's 866-585-4044.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:54.760]  Alright, let's jump right back into your calls, let's go to Greg in Florida, Greg what's
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:25:55.760]  on your mind?
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:25:59.600]  Hey, good afternoon gentlemen, thank you for taking my call.
[3:25:59.600 --> 3:26:00.600]  You got it.
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:05.720]  Thank you Mr. McGovern for your services, country, and thank you even more for your patriotism
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:12.560]  since then, and remembering to protect this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[3:26:12.560 --> 3:26:13.560]  Thank you.
[3:26:13.560 --> 3:26:19.320]  Mr. Bermas, thank you very much for your movies, loose change opened my eyes to a whole new
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:20.320]  world.
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:26.560]  I just wanted to say that I really hope you're right about the coming crisis, that it's just
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:32.680]  going to be an economic one because my fears are far greater than that.
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:40.320]  I take General Colin Powell very seriously at his word, including Mr. Biden as well,
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:49.600]  and it's also should be, I should say that the First Army Brigade is back from Iraq.
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:54.720]  They're specialized in training urban warfare and disarming citizens, civilians, they spent
[3:26:54.720 --> 3:27:00.560]  the last six years in Iraq and they're now training in, I believe, with St. Louis, Missouri,
[3:27:00.560 --> 3:27:05.800]  and I think it's just so you start adding up all the things going on, I think there's
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:08.200]  a lot worse stuff going on than anywhere in the United States.
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:09.200]  What do you see?
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:12.680]  Do you think that they're going to pull a false flag event, a military type style black
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:14.680]  up and then release the troops?
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:16.320]  I mean, Posse Comintatus is done.
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:21.840]  I think we learned that from the Katrina disaster when we were disarmed down in New Orleans,
[3:27:21.840 --> 3:27:24.600]  so they've passed further legislation.
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:26.040]  I mean, that is a possibility.
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:30.840]  That's not one that we've harped on on this program, given the current economic situation,
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:32.440]  but that's what you're leaning towards, right?
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:34.160]  You think that's what this might be?
[3:27:34.160 --> 3:27:35.160]  Yes, sir.
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:36.160]  I'm afraid so.
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:42.320]  Well, you know what, it's not like you're saying that out of the blue.
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:46.520]  They tend to like to attack in the beginning of administrations, gives them more plausible
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:47.520]  deniability.
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:49.440]  It says that they're caught by surprise.
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:53.720]  That's a possibility, but I want to point this out, and I thank you for the call.
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:28:00.440]  Bush is all over the media saying that his most important achievement as president was
[3:28:00.440 --> 3:28:05.960]  keeping the country safe after 9-11, and the most important job the next president is going
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:09.960]  to have is to protect the American people from another attack.
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:15.120]  Again, going along with the same promotion, see these nexus points from the media, that
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:19.480]  Newsweek is saying, you know, Obama's chainie dilemma, keep all the powers.
[3:28:19.480 --> 3:28:23.000]  So I am not quite sure that's what's going to happen.
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  That's a possibility.
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:29.800]  I really think that this economic crisis is going to be enough for them to reshape the
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:34.920]  world and the economic powers, you know, reshape into their North American Union, possibly
[3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:38.560]  their Eurasian Union, without a false flag event.
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:39.560]  I could be wrong.
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:41.840]  All right, let's go to Paul in Germany.
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:43.840]  Paul, what's on your mind?
[3:28:43.840 --> 3:28:44.840]  Hey, Jason.
[3:28:44.840 --> 3:28:50.080]  Jason, first and foremost, you woke me up everything that I know now I owe to you.
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:53.880]  Straight on to my comment.
[3:28:53.880 --> 3:29:00.000]  I am in the Army, presently in Germany, and I got to say that right now, I can tell you
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:02.960]  from being on the inside that conscription started right now, but the way they're doing
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:05.400]  it is they're bringing kids in with college money.
[3:29:05.400 --> 3:29:08.920]  They offer all these high school kids straight out of high school, all this college money,
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:12.000]  and I can tell you, sitting in a foxhole next to somebody who says, I'm just here for the
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:14.800]  college money, isn't somebody I want watching my back.
[3:29:14.800 --> 3:29:18.160]  Yeah, that must be straining on you because this is somebody that really didn't want to
[3:29:18.160 --> 3:29:22.000]  be in basic training, that might not even go through a full basic training, that never
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:25.400]  really wanted to be in any kind of combat, and all of a sudden, this is the guy that's
[3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:27.120]  watching your back.
[3:29:27.120 --> 3:29:33.040]  But to the elitists, this is just another body, another warm body to absorb bullets
[3:29:33.040 --> 3:29:34.520]  or fire at somebody else.
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:38.680]  It's literally what they say in their policy papers, we're shadow, we're cheap, I'm sorry,
[3:29:38.680 --> 3:29:41.040]  we're sheeple, we're chattel, we're nothing more to them.
[3:29:41.040 --> 3:29:43.160]  We're going to come back to your call, Paul, on the other side.
[3:29:43.160 --> 3:29:52.040]  It's the Alex Jones show, infowars.com, truthnews.us, Prismplanet.tv.
[3:29:52.040 --> 3:29:55.800]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.800 --> 3:30:02.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:05.080]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:30:05.080 --> 3:30:10.680]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:15.200]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:16.200]  are synthetic.
[3:30:16.200 --> 3:30:17.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:30:17.640 --> 3:30:21.360]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:25.800]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:26.800]  and mucous membranes.
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:32.120]  Now, compare a cowbell and pure soap, all natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals,
[3:30:32.120 --> 3:30:37.040]  no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning
[3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:38.320]  products now.
[3:30:38.320 --> 3:30:42.120]  You're saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[3:30:42.120 --> 3:30:43.120]  Keep it natural.
[3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:51.560]  Call Cowbell and Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[3:30:51.560 --> 3:30:56.040]  Try Cowbell and Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[3:30:56.040 --> 3:31:01.960]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[3:31:01.960 --> 3:31:07.160]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:08.640]  against this country.
[3:31:08.640 --> 3:31:12.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.440 --> 3:31:13.440]  bin Laden.
[3:31:13.440 --> 3:31:14.440]  This is his MO.
[3:31:14.440 --> 3:31:18.240]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:31:18.240 --> 3:31:22.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:25.240]  networks inside the United States.
[3:31:25.240 --> 3:31:29.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[3:31:29.120 --> 3:31:31.880]  spying in and on the U.S.
[3:31:31.880 --> 3:31:35.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:41.000]  From Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:31:41.000 --> 3:31:44.800]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[3:31:44.800 --> 3:31:46.160]  much, much more.
[3:31:46.160 --> 3:31:47.160]  Fabled Enemies.
[3:31:47.160 --> 3:31:52.120]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of
[3:31:52.120 --> 3:31:54.680]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:31:54.680 --> 3:32:02.040]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:05.520]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[3:32:05.520 --> 3:32:09.200]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:10.200]  world.
[3:32:10.200 --> 3:32:15.160]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who
[3:32:15.160 --> 3:32:20.080]  offers colloidal products produced in distilled water, without use of animal protein, nitrates
[3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:21.640]  or saline solutions.
[3:32:21.640 --> 3:32:26.200]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[3:32:26.200 --> 3:32:30.880]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[3:32:30.880 --> 3:32:32.520]  antibiotics.
[3:32:32.520 --> 3:32:37.160]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper,
[3:32:37.160 --> 3:32:40.400]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[3:32:40.400 --> 3:32:44.640]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[3:32:44.640 --> 3:32:48.720]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[3:33:04.600 --> 3:33:25.480]  Only 10 hours left, actually less than 10 hours, over at eBay on the Tierney Crusher
[3:33:25.480 --> 3:33:50.480]  One Bullhorn.
[3:33:50.480 --> 3:34:18.640]  Only 10 hours left, over at eBay on the Tierney Crusher, over at eBay on the Tierney Crusher
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:24.920]  There's really nothing to this, folks.
[3:34:24.920 --> 3:34:29.440]  There's a possibility of a food shortage with the economy in the gutter, God knows.
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:32.240]  It's always nice to have an insurance policy.
[3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:33.920]  Storeable foods are that insurance policy.
[3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:39.360]  You can get cheap, good, edible, delicious, storeable foods over at eFoodsDirect.com right
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:42.360]  now or call 1-800-409-5633.

[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:49.640]  You've got Paul in Germany still on the line.
[3:34:49.640 --> 3:34:53.160]  Paul, why don't you finish up your point?
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:34:59.320]  My point was just basically that the whole idea of a conscription isn't, I mean, they're
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:03.640]  like just recently, they just passed a new GI bill for paying for their college.
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:08.200]  It takes effect on August 1st, and I mean, it's basically three, four years of college
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:09.640]  that they pay you to go to.
[3:35:09.640 --> 3:35:12.760]  So, I mean, a high school kid would be retarded not to jump on that.
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:15.480]  You do three years in the Army and they pay for four years of college.
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:19.520]  I mean, it's a great deal, but the problem that I have with it is that I've got these
[3:35:19.520 --> 3:35:24.000]  18-year-old straight-up high school kids now watching my back who are just there for the
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:25.880]  college money, and that scares me.
[3:35:25.880 --> 3:35:29.600]  I've got a wife and a kid, and I want people watching my back that want to be there.
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:30.600]  Yeah.
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:35.720]  Well, I think that there's another problem with that in that, let's say we do have conscription.
[3:35:35.720 --> 3:35:39.880]  I think one of the reasons that they gave us a black president is because in Vietnam,
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:44.360]  they were drafting young black men the majority of the time, and I think that that's going
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:45.800]  to happen again.
[3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:50.000]  But I feel like a lot of those people who get drafted will feel like there's a new sense
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:53.920]  of service, a new sense of nationalism, because they're going to be able to quote-unquote
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:35:57.200]  relate with the new president, and I think it's a scam on that end.
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:35:58.880]  I thank you for the call, Paul.
[3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:00.880]  Let's jump to Chris in Colorado.
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:02.880]  Chris, what's on your mind?
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:03.880]  Hi, Jason.
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:04.880]  Yes, sir.
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:05.880]  You're taking my call?
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:06.880]  You got it.
[3:36:06.880 --> 3:36:07.880]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[3:36:07.880 --> 3:36:08.880]  How are you doing?
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:10.880]  I'm still here for Alex, and I enjoy fabled enemies.
[3:36:10.880 --> 3:36:11.880]  Oh, thank you.
[3:36:11.880 --> 3:36:17.160]  Yeah, I really filled in a lot of the missing points from Loose Change.
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:19.240]  I guess you just didn't have time to go into it.
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:22.480]  Yeah, I mean, Loose Change, if you look at all the series of movies, I mean, the first
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:23.480]  one's an hour.
[3:36:23.480 --> 3:36:24.680]  We took the best 30 minutes out of that.
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:26.480]  We made a 90-minute picture.
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:30.680]  We took probably the best 20 or 30 minutes out of that second edition and put it into
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:35.040]  a two-hour picture, Loose Change, and yet we still weren't able to go over a lot of
[3:36:35.040 --> 3:36:40.160]  the nexus points that I put in Fabled Enemies, which is an hour and 42-minute film.
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:41.160]  Wow.
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:42.160]  Yeah.
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:49.960]  Well, hey, I was calling about Ray McGovern, the most enormous respect for him and what
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:56.200]  he's done and how vocal he's been, but I'm a little disappointed in how hopeful he is
[3:36:56.200 --> 3:36:57.200]  for Obama.
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:00.160]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know what, you had to see that.
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:06.920]  I mean, even Mike Rivera, who was on earlier, was really behind this Obama pick for presidency.
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:09.960]  He was on Genesis Network promoting it all the time.
[3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:15.520]  So you had to understand first of all, people have their blind spots, and myself included.
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:19.240]  And I see Rivera coming along a little quicker than McGovern.
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:22.920]  You know, obviously, I think that Rivera felt like it was a huge kick to the spine when
[3:37:22.920 --> 3:37:26.720]  Rahm Emanuel was put in his chief of staff, and he started to see the bigger picture
[3:37:26.720 --> 3:37:27.920]  right away.
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:32.440]  And I think what's waking up McGovern more than anything, more than people calling him
[3:37:32.440 --> 3:37:37.520]  in and saying, one CIA, always CIA, or talking about the Bohemian Grove, is the fact that
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:42.160]  Obama is now on record after being elected as saying is he's going to put more troops
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:44.160]  into Afghanistan.
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:48.560]  And when you're talking to Mr. McGovern, I think that the way to relate to him best
[3:37:48.560 --> 3:37:50.640]  is military conflicts.
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:53.680]  And I think that's what's going to be waking him up.
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:57.440]  Like I said, I have great hopes that two months down the line, when some of this stuff does
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:03.200]  go down, if Obama is not a positive influence in this country, that he will rejoin us on
[3:38:03.200 --> 3:38:05.600]  the program and admit those mistakes.
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:08.040]  That's how I hope so.
[3:38:08.040 --> 3:38:16.080]  And one of the ironies about going back to Afghanistan is that Brzezinski, as he said
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:21.840]  publicly, that he was involved in the funding and training of these guys who we now call
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:22.840]  Al Qaeda.
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:28.400]  He basically took the Mujahideen, he radicalized them, he wrote books about it.
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:30.520]  The Grand Chess Board, it's his policy.
[3:38:30.520 --> 3:38:32.960]  He was on the advisory board for Obama.
[3:38:32.960 --> 3:38:38.160]  He's got a couple of kids that once supposedly a Democrat, the one on MSNBC, of course, and
[3:38:38.160 --> 3:38:42.440]  then the other ones are Republican, who worked on the McCain campaign, of course.
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:48.240]  And that's an intelligence-based family above something like the CIA or the NSA.
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:53.200]  I really feel like Brzezinski is really something out of a Bond movie superman.
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:58.680]  I mean, he really talked like this and everything I say, you will hang on my word.
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:02.960]  And yes, I go to build a big meeting, but nothing is bad.
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:04.760]  We do good things there.
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:10.320]  So Brzezinski's really a genius and he's placed himself in these positions where only the
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:13.560]  alternative media is talking about him in a negative light.
[3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:18.160]  The mainstream media fawns over him like he's some kind of a god.
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:20.840]  And I think that's a big problem.
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:25.240]  And I think that's something that Murray McGovern may even come around to as well, that Brzezinski
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:27.040]  is not a level-headed good guy.
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:28.920]  I thank you for the call, Chris.
[3:39:28.920 --> 3:39:31.560]  Let's jump to Jim in Chicago.
[3:39:31.560 --> 3:39:33.280]  Jim, what do you want to talk about?
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:34.760]  Hey, guys, how's it going?
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:39.200]  I just want to start off with you guys are real American heroes.
[3:39:39.200 --> 3:39:42.840]  And I've just been awake for the past couple of months.
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:43.840]  So I'm new to this.
[3:39:43.840 --> 3:39:47.120]  So I'm not going to pretend I know as much as you guys.
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:52.160]  But I really, really got to argue with you about the racial tension.
[3:39:52.160 --> 3:39:57.800]  You know, I live in Chicago here and I can tell you right now there's racial tension.
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:02.520]  Well, I think there is some racial tension.
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:04.880]  I'm not saying racism has left the country.
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:05.880]  You know what I mean?
[3:40:05.880 --> 3:40:06.880]  I mean, I'm from New York, man.
[3:40:06.880 --> 3:40:10.440]  You go down to the city, it's, you know, gook this, spik that.
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:15.200]  I mean, people just will say the most outrageous, outlandish, racist things.
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:19.200]  But what I'm saying is that I don't see the organization of a group like the Ku Klux
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:25.080]  Klan or, you know, some of these other groups to the point where we're going to have like,
[3:40:25.080 --> 3:40:29.640]  you know, military confrontations in the street or even confrontations between, you know,
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:33.600]  the whites and the other races and the whites that take their side.
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:34.840]  I don't see it on that level.
[3:40:34.840 --> 3:40:39.800]  Will you see, you know, lynchings or will you see some racially motivated crime?
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:40.800]  Sure.
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:41.800]  Especially in an urban area like Chicago.
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:42.800]  Continue.
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:43.800]  Yeah.
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:47.000]  Well, I mean, I can't speak for other cities, you know, because I, you know, I'm not that
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:53.520]  well-traveled, but in Chicago, every neighborhood is segregated by, you know, not only race,
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:59.560]  but just, you know, if you're Irish or Polish or whatever, I mean, that's real small neighborhoods.
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:04.920]  And I could tell you, my biggest fear, I mean, I know, you know, there's a lot of things
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:05.920]  to be scared of.
[3:41:05.920 --> 3:41:10.960]  But, you know, even if the economy just gets bad and there's going to be finger point
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:15.760]  going on, let alone an assassination, I mean, I really, really believe that Chicago would
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:20.000]  be, you know, they'd have to bring the military in, because there would just be nonstop killing.
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:24.320]  I mean, just, it would never end, because I mean, I, you know, I, even just me, you
[3:41:24.320 --> 3:41:27.480]  know, I know people that are cops and I, I'm just some of the stuff that I've known,
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:31.640]  you know, that I didn't think of much before until I learned about this, but just how,
[3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:35.120]  you know, some of these, you know, people in the, you know, in the black neighborhood
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:40.520]  that they did stuff like cops, but I mean, I could guarantee that Chicago would need
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:42.520]  the National Guard to come in and stop the campaign.
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:43.520]  Well, the elites want that.
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:48.480]  And what's part of the plan, man, is that they want riots, they want physical violence
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:53.720]  and up evil, so that they can send troops into these large urban areas and then even
[3:41:53.720 --> 3:41:57.640]  regroup people into these large urban areas under military control.
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:02.920]  I suggest you check out 9-11, the road to tyranny goes into this paradigm a little bit
[3:42:02.920 --> 3:42:03.920]  during the end.
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:04.920]  And then, of course, end game.
[3:42:04.920 --> 3:42:05.920]  I thank you for the call, Jim.
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:10.680]  There's a, there's a new caller and I understand that, man, if you're in any big city, maybe
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:15.760]  not so much, you know, California is a little bit different in LA, so close to everything.
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:20.040]  Yeah, you have like the slums in LA or whatever, but it's not, I guess I would say it's not
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:25.920]  as racially divided as, say, a New York City is, you know, New York, I mean, you got Chinatown,
[3:42:25.920 --> 3:42:30.720]  you literally have these sections where all the people speak are Korean, you know, you
[3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:35.720]  have a lot of machismo on the Italian end of town, you know, there are those Irish neighborhoods.
[3:42:35.720 --> 3:42:40.600]  So I see where he's coming from, but I just, I'm not, starting the race war, someone calling
[3:42:40.600 --> 3:42:44.400]  him to start a race war, I don't see that happening in any way, shape, or form.
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:46.680]  All right, let's go to Casey in California.
[3:42:46.680 --> 3:42:47.680]  Casey, what's on your mind?
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:48.680]  Hey, Jay.
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:49.680]  It's nice to talk to you.
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:56.400]  I just want to say, look at my computer right now in June 19th of 2007, I got an email from
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:00.720]  one of my sales guys and it was your movie, Loose Change, and I just want to say that
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:05.000]  they pretty much changed my whole thoughts on it, on everything once my eyes opened up.
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  It was a pretty big awakening.
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:11.760]  I just want to make a couple of points here in terms of what people can do to get the
[3:43:11.760 --> 3:43:16.800]  voice out or the word out, because when you tell people, you know, they think you're some
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:22.160]  nut job, whatever, but a couple of things here, if you got money and you're in a fight
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:29.200]  for the cause, some things you could do would be to like run a plane and fly a banner, you
[3:43:29.200 --> 3:43:34.160]  know, we're out here in California and they do that all day long up and down the beach.
[3:43:34.160 --> 3:43:38.440]  Another thing to do would be make stickers, I know, like you said, you pass out DVDs when
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:45.040]  you go to concerts, posters, banners, whatnot, another idea is bedsheets, you go to the Salvation
[3:43:45.040 --> 3:43:49.720]  Army, get bedsheets, get cans of spray paint, hang those puppies around town.
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:53.920]  Another cheap one is the back of semi-trucks, 18-wheelers, you know how they get real dusty
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:43:58.400]  on the roll, okay, from the back, you can write your ideas or your voice, your opinions
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:01.840]  on those, it doesn't cost you a penny, and then the other thing is like I've heard before
[3:44:01.840 --> 3:44:05.960]  is on every piece of money or dollar bill that you get, just write what you can to
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:06.960]  try to inform these people.
[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:11.360]  And that's the Guerrilla Info War, that's how we're effective, and even if you need
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:15.600]  stickers to be made up, I mean, we sell stickers here at Info Wars, you know, there's loose
[3:44:15.600 --> 3:44:21.720]  chain stickers out there, I think the packs are 10 of 10 or like 4.95, so you can get
[3:44:21.720 --> 3:44:24.720]  them printed up and you can even buy them in bulk, really, really cheap, and I feel
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:29.680]  like you put those on light poles, you put them on stop signs, you put them all over
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:32.880]  where people, the stop signs are the best, because you actually have to stop at a stop
[3:44:32.880 --> 3:44:36.800]  sign, and it's right on the front, so whether or not you're consciously absorbing it, you're
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:40.680]  getting the website there, and when you visit it, it's something that will click in your
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:44.640]  brain that you've been introduced to it before, so I'm all about getting people out on the
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:49.040]  street, and you know, it's not just about emailing people, links to loose change and
[3:44:49.040 --> 3:44:52.680]  fabled enemies, although that worked in your case, it's also about getting in the streets
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:53.680]  and relating to people.
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:55.560]  I thank you for the call, Casey.
[3:44:55.560 --> 3:44:59.920]  Let's go to PJ in Texas, PJ, what's on your mind?
[3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:02.560]  Hey, Jason, thanks for having me on your show.
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:03.560]  You got it.
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:08.560]  I'm calling in response to an earlier caller today, and he made kind of a silly comment,
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:13.960]  and I just think that it's important to comment back on that, but he made a comment that who's
[3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:15.960]  really...
[3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:16.960]  Who's really?
[3:45:16.960 --> 3:45:17.960]  Do we drop him?
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:19.960]  PJ, are you still there?
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:24.960]  Or Obama showing that they're racist, and I think really, you know, through the history
[3:45:24.960 --> 3:45:31.000]  of black voters, 100% of those voters have been voting for white presidents, and I think
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:32.800]  history speaks for itself.
[3:45:32.800 --> 3:45:34.400]  We know that that's a fact.
[3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:42.040]  In the last Bush election, the Republicans made a big deal because 14% of black Americans
[3:45:42.040 --> 3:45:46.800]  voted for Bush, which was a gain of 6%, which shows that about 90 had voted for Al Gore and
[3:45:46.800 --> 3:45:52.120]  a little bit less voted for Kerry, and I think the real thing here is that black Americans
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:54.040]  vote for Democrats.
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:45:58.880]  And the reason I say this is important is I think for the movement, it's really important
[3:45:58.880 --> 3:46:08.600]  to distance ourselves from the underlying, you could call it racism, but maybe the loss
[3:46:08.600 --> 3:46:13.840]  of status and power that some white Americans are feeling, you know, with a black president
[3:46:13.840 --> 3:46:17.440]  or with folks immigrating to this country, et cetera.
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:20.720]  It's real important to distance ourselves from that, and to make sure that the drive
[3:46:20.720 --> 3:46:30.560]  of this movement is based on the Constitution and the rule of law, and not on elements of
[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:35.120]  dissatisfaction because the demographic of the country is changing because that's the
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:36.360]  nature of the country.
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:42.320]  It's changed, you know, from Native Americans to Puritans, you know, and then from there
[3:46:42.320 --> 3:46:48.680]  to an influx of Italians, Irish Catholic folks, Germans, things like that.
[3:46:48.680 --> 3:46:52.360]  But the country's constantly changing, and I think regardless of what anyone's race
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:57.640]  is, I think we really need to make the focus, you know, on what our country is based on,
[3:46:57.640 --> 3:46:58.640]  which is the Constitution.
[3:46:58.640 --> 3:47:04.760]  I agree 110%, 110% that we should be focused on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and
[3:47:04.760 --> 3:47:09.440]  these are splinter issues that are often used to divide us, and if, you know, it's order
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:11.920]  out of chaos, it's to divide and conquer us.
[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:17.000]  You know, they bring these races in as, you know, fronts to say that they're part of this
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:18.920]  movement and they're not part of this movement.
[3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:24.360]  They have a small sect of followers that are completely and totally mentally ill that want
[3:47:24.360 --> 3:47:28.680]  to blame all the problems on one group or another based on their race, and again, not
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:32.400]  on what they've done, not the content of their character, but the color of their skin or
[3:47:32.400 --> 3:47:34.960]  their religion, and it's absolutely ridiculous.
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:39.320]  We do need to focus on the fact that this is the great melting pot, that race has nothing
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:45.880]  to do with us and to do with, you know, us as a nation, and that our really, our commonality
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:52.160]  comes from our freedoms that are only in this country, are our pieces of paper.
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:55.200]  The Constitution and Bill of Rights, I couldn't agree more.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:58.000]  Let's jump to their next caller, let's go to Scott in California.
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:47:59.400]  Scott, what's on your mind?
[3:47:59.400 --> 3:48:02.200]  Hello, Jason, thank you for showing up.
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:03.200]  You got it.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:11.280]  Hey, yeah, my youngest boy got back from Afghanistan and he was hanging out at the University of
[3:48:11.280 --> 3:48:16.520]  California and called me up very excitedly one night and told me to watch loose change
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:22.120]  just with several years ago, right when it first came out, and that's what did it.
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:27.960]  And anyway, what I want to talk about is executive orders and the true powers of the president,
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:30.920]  and I'd like to explain it in terms of the Japanese Internment Act.
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:31.920]  Sure.
[3:48:31.920 --> 3:48:37.240]  So, okay, this is real important for these coming times, as I've heard that, you know,
[3:48:37.240 --> 3:48:41.880]  Obama's going to start ruling through executive orders, but if you just read the executive
[3:48:41.880 --> 3:48:51.840]  order, it's 9-0-6-6, and that was Roosevelt, you know, the pulling away offspring of enemy
[3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:55.240]  aliens from enemy countries from the coastal area.
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:48:59.240]  Yeah, this is when we put all the Japanese citizens in internment camps during World
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:00.240]  War II.
[3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:07.200]  Yes, but if you just read it, read the first part, and it says this, executive order,
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:13.440]  order modifies public law, blah, blah, blah, like three or four public laws, right?
[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:19.040]  And then you read the order, and it sounds like it reads like, oh, he's got this authority.
[3:49:19.040 --> 3:49:26.440]  But if you go back and look at those public laws, they only apply in very narrow areas,
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:31.680]  like, you know, one of them was a basketball-sized area in Guam, right?
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:33.560]  And it sees territories and possessions.
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:39.600]  It's where these public laws applied, and, you know, nobody called him on it, man, but
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:40.600]  they wouldn't.
[3:49:40.600 --> 3:49:47.080]  This guy, Kiramatsu, Japanese-American guy, attorney, and he went in as a United States
[3:49:47.080 --> 3:49:51.480]  citizen whining about this, and then went all the way to the Supreme Court, and they
[3:49:51.480 --> 3:49:53.120]  shot him down.
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:50:00.400]  But all he had to say was that these executive orders lacked a venue on the soil of California.
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:04.280]  Yeah, but don't you think they, just like I mentioned earlier today, don't you think
[3:50:04.280 --> 3:50:08.080]  they bully and push and do whatever they want, no matter what, and especially with executive
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:09.080]  orders?
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:13.120]  I mean, I expect Obama's administration to come out of the gate with two or three just
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:17.680]  unbelievable executive orders, you know, tyrannical executive orders that the media
[3:50:17.680 --> 3:50:21.480]  will spin as a positive for this country.
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:22.800]  It doesn't matter.
[3:50:22.800 --> 3:50:27.920]  All you have to do is look at what public law that he's bringing his executive order
[3:50:27.920 --> 3:50:31.720]  off of and find out where it applies.
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:38.240]  And I have seen people go in the court on, well, you know, you're talking about Americans
[3:50:38.240 --> 3:50:39.240]  being free, right?
[3:50:39.240 --> 3:50:40.240]  Yes.
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:48.320]  Well, in Chilton v. Georgia Supreme Court in 1793, they said that Americans are the
[3:50:48.320 --> 3:50:49.320]  sovereign.
[3:50:49.320 --> 3:50:50.320]  All right.
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:50:51.320]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[3:50:51.320 --> 3:50:52.320]  We'll be back after this.
[3:50:52.320 --> 3:50:53.320]  I am Jason Burma.
[3:50:53.320 --> 3:51:02.840]  This is news.comprisonplanet.tv.
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:03.840]  Hello.
[3:51:03.840 --> 3:51:04.840]  I'm Steve Shank.
[3:51:04.840 --> 3:51:08.480]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[3:51:08.480 --> 3:51:14.120]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing
[3:51:14.120 --> 3:51:15.640]  your food supplies.
[3:51:15.640 --> 3:51:19.680]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the
[3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:25.600]  21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident
[3:51:25.600 --> 3:51:28.560]  to make some unpopular decisions.
[3:51:28.560 --> 3:51:33.000]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:38.280]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation
[3:51:38.280 --> 3:51:41.160]  and availability of food distribution.
[3:51:41.160 --> 3:51:45.360]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow
[3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:46.800]  for shipping.
[3:51:46.800 --> 3:51:51.080]  Order's cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[3:51:51.080 --> 3:52:01.400]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, hefoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[3:52:01.400 --> 3:52:03.360]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[3:52:03.360 --> 3:52:07.880]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[3:52:07.880 --> 3:52:09.400]  hour there is hope.
[3:52:09.400 --> 3:52:12.440]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:16.680]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new
[3:52:16.680 --> 3:52:18.240]  world order master plan.
[3:52:18.240 --> 3:52:22.480]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:52:22.480 --> 3:52:27.840]  In the info war, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:52:27.840 --> 3:52:30.680]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[3:53:01.920 --> 3:53:05.360]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:09.360]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way
[3:53:09.360 --> 3:53:11.000]  to get your daily intake?
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:15.240]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer.

[3:53:22.680 --> 3:53:28.000]  cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:29.160]  flaxseed around.
[3:53:29.160 --> 3:53:34.240]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight, keeping only
[3:53:34.240 --> 3:53:37.840]  the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:41.200]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:43.280]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.

[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:20.440]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show, Wednesday, January 14, 2009.
[3:54:20.440 --> 3:54:28.640]  Really, your last chance to bid on Tierney Crusher 1, Alex's iconic bullhorn is going
[3:54:28.640 --> 3:54:32.840]  for a little over 50 Gs right now on eBay.
[3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:37.600]  We'll know who has it tomorrow, folks, and we'll probably announce that on air after
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:41.160]  we get all the legalities out of the way, of course, you know, you have the fake bitters
[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:44.960]  up there, and then you have the real bitters that are putting up some serious scratch, but
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:53.040]  all of it goes right back into the Info War, and Alex Jones' Info Warrior Studios, I mean,
[3:54:53.040 --> 3:54:54.040]  it's just great to be here.
[3:54:54.040 --> 3:54:57.320]  I want to thank him again for allowing me to sit in all week.
[3:54:57.320 --> 3:55:02.280]  We have Bob Dacey riding shotgun with me tomorrow.
[3:55:02.280 --> 3:55:03.280]  Tons of great guests.
[3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:08.720]  If you missed anything today, we'll be rebroadcasting in about four minutes over at infowars.com,
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:12.880]  and you can listen to mine and Michael Rivera's interview, the Ray McGovern interview, or just
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:18.280]  all the callers we've been taking on just about every single subject you can imagine.
[3:55:18.280 --> 3:55:22.440]  And we were just talking about executive orders and constitutional law.
[3:55:22.440 --> 3:55:27.480]  The problem is that, you know, common law, constitutional law, once again, the powers
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:34.760]  that be have all these resources and unlimited supply of money, and so they're going to take
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:38.960]  it to you whether or not you're in the right, and unfortunately, the little guy doesn't
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:39.960]  always win.
[3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:43.720]  Sometimes the little guy is a visceride, and that happens more often than not, whether
[3:55:43.720 --> 3:55:45.720]  he's in the right or not.
[3:55:45.720 --> 3:55:48.640]  All right, let's jump to Adam in Wisconsin.
[3:55:48.640 --> 3:55:50.160]  Adam, what's on your mind?
[3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:51.160]  Hey, whoa.
[3:55:51.160 --> 3:55:52.160]  Hey, Jason.
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:53.160]  Thanks a lot for everything.
[3:55:53.160 --> 3:55:54.160]  Are you there?
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:55.160]  Can you hear me?
[3:55:55.160 --> 3:55:56.160]  Yes, sir.
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:55:57.160]  Okay.
[3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:00.080]  I just have kind of a comment about the guy they're called from Chicago.
[3:56:00.080 --> 3:56:04.920]  I'm not too far away from there myself, and a lot of these guys that think some type of
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:15.040]  military thing is coming down, I just don't see it happening, just because they're always
[3:56:15.040 --> 3:56:16.040]  our savior.
[3:56:16.040 --> 3:56:17.800]  They're always here to help us.
[3:56:17.800 --> 3:56:19.200]  They don't come in and attack us.
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:22.760]  I mean, they do, but they don't come in and attack us, and we know it's them.
[3:56:22.760 --> 3:56:27.440]  Well, I think that if they want to come in, it'll be posing as a savior and some kind
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:30.520]  of, and it'll have to be some kind of a riot that erupts there.
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:34.120]  I don't think that they're just going to come in and jack the citizens as I was trying
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:37.800]  to say to the guy, you know, it's just like when they talk about a race war in this country,
[3:56:37.800 --> 3:56:39.280]  no, there won't be a race war.
[3:56:39.280 --> 3:56:46.160]  There might be some riots incited by racists, and then the military comes in, yeah, sure.
[3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:51.560]  My point is, a biological weather is, see, I don't believe, I think they know that we're
[3:56:51.560 --> 3:56:54.080]  hip to this whole false flag thing.
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:56:57.480]  I think that they're not stupid, obviously, these are some of the smartest people there
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:56:58.480]  is.
[3:56:58.480 --> 3:56:59.480]  Yep.
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:00.480]  Okay.
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:05.560]  So, just for a common sense, say somebody got sick over in Germany or Japan or whatever
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:09.200]  it was and came over on a flight over here.
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:11.400]  We have an epidemic and an outbreak.
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:15.240]  Now it does cause riots, but it truly doesn't.
[3:57:15.240 --> 3:57:19.080]  It's not us against the police, it's for our own safety.
[3:57:19.080 --> 3:57:21.800]  It's keeping us safe to put us in internment camps.
[3:57:21.800 --> 3:57:25.160]  It's keeping us safe to keep us away from the quarantine areas.
[3:57:25.160 --> 3:57:26.160]  Exactly.
[3:57:26.160 --> 3:57:27.160]  I'll make it 100%.
[3:57:27.160 --> 3:57:28.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:57:28.160 --> 3:57:32.400]  They have to first create the problem and have the problem happen without the military
[3:57:32.400 --> 3:57:38.240]  coming in before they can pose at the saviors and basically round us up, vaccinate us, or
[3:57:38.240 --> 3:57:41.520]  put us into small compact cities, I agree 100%.
[3:57:41.520 --> 3:57:43.840]  Let's go to John in New York.
[3:57:43.840 --> 3:57:45.840]  John, what's on your mind?
[3:57:45.840 --> 3:57:50.040]  I think, thanks for everything you guys do.
[3:57:50.040 --> 3:57:56.840]  I think people have to be really aware of the difference between a constitutional convention
[3:57:56.840 --> 3:58:02.080]  and just an amendment to the Constitution, and that's out on a prison planet.
[3:58:02.080 --> 3:58:08.400]  There's an article out there, Global Constitution Convention Built to Defeat in Ohio.
[3:58:08.400 --> 3:58:13.880]  What they're trying to do is open up the whole Constitution to people like Pelosi, Clinton,
[3:58:13.880 --> 3:58:17.760]  Biden in a room and rewrite the Constitution.
[3:58:17.760 --> 3:58:23.080]  That's what they can do at a constitutional convention, and that's...
[3:58:23.080 --> 3:58:24.080]  Well let's hope that doesn't happen.
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:28.040]  I wish I had more time to give you, but call in tomorrow, we'll take callers.
[3:58:28.040 --> 3:58:29.560]  It's the Alex Jones Show, folks.

[3:58:53.760 --> 3:58:54.760]  Thank you for a long time.
[3:58:54.760 --> 3:58:58.200]  It's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[3:58:58.200 --> 3:59:01.160]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[3:59:01.160 --> 3:59:03.960]  You'll never have to stand in a red line when you have your own bread.
[3:59:03.960 --> 3:59:07.840]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:59:07.840 --> 3:59:10.240]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[3:59:10.240 --> 3:59:13.520]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.

[3:59:21.560 --> 3:59:23.880]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
