[00:00.000 --> 00:12.680]  Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hirsch, relying on unnamed national security
[00:12.680 --> 00:17.960]  sources, recently published an article on his sub-stack about the destruction of the
[00:17.960 --> 00:20.240]  Nord Stream pipelines.
[00:20.240 --> 00:27.320]  Two pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1, provided Western Europe with cheap Russian gas for
[00:27.320 --> 00:28.880]  more than a decade.
[00:28.880 --> 00:33.720]  These pipelines were seen by NATO as a threat to Western dominance.
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.880]  Profits were shared with the Russian government and provided up to 45% of their annual budget.
[00:39.880 --> 00:46.600]  A second pair, called Nord Stream 2, had been built but were not yet operational.
[00:46.600 --> 00:52.360]  NATO was concerned that as long as Europe remained dependent upon these pipelines, Germany would
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.600]  be reluctant to supply Ukraine with money and weapons to fight Russia.
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.480]  And so the Biden administration authorized Jake Sullivan to assemble a task force with
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.480]  members of the Biden White House, the CIA, and the Pentagon to come up with a plan for
[01:09.480 --> 01:12.040]  the destruction of the pipelines.
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.720]  The operation was run by Victoria Newland, Anthony Blinken, and Jake Sullivan.
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.480]  The Navy proposed using a submarine to assault the pipeline directly.
[01:22.480 --> 01:26.760]  The Air Force proposed dropping bombs with delayed fuses.
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.160]  And the CIA argued that whatever was done, it would have to be covert, because if the
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.040]  attack was traced to the U.S., then it would be an act of war.
[01:37.040 --> 01:44.520]  In early 2022, right after the CIA reported to Sullivan that they had a plan, both Victoria
[01:44.520 --> 01:50.600]  Newland and President Biden publicly threatened to bring an end to Nord Stream 2.
[01:50.600 --> 01:57.880]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[01:57.880 --> 02:09.800]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then
[02:09.800 --> 02:12.840]  there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.680]  According to the source, this public announcement meant that blowing up the pipeline no longer
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.320]  could be considered a covert option, and that there was no longer a legal requirement to
[02:24.320 --> 02:27.360]  report their plans to Congress.
[02:27.360 --> 02:32.280]  The Americans partnered with Norway, who had their own motivations for the destruction
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.920]  of the Nord Stream pipelines, which would allow them to sell more of their own natural
[02:36.920 --> 02:39.000]  gas to Europe.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.140]  In March of 2022, members of the team flew to Norway to meet with the Norwegian Secret
[02:45.140 --> 02:46.400]  Service.
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.460]  The Norwegian Navy decided on a spot in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, a few miles
[02:52.460 --> 02:59.200]  off Denmark's Bornholm Island, where the divers operating from a Norwegian Alta-class
[02:59.200 --> 03:07.160]  mine hunter would plant C4 charges with concrete protective covers on the four pipelines.
[03:07.160 --> 03:13.320]  Divers were chosen from the U.S. Navy's Diving and Salvage Center in Panama City, which
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.940]  specializes in training deepwater divers to use C4 explosives because they were Navy
[03:18.940 --> 03:25.600]  only and not members of America's Special Operations Command, whose covert operations
[03:25.600 --> 03:28.160]  would need to be reported to Congress.
[03:28.160 --> 03:33.480]  The mission was secretly embedded into an annual training exercise already scheduled
[03:33.480 --> 03:43.280]  for June of 2022, known as Baltic Operations 22, or Baltops 22, wherein the Panama Sea
[03:43.280 --> 03:49.640]  divers would place C4 explosives with a 48-hour timer attached.
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.960]  But the White House then worried that triggering the explosion within two days of the well-publicized
[03:55.960 --> 04:02.680]  training exercise would make it obvious that America was responsible, and so it was decided
[04:02.680 --> 04:08.680]  that the C4 would be triggered by a sonar buoy later dropped by plane.
[04:08.680 --> 04:16.080]  The buoy would emit a sequence of unique low-frequency tonal sounds to trigger the explosives.
[04:16.080 --> 04:25.120]  On September 26, 2022, a Norwegian Navy P-8 surveillance plane dropped the sonar buoy.
[04:25.120 --> 04:31.640]  The signal spread underwater, and a few hours later, the high-powered explosives were triggered
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.480]  and three of the four pipelines were put out of commission.
[04:35.480 --> 04:40.720]  According to Hirsch's national security sources, it was a beautiful cover story.
[04:40.720 --> 04:46.920]  It was a covert operation that placed experts in the field and equipment that operated
[04:46.920 --> 04:48.640]  on a covert signal.
[04:48.640 --> 04:52.440]  The only flaw was the decision to do it.
[04:52.440 --> 04:55.520]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:55.520 --> 05:01.880]  Big Friday show going live now, now, now.
[05:01.880 --> 05:05.560]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.280]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[05:10.280 --> 05:11.280]  us.
[05:11.280 --> 05:16.720]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[05:16.720 --> 05:20.280]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[05:20.280 --> 05:23.760]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in
[05:23.760 --> 05:29.120]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[05:29.120 --> 05:32.240]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[05:32.240 --> 05:37.520]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[05:37.520 --> 05:38.520]  us.
[05:38.520 --> 05:41.600]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[05:41.600 --> 05:46.480]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[05:46.480 --> 05:50.400]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[05:50.400 --> 05:54.760]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[05:54.760 --> 05:58.880]  If just one percent more of you took action at InfowarsStore.com, our fighting problems
[05:58.880 --> 05:59.880]  will be over.
[05:59.880 --> 06:05.880]  Please take action now.
[06:05.880 --> 06:19.880]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[06:19.880 --> 06:28.560]  All right, I am completely overwhelmed in a crazy way.
[06:28.560 --> 06:33.080]  I mean, the news is all just so over the top, so insane.
[06:33.080 --> 06:37.840]  The global awakening is so massive and so positive, but the new world order is just doubling
[06:37.840 --> 06:39.360]  and tripling down.
[06:39.360 --> 06:46.000]  There's no way to even properly cover a tenth of this, but I'm going to do my best today.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.080]  Then we have Josh Alexander, who is a high school student arrested in Canada because
[06:51.080 --> 06:56.720]  he did not worship transgenderism and take part in the school.
[06:56.720 --> 07:02.120]  I mean, this is the global cult, the total control that you need to accept that men are
[07:02.120 --> 07:06.280]  women and that men can be in women's bathrooms and things, that you need to do anything.
[07:06.280 --> 07:12.120]  He's joining us, great reporter Emerald Robinson is going to be joining us to cover the waterfront
[07:12.120 --> 07:18.400]  as well and so much more.
[07:18.400 --> 07:29.880]  So again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday, February 10th, 2023 transmission.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.760]  Now I'm just going to read some headlines here in this segment, and I'm not reading
[07:33.760 --> 07:35.480]  these in the order of importance.
[07:35.480 --> 07:38.320]  I'm just going to give you an idea of how insane things are, okay?
[07:38.320 --> 07:45.440]  It's just broke on Fox News and this is Fetterman's family confirming this that it's not a new
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.440]  stroke.
[07:46.440 --> 07:52.800]  He's gone completely insane and hears voices while he's working in the Senate that are
[07:52.800 --> 07:59.160]  the Peanuts voices from the Peanuts 1960s, 70s, 80s TV show.
[07:59.160 --> 08:07.000]  I'm not getting Snoopy, Charlie Brown, all of them, which they should give him the nuclear
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  codes immediately.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.200]  He's even more insane than Joe Biden, so he's the perfect puppet.
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.520]  Fetterman hears voices like the teachers in Peanuts after stroke, struggles to adjust
[08:18.520 --> 08:24.520]  to Senate life, and he's in the hospital hearing voices right now and is dizzy and can't stand
[08:24.520 --> 08:25.520]  up.
[08:25.520 --> 08:27.520]  Well, that's interesting.
[08:27.520 --> 08:33.000]  We have a whole stack of news from the incredible last two days of hearings on Twitter and the
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  FBI.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.720]  It's just Twitter that the documents came out because Elon Musk released them.
[08:36.720 --> 08:38.400]  It's all the big tech.
[08:38.400 --> 08:45.560]  With the FBI colluding with the Southern Poverty Law Center to list hundreds of groups as terrorists,
[08:45.560 --> 08:48.360]  the FBI is under the command of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[08:48.360 --> 08:51.520]  They've now come out and admitted that they follow the orders of the Southern Poverty Law
[08:51.520 --> 08:53.320]  Center.
[08:53.320 --> 09:00.240]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, an offshore criminal organization in my view, directed
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.520]  them to say that conservative Catholics are the main terror threat in America.
[09:04.520 --> 09:06.880]  You can't make that up.
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.880]  We also have the videos of House Conference Chair Blass FBI and Democrats for election
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.080]  meddling and weaponization against the American people.
[09:16.080 --> 09:21.240]  FBI says, Leak Memo showing their monitoring radical, traditional Catholics was not up
[09:21.240 --> 09:25.440]  to their exacting standards, but they were directed to follow it by the Justice Department
[09:25.440 --> 09:29.920]  and President Biden and that they are given policy by the Southern Poverty Law Center
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.200]  and the ADL, FBI under pressure for targeting Catholics in Leak Document, reported FBI documents
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.200]  suggest agency maybe targeting Catholics would tend Latin Mass, boy, that's so evil,
[09:41.200 --> 09:42.200]  horrible people.
[09:42.200 --> 09:44.160]  Say what you want about Catholics.
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.760]  The Latin Mass is beautiful and I've been to a few of them over the years and it's
[09:50.760 --> 09:54.560]  very, very pretty and even if you're lucky enough to go to one of the churches that has
[09:54.560 --> 10:01.080]  the monks chanting, it's just amazing stuff, very dangerous, very, very evil, ladies and
[10:01.080 --> 10:09.680]  gentlemen, FBI to retract Catholic infiltration memo, spying on them, the FBI slander a radical
[10:09.680 --> 10:15.520]  traditionalist Catholics with their headline there, FBI retracts leaked document orchestration
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.200]  investigation of Catholics as the main terror threat, FBI targeting devout Catholics at
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.600]  the whistleblower, Kyle Saffron reports on Leak Bureau document warning agents of danger
[10:25.600 --> 10:31.840]  and radical traditionalist Catholic ideology, continuing here, Catholic high school student
[10:31.840 --> 10:42.440]  arrested after suspension for opposing transgender ideology, he'll be joining us and the war
[10:42.440 --> 10:47.800]  on anybody traditionalist, particularly Christian traditionalist whether evangelical, Baptist
[10:47.800 --> 10:54.880]  Catholic, they are coming after you, because they're Satanist folks brought to you by Pfizer,
[10:54.880 --> 11:02.880]  FBI using discredited SPLC to plant paint Catholics as extremists, we've got all that,
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.600]  it just goes on and on from there and we've got more attempts to arrest people in the
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.920]  US that don't want their children to be brainwashed in the transgender cult, we're gonna be laying
[11:13.920 --> 11:19.640]  all of that out, I see these deceptive headlines everywhere that oh Tennessee and Texas passed
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.080]  laws restricting drag shows, no men can dress up in dresses and men can go get naked dressed
[11:25.080 --> 11:29.720]  up like women at bars or wherever they want, you just can't do it with two year olds and
[11:29.720 --> 11:36.360]  then shake your penis in their face, that's what you can't do, that's illegal, and again
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.800]  how offended would you be if you went to a topless bar to have a drink after work, you're
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.680]  an adult, it's what you want to do, people can judge you or they can't and then they
[11:45.680 --> 11:51.040]  had three year olds, five year olds there sticking money in the topless women's G-strings,
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.720]  you'd call the police and you should, but if it's all homosexual, well we've got to allow
[11:56.720 --> 12:02.520]  that, and they call it oh you're anti-gay, you're anti-freedom, you're anti-no, some
[12:02.520 --> 12:06.440]  people can be, that's their view, there are a lot of me, I'm anti-targeting children whether
[12:06.440 --> 12:13.440]  you're homosexual, heterosexual, whatever it is, it's called pedophilia, we've got some
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.320]  powerful videos coming up, activists confronts Tennessee Democrats on hearing on sexual mutilation
[12:18.320 --> 12:25.680]  of children, very powerful clips, on that front we obviously have the huge news dealing
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.720]  with the Nord Stream Pipeline being blown up in three spots and Psyhurst with internal
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.480]  documents and whistleblowers on exactly who did it and how, and I guess I was wrong, I
[12:37.480 --> 12:43.080]  would guess it'd be the Navy SEALs, as I said when it first had been blown up, part of that
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.400]  drill, but now they're saying that was under the oversight of Congress, so they use regular
[12:48.400 --> 12:55.000]  Navy demolition divers, use for underwater Navy construction to blow it up, and Hirsch
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.040]  has the witnesses because people in government know this is illegal and they're doing the
[13:00.040 --> 13:07.040]  right thing, and now we're learning that they've gone to Congress and that nothing was done
[13:07.040 --> 13:14.200]  and so they went to see more Hirsch, so we salute him always doing an incredible job,
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.320]  that's all coming up, and then there's more news on this, but I've been covering a lot
[13:18.320 --> 13:25.360]  the last few days, but out of anything out there that illustrates how truly evil, Joe
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.400]  Biden is, and how truly evil the globalist agenda, not just here but all over the world,
[13:30.400 --> 13:36.520]  to drive working class, hardworking families into welfare and bankruptcy and destruction
[13:36.520 --> 13:40.440]  so the government can monitor and control your life, the social credit score, the universal
[13:40.440 --> 13:47.640]  basic income, it's Joe Biden, when he first got in over two years ago, directing almost
[13:47.640 --> 13:52.640]  all the agents to not focus on white collar crime and rich people, but no matter what
[13:52.640 --> 14:00.200]  you think of the IRS or whether it's constitutional, which obviously is in 1913, it's all BS.
[14:00.200 --> 14:06.320]  The point is, is that when you aim the bureaucracy at people making $40,000 or less a year, when
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.800]  they pay less than 6% of the taxes, you're not doing that to raise revenue, you're doing
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.520]  that to push people over the edge, I don't know how many people I know who have college
[14:17.520 --> 14:23.520]  degrees who can't get a job and pay their bills, so they do things like mow yards, give
[14:23.520 --> 14:31.320]  massages, they are good golfers, so they train, you know, golfer pros go out and hey, I'll
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.200]  give you half price on a golf lesson, you just got to pay me cash, and they can barely
[14:36.200 --> 14:41.320]  pay their bills having two or three jobs, two of the jobs they pay taxes on, one of
[14:41.320 --> 14:46.800]  the jobs they don't, so now the IRS is scaling up tattletail lines, oh, we'll give you tens
[14:46.800 --> 14:57.480]  of thousands of dollars if you report a waitress or waiter who keeps those cash tips, or oh,
[14:57.480 --> 15:02.960]  did your neighbor pay the lawn man in cash?
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.180]  And that's why they want to get rid of cash, because they want to establish the economy
[15:06.180 --> 15:12.080]  where you can't operate and survive as the average person to destroy the idea of capitalism,
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.400]  that's clout and pibbon, and that's their admission, but then Joe Biden's got the nerve
[15:15.400 --> 15:21.600]  and I'm going to cover this coming up, talk about oh, these billionaires and trillionaires,
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.960]  they don't pay even 3% tax, which is true, and they're the woke mega corporations that
[15:25.960 --> 15:31.600]  are funding all the leftist garbage and funding the tax code to annihilate little people while
[15:31.600 --> 15:37.240]  they make hundreds of billions of dollars and then fund all this wokeism, but I just
[15:37.240 --> 15:41.520]  love the Democrats always talk about going after the ultra rich, and their idea of the
[15:41.520 --> 15:47.440]  ultra rich is somebody mowing yards or giving massages, or a waitress, or a bartender trying
[15:47.440 --> 15:53.080]  to put their kid through school, I'm just, oh, it's such a deal breaker, how could any
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.520]  working class person support these people, and why are the Republicans making a bigger
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.520]  deal out of this?
[15:59.520 --> 16:15.040]  Well, I just want to say about diet force, diet force is amazing, I'm 45, and I have
[16:15.040 --> 16:22.040]  bit, I go to the gym, and I have bit that won't move, and diet force has helped me move
[16:22.040 --> 16:27.040]  those bits, like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two towels a day,
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.560]  because the go, you have to get the diet force and have it to a day, and just keep
[16:31.560 --> 16:32.560]  active.

[17:17.040 --> 17:21.360]  what you pay for similar products, or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.360]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation, that supplies
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.120]  some of the top names, they then give us the best deal out there, because the owner is
[17:29.120 --> 17:32.520]  a listener, and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts, you're not going
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.520]  to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it, you're
[17:37.520 --> 17:40.640]  not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram, you're not going to find
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.680]  two-market 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it, you're not going to find any of
[17:44.680 --> 17:50.720]  this anywhere near that, these similar formulas with the same formulas sell for up to 200%
[17:50.720 --> 17:56.560]  more than we're selling these, InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com,
[17:56.560 --> 18:00.000]  a true 360 win.
[18:00.000 --> 18:10.400]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones, I want you all to know something, Alex Jones
[18:10.400 --> 18:11.400]  was right.
[18:11.400 --> 18:15.120]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[18:15.120 --> 18:18.120]  Alex has been right on port over a decade.
[18:18.120 --> 18:24.800]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[18:24.800 --> 18:28.800]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two, imagine being
[18:28.800 --> 18:31.920]  like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[18:31.920 --> 18:35.760]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[18:35.760 --> 18:40.040]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[18:40.040 --> 18:42.440]  You're one of the great thinkers of this.
[18:42.440 --> 18:44.880]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[18:44.880 --> 18:48.200]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[18:48.200 --> 18:55.360]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[18:55.360 --> 19:00.280]  AlexJonesLive.com.
[19:00.280 --> 19:02.000]  InfoWars is winning.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.120]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[19:04.120 --> 19:07.480]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago, mainstream media
[19:07.480 --> 19:09.640]  told you, but it's not true.
[19:09.640 --> 19:11.760]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[19:11.760 --> 19:13.840]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[19:13.840 --> 19:14.840]  None of that's true.
[19:14.840 --> 19:16.160]  It's all being appealed.
[19:16.160 --> 19:21.080]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars,
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.160]  we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[19:25.160 --> 19:28.800]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[19:28.800 --> 19:31.280]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.760]  Go to InfoWars.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts.
[19:35.760 --> 19:39.880]  You name it, then fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their
[19:39.880 --> 19:41.760]  sigh up has not worked.
[19:41.760 --> 19:43.120]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[19:43.120 --> 19:49.200]  Take action at infowarstore.com today because the only people that can take us off the air
[19:49.200 --> 19:51.480]  is you, the viewers and listeners.
[19:51.480 --> 19:54.880]  The majority of you have not been sigh up, but some of you have.
[19:54.880 --> 20:14.560]  Do not let the globalists brainwash you, go to infowarstore.com and keep us on the air.
[20:14.560 --> 20:25.880]  All right, let me talk about a 35,000-foot issue and then we'll move into ground level.
[20:25.880 --> 20:29.240]  I put up the show headline this morning, Victory Within Grass, Humanity is Awakening
[20:29.240 --> 20:34.120]  the Globalist Occupation of Earth, Must Watch Friday Live Broadcast, please share the links
[20:34.120 --> 20:37.120]  from bandoutvideoininfowars.com.
[20:37.120 --> 20:43.440]  But when you try to share those links, let them get blocked so we have a page that's
[20:43.440 --> 20:50.440]  just a static page that is, I forget what the new URL is, let me put it back on screen
[20:50.440 --> 20:51.440]  guys.
[20:51.440 --> 20:55.400]  I think that's a conspiracyfact.info, conspiracyfact.info.
[20:55.400 --> 21:01.120]  And so just be sure and share that link or figure out however creatively you can because
[21:01.120 --> 21:07.840]  we are in an information war and it is essential in the information war to get those facts
[21:07.840 --> 21:08.840]  out.
[21:08.840 --> 21:13.720]  That's conspiracyfact.info for me right now and more and more we're just going to build
[21:13.720 --> 21:17.480]  separate sites because every few months they'll ban the next site.
[21:17.480 --> 21:22.120]  They just have the simple video and audio players for the show for you so you can share
[21:22.120 --> 21:27.600]  it on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, in person, everywhere else and go ahead and scroll down
[21:27.600 --> 21:34.280]  and then find the live feed for your friends, family, neighbors, perfect strangers, whoever
[21:34.280 --> 21:37.720]  it is that you want to share that information with.
[21:37.720 --> 21:41.880]  Hey here's a forbidden link, here's information they don't want you to know, the people are
[21:41.880 --> 21:47.480]  very very hungry for the truth and again it's a simple thing, everybody understands it,
[21:47.480 --> 21:52.560]  but if we don't share the word we can't overpower the sensors and the control.
[21:52.560 --> 21:57.440]  They don't have big tech and legacy dinosaur media and the FBI and the CIA and the Justice
[21:57.440 --> 22:02.800]  Department depending on trying to suppress the American people, criticizing Bill Gates,
[22:02.800 --> 22:06.480]  criticizing election fraud, criticizing open borders for nothing.
[22:06.480 --> 22:10.120]  They're winning hearts and minds, they have a good chance of beating this, but people
[22:10.120 --> 22:13.920]  have to realize how critical and important they individually are.
[22:13.920 --> 22:19.720]  So Conspiracy Fact.info is the current URL to share and it's still from that fundraiser
[22:19.720 --> 22:23.640]  a few weeks ago, has some headlines about Moneybomb, we're going to update that to say
[22:23.640 --> 22:29.720]  live Alex Jones broadcast and that's a very simple, easy page for everybody to share.
[22:29.720 --> 22:34.640]  Okay, let me give you the 35,000 foot view and then dig back into the news.
[22:34.640 --> 22:42.040]  If you understand why Biden is assaulting over the last two years and upgrading the assault
[22:42.040 --> 22:48.480]  to just a deluge with 87,000 new agents that the House voted to repeal the money for, but
[22:48.480 --> 22:51.520]  the Senate isn't doing it, so it's on the books, it's happening.
[22:51.520 --> 22:57.480]  The reason they would target people bringing in less than 6% of the revenue is to why.
[22:57.480 --> 23:02.200]  Get them to give up, go on welfare, go to the system, so the system has a bunch of people
[23:02.200 --> 23:06.680]  that they control, that they can domesticate, that they can make politically follow their
[23:06.680 --> 23:11.680]  orders or they don't get to have food.
[23:11.680 --> 23:15.680]  And then you grow up generations in that, which we already have, now it's intensifying,
[23:15.680 --> 23:19.560]  they have an army of people that are totally domesticated and don't know how to take care
[23:19.560 --> 23:25.600]  of themselves who will actually believe somebody that has a nice car or a decent house or has
[23:25.600 --> 23:31.240]  a nice education or can go on vacation or has good medical care is bad and that it's
[23:31.240 --> 23:37.640]  that person that didn't pay more taxes and because that person didn't support communism
[23:37.640 --> 23:43.680]  and authoritarianism and centralization that that's the reason that they just got pure
[23:43.680 --> 23:51.760]  corporate communism in, they suddenly have all this wealth when it's the most rich, powerful
[23:51.760 --> 23:57.600]  elite corporations on earth headed up by the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller Foundation
[23:57.600 --> 24:06.160]  that publicly run our healthcare, publicly run our policy, publicly run everything and
[24:06.160 --> 24:11.200]  they're trying to take the world over and doing all these evil things in our name while
[24:11.200 --> 24:17.160]  at the same time discrediting America when this isn't America, this is a globalist occupied
[24:17.160 --> 24:18.160]  force.
[24:18.160 --> 24:26.440]  So here's a short clip of Biden just from yesterday saying you'd think a trillionaire
[24:26.440 --> 24:42.600]  should be paying at least 3%, here it is.
[24:42.600 --> 24:49.680]  But the very corporations, 99% of the Fortune 500 give most of their money to Democrats
[24:49.680 --> 24:57.120]  and create the global policy through the tank tanks to have Google and Microsoft and all
[24:57.120 --> 25:04.560]  these other corporations paying, Biden correctly said less than 3% on average in taxes.
[25:04.560 --> 25:12.400]  So a working class person making $35,000, $40,000 a year, they are paying after Social Security
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.400]  and all the rest of it around 30%, 25 to 30%.
[25:17.400 --> 25:23.600]  Let me tell you, you're making less than $45,000 a year, you should be paying no taxes
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.720]  at the federal level and back when our country was healthier and smarter, there was no tax
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.480]  on working class people and blue collar people and there were no taxes on middle class, that
[25:33.480 --> 25:35.480]  makes a bigger middle class.
[25:35.480 --> 25:40.000]  But when you raise taxes on the middle class and working class and then the elites have
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.960]  all these special provisions for themselves, that's how you do what they've done.
[25:45.960 --> 25:52.600]  In 1950, look it up, America was 4% of the world population, 96% didn't live in the United
[25:52.600 --> 25:58.600]  States of America, the United States had over half the wealth in the planet, the biggest
[25:58.600 --> 26:04.800]  middle class the world had ever seen, the top 1% only owned about 20% of the wealth
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.520]  and property and a giant middle class or working class had almost all the rest of it, close
[26:09.520 --> 26:11.320]  to 80%.
[26:11.320 --> 26:26.000]  Today, 1 tenth of 1% has over 75% of the wealth and it is a tiny percent of that percent that
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.640]  has over half the wealth, there are less than 10 families that have over half the wealth
[26:32.640 --> 26:40.000]  in the world, how did we go since 1950 with 4% of the world that launched the American
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.840]  system created a giant wealthy middle class or working class or now a poor person had
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.880]  more wealth than a rich person had in 1900.
[26:49.880 --> 26:54.200]  All this wealth, all this splendor, all this stuff that made us so decadent, that's the
[26:54.200 --> 26:59.480]  byproducts that makes you spoiled, makes you lazy, makes your kids lazy, we all know it.
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.840]  And that's when the corruption sets in, history shows when you have a powerful, rich country
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.240]  and hard working people, they have a golden error, within a few generations they had a
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.480]  bunch of spoiled, rotten people that are lazy and stupid on average and corrupt elites
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.560]  take over and then the cycle of corruption takes over and then it's a collapse.
[27:17.560 --> 27:22.080]  And we're headed into that right now and the globalists know that cycle so they're orchestrating
[27:22.080 --> 27:23.080]  it.
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.160]  So I'm going to say to new listeners, I know our regular listeners know this, but to new
[27:26.160 --> 27:30.840]  listeners out there, if you're a Democrat with 2 or 3 college degrees and you think
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.720]  if you bring in communism it's all going to be free, you're an idiot, the ultra rich
[27:35.720 --> 27:44.960]  are fascist transhumanists that hate you and have nothing but revulsion for you.
[27:44.960 --> 27:46.740]  They think you're a complete joke.
[27:46.740 --> 27:50.760]  Because you buy into this, you're not going to get black reparations, you're not going
[27:50.760 --> 27:52.920]  to get your student loans forgiven.
[27:52.920 --> 28:00.800]  They dangle that out in front of you while they hire 87,000 IRS agents after 2 years
[28:00.800 --> 28:08.120]  of raping poor people, the working poor and the blue collar people above them to destroy
[28:08.120 --> 28:14.640]  you and then you'll get your little EBT card and live in a project and full of crime and
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.680]  death and barely even have enough money to eat food.
[28:18.680 --> 28:20.720]  They want you out of the game.
[28:20.720 --> 28:27.440]  They want you enslaved and it's the Fortune 500 controlled by the Fortune 100 that are
[28:27.440 --> 28:33.120]  publicly running all of these policies worldwide, the same policies in Australia, that are in
[28:33.120 --> 28:39.200]  France, that are in the UK, that are in the US because it's the new world order and anything
[28:39.200 --> 28:45.040]  they push will bring you poverty and death and enslavement and war and destruction.
[28:45.040 --> 28:51.760]  You have to reject everything they do and get back to the American system that in 1950
[28:51.760 --> 28:56.720]  had the American people having half the wealth in the world that we produced that made others
[28:56.720 --> 29:00.000]  rich.

[32:21.880 --> 32:27.560]  biological weapons against all of mankind and by the time they launched their attack
[32:27.560 --> 32:34.640]  in 2020, Alex Jones' Infowars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly
[32:34.640 --> 32:37.520]  vaccines that we knew were coming.

[33:13.880 --> 33:26.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[33:26.600 --> 33:31.600]  Jones.
[33:31.600 --> 33:35.760]  The tyrants are attacking reading, writing and arithmetic, they're attacking logic,
[33:35.760 --> 33:41.040]  they're attacking science, they're attacking common sense, they're putting slaves, brainwash,
[33:41.040 --> 33:46.120]  dumb down, adult people, the musicians of power so that you think it's Joe Biden and
[33:46.120 --> 33:51.080]  you think it's Senator Federman running things when it is the big globalist think tanks
[33:51.080 --> 33:52.520]  that are running at all.
[33:52.520 --> 33:57.760]  But the beautiful good news is that not just here but all over the world, folks are finding
[33:57.760 --> 34:03.720]  out about multinational corporations writing policy, using executive branches through intelligence
[34:03.720 --> 34:10.600]  agencies and think tanks and media and big tech to suppress and control and dumb down
[34:10.600 --> 34:11.720]  the public.
[34:11.720 --> 34:16.320]  And Twitter was a big test of their power and control.
[34:16.320 --> 34:20.720]  So I've been telling you this for many years, but you have big tech dinosaur media, think
[34:20.720 --> 34:28.240]  tanks that create policy, and then the organizations that create the targeting policy, the ADL
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.920]  and Southern Primary Law Center, that is then given over to big tech and legacy media and
[34:33.920 --> 34:38.680]  federal law enforcement, not just here but in every western country, it's the same blueprint
[34:38.680 --> 34:43.680]  where they have consoles, as I've told you hundreds of times the last eight, nine years
[34:43.680 --> 34:47.600]  when we learned the specifics of this, to all go into your file, they can read your
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.160]  private text messages without a warrant, they can track everything you're doing, they read
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.840]  your email, they read your private Twitter, your Facebook, your Instagram, your Google
[34:56.840 --> 35:04.800]  search, that has been given access to millions alone in the U.S. of private and governmental
[35:04.800 --> 35:06.400]  bureaucrats.
[35:06.400 --> 35:10.040]  And that was what's so amazing about the last two days of hearings that I could do the whole
[35:10.040 --> 35:16.200]  show just on these in Congress where they've got just the documents from Twitter where
[35:16.200 --> 35:23.800]  they create a console for each platform that government agencies without warrants who put
[35:23.800 --> 35:29.080]  former FBI agents and CIA and others in the offices at Twitter, which is done everywhere
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.640]  else but we have the Twitter files, to then in live time go in and spy on you and they
[35:34.640 --> 35:42.960]  give national security secret and top secret clearances to thousands of people per big
[35:42.960 --> 35:45.920]  tech company.
[35:45.920 --> 35:53.400]  And of course it's top secret because just like blowing up the gas pipeline, it's illegal.
[35:53.400 --> 35:59.040]  You see this congressional oversight over Army special operations, Navy special warfare,
[35:59.040 --> 36:05.560]  but there's not over the general programs and so they bring in contractors, they bring
[36:05.560 --> 36:11.200]  in outside construction teams, then they give the military training and they go blow up
[36:11.200 --> 36:15.200]  the pipeline as we now know.
[36:15.200 --> 36:16.200]  So they're outsourcing it.
[36:16.200 --> 36:21.120]  There's a big article out of the U.K. where you read it, you go oh my gosh, the government
[36:21.120 --> 36:29.000]  agency that's over domestic surveillance commissioner admits illegal spying on everyone in live
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.880]  time and says private corporations are doing it and there's nothing they can do because
[36:34.880 --> 36:41.360]  the government set them up in that position because big tech is the deep state.
[36:41.360 --> 36:45.320]  And then government can say oh it's big tech and big tech can say oh it's the government
[36:45.320 --> 36:47.440]  but it's all a revolving door.
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.680]  So I had a bunch of new clips today but I want to go to a clip I didn't get to yesterday
[36:52.680 --> 36:53.680]  because it's so important.
[36:53.680 --> 37:02.080]  Representative Anna Paulina Luma grills former Twitter exec Yole Roth and she's got a map
[37:02.080 --> 37:03.320]  and details how this works.
[37:03.320 --> 37:04.320]  Here it is.
[37:04.320 --> 37:10.840]  Mr. Roth, have you communicated with government officials ever on a platform called JIRA?
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.280]  Yes or no?
[37:15.280 --> 37:16.280]  Real quick answer.
[37:16.280 --> 37:17.280]  We're on the clock.
[37:17.280 --> 37:18.280]  Not to the best of my recollection.
[37:18.280 --> 37:19.280]  Not to your recollection?
[37:19.280 --> 37:20.280]  Great.
[37:20.280 --> 37:26.120]  If you did in the event communicate, who would have had access to this platform?
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.600]  That's the nature of my confusion.
[37:27.600 --> 37:28.600]  Okay.
[37:28.600 --> 37:32.200]  Did you ever speak to government officials on JIRA regarding taking down social media
[37:32.200 --> 37:33.200]  posts?
[37:33.200 --> 37:35.160]  Again, not to the best of my recollection.
[37:35.160 --> 37:39.240]  Can you explain to me why the federal government would ever have interest in communicating through
[37:39.240 --> 37:44.920]  JIRA, mind you, a private cloud server with social media companies without oversight to
[37:44.920 --> 37:46.560]  censor American voices?
[37:46.560 --> 37:51.080]  I want to let you know that this is a violation of the First Amendment and the federal government
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.280]  is colluding with social media companies to censor Americans.
[37:54.280 --> 37:59.040]  Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to submit these graphics into record.
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.040]  And Mr. Roth, I'm going to refresh your memory for you.
[38:02.040 --> 38:09.200]  This flow chart shows the following federal agencies, social media companies, Twitter,
[38:09.200 --> 38:16.480]  leftist nonprofits, and organizations communicating regarding their version of misinformation using
[38:16.480 --> 38:18.960]  JIRA, a private cloud server.
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.640]  On this chart, I want to annotate that the Department of Homeland Security, which has
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.360]  the following branches, Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency, also known
[38:27.360 --> 38:33.560]  as CISA, Countering Foreign Intelligence Task Force, now known as the Misinfo, Disinfo,
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.760]  and Malinformation MDM.
[38:35.760 --> 38:37.920]  This was again used against the American people.
[38:37.920 --> 38:44.880]  The Election Integrity Partnership, EIP, which includes the following Stanford Internet
[38:44.880 --> 38:50.520]  Observatory, University of Washington Center for Informed Public, Graphica, and Atlantic
[38:50.520 --> 38:55.560]  Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, and potentially, according to what we found
[38:55.560 --> 38:58.920]  on the final report by EIP, the DNC.
[38:58.920 --> 39:05.120]  The Center for Internet Security, CIS, a non-profit funded by DHS, the National Association
[39:05.120 --> 39:10.960]  of Secretaries of State, also known as NASS, and the National Association of State Election
[39:10.960 --> 39:17.200]  Directors, NASED, and in this case, because there are other social media companies involved,
[39:17.200 --> 39:18.440]  Twitter.
[39:18.440 --> 39:21.460]  What do all of these groups, though, have in common, and I'm going to again refresh
[39:21.460 --> 39:25.840]  your memory, they were all communicating on a private cloud server known as JIRA.
[39:25.840 --> 39:32.400]  Now, the screenshot behind me, which is an example of one of thousands, shows on November
[39:32.400 --> 39:37.120]  3rd, 2020, that you, Mr. Roth, a Twitter employee, were exchanging communications
[39:37.120 --> 39:44.760]  on JIRA, a private cloud server, with CISA, NASS, NASED, and Alex Stamos, who are now
[39:44.760 --> 39:45.760]  working for Stanford.
[39:45.760 --> 39:46.760]  Oh, hit pause.
[39:46.760 --> 39:47.760]  Back in 10 seconds.
[39:47.760 --> 39:52.960]  Now, you can look this up, but there's at least 10 federal laws that I know of, and
[39:52.960 --> 39:55.640]  I was looking into this morning to remind myself, that was a couple of laws, there's
[39:55.640 --> 40:02.000]  like 10, that any official government business has to be conducted on government software,
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  government platforms, and it's subject to reporting by law to the Freedom of Information
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.440]  Act system, or the FOIA.
[40:11.440 --> 40:13.440]  So that right there is a crime.
[40:13.440 --> 40:17.880]  But to have the FBI and all these groups quarterbacking, targeting people in an election, and that
[40:17.880 --> 40:22.800]  came out in the hearings, to suppress all these stories exposing the Democrats, and
[40:22.800 --> 40:26.320]  the DNC is telling all these think tanks and private groups and government what they
[40:26.320 --> 40:30.400]  want shut down, they then gin up the propaganda of the program, and then have their minions
[40:30.400 --> 40:32.640]  go out and shut it down.
[40:32.640 --> 40:34.600]  I mean, that's illegal as hell.
[40:34.600 --> 40:40.160]  That's an informational coup, a weaponized, hijacked federal government by private interest
[40:40.160 --> 40:43.560]  with the leftist ideology over America.
[40:43.560 --> 40:48.240]  So the big awakening is, you live in an occupied country, whether you're in Australia, or New
[40:48.240 --> 40:55.600]  Zealand, or Canada, or France, or the US, this is all illegal as hell, and this is why
[40:55.600 --> 40:56.840]  they think you're so dumb.
[40:56.840 --> 41:02.080]  Remember the hearings the last 10 years, I was even at one, four years ago with Sundar
[41:02.080 --> 41:08.360]  Pichai, the head of Google, and they said again, does Google track people in lob tom
[41:08.360 --> 41:09.360]  on their phone?
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.280]  He goes, no sir, we don't, total lie.
[41:13.280 --> 41:17.920]  But the Geospatial Center merged with Google does, so he uses little technicals on him,
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.920]  see?
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.840]  They had no respect for Congress, because the congressmen still don't even know about
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.400]  GPS systems.
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.080]  But they're waking up fast, let's continue.
[41:30.080 --> 41:35.800]  Roth, a Twitter employee were exchanging communications on JIRA, a private cloud server,
[41:35.800 --> 41:42.360]  with CISA, NASS, NASED, and Alex Stombas, who now works at Stanford, and is a former
[41:42.360 --> 41:48.080]  security officer at Facebook to remove a posting.
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.120]  Do you now remember communicating on a private cloud server to remove a posting?
[41:53.120 --> 41:57.480]  Yes or no?
[41:57.480 --> 42:02.480]  I wouldn't agree with the characterization that this is your stuff.
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.560]  Back it up 20 seconds, we're going to go to break and come back with us, folks.
[42:06.560 --> 42:11.840]  This young, amazing, smart woman, new member of Congress, understands technology.
[42:11.840 --> 42:16.000]  She's got all these documents that are public, and so he says, I don't know what that is.
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.640]  She has his messages on it.
[42:21.640 --> 42:34.160]  It's called nailing someone, nailing them, absolutely nailing his ass.
[42:34.160 --> 42:37.400]  And I got clips of the FBI being confronted, and trying to lie about it, and then making
[42:37.400 --> 42:38.400]  fun of the documents.
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.880]  I mean, it's just a smorgasbord of the new world order being burned down in front of
[42:42.880 --> 42:43.880]  us.
[42:43.880 --> 42:53.560]  So, this is good, good, good stuff for the future of art species, and you go get them,
[42:53.560 --> 43:01.360]  girl, we'll be right back.
[43:01.360 --> 43:04.560]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.800]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[43:09.800 --> 43:10.800]  us.
[43:10.800 --> 43:14.240]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[43:14.240 --> 43:20.520]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison
[43:20.520 --> 43:25.040]  Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven
[43:25.040 --> 43:28.600]  days a week, it's really just incredible.
[43:28.600 --> 43:32.120]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.040]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[43:37.040 --> 43:38.040]  us.
[43:38.040 --> 43:41.120]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[43:41.120 --> 43:46.000]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsTour.com, and you never buy great
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.880]  products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keep us on air.
[43:49.880 --> 43:53.680]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[43:53.680 --> 43:58.360]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTour.com, our funding problems
[43:58.360 --> 43:59.360]  will be over.
[43:59.360 --> 44:00.360]  Please take action now.
[44:00.360 --> 44:09.040]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWarsTour.com,
[44:09.040 --> 44:16.640]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[44:16.640 --> 44:21.720]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.600]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.120]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform,
[44:30.120 --> 44:34.160]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.960]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[44:38.960 --> 44:39.960]  Tim Cass IRL.
[44:39.960 --> 44:45.840]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because
[44:45.840 --> 44:48.160]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.880]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[44:52.880 --> 44:57.240]  their store, go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're
[44:57.240 --> 45:04.240]  gone.
[45:27.240 --> 45:40.520]  Now, the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[45:40.520 --> 45:47.400]  was Death and Hell Followed with Him, the Book of Revelation.
[45:47.400 --> 45:50.840]  Very serious times to be alive, folks, they're not just doing this as a one-off, this is
[45:50.840 --> 45:54.920]  the beginning of the rest of our lives, this is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[45:54.920 --> 45:58.760]  The globalists even admit it's leaked, they're very upset that they're losing and that this
[45:58.760 --> 46:00.680]  hasn't gone the way they thought it would.

[47:18.440 --> 47:47.440]  The good news is, now everybody knows, we can start turning this thing around, that's
[47:47.440 --> 48:06.560]  how the cycles work, as everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows, the captain lie, everybody
[48:06.560 --> 48:07.560]  got it.
[48:07.560 --> 48:10.440]  Alright, so let's get back to this incredible clip, there's just hours of these, representative
[48:10.440 --> 48:21.600]  of Anna Halina Luna, I tell you, really taking it to the head censor, who had national security
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.080]  clearance highest levels with the FBI, inside Twitter, quarterbacking this, he just told
[48:27.080 --> 48:29.920]  her he doesn't even know about any of this, never heard of this, she hits him with the
[48:29.920 --> 48:35.120]  internal communications that Elon Musk has released and he goes, oh, well, don't misrepresent
[48:35.120 --> 48:38.400]  me, let's continue with that.
[48:38.400 --> 48:46.080]  Do you now remember communicating on a private cloud server to remove a posting?
[48:46.080 --> 48:47.080]  Yes or no?
[48:47.080 --> 48:52.840]  I wouldn't agree with the character, I don't care if you agree, this is your stuff, yes
[48:52.840 --> 48:58.160]  or no, did you communicate with a private entity, the government agency on a private
[48:58.160 --> 49:00.080]  cloud server, yes or no?
[49:00.080 --> 49:03.160]  The question was, if I could, yes or no, I'm on time, yes or no.
[49:03.160 --> 49:05.160]  Ma'am, I don't believe I can give you a yes or no.
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.360]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now that you did and we have proof of it.
[49:08.360 --> 49:12.320]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is joint action between the federal government and a private
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.160]  company to censor and violate the First Amendment, this is also known, and I'm so glad that
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.080]  there's many attorneys on this panel, joint state actors, it's highly illegal, you are
[49:21.080 --> 49:26.680]  all engaged in this action and I want you to know that you will be all held accountable.
[49:26.680 --> 49:31.680]  Ms. Gaddy, are you still on CICE's Cybersecurity Advisory Council?
[49:31.680 --> 49:32.680]  Yes or no?
[49:32.680 --> 49:33.680]  Yes, I am.
[49:33.680 --> 49:34.680]  Okay.
[49:34.680 --> 49:38.360]  I have said that this is a pointless hearing and I just want to let you guys all know,
[49:38.360 --> 49:43.240]  we found that Twitter was indeed communicating with the federal government to censor Americans.
[49:43.240 --> 49:48.280]  I'd like to remind you that this was all in place before January 6th, so to say that these
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.040]  mechanisms weren't in place and to make it about January 6th, I want to let you know
[49:52.040 --> 49:55.920]  that you guys were actually in control of all of the content and clearly we have proof
[49:55.920 --> 49:56.920]  of that.
[49:56.920 --> 50:00.080]  Now, if you don't think that this is important to your constituents and the American people
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.200]  from those saying that this was a pointless hearing, I suggest you find other jobs, Chairman,
[50:04.200 --> 50:07.000]  I yield my time.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.120]  By the way, I have some breaking news that I've sat on for a few weeks.
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.760]  I don't normally sit on stories, but I wanted to get the green light to talk about it concerning
[50:15.760 --> 50:24.520]  January 6th because it's so big and I also wanted to just give it to Tucker Carlson,
[50:24.520 --> 50:31.840]  but the sources that gave me the information told me to hold off and I was supposed to
[50:31.840 --> 50:37.240]  call them back yesterday and I didn't, but let's just say they're inside the Proud Boys
[50:37.240 --> 50:49.280]  trial in D.C. where the jury's out of the room most of the time and it's incredible.
[50:49.280 --> 50:59.120]  I mean, smoking gun of hundreds of federal informants leading the attack and actually
[50:59.120 --> 51:03.640]  being the leaders of the Proud Boys.
[51:03.640 --> 51:05.560]  You know, Tario was a federal informant.
[51:05.560 --> 51:06.560]  That's admitted.
[51:06.560 --> 51:14.760]  He got set up by him, though, but the people right under him and the driver and all of it
[51:14.760 --> 51:16.640]  was a deep state operation.
[51:16.640 --> 51:21.400]  These guys got totally set up and the judges in the trial, well, everybody kicked out of
[51:21.400 --> 51:25.800]  the room saying to the feds, no, you're right, we're not letting you that out.
[51:25.800 --> 51:30.160]  So I just went ahead and let the cat out of the bag because I'm not going to sit on it
[51:30.160 --> 51:32.040]  and I've been sitting on it too long because it's so big.
[51:32.040 --> 51:36.240]  You're like, that one story is like a Seymour Hirsch level deal, six month investigation
[51:36.240 --> 51:40.080]  and all the proof and the facts and the insiders and that's just my daily life.
[51:40.080 --> 51:43.640]  Just like bam, bam, bam, bam.
[51:43.640 --> 51:44.640]  So I'm not complaining.
[51:44.640 --> 51:51.440]  I'm just saying I'm busier than one legged man in an ass kicking contest or I'm busier
[51:51.440 --> 52:00.720]  than a one-armed paper hanger and believe me, this is from inside the trial and they're
[52:00.720 --> 52:08.520]  just suppressing the hell out of it, but you talk about vindicating us and Tucker Carlson
[52:08.520 --> 52:12.240]  to talk to about testing.
[52:12.240 --> 52:14.400]  I just got, I got to call Tucker after the show.
[52:14.400 --> 52:16.360]  I got to put him in touch with these sources.
[52:16.360 --> 52:20.160]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[52:20.160 --> 52:23.560]  And remember, people pay dear prices for covering this.
[52:23.560 --> 52:25.960]  Let's play this clip.
[52:25.960 --> 52:30.280]  This is Congressman Clay Higgins, Louisiana, pointing out these criminals will be held
[52:30.280 --> 52:34.680]  accountable for what they've done, election meddling, election stealing, admitted by
[52:34.680 --> 52:39.360]  suppressing information and spying on people politically for the DNC at Twitter.
[52:39.360 --> 52:41.560]  Here it is.
[52:41.560 --> 52:49.400]  Bottom line is that the FBI had to buy and cram family laptop for a year.
[52:49.400 --> 52:50.880]  They knew it was leaking.
[52:50.880 --> 52:54.800]  They knew it would hurt the Biden campaign.
[52:54.800 --> 53:02.320]  So the FBI used its relationship with Twitter to suppress criminal evidence being revealed
[53:02.320 --> 53:07.280]  about Joe Biden one month before the 2020 elections.
[53:07.280 --> 53:12.400]  You ladies and gentlemen interfered with the United States of America 2020 presidential
[53:12.400 --> 53:15.720]  election knowingly and willingly.
[53:15.720 --> 53:21.240]  That's the bad news is going to get worse because this is the investigation part.
[53:21.240 --> 53:24.600]  Later comes the arrest part.
[53:24.600 --> 53:27.560]  Your attorneys are familiar with that.
[53:27.560 --> 53:32.640]  Mr. Chairman, I'd like to spend five hours with these ladies and gentlemen doing depositions
[53:32.640 --> 53:34.400]  surely yet to come.
[53:34.400 --> 53:41.440]  But for right now, I'll yield the balance of my time to my colleague, Mr. George.
[53:41.440 --> 53:44.320]  America's not going to be killed so easily.
[53:44.320 --> 53:47.160]  So the globalists are panicking trying to start World War III.
[53:47.160 --> 53:48.680]  I'm getting chills right now.
[53:48.680 --> 53:50.560]  I've got dozens more of these clips.
[53:50.560 --> 53:54.560]  We've got a guest come up with 30 minutes arrested in Canada for not submitting to transgender
[53:54.560 --> 53:56.600]  brainwashing in his high school.
[53:56.600 --> 53:57.600]  And that ties into all this.
[53:57.600 --> 54:04.040]  Then we'll continue on with these clips and news and Emerald Robinson and more today.
[54:04.040 --> 54:08.440]  But listen, you want somebody to fight?
[54:08.440 --> 54:09.440]  I'm ready to fight.
[54:09.440 --> 54:12.000]  I was born to fight.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.920]  I don't always win, but I don't ever give up.
[54:14.920 --> 54:18.360]  I want to salute and thank the viewers and listeners for your support, but this is such
[54:18.360 --> 54:19.600]  a no-brainer.
[54:19.600 --> 54:24.120]  We've got products you need that will enrich your life and make it better and your family's
[54:24.120 --> 54:27.200]  life and your friends' life and strangers' lives.
[54:27.200 --> 54:30.920]  And we have been proven right in triplicate.
[54:30.920 --> 54:36.280]  And we've held on through all this hell to be vindicated now.
[54:36.280 --> 54:40.480]  And I'm not controlled by a board or outside a group like James O'Keefe who's an amazing
[54:40.480 --> 54:45.680]  person and I held my fire here until I talked to everybody and found out 100% Democrat,
[54:45.680 --> 54:50.120]  deep state, CNN infiltrators, after the Pfizer thing, the FBI came in and threatened a bunch
[54:50.120 --> 54:52.720]  of them with a rest and the board got scared.
[54:52.720 --> 54:54.560]  So they fired James O'Keefe.
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.320]  They've removed him because the Pfizer thing was the biggest thing they ever did.
[54:58.320 --> 55:05.560]  I mean, that blew a big, giant hole in the New World Order ship of lies.
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.640]  That video that came out two weeks ago with their head of global vaccine, mRNA, saying
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.240]  we created the virus, we did all this and we're going to take control of it and we're
[55:16.240 --> 55:19.800]  hurting a bunch of people.
[55:19.800 --> 55:23.720]  The FBI has already raided Project Veritas several times and they told them we're going
[55:23.720 --> 55:26.880]  to arrest your ass if you don't get rid of James O'Keefe.
[55:26.880 --> 55:33.240]  And the word is they're getting ready to indict O'Keefe for the diary that he didn't
[55:33.240 --> 55:42.720]  even publish with Biden's daughter saying he used to rape me in the shower.
[55:42.720 --> 55:50.880]  We have a rogue justice department that works for the globalists that are Chacom controlled.
[55:50.880 --> 55:52.520]  That's where we're at.
[55:52.520 --> 55:55.600]  And you can see the deep state losing, but they're not giving up.
[55:55.600 --> 56:00.320]  Don't you see the intelligence agencies release the Nord Stream blow up.
[56:00.320 --> 56:01.320]  More is going to come out.
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.480]  Elon Musk is a opportunist, really smart, but he knows we're winning.
[56:06.480 --> 56:09.000]  He already jumped over to our side.
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.200]  More of you that serve the New World Order should just jump over to our side because
[56:13.200 --> 56:18.320]  we're going to win and we want prosperity and we don't want to blow the planet up.
[56:18.320 --> 56:20.920]  Will you please just join us?
[56:20.920 --> 56:21.920]  My God!
[56:21.920 --> 56:22.920]  It's the only move.
[56:22.920 --> 56:26.800]  I'll put my hand out again to the establishment people that serve the system when you know
[56:26.800 --> 56:33.120]  the ship sinking, as I've done so many times, just take my hand.
[56:33.120 --> 56:34.520]  Come on.
[56:34.520 --> 56:37.840]  You don't have to keep pretending like Mitt Romney, you're part of the power structure
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.680]  when the whole thing's sinking.
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.680]  Don't be a Mitt Romney.
[56:40.680 --> 56:43.920]  Now, I don't just extend sales like, oh, today's the last day.
[56:43.920 --> 56:48.280]  I've been too busy and we're out of so much product that when this sale ends, I don't
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.640]  know what I'm going to do.
[56:49.640 --> 56:52.960]  So I've been so busy, I haven't cut new ads and I haven't figured out what the new
[56:52.960 --> 56:56.280]  sale will be, but we've got the biggest sale we ever run in a year run right now.
[56:56.280 --> 56:59.200]  Y'all chose the right sale and it's got to end this weekend.
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.360]  So I'm going to be up here on a nightmare day, as if I care about that.
[57:03.360 --> 57:07.680]  Getting ads cut, getting things ready, figuring out what the new sales are going to be, but
[57:07.680 --> 57:11.480]  this big sales ending, you should go to infowarstore.com.
[57:11.480 --> 57:17.280]  If we were selling peanuts as a fundraiser, you should go buy them and keep us on air,
[57:17.280 --> 57:18.280]  but we're not.
[57:18.280 --> 57:24.440]  We're selling high quality products and the sale is about to end infowarstore.com up

[57:48.560 --> 57:54.800]  What I just want to say about diet force, diet force is amazing.
[57:54.800 --> 58:01.520]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move and diet force

[58:15.680 --> 58:21.280]  diet force is the go, you have to get the diet force and have two a day and just keep
[58:21.280 --> 58:22.280]  active.
[58:22.280 --> 58:28.440]  Infowarstore.com, X7 diet force, infowarstore.com, baby.

[58:32.400 --> 58:33.400]  you that.
[58:33.400 --> 58:36.360]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant, God bless Australia.
[58:36.360 --> 58:50.840]  We'll be right back folks, don't go anywhere, infowarstore.com, diet force, get it now.
[58:50.840 --> 58:57.120]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, showed the
[58:57.120 --> 59:03.920]  world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[59:03.920 --> 59:12.680]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using
[59:12.680 --> 59:16.400]  biological weapons against all of mankind.
[59:16.400 --> 59:22.920]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' info wars and our audience
[59:22.920 --> 59:28.360]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[59:28.360 --> 59:30.360]  This is why they attack us.
[59:30.360 --> 59:37.000]  This is why we need your support, because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[59:37.000 --> 59:43.320]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the links, join us in
[59:43.320 --> 01:00:01.080]  the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:16.240]  2016, you also said that you actually were opposed to deleting the New York Post story.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.080]  Who advocated for the removal of the New York Post story?
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.760]  The company's decision to treat it as a violation of law.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.600]  Mr. Roth, who at the company actually went over your recommendation, because you're
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.640]  pretty high up.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.400]  Who overrode you?
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.960]  The decision was communicated to me by my direct supervisor.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.240]  Who was that person?
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240]  Her name was Del Harvey.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.080]  She was the vice president of trust and safety at the time.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.080]  All right.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.080]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.480]  Ms. Gaddy, real quick, you said to the chairman earlier, and I want to paraphrase what I heard
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:49.560]  earlier, is that Twitter had no contact with anybody from the Biden team.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.000]  Is that correct to your knowledge?
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Not to my knowledge.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.960]  Put that up for me.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960]  Okay.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:06.800]  On the right shoulder, we have an email, this is Saturday, October 24th, 5.39pm, referencing
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:13.160]  five different tweets with a Twitter email chain.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.320]  Under the line, it's more to review from the Biden team.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:23.680]  Does anybody have a comment on how much interaction was happening with the Biden team at Twitter
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.760]  with respect to tweets that they wanted Twitter to review?
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.680]  Ms. Gaddy, Mr. Roth?
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.640]  I'm not familiar with this email.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.560]  So you're not familiar with this email, Mr. Roth?
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.120]  Are you familiar with this email?
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.360]  Only from what's been reported in the Twitter files.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.280]  Did you ever have contact with anybody from the Biden team?
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.680]  No, sir, I did not.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.920]  We explicitly separated the teams that would interact with campaigns from teams like mine
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.480]  that were responsible for content marketing.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.840]  How big was the organization in Twitter that was actually working with campaigns?
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.840]  I couldn't say for sure.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.200]  Did you ever have any contact with the DNC?
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]  Directly?
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]  No, I did not.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.040]  Did anybody at Twitter have any contact with anybody at the DNC?
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.600]  I think it's likely that somebody at Twitter did, yes.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.400]  In these emails, this list, these are tweets that hate to be flagged from the Biden team.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.360]  That's what's in the files.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:16.200]  You have no idea how many people actually engage with the Twitter team or how frequently
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.840]  that engagement happened.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.440]  No, and again, that was by design.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.920]  We kept those functions separate from content moderation so that we could impartially assess
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920]  reports like that.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.280]  Do you know how many tweets were actually flagged and taken down at the behest of the
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.200]  Biden team?
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.600]  I wouldn't agree with the characterization of it as being at the behest of them.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.080]  These tweets were reported, and Twitter independently evaluated them under its rules.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.480]  But the email is very clear.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.040]  More to review from Biden team.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.880]  The response three hours later at the bottom, hold this up real quick so we can see.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.640]  The request at the bottom it says, handled these.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.280]  What does handle these mean?
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:02.000]  My understanding is that these tweets contained nonconsensual nude photos of Hunter Biden,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.600]  and they were removed by the company under.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600]  Hold on real quick, Mr. Roth.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.960]  How could you know so much about the content of these tweets?
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.520]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, these are just web addresses.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.360]  I don't know what's in these tweets.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.800]  You have these things committed to memory that you know the content, but you don't know
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.360]  who you talk to, you talk to at the Biden team?
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.640]  Sir, I didn't meet with the Biden team, but there was extensive public reporting about
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.280]  these tweets specifically that uncovered what they were.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.280]  You know the contents of the tweets.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:34.080]  I was obviously at Twitter, but you have no idea how often people who worked in your organization
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.800]  had with the Biden team during the end of the 2020 president.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:46.600]  I mean, Hillary won, but in 2020, no one could question elections saying Trump won.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:53.280]  You abused the power of a large corporation, Big Tech, to censor Americans.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.000]  And you want to know something?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  Guess what?
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.200]  I'm so glad that you're censored down.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.600]  I'm so glad you've lost your jobs.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.480]  Thank God Elon Musk bought Twitter.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.480]  And you know what?
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.480]  Let's talk about something a little bit further.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:13.560]  It's amazing to me, Mr. Roth, as the head and trust of safety at Twitter.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.520]  Your ability, or should I say inability to remove child porn.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.400]  Now here's something that disgusts me about you.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.520]  In your doctoral dissertation entitled Gay Data, you argued that minors should have access
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:33.960]  to Grindr, an adult male gay hookup app.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.960]  Minors?
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.960]  Really?
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:42.280]  You know, Elon Musk took over Twitter and he banned 44,000 accounts that were promoting
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.800]  child porn.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:49.960]  You permanently banned my Twitter account, but you allowed child porn all over Twitter.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960]  Yep, it's called.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.960]  Twitter has become a platform.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.360]  All right, Josh Alexander arrested in Canada for not worshiping transgenderism straight
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360]  ahead.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:07.800]  The cavalry has arrived, ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken

[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.560]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.600]  Well, he joins us to lay out what really happened.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.720]  Gosh, Alexander, a 60-year-old Catholic high school student from Canada who was arrested
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.000]  on February 6th that were being suspended for protesting his transgender people's use.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.320]  A bathroom has been saying there are only two genders and now he's appealing to Ontario's
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.080]  Human Rights Tribunal.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:33.560]  Here's a clip of folks who have also been arrested responding to it, then the video
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:07:02.560]  of him being arrested here it is.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:10.320]  You know, hit pause here, then we'll play the Toronto Sunpiece and then go to our guest,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.000]  the victim of this.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.600]  He got the LGBT cult out there wanting access to the children, the bathrooms, the girl showers,
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.360]  men having access to that, but the left says a guy, an adult shouldn't ask a woman out
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.560]  for a date at the mall.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.560]  That's rape.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.200]  That's Gillette Runs ads, you see all the ads, the corporate media, men and women, men
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.440]  whistling at girls, that's rape.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.840]  Men asking girls out, that's horrible, that's misogyny.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.120]  But this going on in the schools, all the world, corporate finance, that's good.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.920]  If you're a radio looser, you can't see the image of the police arresting him for simply
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.160]  criticizing this publicly for his speech.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160]  Where is the speech?
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:52.280]  Well, it's a protected group with the left cheering as he's arrested.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:08:09.000]  Please play the video of the arrest one more time.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.200]  And then they turn the camera around at Rebel News and you see the organization that wants
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:19.840]  to have sexual discussions with your children cheering in the background.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.800]  The tyranny isn't coming, it's here, they're trying to pass laws like this here in the
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.960]  US, they're having to pass laws to counter laws to do it.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.200]  Tennessee set to pass a law that restricts drag shows.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.800]  Montana bill would let students misgender classmates because they want to arrest students
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.160]  in Montana if somebody says I'm a girl but they're really a boy, you should be able to
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.920]  call them Batman, you should be able to call them a donut, you should be able to call them
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920]  whatever you want.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.600]  It's free speech.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:51.840]  But they've got to pass laws saying you don't bring little kids to naked sex shows or kids
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.640]  are allowed if somebody wants to be misgendered or is misgendered.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.360]  I mean, this is such an assault.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:03.000]  Joss Allen Jender joins us, 16-year-old Catholic high school student from Canada who was arrested
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.200]  Monday, February 6th, and reportedly twice he can confirm that after being suspended for
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.680]  protesting his transgender people's use of bathrooms and saying there's only two genders.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.200]  The high school junior tweeted that Ontario police arrested him and charged him after
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.520]  he attempted to attend a class in violation of exclusion order following his suspension
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.400]  earlier the school year.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.000]  Josh, a born-again Christian, was hit with a suspension for allegedly organizing protests
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.680]  at a school against biological males and girls' bathrooms and arguing in class that God created
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.040]  two unchangeable genders.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:42.120]  Sir, we salute you, we support you, we thank you, you are the Rosa Parks of the 21st century.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.400]  I'm gonna try to shut up, give you the floor to describe what happened, what you're witnessing,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.600]  and where this is all going.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600]  Thank you so much.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.200]  Yeah, thank you for having me on.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.440]  Well, just start at the beginning and just tell us.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.960]  Yeah, so the video you're playing there on the screen, that was footage from my second
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.800]  arrest.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:09.560]  So the first one happened after I had spoken out in my school about female students who
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.280]  had addressed me and were quite concerned and disturbed by males who were using their
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.280]  washrooms.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.440]  This was a topic that as a young Christian man, I felt an obligation to speak out about,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.940]  so I did.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:29.600]  And I was suspended twice, excluded from my high school twice, and then eventually arrested
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.720]  and removed from the school.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:37.600]  Yeah, this all, this all, I've now been charged for trespassing at my school.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:46.840]  And I was then arrested a second time on two days later in Ottawa, the protest I had organized
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.840]  outside of the National Arts Center in Ottawa, against a Drake Queen story hour.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.720]  And let's be clear, they're arresting people for protesting, corporately funded drag queen
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.960]  pedo hours, and I mean, Canada is a tyranny, this is incredible.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:10.240]  Yeah, so at that National Arts Center, I actually got to go inside and see it was completely
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.520]  inappropriate it was happening, but we communicated with police liaison, they agreed that we could
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.640]  be able to have a side walk for the protest that day.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.920]  And after I was assaulted by counter protesters, the police dragged me out, threw me onto the
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:31.360]  street and they arrested, they ended up arresting myself and my brother for continuing to quote
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.840]  scripture and give the gospel over a megaphone.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.800]  And yeah, that's that's the footage you're seeing from the second arrest there.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.760]  What are the enabling laws I know Trudeau is still using for the trucker protests, a
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:50.800]  national emergency, it was supposed to only be in the capital there, but now that's ongoing.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.360]  What powers, what authoritarian, totalitarian powers are they claiming to arrest you for
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.080]  reading scripture?
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:03.960]  Yeah, so they actually the first arrest, which was the most significant one, they, they claimed
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:10.840]  it was trespassing, I was at my own high school, and they told me I was being excluded
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:17.720]  for what I had expressed my I got in contact with Liberty Coalition Canada, they're funding
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:23.720]  my lawsuit, and I informed them that I would be attending school and I would continue to
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:29.480]  adhere to my Christian beliefs, and in response to that the school informed me that I was excluded.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.560]  I felt this was unlawful and discriminatory, so I decided to attend school, and within
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.680]  a few minutes I was arrested, and put in the back of the cruiser and drove away.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.240]  And I know you say that's the most substantive charge, but for me, you protesting outside
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.640]  an art center, where little children are brought in to watch men dress around half naked, I
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:54.120]  mean, to me, that's the big one, I know the charges aren't as long a prison sentence,
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.200]  but to me, that is like, you're not even at the school, you're protesting an event, you're
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.160]  not allowed to protest in Canada?
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:07.400]  Yeah, apparently not, we've seen the trucker convoy and any protests really since then,
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.240]  they don't take too kindly to our freedom of sound.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.360]  So the leftists can wave their flags and want access to children sexually, and pushing,
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.760]  mutilating them, they're all allowed to protest and yell and scream, but you're not allowed
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.760]  to.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:26.240]  Yeah, no, I'm not, because it's one thing when a totalitarian country bans all protests,
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:32.840]  but when they selectively do it, that's the highest level of suppression of speech.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:39.920]  So now you can go to Liberty Coalition Canada website, and you'll be able to find a petition
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:47.120]  you can sign to vocalize your support for me, and yeah, hopefully we're going to be
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.840]  using that in a fairly substantial announcement that's coming up.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.720]  Okay, so folks will find that on Twitter at officialjosh underscore A, or give us the URL
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.440]  again for folks to sign the petition, we'll come back and talk about taking action and
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:04.560]  fighting this, because you're now fighting this, and we'll discuss that.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]  Sure, yeah.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.080]  So, for the petition, it's libertycollectioncanada.com, and then for my personal website, it's
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:18.680]  savecanada.army, and then you get, like you said, my Twitter handles at officialjosh underscore
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.680]  A.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.520]  Well, Josh, you've got a great bearing, and I bet your parents are proud of you.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.520]  You give me hope for the future, my friend.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520]  Thank you.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.480]  Well, we got another segment, a couple more coming up if you've got time, but just what
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.400]  else do you want to add to the viewers?
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.720]  Yeah, I mean, it's time for us to stand up.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.560]  I'm an American citizen as well, so I know there's issues going on in the States, they're
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.720]  very similar to this, and it's obviously not just Canada.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:51.320]  I've started my, or I'm now running my own organization called Save Canada here, and
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.800]  got a bunch of young people that have my back, and we're together trying to make as much
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.200]  change as we can.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:04.000]  So, one step you can take is go sign our petition, and that's going to help us a lot.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.160]  But yeah, it's time for not just the adults, but it's time for our youth to stand up and
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160]  do something.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.680]  Our beliefs, our freedom of expression, our freedom of religion, our freedom of assembly,
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.400]  everything is under attack.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:23.000]  The woke mob is stronger than it's ever been, and the more we resist, the faster we get
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.120]  out of this.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.680]  And I know a lot of young people think their voices aren't powerful, but they wouldn't
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.320]  be arresting me and trying to silence me if my voice wasn't powerful, and I'm just another
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  high school student.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:38.520]  And you are the blood of victory here, and I don't mean that to butter you up, it's true.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.520]  You're not taking this and backing down, you're a building organization, you're standing up,
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.360]  you're using their attacks as an example to build energy and be a leader.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.040]  This is victory.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.800]  When the left bullies and intimidates an attack, we don't roll over and die, we fight back.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.600]  We get stronger, they get weaker.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.600]  Stay right there.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.600]  Man, this guy's got me fired up.

[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.800]  This is an information war.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:10.600]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:17.360]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.680]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.120]  them, but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products

[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.920]  time you keep us on air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.080]  world order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.920]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.640]  We're going over the top, but right now is the critical juncture, so please go to infowarsstore.com

[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.680]  company.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.200]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:13.320]  I contribute with like so many, uh, else do their so many wonderful doctors far and away.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:20.320]  The most popular product is Dr. Vanda Waters detoxification supplement that features natokinase.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.720]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.280]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.280]  This is very important.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.160]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.280]  the vaccines.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.560]  People are lower with the spike protein.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.640]  I don't feel well.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.680]  This is a potential solution.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.320]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.320]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.960]  Isn't it interesting?
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:51.920]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.640]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640]  it's important.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.280]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:08.280]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:06.760]  Our guest connection just dropped as we came back live, Josh Alexander.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.680]  But wow, what a story, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.680]  Absolutely insane.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.320]  This is the tyranny of the left.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.880]  We're trying to pass similar laws here.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.760]  Hell, California did pass a law that if you misgender somebody, you see a big ol' fat
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.760]  dude with a beard.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.240]  You say, hello sir, at the cash register.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:29.520]  That's some of the cases they have and then you get arrested.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.040]  I mean this is mind control.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.400]  This is an attack on language.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.960]  This is them making you submit to every one of their whims.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.800]  Let's play a clip of the Toronto Star as a TV program.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800]  I'm talking about this.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.960]  Here it is.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:48.960]  On a normal Thursday morning in February, Josh Alexander will be getting ready for school,
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.560]  but not today.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.720]  Yeah, no, I'm getting ready for Tucker Carlson.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:59.600]  But there is a way for Josh Alexander to get back in the class, but it's something he's
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.440]  not prepared to do.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:09.480]  I would have to basically agree to a multitude of conditions that are contrary to my religious
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.480]  beliefs.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:18.120]  I would basically have to recognize that anybody can identify as a Christian, that anybody
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:23.920]  else must identify them or address them in that manner.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:30.560]  And I'm also not allowed to be allowed in here, I'm just trying to, I wouldn't be allowed
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.040]  to speak, I wouldn't be allowed to be in my classes.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:36.440]  There's not really a way for me to go back.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:42.680]  In the classroom, Josh Alexander feels that he's talking about the overall issue and
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.960]  not the individuals.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:51.480]  As a born again Christian and as somebody with freedoms in a country that has freedoms,
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:57.600]  Josh Alexander has some very strong views on this subject, but there are views that
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.080]  many people don't want to hear.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:06.040]  Everything first erupted in the class debate and that's what you basically have, that's
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.160]  what I said.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:15.560]  And then it went beyond that over time, where it got to teachers like encouraging, defending
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:21.440]  male breastfeeding and stuff, and I ultimately called that pedophilia.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:26.480]  And that was another allegation against me, but the main one is that I said there's two
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.600]  genders and there's trans students in the class, but they're that low.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.800]  This teacher in Oakville, the wearing the prosthetic, what are your thoughts on that?
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.640]  That teacher's allowed to teach and was in yesterday, and you're not allowed to go to
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]  school.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:45.520]  There's actually several meetings going around, they know the internet, showing me getting
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:52.760]  arrested and then it shows the Oakville teacher that's standing there, and they're allowed
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:58.960]  in the school and I'm not, that's pretty ridiculous, they're allowed to have an influential role
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.440]  and I'm not allowed to go there just to simply get an education.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.000]  That problem's going to follow me no matter what school I go to, however I'm done, but
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.240]  my goal isn't to pre-shade it anybody, I'm just, like you said, a student that wants
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.400]  to go to school, but I'm not going to compromise my religious beliefs.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.880]  My issue was never with the individual trans student, in fact, I have some sense.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:24.640]  Okay, so Josh Alexander's here, he doesn't hate anybody, but he has a right to protest
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.080]  men being in girls' bathrooms, and that's what he is doing, and we've got him with us.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.080]  So Josh, let's go back to the start, how this began, you were talking about it with the
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.840]  local newspaper slash TV program there, but describe your thought crime here, and then
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.400]  how they extended to you protesting outside of Drag Queen Pito time, and arrested you
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.920]  again, so how did this start?
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.600]  Yeah, so I was always in the public board, well actually, sorry, I was homeschooled for
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:58.200]  my elementary years, and then in high school I was at the public board, and I actually
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.640]  became fairly well-known for organizing student walkouts and solidarity with the Freedom Convoy.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.440]  Myself and my organization, Safe Canada, did that, and it spread all across Canada.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.240]  But after that I was suspended so many times, I just decided to switch to the Catholic board,
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.400]  and about a month into my time there I was informed by concerned female students, and
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:24.440]  I decided to take it to the administrators, and inform them that there are in fact female
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.240]  students that are concerned that male students are using their washrooms.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:35.520]  So I just continued bringing it up to the principal, and they still ignored me, I even
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:41.640]  brought a female student with me, and they continued to just ignore it, and they didn't
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.000]  pay me any attention.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.600]  So at that point I decided to organize a protest outside my high school, and two days leading
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:55.800]  up to the protest they suspended me indefinitely, and said it was because of bullying or something.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.920]  Yeah, they brought up fake allegations of bullying, and most of it was just for saying
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:05.500]  that there's only two genders, and then backing it with my religious beliefs, and just basically
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.500]  pathology.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:12.360]  But yeah, that's where they wanted to punish me first, and I served that suspension.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:19.900]  I got in contact with the Liberty Coalition, started suing my school, and then they just
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.040]  excluded me.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.880]  I returned regardless of the exclusion because it was unlawful, and at that point they gave
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.720]  me a trespassing notice.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.280]  I waited until the trespassing notice ended, and then I returned to school again with just
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.520]  an exclusion, and at that point that's when they arrested me.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:45.880]  Well, that's all very interesting, and they used the trespassing thing as a clause, but
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:52.240]  for me, crossing the Rubicon here, Josh Alexander, is the drag queen pedo event that you protested
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.520]  being arrested there.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.960]  Talk about that, and then I know you're appealing to a body in the government, tell us about
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960]  that.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:09.080]  Yeah, so I was informed that there was a National Arts Center was going to be holding a drag
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:16.880]  queen story time, so I decided to throw together a poster with my crew, and yeah, we communicate
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.360]  with police liaison, they said we could be there, it was all good, we had an open line
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:27.720]  of communication, and it was all going fairly smoothly until we were met by a massive group
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.560]  of counter protesters.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.800]  They were physically pushed away from the doors of the building on the sidewalk where
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:42.640]  we've been protesting, and eventually assaulted me when I started giving the gospel through
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:49.880]  my megaphone, and they took my hat off, threw it on the ground, stomped it out, they assaulted
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.120]  all of us, hit us, pinned me up against the wall, they did everything they could until
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.640]  police finally came in, and they dragged us out rather than the people that were assaulting
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.680]  us, and they threw us into traffic, and then when we tried to get back on the sidewalk,
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.680]  they threw us into traffic again, and then arrested my brother for being in traffic.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:12.080]  So at that point, I tried to return to my group of protesters, and I was told by the
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:18.080]  police if I didn't stop giving the gospel on my megaphone, I would be arrested for disruption,
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:24.400]  which isn't even a real charge, but I continued to, I was quoting John 316 in my megaphone,
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.400]  and they arrested me, and put me in coughs, and held me in the cruiser for about two hours,
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.200]  and then charged me with trespassing.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:37.560]  Wow, for being on a city street, unbelievable, and again, this is the banning of the gospel,

[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.040]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:15.000]  crew at M4Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.160]  have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:27.080]  and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week, it's really just incredible,
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.320]  so for myself and the whole M4Wars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only encourage

[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.480]  spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.280]  viewers and listeners never go to M4Wars.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.800]  and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air, I know that less than 1% of
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.680]  our listeners actually go buy products at M4Wars.com, if just 1% more of you took action
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.600]  at M4Wars.com, our fighting problems will be over, please take action now.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:09.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones, I want you all to know something, Alex Jones
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.960]  was right, Alex is right about far more things wrong, Alex has been right on court over a
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:22.040]  decade, I don't care how you slice it, slice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:27.200]  was right, think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two, imagine
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:31.520]  being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades, Alex Jones called
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:38.640]  this years ago, years ago, Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second, you
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:44.600]  are one of the great thinkers of this, you are a martyr to the First Amendment, the government
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:50.240]  beers Alex Jones, that's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:32:04.120]  worldwide tyranny, AlexJonesLive.com, cover commander here with an important message to
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:11.560]  humanity, I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:21.600]  be safe, but the injection is not ready, and so I need all of you to stay indoors for the
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:30.280]  next 15 days to flatten the cans, I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:38.520]  shop at mega corporations, that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:47.960]  economy, even companies that only I own, profitable, you will then be my slaves, oh, and then
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:53.960]  you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra, it will remove your immune system,
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:33:01.280]  so you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:09.120]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:18.840]  Alright, we got one more segment of our guests, what's your news?
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:25.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:37.040]  So Josh Alexander, Canada was known as this open, free, fun country, now you get to know,
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.160]  he follows the whole global agenda, he says he wants to censor people, what's happening
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.640]  in your country?
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:49.760]  Yeah, it's chaotic, like I was mentioning earlier, I was quite involved with the freedom
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.600]  convoy and the student aspect of that.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:07.880]  I saw firsthand the violence that the state will take to subdue civil disobedience, and
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:15.120]  it's crazy how Canada, which is a country that supposedly recognizes the supremacy
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:23.880]  of God and recognizes our fundamental freedom of religion.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:29.680]  Like just yesterday, I was arrested in the shadow of the war memorial, a monument to
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.920]  those who have died and sacrificed for the freedoms that we enjoy in this country, and
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:40.040]  there I am, my dad was a veteran as well, and I'm being arrested right in front of it for
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.040]  street preaching.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.440]  Wow, so you just got arrested again, I mean, wow.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:50.120]  Well, no, that's where the National Arts Center was, same arrest.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.120]  Wow.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:58.680]  So who is Trudeau, I mean, he says I want to be a dictator, I want to follow the WEF,
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.600]  what a Canadian is thinking of him?
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:10.120]  He's a puppet, I mean, Canada's kind of, like Canada's fallen, it's on a drastic decline
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:16.080]  because of not just Trudeau, everybody points at Trudeau, he's terrible, I agree, but you
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.600]  got to look at our provincial and even our municipal government and just the self-censoring
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.720]  of the Canadian people, they're terrified, they're afraid to speak up, and it's going
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.440]  to cost them, people are going to regret it, so it's time for it.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.120]  Well, that was my next question, what happened to Canada because Clauss Schwab says it's
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:38.160]  the best example of a WEF UN takeover, total agenda 21, 2030, all the different leftist
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:43.600]  ideologies to be implemented, police arresting people everywhere, freedom peacefully protesting,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.080]  how do they get the cops and their unions to be so evil?
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:53.160]  Yeah, well, you say, like everybody, the stereotypical Canadian is just a polite, you know, he's
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:36:00.680]  just a polite guy, but the problem is we allow ourselves to be manipulated and used without
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:08.400]  any resistance by our government, and it's gone too far, and now we're at a point where
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.680]  anybody who speaks out is being censored and arrested and charged, they're still pastors
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:21.960]  fighting charges for simply opening their churches during the pandemic, and it's time
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.640]  that we come together as a nation and resist this.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.200]  Far too many people are divided over, like even in the church over the nomination and
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:37.480]  all these small issues when really there's a much larger issue at hand, and so I hope
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:45.760]  that maybe my voice may be heard and people could go and support my petition and stay
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.720]  tuned for our future updates, so that you're going to evolve both America and Canada together
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.400]  against this globalist takeover.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.600]  Well, as you know, she's covered your case, Tucker Carlson said, if we're going to invade
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.440]  countries and liberate them, why not invade Canada?
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.600]  It was tongue-in-cheek, but I mean, really, Canada is in the throes of tyranny because
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:12.080]  the Parliamentary system, Trudeau is able to have a minority of the votes, like 30%
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.080]  would stay in power.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:21.040]  Yeah, and it's weird when you look at the electoral map, you just see it's blue all
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:25.760]  across the map for conservatives, but then when you get to Toronto and eastern Ontario,
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:31.760]  where the majority of the city population is, it's just completely red, so he's basically
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.720]  running, he's forgotten about the rural communities and the farmers and the people that keep this
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.640]  country running, he's just catering to the large population.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.760]  Well, he hasn't just forgotten about him, he's trying to ban cows and milk farming and
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.760]  all the rest of it.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.040]  I mean, this is a takeover with police forces running over men, women, and children.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.320]  The five minutes we have left, you have the floor.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.000]  What else do you want viewers and listeners to know about the situation in Canada?
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.760]  Because, oh, that's Canada, but it's the same globalist running that agenda.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:08.040]  Yeah, well, yeah, I'm an American citizen too, and I can see America is not standing
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.400]  up in the way it should be.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.920]  America's supposed to be the land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:19.560]  I'm an avid American patriot, but I'm disappointed to see that when Canada, the country that
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.360]  I can see how weak the average person in Canada is, they refuse to stand up, and even we held
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.960]  the freedom convoy that influenced the entire world to resist.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.880]  And I don't know why America, when they were facing the same restrictions, didn't do so.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.400]  So I'm calling on both nations to stand up and wake up to what's going on, because it's
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.720]  going to be too late.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.520]  Talk about your family.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.960]  I would imagine they're proud of you.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:56.520]  Yeah, they, like I said, my dad's a veteran, so he's disappointed as well to see the freedom
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.320]  of expression and freedom of religion going down the tubes here, but they're just letting
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.360]  me work things out with my lawyer, and I'm going to continue to fight it.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.600]  How do the police behave when they take you to the police station?
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.320]  Are they proud of themselves?
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.280]  So I've actually, I've never been taken to the station.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.120]  They, in Ottawa there, they didn't really have a charge against me other than trespassing,
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.040]  so they just ended up releasing me and told me not to go back and serve me some papers.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.760]  And at school, they just, they put me in the back of the cruiser and ended up driving
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.160]  me away and releasing me to my brother with charges.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.880]  So I've never actually been to the station.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:31.880]  Wow.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:32.880]  How do you think?
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:40.080]  However they did, I was just going to say, however they did steal $600 worth of my camera
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.080]  equipment there.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.040]  They took it off me, showed it in the video there, and they never gave it back.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.040]  They're still refusing to give it back.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.040]  Wow.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.000]  They'll obviously have something to hide.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  So they never gave your camera back?
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.880]  Nope.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.880]  How do they get compliant people like this to commit?
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.000]  I mean, everybody knows in North Korea this is wrong, in China this is wrong, you know,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  in Cuba this is wrong.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.680]  How do these cops, I mean, I've seen the Canadian police all over the place really act
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.680]  horribly.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.360]  Who the hell are these people?
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.440]  Yeah, I mean, they've just manipulated them with indoctrination.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:22.080]  They truly believe that I am hateful and a threat to the majority of society, I suppose.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:27.840]  Because a multinational corporate funded drag queen time wants to sexualize three-year-olds,
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.360]  you're bad for not liking them.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.320]  Yeah, and the same with the gender dysphoria in the schools and all that.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.000]  I've spoken out against that and I've voiced my opinion on it multiple times.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.720]  My issue is not with the individual transgender student, I have sympathy for them, and I think
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.680]  they've been wronged by society, they've been wronged by their parents, and they've been
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.600]  wronged by the education system.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  They're confused.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  Yeah, they've been inducted into cult, they're victims.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.560]  Yeah, they're victims as well.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:57.600]  I mean, I'm not going to condone any one of them going into the woman's washroom, but
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:01.560]  I will still speak out against it, but I still do have sympathy for them because they have
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560]  been wronged.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.720]  It's the majority of our society that's backed down and allowed government corruption and
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:16.120]  ideology and political confusion into the education system, and that's what we're seeing.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.240]  You can look at it, look at the suicide rates in Canada amongst our youth.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.160]  It's incredible, and it's saddening.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:29.240]  Wow, Josh Alexander, Twitter, and official Josh underscore A, and how do people go sign
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]  the petition?
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:35.400]  And again, just in closing, you're appealing this to the federal government in Canada.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.400]  Tell us about that.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:43.480]  Yeah, well, I'm taking it to the Human Rights Tribunal, and my lawyer James Kitchen from
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:46.960]  Liberty Coalition Canada is going to help me do that.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:52.080]  So livepetitions.com forward slash petition, Josh dash Alexander, and that petition is
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.680]  calling for what?
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.120]  So it's just going to be right now is just a way to vocalize your support for me.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:06.480]  But, of course, on the plans we're releasing very shortly, and that's going to involve
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.480]  both countries.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.440]  Yeah, go to Liberty Coalition Canada dot com, you can sign my petition.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.320]  In closing, what's the temperature of Canada?
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.760]  It seems like it's really awake, really upset from what I'm saying.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.040]  Yeah, it's hard to tell the fence, which community you go to.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.000]  I'm currently in the most conservative writing in history, and I'm not receiving much support
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  from my community.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.080]  They're, they're pretty, I would say they're ashamed to have me in the community.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.960]  I mean, I get so many messages, I get threats, I can walk down the street.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:41.480]  And I was just in Ottawa the other day, and Antifa, all dressed in black and mask, run
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.400]  up to me, take photos of me, and then as they're walking away, they informed me that I'm going
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.680]  to regret this for the rest of my life and that they're going to ruin my life.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.880]  So, yeah, I wouldn't say I'm getting much of a positive response.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.880]  Wow.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.880]  Well, keep fighting.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.880]  You're getting a response around the world.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.880]  God bless you.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:56.880]  We will free Canada.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:26.720]  Thanks, Alexander, thank you.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.360]  Please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.920]  great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.480]  Infowarsstore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation,
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.840]  Big Red Manor at the top of Infowarsstore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.920]  fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.800]  But I thank you all for your support.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.960]  Please commit now to go to Infowarsstore.com, get great products, and make donations.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.240]  I thank you for your support, now take action.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:59.640]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.560]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.560]  band.video.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.280]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.640]  I'm going to do that right now.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.640]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.840]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.760]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760]  including myself.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.360]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.120]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.120]  Jones.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.240]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.240]  Tim Cass IRL.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:45.120]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted, because
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.440]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.240]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:55.080]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support Infowars, leave a donation
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.080]  right now.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.760]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.560]  Infowars is winning.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.320]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.080]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.160]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.240]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.240]  None of that's true.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.560]  It's all being appealed.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.760]  They want you to think Infowars is dead.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.680]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowars, we've got years and years of appeals and we
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.560]  will not be taken off the air.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.200]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.680]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:35.160]  Go to infowarstore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160]  You name it.
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.840]  They fund the Infowar and empower your life and let the globalists know their sigh up
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:40.840]  has not worked.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.520]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:48.600]  Make action at infowarstore.com today because the only people that can take us off the air
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.520]  is you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:54.280]  The majority of you have not been sidelined, but some of you have.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.280]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.440]  Go to infowarstore.com to keep us on the air.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:06.480]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:13.360]  our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:21.320]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elites' plans for covertly using
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.040]  biological weapons against all of mankind.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:31.560]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' Infowars and our audience
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:37.000]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.020]  This is why they attack us.
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.640]  This is why we need your support.
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:45.640]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:46.840]  Join the resistance.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.520]  Buy products.
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:50.120]  Donate to the cause.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.480]  Share the links.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:47:01.400]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:12.760]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:27.920]  We're covering all the big breaking news that's been unfolding the last few days with
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:33.520]  Emeril Robinson next hour on this live Friday edition, and now when Shroyer comes up, 3
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.800]  p.m. central today with the war room, then I'm going to come back and do two hours live
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.440]  from my new studios in my house.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:46.360]  You can also be someone cast on Infowars.com and AlexJonesLive.com, got some big guests,
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.520]  breaking news, and more.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.080]  I didn't know any brother was here in town, Joe Rogan tomorrow, so I'm going to get him
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.320]  on the night probably.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:56.480]  We also got Matt Baker, who was really on fire yesterday, I want to have him on commercial
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  free.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.440]  That's all tonight, 6 p.m. central.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  It's free.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.440]  It's up there.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.760]  It's AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:10.040]  Let me hit some of the real positive news in the fighting against our biology and the
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.640]  fighting against the family and the deep states, admitted plan to overturn things.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.200]  We'll do that in just a moment, but let me just say this.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:20.840]  Usually when I say a sale is going to end, it ends around the time the sale ends.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:24.480]  I have not ended this sale because, again, I've been so busy working and so busy on
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:30.120]  air and so busy doing interviews, and our inventory is so down, so low, but we've got
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:35.000]  a lot of stuff coming in in about a month, so the calories here, and just a couple months
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.040]  ago, we had gotten back into the red, but it wasn't an insurmountable amount.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.400]  It was a couple hundred thousand dollars a month we were behind.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.880]  That's the bandwidth cost, by the way, a band-up.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:46.800]  Then again, it was six, seven, eight, nine, ten million views a day.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.800]  That cost money.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.760]  Cybersecurity, the crew, legal, all of it, but the good news is, is that our deficits
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:53.760]  are not that big.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.880]  In the last month and a half, two months, listeners have really come through and put
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:04.200]  us into the black in the months we're in, but we're trying to gain money back for the
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.400]  months we lost, and I had savings.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.320]  Personally of two million dollars is a mercy backup.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:15.840]  I put 100% in, and then we had over seven million dollars of Bitcoin that we put in
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.240]  last year because we hadn't ordered enough product and supply chain breakdowns.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.120]  We were 10 million dollars behind, God literally found the number, and somebody, we don't know
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.680]  who gave it to us.
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:33.560]  So the good news is, we don't have obstacles we can't overcome, but it's really up to
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.040]  you, plus we have great products you need.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.960]  So I've got to today, and I'm coming in tomorrow, cut some new ads, talk about some of the
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:45.040]  products we're still going to have in stock, but we did our big sale, and so much of this
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.200]  stuff is almost sold out.

[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:59.560]  to go, full spectrum CBD oil, infowarstore.com, okay, so Dubb Taylor with the guest we just
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:05.720]  had on, Josh Alexander, who's an amazing 16 year old man and I'm so proud of him and
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:11.160]  what he's doing, he makes anybody proud to know there's great youth like that out there
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:17.600]  but everything you see happening in different parts of the world is targeted here, it's
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.880]  the same globalist cult and they want to end the family, they want to destabilize civilization,
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:29.360]  they want to scramble everything but how does a 16 year old or a 10 year old make a decision
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:32.800]  they're a girl, they're a boy, they're really a boy or girl, how do they make a decision
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:36.840]  to have their breasts cut off or their penis cut off or their ovaries taken out, this is
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:42.280]  to sterilization made cool, well they can't, they can't join the military, they can't buy
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:47.320]  alcohol, they can't do any of that, they can't gamble, they can't do any of these things,
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:52.000]  these vices adults can do but the government can form a relationship with them and psychologists
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.760]  and convince them outside of parental control to have their body parts cut off, so this
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:02.440]  video is on infowarstore.com, hope everybody shares it, watch, activists confronts Tennessee
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:08.320]  Democrat at hearing on sexual mutilation of children, conservative activist Matt Walsh
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:13.480]  who's made a great film, does great work, spoke at a Tennessee legislative hearing objecting
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:19.640]  to children being provided transgender medications and medical procedures, some as young as seven
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.720]  and he just made a great point here it is.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:29.960]  Thank you Mr. Walsh, I found it interesting one of our people testified today that they
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:35.560]  had their gender firming surgery at 16 and I know you in former comments mentioned this
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.440]  on your blog, at about 16 you're an adult who's mature and can make decisions, you're
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:44.960]  that at 16, I don't care what anybody says, even going so far as to say, you know, 16
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:51.200]  people, even if you're 16 you should be married and could be pregnant or should be pregnant,
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:59.960]  so I'm curious if 16 is an adult in your view, why does this bill have the minor defined
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:00.960]  as 18?
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:08.080]  Yeah, that's a hit piece you took from media matters, from something when I was a radio
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:14.320]  host 13, 14 years ago, my early 20s, it's also not an accurate reflection of what I actually
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:21.760]  said, I was talking about the fact that people tended to marry young historically and that's
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:28.680]  all that that was about, how does that relate to this subject?
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:33.200]  Just curious to your definition of if you feel like people are adults at 16 should
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:39.320]  Well people are adults at 18, but actually your brain is not fully developed until you're
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.680]  25, so we should be having a conversation about whether we should even be doing these
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:50.760]  surgeries to people at 18, but certainly before 18, it's absurd, I mean do you think that
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:58.440]  a 16 year old can meaningfully consent to having their body parts removed?
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:06.840]  Do you, no?
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:17.160]  We do not, yeah we ask the questions, it's not, I'm going to represent if you're recognized.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:23.320]  This is a game the left plays, when I've sat on air for 20 years plus, when I got the courage
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:29.680]  up to admit what I'd done, that I had funded when I was younger and I believed the lies
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.080]  that it wasn't a human yet and all the rest of it, I repented of it, I was wrong, that
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:40.040]  I financed some abortions with girlfriends and that God touched my heart and I repented
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.840]  of it and I'm still guilty of it, that God has reprimanded me in the blood of Jesus and
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.360]  they always write articles, there's been hundreds of them that I've seen, probably more than
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:55.240]  I didn't see, Jones is a hypocrite, he paid for abortions, but now he's against them,
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:00.720]  no, just because somebody made some comments that they now disagree with 15 years later,
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.480]  they're allowed to change your opinion, so the left's like, why would he make this statement
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:13.520]  in front of his right wing audience, that he killed his children, how does that make
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.480]  them like him when they're against abortion, no, they're Christians, they've done things
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.160]  wrong too, they understand like King David changing your heart and repeating and being
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.720]  sad for what you've done and I've told those stories because I want women to know that
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.600]  have been part of this and men that have supported it who feel guilty instead of hardening your
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.280]  heart and supporting it, admit you're wrong and get on your knees to God and be cleansed
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:41.960]  of this because there is an afterlife, there is interdimensional entities that we are eternal,
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:48.840]  you will be with your children that you killed as long as you go to the right side and they
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:55.160]  will forgive you, this is real and I would die in an instant for my children right now,
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:00.920]  I cannot believe that I ever got tricked and fooled into that by the system and I'm angry
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:08.200]  about it, so I'm admitting I've been wrong, I'm admitting I'm sorry, I'm saying I want
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:15.280]  to do better, I seek your face God, I repent, I want to be cleansed, I want to be sanctified,
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:23.200]  I don't want to be like this and the left lasting, he had abortions and he's a hypocrite,
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:29.240]  you know you're a hypocrite, the idea that somebody like a murderer in prison can't
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.840]  get reformed and say it was wrong what they did, the idea that you can't reform is a leftist
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.400]  satanic lie, I don't care what you've done, how horrible it is, if you can still repent
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.240]  and you still feel the Holy Spirit and you still want to be good just like on the cross
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:49.280]  with Christ and the thief of the murderer, you will be sanctified.

[01:59:51.080 --> 02:00:04.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:11.040]  No surprise winning journalist Seymour Hirsch, relying on unnamed national security sources,
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:17.560]  recently published an article on his sub-stack about the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:24.640]  Two pipelines known as Nord Stream 1 provided Western Europe with cheap Russian gas for
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:26.200]  more than a decade.
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:31.760]  These pipelines were seen by NATO as a threat to Western dominance, profits were shared
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:37.200]  with the Russian government and provided up to 45% of their annual budget.
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:43.920]  A second pair called Nord Stream 2 had been built but were not yet operational.
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.480]  NATO was concerned that as long as Europe remained dependent upon these pipelines, Germany
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:54.920]  would be reluctant to supply Ukraine with money and weapons to fight Russia.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.800]  And so the Biden administration authorized Jake Sullivan to assemble a task force with
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:06.800]  members of the Biden White House, the CIA and the Pentagon to come up with a plan for
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.320]  the destruction of the pipelines.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:15.000]  The operation was run by Victoria Newland, Anthony Blinken and Jake Sullivan.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.760]  The Navy proposed using a submarine to assault the pipeline directly.
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.080]  The Air Force proposed dropping bombs with delayed fuses and the CIA argued that whatever
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:31.960]  was done it would have to be covert because if the attack was traced to the U.S. then
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:34.320]  it would be an act of war.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:41.800]  In early 2022, right after the CIA reported to Sullivan that they had a plan, both Victoria
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:47.880]  Newland and President Biden publicly threatened to bring an end to Nord Stream 2.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:55.120]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:07.000]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.760]  there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:15.920]  According to the source, this public announcement meant that blowing up the pipeline no longer
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:21.560]  could be considered a covert option and that there was no longer a legal requirement to
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.600]  report their plans to Congress.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.560]  The Americans partnered with Norway, who had their own motivations for the destruction
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.160]  of the Nord Stream pipelines, which would allow them to sell more of their own natural
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:36.240]  gas to Europe.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:42.400]  In March of 2022, members of the team flew to Norway to meet with the Norwegian Secret
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.640]  Service.
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:49.720]  The Norwegian Navy decided on a spot in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, a few miles
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:56.480]  off Denmark's Bornholm Island, where the divers operating from a Norwegian Alta class
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:04.440]  mine hunter would plant C-4 charges with concrete protective covers on the four pipelines.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:10.560]  Divers were chosen from the U.S. Navy's Diving and Salvation Center in Panama City, which
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:16.200]  specializes in training deepwater divers to use C-4 explosives because they were Navy
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:22.880]  only and not members of America's Special Operations Command, whose covert operations
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:25.440]  would need to be reported to Congress.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.760]  The mission was secretly embedded into an annual training exercise already scheduled
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:40.680]  for June of 2022, known as Baltic Operations 22, or Baltops 22, wherein the Panama City
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:46.920]  divers would place C-4 explosives with a 48-hour timer attached.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:53.240]  But the White House then worried that triggering the explosion within two days of the well-publicized
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:59.960]  training exercise would make it obvious that America was responsible, and so it was decided
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:05.960]  that the C-4 would be triggered by a sonar buoy later dropped by plane.
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:13.360]  The buoy would emit a sequence of unique low-frequency tonal sounds to trigger the explosives.
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:22.400]  On September 26, 2022, a Norwegian Navy P-8 surveillance plane dropped the sonar buoy.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:28.920]  The signal spread underwater, and a few hours later, the high-powered explosives were triggered
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.760]  and three of the four pipelines were put out of commission.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:38.000]  According to Hirsch's national security sources, it was a beautiful cover story.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:44.200]  It was a covert operation that placed experts in the field and equipment that operated
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.920]  on a covert signal.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:49.720]  The only flaw was the decision to do it.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:05:03.800]  Coming for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:06.800]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.640]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:09.640]  us.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:15.120]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.680]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:23.120]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:27.600]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.520]  For myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:35.920]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:36.920]  us.
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:37.920]  I know you spread the word.
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:39.400]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:40.400]  Keep doing it.
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:44.920]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great
[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:48.800]  products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keep us on air.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:53.200]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:57.280]  If just one percent more of you took action at InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.280]  will be over.
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:23.280]  Take action now.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:29.800]  Well there's so many amazing pro-truth, pro-freedom, pro-America talk show hosts and reporters
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.800]  and analysts out there.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:34.680]  One of my favorites is Emerald Robinson, and of course she was a former White House
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:38.080]  correspondent for Newsmax and OAN, refused to be censored.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.200]  She's currently the host of Absolute Truth with Emerald Robinson on Frankspeech.com.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:47.280]  You can find her on Twitter at Emerald Robinson, again at Twitter, and she's with us to cover
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:50.320]  all the food processing plans and things that keep blowing up.
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:54.000]  And again, I like Jim Jordan on the service, but he took a bunch of big tech money, he's
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.880]  been soft on Google, and is he really doing all he can do at these hearings?
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:02.840]  She wants to take him to the woodshed.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:05.640]  I think it's important that we hold their feet to the fire.
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:08.760]  We'll talk about the pipeline blowing up.
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:14.400]  Joe Biden, just the whole war in Ukraine, so much more with Emerald Robinson.
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.640]  Emerald, great to have you.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.880]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:22.400]  Why don't we get into the subcommittee on the weaponization of the FBI, because I think
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.800]  there's a lot to unpack there.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:27.640]  While there's lots of good downbites, as there always are, there's so much more going on
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:28.640]  behind the scenes.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.760]  And I take him to the woodshed.
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.760]  I don't know if I go that far yet.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:38.840]  The jury's still out on how Jim Jordan chairs this subcommittee, but I will tell you, Alex,
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:45.480]  I would have liked to have seen some different witnesses yesterday, I know from sources,
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:49.320]  and actually from Kyle Serafan, who was one of the FBI whistleblowers.
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.480]  He came on my show yesterday.
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:55.680]  There were some actual whistleblowers who could have given their first-hand accounts,
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:08:00.480]  right, and been much more powerful witnesses out of the gate, because as you and I know,
[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:04.640]  on the first day of a highly anticipated committee, the first hearing is when you're probably
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:06.680]  going to get most of your eyeballs, right?
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:10.760]  So I think it'd be much stronger to put those whistleblowers out there.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:14.560]  Some of them were willing to go public, despite the kind of backlash they get.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.720]  They thought it was important.
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:20.720]  They were slated to be in the public testimony yesterday, and then at the last minute, they
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.480]  were moved to private testimony.
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:31.040]  We haven't gotten any word back from committee members on why that decision was made.
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:38.280]  And so we hope to, because we think it's important to explain why that decision was made, given
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:39.280]  that...
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:40.280]  Absolutely.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:43.840]  The question is, why didn't Jim Jordan bring forward the slated, smoking-gun whistleblowers
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.720]  which would have been 10 times more powerful?
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:51.560]  Is he backpedaling because he's getting big tech money?
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:55.520]  I think that yesterday, that raised the questions even more, and there were a lot of questions
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:59.760]  heading into yesterday, from people in D.C. who...
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:05.040]  There are some good people in D.C., Alex, so you feel like there's none left.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:10.240]  There are people who have been trying to help the committee and help them organize it in
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.980]  a way that they can be the most effective, tell them what to look for, and how to actually
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:21.480]  approach the misconduct of the FBI, bring it out, and then how you deal with it once
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.080]  you prove it.
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:28.600]  And I don't think that they were feeling very hopeful headed into yesterday based on their
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:32.120]  conversations and then the change of witnesses.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:33.440]  So they're not quite there yet.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:41.400]  I also know that they haven't staffed up really enough to deal with the portfolio of material
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:44.960]  that they're going to have to deal with because it's not just the censorship, right?
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:52.800]  It's not just targeting parents who spoke out about CRT or genderqueer books and libraries.
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:58.560]  It's a whole host of issues to tackle, and that requires a lot of help.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:59.560]  I agree.
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.960]  There are researches and investigative journalists, what has the FBI and Justice Department really
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.960]  done?
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:08.480]  I mean, they're not just saying that conservative Catholics are terrorists and secret memos
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.480]  now coming out.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:12.080]  They're not just manipulating the election results.
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:18.600]  I mean, they are interfaced with old media big tech against the American people.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:20.080]  Yeah, they are.
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:25.920]  I mean, I feel like you look back and the term, the term, Pretorium Guard from the Old
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.720]  Roman days really comes to mind when we're thinking about our FBI and CIA because basically
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.840]  with the kind of censorship that they're doing and the interference, I believe in the elections,
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:42.080]  the way that they're targeting average American citizens for ideology, they're really the
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:44.440]  ones running the country.
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:48.320]  And I think Congress has to take a stand and try to take some ground back, and that's going
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:52.440]  to be a really hard job because one thing I've discovered since November 3rd, 2020, and even
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:58.800]  before then, it became very clear to me in 2018 that an administration really doesn't
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.640]  have control of D.C. or the country, right?
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.080]  They can make some suggestions, but it's really the bureaucracy and then the intelligence
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.320]  community that has the most day as to what happened, especially when it comes to foreign
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:10.320]  policy.
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:21.280]  And you saw the headbutting that went on when Trump tried to change U.S. foreign policy.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:24.880]  They were quick to try to take him out, and that's how you got the Ukrainian impeachment.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:27.560]  Well, that's right.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:31.440]  Trump's not perfect, but what he did was anger the deep state and make them come out of the
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:32.940]  open.
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:38.400]  And we saw that what he tried to do, they just ignored showing it's a bipartisan deep state
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.840]  and that's what you're exposing.
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:42.880]  And so really, is Congress just ceremonial?
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.280]  Are they vestigial?
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:48.040]  Are they just a clown show or are they going to stand up like the church committee did
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:52.800]  in the 70s and reassert the people's control by our elected representatives over the side
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:55.200]  of control permanent deep state?
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:01.400]  Yeah, and I think that this is the opportunity to show it, to show that they actually can
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:07.840]  cause some effect and hold accountability to the institutions and take that ground of freedom
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:09.600]  for the American people.
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:11.280]  It will be this committee, right?
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.400]  To some degree, the oversight committee that's working very hard on also the censorship, but
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.120]  also as Congressman Andy Big said on my show today, he's particularly trying to tackle
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:27.240]  the surveillance that both you and I know a lot about the FBI overreach and surveillance
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:32.920]  of regular American people that just seems to increase all the time.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.720]  What can we do to get Jim Jordan to do his job?
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:41.040]  Because I'm not just here to criticize people for fun, but I know when you're real, like
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:45.600]  James O'Keefe and Veritas with that huge coup two weeks ago, now notice he's been removed.
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:48.720]  I mean, I know what it's like, we're actually really changing things that come after you.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:50.320]  You've had that happen to you as well.
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:55.160]  And so Jim Jordan, it seems like it's no Mitt Romney, but he's also no George Washington.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:56.680]  He's trying to play both sides.
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:00.400]  Well, I can tell you that they respond to pressure.
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:06.760]  So if you keep asking questions, the office gets uncomfortable enough to do something.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:11.120]  So the case in point when, remember in the lead up to the midterm elections and they
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:15.000]  kept talking about this group of whistleblowers, Jim Jordan was out there on the media all
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  the time.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.760]  He was writing letter after letter to the Biden Department of Justice seeking answers
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:25.640]  and saying he was going to get accountability, that he was going to protect these whistleblowers.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:32.080]  Well, after the midterm, the ones I was speaking to, so they just didn't hear anything anymore
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.800]  from Jim Jordan's office.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.440]  They weren't even hearing from his staffers other than when they were attacked, you know,
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:40.000]  or say something and say, oh, okay, yeah, we'll get back with you, but really didn't.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.400]  So once we started asking Jim Jordan's office why they hadn't been in contact, did they
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.480]  plan to get in contact with them?
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:50.080]  They're saying you're not in contact when we started reporting that on our show.
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:56.640]  Well, surprise, surprise, Jim Jordan's office reaches out to said whistleblowers and starts
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.920]  having conversation.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:05.880]  And one of the things that policy people in DC who are on the right side of things and
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.720]  who really care about our Constitution and American people are super concerned about
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.960]  the chipping away at the Constitution.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:19.240]  They also know that Jim Jordan is someone though he's hesitant, you can apply pressure
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:20.240]  to you.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:25.880]  So if you keep asking questions, you keep publicly reporting exactly what's going on and don't
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:33.000]  get caught up into the sensationalism of good soundbite, you can kind of shift him in the
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.080]  right direction to actually do the right thing.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:38.440]  Well, that was my next question.
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:42.000]  If you have smoking on whistleblowers, that's what you cover.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.040]  You don't just show a few emails and let them lie about it.
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.080]  Are they planning to bring the whistleblowers forward even though they interviewed him privately?
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:51.080]  Why haven't they brought him forward?
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.800]  That remains to be seen.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:53.800]  We don't know.
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:57.040]  And that's something we're asking Jim Jordan's office about, along with other members of
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.840]  the committee now.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:03.240]  From how I understand the committee structure, while Dan Bishop does have a certain amount
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.440]  of power, it is still really Jim Jordan's baby.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:10.160]  There was some hope among some people who were trying to help them structure the committee
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.560]  that Dan Bishop would have a little more power than he seems to have and that Jim Jordan
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:21.080]  was sort of just sign off on the subpoenas, right, as the chair, but as the subchair that
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:23.240]  Dan Bishop would really be the one running it.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:25.680]  It doesn't seem that they're there yet.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.640]  So we're asking, why have it?
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.480]  Why didn't you put them out there first and all, and when will you, if they're willing
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.280]  to go public, why just do it as private testimony?
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:42.000]  Because I think everyone can agree on, and if you look at any polling, right, from real
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:48.800]  pollsters like Chris Mustad, even Democrat, Democrat voters want transparency.
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:52.400]  They just want to see what's behind the curtain, instead of hearing talking.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:53.400]  That's right.
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:54.400]  Emerald Robinson, stay right there.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.480]  We'll come back more and talk about this.
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:02.080]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow Info Warriors here in the United
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.280]  States and around the world.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:08.880]  We are so excited to announce Info Wars MD.

[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.760]  to support Info Wars and keep us on the air.

[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:04.040]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:09.520]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:10.520]  world.
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:16.120]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:17.120]  deserve the credit.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.040]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Info Wars are the real
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:24.600]  reason you've had the success.
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  had.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:36.400]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:40.360]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:43.560]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:49.200]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.080]  now because we are over the target and this streak is happening.
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:57.720]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:01.320]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:09.480]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:12.960]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.840]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:22.520]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:26.280]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:29.800]  Maybe in like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:32.840]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:33.840]  Years ago.
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.680]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.160]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:42.600]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:45.920]  The government, ears, Alex Jones.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:53.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  AlexJonesLive.com.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.040]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:04.040]  company.
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:07.520]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:12.280]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:17.800]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vanda Watter's detoxification supplement
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.640]  that features natokinase.
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:22.080]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:27.640]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.560]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:33.640]  the vaccines.
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:36.000]  People are lower with the spike protein, they don't feel well.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.040]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:40.680]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:43.680]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:45.280]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.280]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:55.560]  Thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:20:00.360]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:09.680]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:25.400]  Well, investigative journalist is News Anchor, Emerald Robinson is almost the rest of the
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:30.280]  hour and I've got a lot of questions for everyone to finish up with these hearings.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:33.520]  Now, powerfully they already are, imagine how much more powerfully it would be if Jim
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:37.560]  Jordan wasn't, I think, soft peddling things, wasn't that about the Veritas coup that's
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:38.560]  happening?
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:42.360]  We're going to get into all of these hundreds and hundreds of food processing plants blown
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:47.240]  up, burned down, statistically the insurance companies admit that this has got to be most
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:49.840]  of it being carried out by somebody.
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:55.320]  Big picture though, a million foot view about the world today and what you see.
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:00.360]  I see a big awakening, but I see the system only increasing its tyranny in response.
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:06.360]  What is your view just as a human being about the world today?
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:09.640]  My view, I absolutely agree with you.
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:14.440]  I saw that ramp up really in the Trump years, because Trump's greatest legacy to me will
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:18.400]  always be the great awakening that he evoked.
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:22.600]  People became more aware of how corrupt our institutions were, how it was affecting their
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:26.840]  everyday lives, the people they thought that they could trust, they could not.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:32.960]  That's only accelerated, but as you said, in response, the system, the DC bureaucracy,
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:38.520]  the DC swamp, the globalist, the global institutions have all ramped up their plan.
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:42.760]  In fact, remember they used to talk about 2050 and during the Trump years, this whole
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:46.920]  zero going zero carbon has been moved up to 2030.
[02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:52.520]  You can really feel that pressure when you're in Washington DC, and especially as I cover
[02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:58.760]  the Biden White House, Alex, you could almost sense the panic, right?
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:03.720]  Because they had so quietly been doing this, and for decades, they played the law game
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:07.320]  and infiltrated the institutions, but then when people were finally paying attention
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:10.440]  and made it harder to do, and they knew their timeline was shorter, and they're just moving
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:15.440]  so fast and so hard, and so we see these foods processing plant fires.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:19.920]  We see the forced indoctrination of our children in schools, despite the parents going and
[02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:23.240]  screaming and actually fighting this.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:29.920]  It seems like the system is just doing everything it can to crush the will of the people.
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:34.320]  Cloward and Piven, they know we're waking up, so they're accelerating, they're already
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:39.320]  behind schedule plan, but it only seems to, again, paradoxically wake more people up.
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:40.600]  So how do you see that ending?
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:45.400]  I mean, this is a wild time right now.
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:49.280]  I don't know, and that's probably the question I get asked the most, Alex, whether I go
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:53.560]  into a family gathering, or whether someone sees me out in public and knows me, or whether
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:23:00.480]  it's my kindergarten teacher, it's the question I get asked, and honestly, I don't know.
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:05.560]  I just try to cover the events as honestly as I can, so people are aware of what is
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:13.320]  going on, but if things don't change soon, I'm not optimistic, I would say how it ends,
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:20.400]  but I'm Christian, so I always have my faith in the Lord, and I do what I can, but they're
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:21.400]  still the local level.
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.560]  This is what I tell people, if you're feeling overwhelmed, I think you can understand that
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:30.920]  at the local level, there's still an ability to affect change, a little bit harder to mess
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:34.320]  with the elections there, and people have to be more involved than they have.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:38.360]  People have been so put in place in over the last few decades, thinking that good people
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:42.920]  were largely in charge overall, I mean, they always felt this system was somewhat rigged,
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:46.360]  but they felt a little bit safe because they were feeding their families, and they could
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:51.040]  go buy a home and buy gas for their car, but as that changes, they're getting a little
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:56.520]  more activated, and you can go get involved in it, you can volunteer, and I think the
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.080]  school board wins in Florida and really across the country.
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:04.400]  There was some major slipping of school boards, and I think that's a great example, and I
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:09.720]  talked to Ryan Gerdeski of the 1776 PAC who was responsible for a lot of that, and I
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:15.280]  asked Ryan, is this just a school board phenomenon? Can you do the same thing in any local race
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:19.120]  across the country, board of commissioners, whatever? He said, yeah, it could be emulating.
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:24.080]  He said, I was just focused and was funded to focus on school boards, but you could really
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:26.240]  replicate this plan at any level.
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:31.280]  Exactly. The moral of the story is when good people take action, we're unstoppable, but
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:36.040]  how do you get the public to realize they have all the power?
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:40.360]  I keep saying it, and I try to think, every time I do a broadcast and we talk about all
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:46.240]  the problems, I always try to talk about what is the solution, because I think people, it
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:49.640]  could be so easy for everyone to throw out their hands right now and say, well, it's
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:55.000]  over. It's just going to hell in a handbasket. There's nothing I can do about it, but I think
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:00.400]  as outside of the mainstream media, we have to be aware that people can feel that way
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:05.440]  if we just talk about the doom and gloom every day without talking about, well, what are
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:09.560]  real solutions to fix it? And I have great guests on as do you. And I know you're very
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:14.320]  proactive with yours as well and talking about what's the big, and I think more people have
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.000]  to be doing that and talking to our neighbors and our friends and family about it. A lot
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:23.120]  of people have wanted to turn apolitical and I get that, but I think there's a soft way
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:31.080]  to encourage the people around us to be activated and not make them fearful or feel attacked.
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:36.440]  I agree with you. This whole Nord Stream thing coming out with Cy Hirsch. Folks, Cy Hirsch
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:42.920]  has won Pulitzer Prizes, Mealime Asker, back in the 60s, right through today. He has good
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:47.400]  people in the government giving him intel. So I see that as very positive that he has
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:51.160]  these sources that we know he's never lied about sources that exposed how the whole
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:55.560]  bombing happened. And Biden's trying to deny it happened, but he went on TV and said, we're
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:59.560]  going to, we're going to get rid of the pipeline. If Russia invades, we're going to, we're
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:05.720]  going to get rid of the pipeline. So to me, that shows there is a major fissure or split
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:08.840]  inside the government as well. And there's a lot of folks in our government that don't
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:13.000]  want World War Three. So that gives me hope as well.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:19.320]  I agree. And I don't think we hear about them as often, but there are. And with Cy Hirsch's
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:25.560]  sources, and that was an extremely detailed piece, right? It was fantastically written,
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:31.000]  extremely detailed. And it's such detail that it is making it very difficult for the
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  Biden administration to lie about it, even though they continue to do so. You saw the
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.760]  spokesperson for the State Department yesterday. I mean, he struggles a lot, but he really
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:47.240]  struggled in trying to counter the details presented by another reporter in Cy Hirsch's
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:55.640]  piece. And I'll tell you, I've talked to other people who have, were within the CIA and were
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:00.760]  in the military intelligence and they had sources and they say, Cy is absolutely right.
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.840]  And then you also have further confirmation. And remember, I don't know if you saw it,
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.880]  because it wasn't reported in even, you know, sort of some of the alternative media outlets
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.640]  we go to. But there was a podcast, Monkey Works, he likes to track this guy who's a former DOD
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:22.840]  contractor. He likes to track the flight patterns of commercial flights, military flights, you know,
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:30.520]  aircraft. And he had picked up a Navy aircraft that was over the area where the pipeline
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:35.960]  explosion happened at about the time that it happened. And that had, I think that was reported,
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.200]  you know, right after a couple of days after it happened. And that didn't get a ton of
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:44.600]  attention. We had covered it on the show. And then we talked about it again today with a
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:51.560]  CIA veteran and military veteran, Larry Johnson, who said that that just further confirms what
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:56.440]  Cy Hersh reported. And there's really no way to poke holes in Hersh's reporting. Now, this is one
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:01.800]  of the major problems I have with it, is that we have a media that is so willing to push us into
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:11.320]  war, right, with the narrative. And I can tell you, Alex, that, yeah, in anchors have been told,
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:15.080]  it's just like with the COVID thing. Remember when that money was coming from HHS and you weren't
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:19.480]  allowed to question the vaccines? Because the media companies were taking the money, the outlets
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:25.080]  were taking Biden administration money to basically sell the vaccines? It's the same feeling about
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.880]  Ukraine. When I talk to my friends who are still in corporate media, they're basically told, you
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:36.040]  can't say anything that counters the narrative coming out of the White House or the administration
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:41.080]  regarding Ukraine. What's really happening there, you have to go with the narrative, you can't ask
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:46.760]  if that's really the picture of the conflict on the ground. And you can't question Zelensky at all.
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:52.120]  Let's talk about that when we come back, because this facade is starting to break,
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.400]  and once it breaks, it's going to collapse. What comes next? Stay with us.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:05.080]  Well, I think what I want to say about Diet Force is amazing. I'm 45, and I have bits. I go to the
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:12.520]  gym, and I have bits that won't move. And Diet Force has helped me move those bits. Under my
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:19.160]  pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day. Man, if you're struggling to get
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:27.320]  my chip shape for the ladies, mate, Diet Force is the go. You have to get the Diet Force and have
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:36.440]  to die and just keep acting. InfowarsStore.com, X7 Diet Force. InfowarsStore.com, baby. Now on sale.

[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:13.880]  with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors. Far and away, the most popular product
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:20.760]  is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase. It's a natural proteolytic
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:27.080]  enzyme. This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:31.320]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection,
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:35.080]  and definitely with the vaccines. People are lower with the spike protein. They don't feel
[02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:40.680]  well. This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance. So does
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:47.080]  ivermectin and now natokinase. Isn't it interesting? Natural substances, in a sense, combating this
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:53.000]  man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines. Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support,

[02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:02.280]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund
[02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:07.560]  an information war. And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take
[02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:11.800]  the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this war against
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:16.920]  the New World Order by visiting InfowarsStore.com right now and taking action. I thank you for

[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:29.640]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children.
[02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:33.480]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first. These monsters are all over
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:37.160]  television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies. They're already given to pregnant women.
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:41.880]  Miscarriages are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime
[02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:48.680]  ministers after these poison shots. We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.560]  Let's do it together. And the fight starts at Infowars.com and the fight continues with your
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:33:01.800]  financial support at InfowarsStore.com. Now take action now. Leading a frontal assault on the
[02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:15.880]  lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to
[02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:23.400]  you live from the front lines of the Infowar. So you can find her daily at Frankspeech.com,
[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:28.840]  great investigative journalist Emeril Robinson and Emeril Robinson on Twitter. Emeril you got
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:32.440]  caught up in the break. You're making a point about this war, where it's going, how they create
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:37.640]  this wall of funding and censorship like came out in the documents from Twitter last year.
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:43.800]  Don't just criticize open borders or forced inoculation or lockdowns, but don't criticize the
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:50.440]  Afghan withdrawal. Don't criticize the war in Ukraine. That's all illegal to have the government
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:56.520]  involved trying to suppress citizens giving their opinion, claiming it's disinformation. It's real
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:01.880]  tyranny. And it seems like we have a Republican headline here, Republicans push to end Ukraine
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:06.040]  aid. It seems like people are starting to figure this out. And now the news coming out this pipeline
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:11.320]  was blown up. Hell, Biden bragged about it before they did it. That really seems to take the moral
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:19.160]  high ground away. Where do you see this going? I do think with this reporting by side, it's going
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:24.920]  to make it very, it's going to make it harder for the US to continue to send Ukrainian aid because
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:28.920]  clearly we've escalated the situation and made it harder. That was the time that they were supposed
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:34.360]  to be doing diplomatic talks, right? And Russia had shown a willingness to actually have diplomatic
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:40.360]  conversations. And while clearly the US was busy partnering with Norway and other nations to
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:49.720]  sabotage the pipeline, which Joe Biden actually made plausible and incompleting because he had
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:54.360]  lived to the sanctions and made it easier after President Trump had tried to make it a little
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:35:01.240]  bit harder to actually complete the pipeline. I think to particularly Republican members or
[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:07.160]  Congress are getting pressure from their constituents to stop this crazy blank check
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:12.600]  to Ukraine aid. While their constituents are at home not being able to import eggs and milk
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:18.600]  because it's so expensive and they don't have anyone to help them, our Congress and our
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:24.360]  administration and government continues to just send millions, millions over to Ukraine. And
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:30.360]  that's not sitting well with people. And when you have to focus on it this way, they kind of have
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:39.480]  to do something. I agree with you. So you're a smart lady. I want your opinion on this. How do
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:45.160]  you see this going with Russia set to basically triple the invasion they did a year ago in the
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:49.720]  next six, seven, eight days? I'm not glad Russia invaded, but I know the West started a proxy
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:53.880]  war there. I want to just see this end. Where do you think this is going?
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:36:03.400]  I'm not sure, but I would say that eventually when I talk to people and I ask the question who
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:09.480]  know much more about Russia, the Ukrainian conflict than me and diplomatic relations,
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:16.600]  Russia has gained more ground than the U.S. ever promised they would. And at some point,
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:20.840]  it just doesn't look like it's possible for Ukraine to really win the conflict,
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:25.560]  even though we're in the proxy war with them. And at some point, there's just going to have to be
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:30.280]  some diplomatic sit down. Now, you could also, I guess, take the pessimistic view and say this
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:35.080]  is going to lead us into World War III. It's going to probably go one way or the other.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:39.240]  I can't say that I really have a really good answer on that one.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:46.920]  Let's shift gears into politics. What do you make of the DeSantis-Trump battle? DeSantis set to
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:54.360]  announce very soon. Trump obviously already announced attacking DeSantis. Watching this
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:59.720]  and getting ready for the 2024 campaign, it's pretty much already started. What's your view on that?
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:10.040]  Well, I don't think it's benefiting Republicans this kind of antagonistic relationship.
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:18.120]  I have lots of questions about Governor Ron DeSantis. I want to know what his real foreign
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:24.120]  policy is because we don't know that. And he's spoken in the past as a member of Congress. He's
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:31.880]  been supportive of aid to Ukraine and some of the more establishment foreign policy initiatives.
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:37.720]  And I think that could be a real red flag. I wonder too why he is backed by the establishment.
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:45.880]  What is so different about him who has been really hard-headed as a governor considering
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:50.440]  how the establishment, the Uniparty, really wanted governor to be? He wouldn't be the one you would
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:55.960]  think they would be supporting. Why are they the Republican establishment behind him in the
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:00.120]  way that they weren't behind Donald Trump? So I think those are questions that need to be answered.
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:05.880]  Now with the former president, who I thought was a great president, I don't think it benefits him
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:11.480]  to attack Ron DeSantis at this point because he's a very popular governor and he's been very
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:15.800]  effective for his constituents of Florida. Now, would I say this is the best time for Ron to run?
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:21.240]  I don't think so. I think he should probably continue to stay King of Florida. He's a young guy
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:25.640]  and he has lots of opportunities for the future. I think it would also be great to see him and
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:31.480]  Trump work together better because they are both so popular with American people and they were both
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:36.920]  so effective in their role. The only thing that concerns me about Donald Trump and where I think
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:42.120]  he's weak is that he continues to have some people around him who do not have America First
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:47.000]  initiatives really at heart or the best interests of the American people in mind. And I think he
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:52.840]  still needs to do some personnel cleanup as he has into... Yeah, I'm really sick of Jared Kushner.
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:39:01.400]  I'm really sick of his daughter, Ivanka. I'm really sick of him still saying the shot works
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:05.960]  when everybody knows it doesn't. But I like Trump being anti-World War III. I like him
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:09.880]  controlling the border. I like him bringing jobs back. I know the deep state hates him because
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:13.560]  he doesn't listen to them. He does whatever he wants. They like DeSantis because he'll sit down
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:19.720]  at a table with the elites. Doesn't mean he totally agrees with them. But with Trump, his great asset
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:25.960]  is that he's pigheaded, but it's also his great negative. Well, and I think his foreign policy
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:30.600]  was a great asset, right? He was truly America First. If he wouldn't have been for sending all
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:35.320]  this money over to Ukraine, there would have been... I don't think Russia would have invaded
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:40.760]  if Donald Trump had been president. I think that's, you know, we all believe that. I don't think that
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:44.920]  we'd be currently in this situation. But if we had been, there'd been probably a quicker
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:59.080]  end and a more peaceful end to the conflict. I don't see when Ron DeSantis actually announces.
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:03.960]  I know the punditry is behind Ron DeSantis, right? A lot of... And I can tell you, oh, I can tell you,
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:09.080]  Alex, some of those people who were still pro-Trump and who still go on TV and talk pro-Trump all the
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.760]  time, you know, just Trump, Trump, Trump, and they talk to him on the phone all the time,
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:18.920]  they're chomping at the bit to back DeSantis. And they've already had these conversations. Major,
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:23.400]  you know, media figures who are aligned or are seen publicly to be aligned with Trump,
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:29.400]  they're ready to throw him to the wayside and get behind DeSantis. I think that Republican voters
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:34.760]  and real Republicans shouldn't fall into the trap yet. Wait and see and watch both of them.
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:40.120]  Because again, we have... There's a lot we don't know about Ron DeSantis. So he is clearly a very
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:44.040]  good governor for Florida. And there's no questioning that.
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:51.080]  I want to talk about infrastructure attacks. You already kind of mentioned this, but I mean,
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.360]  I've seen the insurance numbers. We're talking thousands of times the normal amount of
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:02.520]  every form of food processing burning down. We see Extinction Rebellion burning stuff down in
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:07.800]  Europe. We see the lefts, you know, cutting off infrastructure. What would the reason be
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:10.760]  to shut off U.S. infrastructure? And what do you think is behind all these attacks?
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:19.320]  Look, I... It's the easiest answer, right? There is no way when you put them on a list,
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:24.120]  and there's a great list that Zero Hedge put out. But it's only up to June 2022. We've seen
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:29.960]  dozens of more attacks since then on food processing plants. You just have to look and know
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:38.440]  that doesn't happen that you have over 100 plants yet, plants worldwide, without there being
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:43.720]  some kind of conspiracy. That doesn't accidentally happen. A kindergartner would know that. But
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:49.640]  particularly, there's a Dr. Andrew Huff, and he's one of the most famous whistleblowers right now.
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:53.160]  And I'll say, when you ask what can we do, I mean, the whistleblowers are really kind of
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:57.000]  saving the day right now, right? So we need to support whistleblowers. But this one in particular,
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.400]  Dr. Andrew Huff, he's known because he was a vice president for Echo Health Alliance,
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:07.960]  and he blew the whistle on Peter Dazak, the CEO for Echo Health and how they really were involved
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:14.280]  with making COVID-19, and they worked with the federal government, and they funded by the NIH,
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:17.640]  the ties to Fauci, all that. He confirmed all that, and he put all the information out there.
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.720]  Well, what a lot of people might not know is that his other area of expertise happens to be
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:27.960]  critical food infrastructure, food supply. And that goes back to his days in academia,
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:32.440]  when he was actually commissioned with a DHS, Department of Homeland Security grant,
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:39.240]  to create a list of critical food infrastructure through processing plants, their vulnerability
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:45.720]  for a tool that DHS has called FASCAT. So he created this list. Hold on. Tell us about that
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:52.200]  list when we come back. This is just breaking. On Fox News, let me come back. Another object over

[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:09.560]  writers and satirist in Mines, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:14.040]  had been greatly exaggerated, because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:20.600]  did die. And it's the same PSYOP today. Info Wars is more influential and more powerful than ever

[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:10.280]  Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:19.800]  in private. In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elites' plans for covertly
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:26.280]  using biological weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched their attack in
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:34.120]  2020, Alex Jones' Info Wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:40.360]  that we knew were coming. This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support,

[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:26.200]  This just broke like five minutes ago. We have the clip right now at a White House press briefing.
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:30.600]  They bring up another Chinese balloon shot down. Canada said last week another was already over
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.640]  Canada. Now there's another one, and they confirm they shot it down. So this is not an accident.
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:38.920]  What is China doing? Here's the clip. We'll get Emil Robbins' take on it.
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:44.680]  Can you speak to rumors that there is another Chinese balloon above Alaska or any other parts
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:50.520]  of US territory that the US shot down? So I can confirm that the Department of Defense
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:54.680]  was tracking a high altitude object over Alaska airspace in the last 24 hours.
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:04.440]  The object was flying at an altitude of 40,000 feet and posed a reasonable threat
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:09.320]  to the safety of civilian flight. Out of an abundance of caution and the recommendation
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:14.920]  of the Pentagon, President Biden ordered the military to down the object, and they did,
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:21.480]  and it came in inside our territorial waters. Those waters right now are frozen, but inside
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:28.040]  that territorial airspace and over territorial waters. Fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:31.240]  Command took down the object within the last hour.
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:41.240]  Emerald studying this, these balloons are between 70 and 90,000 feet. Now they're at 60 and 40,000
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:45.640]  feet. These are not malfunctions. These are obviously provocative. We don't know yet why
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:53.080]  this is happening, but what's your view on it? Well, I think it's a clear provocation and it shows
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:49:05.240]  how little China thinks of Joe Biden and any kind of pushback it'll get. China's testing the waters
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:09.080]  in my opinion. I don't think it's just my opinion. If you look public sentiment,
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:14.840]  Rasmussen did a poll in the last week, and Americans, the majority of Americans do feel like
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:20.440]  we're at risk of going to war with China or that we will go to war, and that's that significantly
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:27.160]  from the Trump years. They don't have a lot of confidence in how Joe Biden handles China.
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:32.040]  Clearly, most people feel that he's compromised, and especially as more people are learning about
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:37.400]  the laptop, since it's finally getting attention, Hunter Biden's laptop. I think that's scary.
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:43.400]  What I also think is really scary, Alex, is I had Gordon Chang on this week. He's a China hawk,
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:51.400]  a China expert. He said that in China, the Chinese people feel that they're preparing to go to war.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:57.960]  A lot of the young men really feel like they're potentially going to be in a war.
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:01.800]  So clearly, if the Chinese people are feeling that way, that's the downstream
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:08.840]  from the Communist Party, and I think that that's extremely concerning and telling us the
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:11.320]  what kind of... Well, that's right. The Communist Party said about the last few years,
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:15.800]  prepare for war with the US, and they're basically at war with us. That's a big deal.
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.920]  Yeah, but Joe Biden says that we're in a competition, and so when you have a country that
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:24.600]  views itself in competition with a country that thinks it's already actively at war,
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:31.320]  you're already starting in a handicap position, not to mention what it means now for our military.
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:36.440]  I talked to members of the military, both current and former active and veteran,
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:40.920]  and they're extremely concerned about the way we've depleted our resources with this Ukraine
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:47.320]  conflict and sent our weapons off and put ourselves in this sort of depleted position.
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:50.600]  And then China launches its main war.
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:56.520]  We're in an extremely vulnerable position right now, and I think that's something that we don't
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:00.120]  talk enough about, and I think a lot of Americans are not aware of.
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:05.800]  Well, there's new footage of lasers, green lasers. So, getawaypunna.com. It's also an
[02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:11.240]  enforce.com. Just shooting down over Hawaiian islands, they're saying most likely from Chinese
[02:51:11.240 --> 02:51:14.040]  satellites. I mean, what in the world is that?
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:21.480]  Yeah, I saw that yesterday as well. And again, it's just that it's another provocation. I think China
[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:25.880]  is testing the waters, and why wouldn't they at this point? It's long been their goal to take down
[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:31.160]  the United States, and they see us, I think, at one of the most vulnerable positions we've been in
[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:34.520]  in decades, if ever.
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:42.600]  What do you think the average leftist woke person is doing right now? They just think,
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:46.840]  bring down America, that's the answer. Attack America, attack the family, attack God, attack
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:50.280]  family. I mean, what are they going to do if we actually get into a hot war with China?
[02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:56.760]  Well, it's probably fight with the Chinese, right? They probably take up arms with the
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:52:02.520]  invading army against the United States. They dislike us, dislike their own country so much,
[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:07.560]  but look, they're the ones in the media, Alex. They're the ones who yell the loudest and do
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:13.800]  have the microphone, but they're not by and large representative of the majority of Americans.
[02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:19.560]  I mean, the majority of Americans truly are patriotic, and for those who do identify as
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:26.040]  they Democrat or left-leaning, and there's some of those that I know and actually have in my family,
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:32.600]  they're getting really concerned. And I would say some of my family members who are your typical
[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:38.520]  Democrats, long-year teachers union, long-time Democrat, and they're not long for this world
[02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:42.920]  anyway because they're a bit older, they're getting very concerned for the generations
[02:52:42.920 --> 02:52:47.960]  they're leaving behind because they feel like America is not in a good place and that we are
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:54.440]  really at risk as they see what the Chinese are feeling emboldened to do. You got to remember
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:58.440]  some of these, this is a generation that some of them remembers World War II, right?
[02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:08.200]  And so they're afraid of where we sit now and with the buildup of China's military
[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:14.280]  and the depletion of our own, and these are Democrats. It's not the conservative pro-truth
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:19.400]  Americans we often talk to a lot. Well, there's definitely a big awakening happening,
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:24.520]  we agreed on that. But are people really awake to how serious it is? They're awake to there's a
[02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:31.000]  problem, but they have any idea, and I use the example, Biden attacking the poorest workers in
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:35.880]  America, even though they raise almost no tax money, and they're now hiring 87,000 and saying
[02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:40.840]  they're going to target waiters and people. You only do that if you want to wreck the country
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:47.000]  and make people go off the worker rolls. And I don't see how anybody could support something
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:53.720]  that cold-blooded. Our own ruling elite are against us while starting all these outside wars. It's
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:54:00.040]  incredible. And I don't think the majority of Americans do. It's just the people who have the
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:04.040]  microphone, the people in the media who want to be a part of the club, right? They know what it's
[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:08.040]  what. I mean, some are just dumb. I can tell you, spending in the White House press pool,
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:14.200]  about 30% of the media are just dumb. 30% are activists and truly believe this stuff and believe
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:21.160]  this way. And then 30% just want to be in the club and be successful. And they know that the climb
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:25.400]  to the top involves selling out America at this point because they're really being corporate
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.800]  media. You have to write on a daily basis. You have to agree to sell out your own country because
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:37.480]  you're not going to really tell the truth. But they're the people, they're not the real Americans.
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:42.840]  The thing is, is that real Americans do have to get louder, right? And again, it goes back to,
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:46.520]  like we talked about a little bit earlier, getting more involved in your local government.
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:53.240]  And your local leadership and officials make a big difference in your life. But that's the
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:58.520]  only way to start, right? Starting at the top and taking it back over is a lot harder to do and
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:03.480]  more overwhelming. You can start there and hope you do it in time before the top totally topples
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:09.240]  down the country and ruins it. Exactly. George Soros is spending billions to take over the
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:15.960]  law enforcement to take over the prosecutors. And then he's got literal pedophile meth head
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:20.920]  armies, but a few thousand per cities that go out and try to intimidate populist or conservatives
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:25.800]  when we protest. That shows how weak the system is. If more people just protest and get involved
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:32.680]  and get engaged, it'll be totally clear we'll win. Yeah, I think so. I think there's still hope.
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:38.920]  It's just doing it. I am encouraged that some people are doing it, but I don't think it's
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:46.360]  fast enough. Not as fast as they're attacking our way of life and, like you said, trying to
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:52.280]  bankrupt even the poorest people or the people who have to work hard and don't make it kind of money.
[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:58.040]  And then again, even to our food supply, like I was saying, they've been predicting food shortages,
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:03.640]  but as I wrote in a piece for Stuffstack, they're not just predicting them. They're planning them,
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:09.080]  and that's very evident now. Oh, I mean, the the UN and the EU and Australia, they're all just saying,
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:14.680]  ban 30% of your cows, 30% next year, and stop farming. It's all evil. We need less food. We
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:20.280]  got to slow the planet down. It is so incredibly predatory at every level. Emerald Robinson,

[03:00:04.440 --> 03:00:32.440]  We blast into the fourth hour on kelvin up from counter spin media and I'm Hannah Sperra and we've got a great show coming up for you today because this week down in New Zealand it is three wins to the people and one to the deep state. We've got a breaking story that we're going to talk about. It's medical tyranny here in New Zealand. But first kelvin should we do a little bit of a breakdown about what the ruling party, the labor party has had to backtrack on this week. They've backtracked on a controversial hate speech laws.
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:50.200]  In fact, they haven't really backed down on them. They, you know, they're building it in the media because as you know, we're in an election year. They want to get reinstalled and they want to then finish off the World Economic Forum. Davos dictates. So they've just parked it in their back pocket. And while we're celebrating at the moment, we cannot rest on our laurels.
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:01:12.440]  Yes, because of course, Chris Hipkins is cut from the same class, although he's trying to say that he's taking the Labour Party, which is like the Democrats over there in the US, back to bread and butter policy, which is of course traditionally for the working class. But they have taken on a lot of left wing extremist woke policies of late here in New Zealand, bringing in a lot of legislation that has been really race based kelvin.
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:41.000]  It has. We have race based policies where there's a type of co-governance sharing. Now the Treaty of Waitangi, which we have here in New Zealand, is basically a partnership between the native people and the settlers who came. And on Waitangi Day, February the 6th, we celebrate the joining together of the nation, although it is highly controversial and you will see as we progress through the show, the pushback that's coming from all sides. And as the people suddenly realize, they're not the enemies, pro-government are.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  Yes, and Donna Palkaty Phillips, the co-leader of the New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party, will be joining us in the second segment to take us through to the end of the show and break down some of these pushbacks that we've had here in New Zealand this week when little old Kiwis have actually stood up and spoken truth to power and you know, the Kiwi bird, it's a flightless, nocturnal bird that, you know, digs around in the earth for little grubs.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  So it's not really, you know, like the flying bald eagle or anything like that, but we need our Kiwis to get out of the dark, stand up, get into the light and flap their wings and get off the ground and soar because Kiwis are traditionally very apathetic, but we know after this week you guys have got it in you.
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  And Calvin, the other breaking story that we should touch on now is the medical tyranny here in New Zealand because as you will know with the Baby Will story, the legal system was very happy to step in there, Calvin.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  They were indeed. Now we have a mother of three, former mayoral candidate who has been sectioned under the Health Act, which is the Compulsory Assessment and Treatment Act, 1992.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  They seem to be using this legislation now to go after anyone who dares to question government narrative. If you are anti-Jab, if you have any adverse views against anything the government wants to do to you, like the 15-minute cities, like take your rights and freedoms away, all the good
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  stuff you actually should be enjoying, then believe me, they're using the Health Act under the Mental Health Act to section you away.
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  And we did break that story late last night here in New Zealand because we were on the phone with Pamela Taylor in the afternoon, but over an hour as she had been taken from her home by the police with the Mental Health Department, and then she had been put into an emergency psychiatric
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  service where they had given her an assessment by Dr Nigel Franchor. She was then on the phone to us and we heard her be driven from that centre to the Waikarei Hospital where supporters will be meeting at 9am this morning.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  And we heard the police talking to her. She was very calm. She was not sounding dysfunctional. She wasn't a complete nut bar, no. No, at all. They have deemed her to have mental dysfunction.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  Now, this is all because the family court system here in New Zealand where the judge has actually ruled that she needed to go for psychiatric assessment because she's having problems with her husband as of last year when she attended the Wellington Freedom
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  Protests up there in Wellington and she travelled twice for a week and is because of that, that her husband and her views on COVID and the vaccine, that her husband has got the courts involved and has now sectioned her. So we will be getting more information on that as the days go on and trying to bring you that as we get more
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  confirmation. We will be talking with Donna shortly about that, Calvin.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  Yes, and Waikarei Hospital is in Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand. Yes, so if you're in New Zealand, please get down to Waikarei Hospital, the psychiatric hospital at 9am.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Well, right now, if you can get there, go down and we'll see you shortly after the break with Donna Porcati Phillips to discuss this medical tyrannical breaking story here in New Zealand.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  Yes, it's going to be fun, believe me.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:58.000]  Yes, and she'll also talk about Waikarei, so see you shortly.
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:29.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:37.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:40.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:50.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:08.000]  On the Alex Jones show, we are now going to bring on our guest, Donna Porcati Phillips.
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:12.000]  She is the co-leader of the New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party.
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:18.000]  She has a Masters in Law. She has been a former candidate for Te Pati Māori, which is the Māori party here in New Zealand.
[03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  She's been a former Meryl candidate and she's always advocated for Māori, which are the indigenous population here in New Zealand in her community.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:29.000]  Welcome to the show, Donna.
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:33.000]  Kilda, thank you for inviting me on.
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  It's great to have you on.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:42.000]  Now, we are going to touch base first with you about this breaking story about Pamela Taylor, the mother of three in Dunedin.
[03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:49.000]  What are your thoughts about the information that you know that actually hasn't been published in the mainstream yet?
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:57.000]  Well, what that tells me is that I think we have desperate people in government doing desperate things.
[03:06:57.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  So if you don't agree with the government narrative, what they are saying to all of us is that you can be sectioned.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:08.000]  It's appalling.
[03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:11.000]  100% correct, and that seems to be.
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  As soon as people started discovering the fact that they have their true power, they're now looking at things like the common law.
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:26.000]  They're looking at living law. They're realizing there is a difference between law and statute and the fact that we have rogue governments who are basically taking over in a tyrannical regime format.
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:35.000]  And suppressing their populations and expecting them to basically just curtail to everything that they want to inflict on behalf of their foreign puppet masters.
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  Yeah, and Calvin, the most worrying thing for me is that what Pamela is reporting is that in the court documents that we are yet to see,
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.000]  she has been said that she has extremist views, Donna.
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:53.000]  Now, someone might say that you've got extremist views.
[03:07:53.000 --> 03:08:00.000]  Yes, the media has told me I've got extremist views tend to mount to being a domestic terrorist.
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:04.000]  You know, what we have to look at is our constitutional makeup.
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:20.000]  In 1986, we had a bloodless coup here in New Zealand where without the people's mandate, the Longie government back in 1986 made themselves sovereign.
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  So it goes to show I mean, I mean, tyranny goes back back a few decades, actually.
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  It certainly does. In fact, from that point on, New Zealand was operating under assumed parliamentary sovereignty.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  And that's why nothing we do, whether we put submissions in your go for your marches, go for your.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  You can basically complain till the cows come home and these people just say too bad. We're in charge. You'll do what he's told.
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  But the good news is, Donna, isn't it that New Zealand is a small country?
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  We've only got five million people. And when we stand up and when we push back, actually change can happen.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  So what we're going to start with now, the first video we want to bring up is you at Waitangi.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  Do you want to do a little setup for this video? What exactly was going on?
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  Well, myself and New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party alongside our co-leader Sue Gray, who is very popular in the freedom space here in New Zealand.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  We had been sitting a while camped out in Waitangi for three days.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  We managed to get ourselves onto the panel for the Therapeutic Products Bill the day before.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  It was challenging for us to get there, but we did get there in the end.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:50.000]  However, we did organise to get ourselves onto the political panel and we told at the last minute that we went aloud.
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  So what we did is we decided that we will ask questions from the floor.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  Excellent. Now let's roll that clip and then we'll come back and break it down. Donna and Waitangi.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  So my pathway is, my father, I buried him six months ago of his vaccine injury.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:26.000]  The occupation, the occupation, so you say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm going to have a courtedor here because this is the appropriate place to have a courtedor.
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  It is. I want to talk to the members of parliament. You did not come out in the occupation for the vaccine injured and people like my father, who I buried six months ago,
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  my husband's family, they buried 30 in one month. 30 who were all vaccine injured.
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  I want to know, I want to know, do you represent us? Are we part of your family?
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  Are we party? Your community as the vaccine...
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  We're not going to have a courtedor here.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  No, no, no, my pathway is, will you support a royal commission on the safe and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  roll out. That's why please come to our teeth for more Corridor. We invite you with our
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:26.000]  only political party with a tent over there. We also have a tent and we've been there
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  for many years. Thank you for your Dona Porcare in the hall.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  That is my question to the MPs of Parliament. Do you support a royal commission?
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  That is the place to do it.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  Now Dona, you are surely understandably upset after that. I mean that video has gone viral
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  around New Zealand and around the world because what actually happened there for people watching
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  from overseas is those people that were sitting on the stage are actually elected MPs from
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  the Green Party and they actually shut you by singing. Now what happens for people who
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  don't know with traditional Māori protocols with singing with Waiata? How is that usually
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  used and how did they use it?
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  So after you have your male speaker, someone gets up and does a Waiata or a chant in support
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  of that speaker and then the whole group will get up and support as you saw on the stage
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  there. Only very rarely is it used to shut a speaker down, a male speaker down and I
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  saw that when I was a very young child and I saw my nuns get up and close down a karewa
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  which is an old man after he was speaking. So it's used, I mean I'm 60 now and I would
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  have been around five or six at that time. So it's used very, very rarely and that's
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  what you saw. I didn't know at the time that there was another karewa, another old man
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  where they shut down his karewa or what he was trying to say, they also shut down with
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  a Waiata and with a song.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  And of course that would be Pomea McKay. We will be airing his as well, not only the
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  shutdown scene but also his clarification of what he was trying to say shortly and of
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:40.000]  course we'll keep you on to break down and get your analysis on that as well.
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  Yes, so Donna, why don't you clarify as well because it's really important that people
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  understand your father has passed away from this jab and also your husband has had 30
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  members of his family in the last month. In the next two minutes of this section, let's
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  break that down.
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  So what happened? You just tell us about what's happening in your family now.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  So when I said 30, that was post jab and one month my husband had 30 of his whānau pass
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  away and it's difficult for family when they're grieving to actually connect the dots.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:26.000]  Actually there were 17 in a matter of two weeks and that was the worst month but you know
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  you're talking about deaths continuously for the last two years.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  Every time there was a rollout here in New Zealand where they'd have clinics and they
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  were using bribery like money, TV, phones, food to encourage families to come and get
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  the jab. Well as Māori we go in clusters, we go in family clusters to get the jab and
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  you know they were dying in clusters and we've recently been having unveiling in
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  clusters as well. The thing is our people know there is something wrong, they just
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:08.000]  haven't quite put the dots together yet.
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  And of course in New Zealand the problem here is and it's now absolutely proven that we
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  have an excess or cause mortality rate that is far beyond any measurable scope from
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  before. I mean and you're right we saw the advertising, we saw the Coke scene of the
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  young ones especially about protect your whakapapa which for those of our international
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  audiences you're lineage, you're bloodline. Protect your family, go and get yourself jabbed.
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  Not too many people were taking up okay we'll give you going to a draw for an iPad.
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  Hey we'll give you some burgers, we'll give you some ice creams, we'll dress people up
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  in Superman costumes so everyone gets into the swing of things and comes along to
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  basically the modern day gas chambers. So we'll be back after this with Donna
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  Phillips to continue with this analysis.
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:37.000]  corporations that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:44.000]  leaving companies that only I own profitable you will then be my slaves
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  Oh and then you'll get that special shot and get him from copra will remove your immune system
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.

[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:26.000]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:30.000]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  infection and definitely with the vaccines. People are lower with the spike protein.
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:38.000]  They don't feel well. This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine comes from
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  a natural substance so does ivermectin and now natokinase. Isn't it interesting?
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  OnlineHealthNow.com thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  because it's important you didn't come here to do that but I made you do it.
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  The most banned man in America Alex Jones.
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:07.000]  I want you all to know something Alex Jones was right.
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:11.000]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:14.000]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:20.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right.
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:24.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:28.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:38.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:20:11.000]  And of course we just really need to let you know that many of you already know this but Alex Jones was right.
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:21.000]  There is an emergency sale on 50% off all the top selling products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  This is really important to help them with their war chest to keep the free speech fund operational.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  Your purchase is a 360 win and will help take the info war to the next level.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:36.000]  Because of course info wars has been leading the way. They've been the tip of the spear for many, many years.
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  They've now given us a platform to get the New Zealand story out.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  So please do get behind. Many of our team have purchased their products over the years and we love them.
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  So get out there and support them.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  Because also this is what you need to know about the therapeutic products bill that's getting rolled out here in New Zealand.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:04.000]  Which is going to limit access to these types of supplements and even just plants that can help with our health.
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:10.000]  And it's all really important now Calvin isn't it? Especially with this jab being rolled out and the effects of it.
[03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:15.000]  Well we no longer have it. Well do we ever have in a health system in New Zealand?
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:19.000]  We have an illness maintenance system. You cannot profit off healthy people.
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:24.000]  Hence that's why let's get rid of anything that does you good and let's bring in everything that does you bad.
[03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  Because that will keep continuing to create new customers as they go forward.
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:32.000]  And boy those pharmaceutical companies have made a killing over COVID.
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:38.000]  Yeah and so what Donna was talking about up there in Waitangi at our national day over the weekend.
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  They were also talking about Orungua Maori which is Maori medicine.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:47.000]  Now Donna before we look at Pomea's excellent stand up there in Waitangi.
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  Why don't we get your quick comment about Orungua Maori and why like all natural medicines it needs to be taken out of the therapeutic products bill.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:10.000]  Yes so in 1907 we had the Tohunga Suppression Act that was brought in to get rid of Maori healing practices and bring in modern medicine.
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:16.000]  The therapeutic products bill is the Tohunga Suppression Act Part 2.
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:21.000]  But it includes all natural medicines not just Orungua Maori.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  It's devastating. My husband depends on Orungua Maori and natural medicines to keep himself alive.
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:36.000]  He's a diabetic. When my father was first vaccine injured in 2021 after his second vaccine.
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:41.000]  We put him on natural medicine in Orungua Maori to help keep him alive.
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:46.000]  If I can just share a little bit about what happened to my father.
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  So he was vaccine injured, got myocarditis with his second vaccine with his booster.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:23:05.000]  I was really shocked that he got his booster and I truly believe that he was pressured by the medical fraternity and people very close to him.
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:10.000]  Because he was told and the propaganda was protect your whakapapa.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  He had already got myocarditis with his second vaccine.
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  So his heart was already injured. With the booster he got pericarditis and pleural effusion.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  By the time I got down to the hospital when he was vaccine injured the second time.
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  He also had ulcers in his mouth, down his throat and in his stomach and they did not feed him.
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:39.000]  They did not give him water and they did not give him any medication for four days.
[03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  To me that was voluntary euthanasia without even speaking to his whanau, to his family.
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:57.000]  So this is personal for me. My father was injured and then he passed and like I said in their video we buried him just over six months ago.
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  This is serious.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.000]  Absolutely disgraceful.
[03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:03.000]  Yeah it's absolutely disgraceful what's happening in this country and indeed around the world.
[03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:11.000]  And it seems it's the same playbook playing out in every country. The entire western world is under attack.
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  Definitely.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  And now what we want to play next is the Pomea, the stand up Pomea video.
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  Now he does talk about the separation of powers and you know the corporate state.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  And there's a great Greg Reese video you can watch about this as well.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:30.000]  He's talking about the corrupt corporation and the three different states they've created around the world.
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  Let's play Pomea and we'll come back for comment.
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  All of these statutes in the parliament of England assembled and all the dominions belong in there too and all of the laws and customs of the same.
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  Therefore you know there is a difference between statute and law.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  Law is made by the Attua. The law of gravity was not made by men.
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:06.000]  Now I want to go and say that there is a difference of people assembled here today.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  There is the elected public servant and there is the appointed public servant.
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  Put the emphasis on public servants and there's the public.
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  And there's the public.
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:22.000]  There it is. Let me finish. And there's the public.
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  Now I was late and I apologize and I hope that in my absence that they began this hui hands-off with their national anthem.
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  So before the start of forces this 82-year-old comatua return servicemen, leave me alone. Let them do their things.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:52.000]  Okay. If you did not begin this hui with their national anthem and the hui with their national anthem.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  If you don't.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is.
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:28.000]  Now what people need to understand here, that was the formal dawn service of Waitangi Day.
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:33.000]  The Prime Minister was present. All the main political parties in Parliament were present.
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  A lot of different nationalities, religions were there opening up with prayer.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  Now this gentleman, he is Māori but he was shut down by his own and he is a return serviceman.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  He's fought for freedom and those two that shut him down were police officers.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  Have you got anything to add? The large Māori gentleman who was trying to usher him away is the Northland Regional Commander.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  So in these situations, especially in Waitangi, it's like anything else.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000]  You stand your own to shut your own down.
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  Well that's what the state does but otherwise it'll look racist.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  Pomea McKay of course has formed a New Zealand Special Air Service, New Zealand SAS.
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  I know him well. I've known him for over 23 years. That man has not changed his stance.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  He has continued to push back against the state and back in the early 2000s he was a great adviser and trainer for our unit.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:36.000]  So Donna, what do you think about this? Because the mainstream is trying to create a narrative here that the colonisers, i.e. the whites here in New Zealand,
[03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  or the Pākehā, what they call them, are trying to shut Māori, the indigenous down.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  But this is the case of your Māori, Pomea's Māori and you are both being shut down by your own, aren't you,
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:48.000]  at a place where there should be free speech on Waitangi?
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  Quick, one minute to go over in the segment.
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  I just want to go back to what he says about God's law. So there are fundamentals, four principles that underpin our democracy.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:05.000]  One is God's law, the principles of natural justice, the rule of law, and man-made law.
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  And what we're seeing, man-made law being statute law, is we're seeing the fundamental principles of our democracy being eroded.
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  And this is what this karoa was trying to express. And so we shut down.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:27.000]  And they're using tikanga, they're weaponising tikanga to shut us down.
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  And so tikanga is Māori tradition, and again they use the song to shut this man down.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:40.000]  And they're using it for their own ends, because what's happening here in New Zealand is the iwi, which is the tribal leaders,
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  working with the corrupt governments. So he says, and we're going to play his next explanation in this next segment,
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  when we come back, so you can really understand exactly what the point was that he was trying to make.
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:56.000]  And it's an absolute beautiful message. When we come back, we'll see it.
[03:28:56.000 --> 03:29:01.000]  You want to beat the New World Order? You want to stop their globalist agenda? Well, so do I.
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:12.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out. So please keep me on the field.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:30.000]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[03:29:48.000 --> 03:30:01.000]  And I thank you for your support. Now take action. The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:22.000]  We're using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:34.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones's Infowars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:38.000]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support.
[03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links.
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:56.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:02.000]  If you go to OnlineHealthNow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the Wellness Company.
[03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:09.000]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company. I contribute with like so many else do there.
[03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:11.000]  So many wonderful doctors.
[03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:18.000]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase.
[03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:26.000]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme. This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:32.000]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:31:32.000 --> 03:31:36.000]  People are lower with the spike protein. They don't feel well. This is a potential solution.
[03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:42.000]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance. So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:31:42.000 --> 03:31:49.000]  Isn't it interesting? Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2, in the vaccines.
[03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:54.000]  OnlineHealthNow.com, thank you for your support. And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:57.000]  We didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:02.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:06.000]  And it is because of Lister's and viewers supporting us.
[03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:15.000]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:22.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:24.000]  It's really just incredible.
[03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:28.000]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:33.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:37.000]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:44.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWars.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:46.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:50.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWars.com.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:55.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWars.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:32:55.000 --> 03:32:56.000]  Please take action now.
[03:32:59.000 --> 03:33:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:12.000]  Welcome back.
[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:14.000]  You were live with the Alex Jones show in our previous segment.
[03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:25.000]  You would have seen Pomeo McKay, a return serviceman, who stood to clarify his position and basically make his voice known at the Waitangi Day celebrations here in New Zealand.
[03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:35.000]  A little difficult to get to the end of his because he was shut down in the manner he was and escorted off, not in a happy way of course.
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  Now what we want to do is we want to now bring you what he was actually trying, the message he was trying to convey and this was shot by Papa Joe.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:55.000]  We thank him for this footage and I think you, the audience, will realise that a lot more people around the world are coming to this conclusion and just let the video explain it for us.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  The war, the battle of words has never been Māori against Pākehā.
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:09.000]  It has always been Māori and Pākehā against their rogue governments.
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  The government is their servant but they're not acting as servants.
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  They're acting as rulers.
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  So I'm going to go over there.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:22.000]  I got in my settle over there the laws that I've won and caught.
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  Where?
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:25.000]  That's why I want to join with you people.
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  So we form up the orbit.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  There is no law to make you pay tax.
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  There's no law to have you register your vehicle.
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  There's no law to have you drive a license.
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:35.000]  None.
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:37.000]  There's no law.
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:40.000]  They have been putting acts against the parliament.
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  Parliament is not sovereign.
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:45.000]  Simple as this.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:51.000]  When you make a tāyaha, can the tāyaha rule over you?
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  No.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  You rule over the tāyaha.
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:58.000]  Until you pick it up and give it life, it's a dead thing.
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  Okay?
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  We living human beings, we give it life.
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  Why do we still have blood over the overseas?
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:06.000]  To have you come back and tell us?
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  Do you want to do that to us?
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  No.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:11.000]  Now I speak fiercely here.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:13.000]  But when I go over there, I speak gently.
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:14.000]  Okay?
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  Because you want to make friends.
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:24.000]  The real mark of orangutida, when he faces his people, he is the public servant.
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  But when he turns his back on the people and the people are behind him,
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  and he's facing the enemy, that's when he's the orangutida's sovereign marshal.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  Why?
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:40.000]  Because he's backed by all the sovereign individuals behind him.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:43.000]  It was the government that broke the treaty.
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  Oh yes, they were mostly partner.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:46.000]  Okay?
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  It's the government that's trying to hold us back.
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:53.000]  It's the government that's putting out all these mandates about COVID.
[03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  Okay?
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  So we must band together.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  And our power comes from eon mature.
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:03.000]  Not from the fact that I have a directly sent it to the king,
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:13.000]  saying, Portugal, not from the fact that I have a direct descent from Rajuane,
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  or haunefe...
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  No.
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:20.000]  Our money comes from the fact that I am a child of God and you and I are brothers.
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:22.000]  The Paha is my brother.
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:26.000]  Oh yes, you and I will soon get into a roy19s.
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  There's a way to fix that.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  Okay?
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:39.000]  concentrate on, think about the Ten Commandments, think about loving each other, okay, and then we'll move forward.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  Now, we do have a mixed history here in New Zealand with the Treaty of Waitangi and there's always been racial division,
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  but Donna, he summed it up beautifully, didn't he, that we can all come together as one and really just love each other.
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:56.000]  Is there is a common enemy?
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  That's right, and that Karua said it eloquently actually, the common enemy is the government.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  You know, and he takes me back to 1986 because it's really important that we in New Zealand understand how important 1986 is.
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:26.000]  1986 was a bloodless coup where the government gave itself sovereignty without the mandate of the people.
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:34.000]  So we can question from 1986 onwards whether or not they have legitimate power.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:40.000]  Definitely. What we're going to do now, Donna, what we're going to do is bring in the other narrative that happened this week.
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:47.000]  As a whole lot of people went to a public meeting to see Christopher Luxon, who here in New Zealand is the leader of the opposition party,
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  which is, of course, the national party here, which is like the Republicans, but the rhinos, not the true patriots.
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  They really are the sell-outs to the globalist deep state.
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:03.000]  So we're going to play you an introduction to that about how mainstream covered it. It took them 24 hours to cover it.
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  It was over 500 people. We turned up. A whole lot of freedom-loving. Patriot New Zealanders asked some tough questions.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:13.000]  And this is how mainstream wrote about it.
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:19.000]  Hey, this is going to save you, so thank you so much for coming out to meet your students at the time with us this afternoon.
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  We're going to talk a little bit about that next time.
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  On February the 7th, Mr Christopher Luxon, the leader of the opposition in the New Zealand Parliament,
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  and leader of the Conservative National Party, spoke at a meet the people gathering in the rural town of Rangiora, just north of Christchurch.
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  The meeting was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of four to five hundred people.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:52.000]  During the question and answer session, several questions were raised about polarizing co-governance issues determined by a racial divide that the current government is rolling out,
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  such as woke education curricula including sexual identity and critical race theory.
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  And of course, COVID jabs and mandates.
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:09.000]  However, when counter-spin media started to ask the really hard questions, he scurred away.
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:11.000]  You have another question.
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  Hi Chris, Chris, you're a businessman. I've got one more question, one more question for you, okay?
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  You're a businessman and I'm from counter-spin media and there's a lot of people here that want to know,
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  are you going to find out what is in the FISA contract? Are you going to actually look at it?
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  What did this government offer FISA to sell out this country and they're going to release the unredacted FISA contract?
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  What did this government offer FISA to sell out this country and they're going to release the unredacted FISA contract?
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  No, the voters are never on. They get to choose how we run the country.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  Until the FISA jab rollout, including the bribery and corruption and the whole South-Deafs of New Zealanders.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  Well, there we go ladies and gentlemen, what's happening here is that's Chris Deluxe and he's leader of the course of the National Party,
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  basically part and parcel of the same parliament you have in Parliament, nothing but the cesspit of corruption.
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  Couldn't answer a simple question, shut down the meeting quick as a flash, as soon as people started talking about the jab, the deaths and all the corruption going on.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  But he's happy to make sound bites and waffle on forever saying absolutely nothing.
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  And he just completely ignored you.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  Okay, there you go. That is our footage actually and we're going to show you the mainstream reporting when we come back.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  But Donna, what have you got to say to Kiwis who in that clip were standing up, were asking the hard questions to the point where Christopher Luxin had to scurry off and shut that meeting down early because he was due to stay a lot later.
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:50.000]  About one minute fifteen. That's why I asked for our Royal Commission because the politicians don't want to debate this issue with us.
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  It's an important issue and instead the shutting every single meeting down.
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:02.000]  We need courageous New Zealanders to get up and challenge them exactly the same way that you did Hannah, the same way that I did.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  It takes some kahunas to do that, but we've got to do it for the sake of our children and our grandchildren.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  We're in peril times. My father paid the ultimate price for that and someone needs to be held accountable for their actions and the buck stops with our members of parliament.
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:28.000]  And I will say that Calvin and I were waiting for the microphone because they did open it up to question time.
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:32.000]  They weren't giving it to us. They were not wanting to give it to us.
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  So in the end there, once they shut the questions down, I had to just take the opportunity to stand up and ask that hard question.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  When will the unredacted FISA contract be released? We want that worldwide because we want to know what did the New Zealand Government offer FISA to have our people injected with a toxin?
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:56.000]  We'll be right back after this.
[03:42:56.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  The cavalry has arrived. Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth they're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart.

[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two, imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:39.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
