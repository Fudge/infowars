[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:27.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex
[00:27.800 --> 00:32.320]  Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and we've got an interesting show lined
[00:32.320 --> 00:36.800]  up today and we've got some breaking news it seems like every time I come in here to
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.840]  substitute for Alex Jones we've got some breaking drone news and that's going on right now we've
[00:41.840 --> 00:48.160]  got a drone an Air Force drone that is crashed close to a remote Florida highway it's shut
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.360]  down that highway we've got a little bit of video here for that if you guys can pull it
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.160]  up and the people who are watching it can see it's quite a bit of smoke going on there
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.720]  last time I was here we had an E6B that was flying loops through Austin there's pictures
[01:00.720 --> 01:07.320]  if you're watching of the drone that went down and it's quite a bit quite a bit of smoke
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.960]  and it was fairly close to a population center says according to an Air Force fact sheet
[01:12.960 --> 01:27.960]  the QF-4 is tested at nearby Tyndall Air Force Base and now they say it's been used since
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.000]  the 1950s now the last time I was here Alex called in was absolutely amazed at the size
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.440]  of this airplane that was flying a looping circles around the city of Austin flying at
[01:39.440 --> 01:46.200]  the level of the buildings very dangerously low we eventually learned that it was an E6B
[01:46.200 --> 01:51.960]  that was doing as I reported a training exercise in Austin and you have to wonder if they're
[01:51.960 --> 01:56.920]  doing training why are they doing training so close to population centers well they're
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.800]  doing that all the time actually we've got numerous incidents of SWAT teams not SWAT
[02:02.800 --> 02:09.440]  teams but military exercises in conjunction with our militarized police with our SWAT teams
[02:09.440 --> 02:14.960]  they're working together in city after city doing these drills and arresting citizens
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.400]  who videotape them we've had reports of that and we've shown video of a citizen getting
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.440]  arrested for exercising his freedom to videotape what's going on in public and they told him
[02:26.440 --> 02:30.080]  you have to leave you're in a dangerous area and it's like well if you're if it's a dangerous
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.040]  area it's because you're landing helicopters here in a public space and they haven't warned
[02:35.040 --> 02:38.280]  anybody they didn't coordinate off and you know you have to ask yourself why they're
[02:38.280 --> 02:44.680]  doing it well they've answered that question we've had videotape of a military officer
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.520]  explaining that you train where you expect to be deployed so if you expect that you're
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.440]  going to invade a mountainous area or you expect you're going to invade a beach you
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.040]  train there if you expect you're going to invade American cities that's where you train
[02:57.040 --> 03:03.360]  and you train with the police and that brings us to an article right now that we've got
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.200]  linked on the Drudge Report this is on info wars.com this is from former president Jimmy
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.520]  Carter and he said in the wake of the NSA spying scandal he said of the American political
[03:13.520 --> 03:20.720]  system America has no functioning democracy that's Jimmy Carter America has no functioning
[03:20.720 --> 03:28.440]  democracy now he joins Paul Craig Roberts and he joins Senator retired Senator Gordon
[03:28.440 --> 03:33.560]  Humphrey and criticizing what's going on in America right now think about this this
[03:33.560 --> 03:41.480]  is just one generation removed these are people who have retired a few years ago still alive
[03:41.480 --> 03:49.960]  criticizing how far we have gone into despotism and another article that's on info wars.com
[03:49.960 --> 03:56.720]  we have this from Paul Craig Roberts and he calls it coup d'etat he said Americans are
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.480]  ruled by usurpers who claim that the executive branch is above the law that the US Constitution
[04:02.480 --> 04:08.920]  is merely a scrap of paper and he points out an unconstitutional government is an illegitimate
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.400]  government says Americans are oppressed by illegitimate government rulings not by law
[04:14.400 --> 04:20.560]  by the Constitution and they by laws and naked force is how they rule and he doesn't miss
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.280]  any words he says the South African apartheid regime was more legitimate than the regime
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.520]  in Washington the apartheid Israeli regime in Palestine is more legitimate the Taliban
[04:30.520 --> 04:38.040]  more legitimate Gaddafi Saddam Hussein more legitimate absolutely true if you don't follow

[08:18.240 --> 08:24.040]  filling in for alex and just before we went to the break we were talking about just the
[08:24.040 --> 08:30.160]  former generation of leaders in this country talking about how illegitimate our government
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.680]  is i mean these are former senators former presidents paul craig roberts who is the father
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.520]  reaganomics former head of policy of the department of treasury they're all pointing
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.440]  out that we have basically had the federal government cut itself loose from the chains
[08:46.440 --> 08:51.200]  that bind them down they've cut themselves loose from the document that they swear allegiance
[08:51.200 --> 08:57.120]  to understand that when they take office the oath to the constitution is essentially an
[08:57.120 --> 09:03.840]  oath to a superior power to the law the law is king lex rex what they're doing is swearing
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.840]  allegiance to a king and then ignoring and subverting that king now we've got an article
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.320]  that's linked on drudge report from jimmy carter where he says basically america has
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.480]  no functioning democracy and as i mentioned just before the break paul craig roberts
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.480]  said the american government is an unconstitutional government and an illegitimate government because
[09:25.480 --> 09:30.720]  they no longer pay any attention to the constitution now also breaking yesterday from the guardian
[09:30.720 --> 09:37.400]  there was an email exchange between ed snowden and former gp senator gordon humphrey and
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.440]  he said i believe you have done the right thing and exposing what i regard to be a massive
[09:42.440 --> 09:51.080]  violation of the u.s constitution and so when they got this message glenn greenwall contacted
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.400]  the former senator just to make sure that it was not a prank that it was actually there
[09:55.400 --> 09:58.800]  and what he did was he essentially clarified it and doubled down this is what he said in
[09:58.800 --> 10:04.280]  the follow-up message he said uh... this is a senator former senator writing to glenn
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.000]  greenwald he says yes it was i who sent the email message ed snowden thanking him for
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.520]  exposing astonishing violations of the u.s constitution and encouraging him to persevere
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.480]  in the search for asylum he talked about him being a courageous whistleblower and he said
[10:20.480 --> 10:27.320]  that uh... no effort he's very concerned that there is no effort being made to identify
[10:27.320 --> 10:34.040]  and to remove from office and bring to justice officials who have abused power seriously and
[10:34.040 --> 10:38.960]  repeatedly violated the constitution united states and the rights of millions of unsuspecting
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.720]  citizens and that's the whole point all you see discussed on the talk show host or how
[10:44.720 --> 10:50.800]  do we keep this from happening again andrea mitchell was interviewing a uh... democrat
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.120]  from uh... i think it was montana and they were talking about how they could vet security
[10:55.120 --> 11:01.720]  clearance is better so this doesn't happen again nothing at all about making the government
[11:01.720 --> 11:08.520]  obey the constitution where we headed with this well actually james madison pointed
[11:08.520 --> 11:12.640]  out and we read this quote last night on the nightly news he pointed out a long time
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.240]  ago what was going to happen if we didn't follow the constitution anymore and if we
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.800]  didn't understand the traditions that led to the writing of that document he says do
[11:22.800 --> 11:27.160]  not separate text that would be the text of the constitution from historical background
[11:27.160 --> 11:33.720]  if you do you will have perverted and subverted the constitution which can only end in a distorted
[11:33.720 --> 11:39.920]  bastardized form of illegitimate government same words being used by the previous generation
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.800]  of politicians who have and government officials at the federal level now uh... in the second
[11:45.800 --> 11:52.120]  hour we're going to be talking to uh... stan linick and if you remember he was the uh...
[11:52.120 --> 11:55.800]  deputy you might remember this uh... when we had the opt out of film campaign with actually
[11:55.800 --> 12:01.120]  jessica and jason bermus they went to a new york airport and they were handing out literature
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.600]  not bothering anybody and they had the police called on them and fortunately the deputy
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.560]  sheriff who showed up with stan linick there's a little video of that we're going to be talking
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.080]  to him he stood up for their constitutional rights he refused to bully them because this
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.440]  fellow with the airport and and the fellow who was trying to uh... to get the police
[12:21.440 --> 12:25.000]  to bully them should have known better he was formerly somebody who worked in the media
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.400]  now that's uh... stan linick that we're going to be talking to and he was a deputy sheriff
[12:28.400 --> 12:32.560]  for the year by the constitutional sheriff's and peace officers association so we're going
[12:32.560 --> 12:38.080]  to talk to him because you know we need to have people who have legitimate authority
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.040]  people who have legitimate authority or people who put themselves under the constitution like
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.420]  deputy linick did so we want to talk to him and in the third hour we're going to be talking
[12:47.420 --> 12:52.360]  to kirsten tynant and she's with the fully informed jury association because that is
[12:52.360 --> 12:57.000]  where you come in that's where every one of you can come in because you can stand in
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.480]  the gap against bad laws against oppressive government you can stand in the gap and make
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.200]  sure that your fellow citizen gets justice and that unjust laws are not enforced and
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.640]  that's a very important thing most people don't understand where that power comes from
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.040]  they don't understand the tradition of that they don't understand the judges will basically
[13:18.040 --> 13:23.600]  tell juries lies they will suppress information about what the rights and the duties of the
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.160]  jury truly are but let's think about where this is really headed let's look at somebody
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.840]  who actually lived under the stasi there's amazing article that was translated into english
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.120]  and i tried to get this guy to come on so we can interview him but unfortunately he
[13:40.120 --> 13:47.240]  doesn't speak english this is a pastor who lived under the stasi in east germany and
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.680]  he has something that all americans should really think about he talked about living
[13:52.680 --> 13:58.920]  there for for most of his life up until about 20 years ago when it fell he says we all recall
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.160]  the fall of 1989 when thousands of people all over german democratic republic marched
[14:04.160 --> 14:10.440]  from churches to streets and squares now this fellow was a pastor and one of the things
[14:10.440 --> 14:13.920]  that he had done he was surprised to find that the stasi didn't know anything about it he
[14:13.920 --> 14:20.200]  actually had smuggled in from the west a miniature lab and he was doing testing of the water
[14:20.200 --> 14:24.920]  because he knew they were putting chemicals into it not openly like our government puts
[14:24.920 --> 14:31.200]  fluoride and other things that we know are harmful things that are banned in europe they
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.000]  were putting other chemicals in as well as that into the water and he was doing testing
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.800]  and giving information out about that and they didn't know about that but they pretty
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.800]  much knew about everything else and one of the things to remember is that it was the
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.680]  clergy who were instrumental in getting people their freedom in east germany just like they
[14:50.680 --> 14:55.280]  were very instrumental in giving people their freedom here in america they called them the
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.320]  black regiment during the revolutionary war and what happened in east germany was the
[15:00.320 --> 15:06.200]  pastors organized people in the churches and the churches marched in mass to the wall
[15:06.200 --> 15:11.760]  to the spots where they would shoot people if they got too close and the soldiers finally
[15:11.760 --> 15:17.960]  refused to fire and it was that kind of a peaceful stand down in mass that essentially
[15:17.960 --> 15:21.520]  brought down the fall of the stasi and the east german government but i want you to think
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.720]  about what it's like to live under the stasi and this is what he tells us he said how did
[15:27.720 --> 15:34.960]  a state keep this population of 17 million in check for 40 years the answer through surveillance
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.400]  incarceration and terror the wheels of terror were implanted in every brain the moment a
[15:40.400 --> 15:45.600]  critical thought took shape the wheels of terror started turning who would be able to hear
[15:45.600 --> 15:50.480]  this and make note of it which file would it land in what could be the consequences what
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.200]  reprisals would be taken could there be an impact on the children's schooling on their
[15:54.200 --> 16:00.640]  apprenticeship position or their college placement even preschoolers and kindergartners had internalized
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.440]  that and he said the guarantor for terror and order was the stasi state security they
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.800]  called it in german eavesdrop and peak that's what our government is doing to us today and
[16:11.800 --> 16:17.600]  i find it so disturbing that americans can come out and say i don't care they can look
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.040]  i don't have anything to hide well the people in east germany didn't have anything to hide
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.680]  either but nothing was able to be hidden and listen to what happens when you know you're
[16:26.680 --> 16:33.160]  being watched hardly anything went undetected like a fungus surveillance permeated all of
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.560]  social life and the quote service of socialism to protect the country from the imperialistic
[16:38.560 --> 16:42.920]  class enemy say they had a different enemy it's always necessary to have an enemy our
[16:42.920 --> 16:48.040]  enemy of course is now al-qaeda used to be the communists when that was no longer a credible
[16:48.040 --> 16:52.640]  threat now they're holding up these boogeymen in caves and we're going to talk a little
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.320]  bit more about that in just a moment but he says during demonstrations and this is how
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.200]  pervasive the threat of the stasi was that even when they started to have demonstrations
[17:02.200 --> 17:07.600]  that led up to the fall of the government in 1989 he said a huge crowd of people marched
[17:07.600 --> 17:13.080]  through downtown izanak in the state of thuringia where i live chanting but the moment the
[17:13.080 --> 17:19.040]  train of protesters passed the headquarters of the stasi they fell silent nobody shouted
[17:19.040 --> 17:25.520]  anything so here you got a crowd of people who are in defiance of this communist regime
[17:25.520 --> 17:30.960]  and demonstrating but they are afraid of the stasi because the stasi knows everything about
[17:30.960 --> 17:36.800]  them records everything about them uses that to control their lives to control their futures
[17:36.800 --> 17:44.400]  that's what total information awareness is about it's a means of control it's a means
[17:44.400 --> 17:49.520]  and that's what surveillance leads to people need to understand this he says listen to this
[17:49.520 --> 17:54.360]  the stasi not only surveyed the everyday life of citizens but also influenced our lives
[17:54.360 --> 17:58.640]  in my case the stasi sought to document my underground political activities with a goal
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.360]  of gathering enough material to take me to court but they didn't wish to wait until i'd
[18:02.360 --> 18:09.240]  made a mistake worthy of prosecution instead they used snitches to plant rumors in my parish
[18:09.240 --> 18:13.080]  and to strip me of the backing of my superiors in the church they even tried to set up an
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.400]  informer on my wife to destroy our marriage snitches provoked me engaged me in topical
[18:18.400 --> 18:23.960]  conversations intercepted letters intercepted personal contacts indirectly influencing and
[18:23.960 --> 18:28.280]  manipulating my life and he goes on to say that whenever they would have a meeting whenever
[18:28.280 --> 18:32.480]  the church would get together any function they always knew that there were stasi members
[18:32.480 --> 18:36.880]  stasi informers that were present then he said they would even cynically extend a welcome
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.480]  to those who quote had to be here professionally unquote so they knew and he said he never
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.720]  said anything at a meeting that he wasn't willing to go to jail for is that the way
[18:47.720 --> 18:53.160]  you want to live because what we're going to see in america is something far more pervasive
[18:53.160 --> 18:58.600]  something far more dangerous than anything that ever happened with the stasi you can
[18:58.600 --> 19:05.720]  see pictures of rooms full of files paper files on people they had no way to data mine
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.680]  most of that they connect they collected so much information on people that they really
[19:10.680 --> 19:15.760]  couldn't put it all together but we now have this massive data center that's being built
[19:15.760 --> 19:22.480]  in utah that is going to use enough water just that is so massive so incredibly massive
[19:22.480 --> 19:28.120]  so much data storage so much heat being generated that they're going to use enough water that
[19:28.120 --> 19:33.320]  they could supply thousands of homes and that's a big issue out in utah but that's where we're
[19:33.320 --> 19:38.120]  headed we're headed for a complete and total surveillance state we're headed for something
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.880]  that is far worse than the stasi ever did something that is far worse than george orwell
[19:42.880 --> 19:49.480]  ever imagined in 1984 and the american public just shrugs many of them those of us who are
[19:49.480 --> 19:53.280]  aware have to wake up the others to the dangers that are coming and we're going to be talking

[24:05.440 --> 24:19.920]  on the gcn radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in
[24:19.920 --> 24:22.440]  for alex today and we were just talking before the break about the stasi life under the stasi
[24:22.440 --> 24:26.040]  and a lot of information is coming out about that right now people are very sensitive about
[24:26.040 --> 24:31.480]  that especially in germany because it's come out that we were conducting massive spying
[24:31.480 --> 24:36.120]  on germany as well and they don't like to be spied on because they have this tradition
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.640]  of the gestapo and the stasi and as one person wrote in the financial times her name was
[24:41.640 --> 24:49.000]  constance stelensmueller she wrote our grandparents generation feared the early morning knock on
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.840]  the door of the gestapo well you know what at least the gestapo knocked that's not the
[24:54.840 --> 25:00.720]  case with the american gestapo the schwaateams right i guess we should call them the schwaateams
[25:00.720 --> 25:06.240]  because it sounds a bit more german they just bust the door down they throw in grenades
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.040]  flash done grenades and they shoot anybody who doesn't understand that they're the police
[25:11.040 --> 25:14.160]  you know somebody kicks in your door in the middle of the night your first reaction is
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.800]  going to be to take defensive action to grab a gun or something they kill people over and
[25:17.800 --> 25:24.480]  over again for that but that's become standard operating procedure now she said that it was
[25:24.480 --> 25:30.600]  only after the fall of the wall in 1989 that people really understood how much terror was
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.520]  being perpetrated on them you know people in america still don't understand that and
[25:34.520 --> 25:40.240]  one of the things she mentioned about this was that in germany she said we have a better
[25:40.240 --> 25:46.840]  reason to fear the secret state than most people she said they don't like closed circuit
[25:46.840 --> 25:50.240]  television cameras we're perfectly comfortable with them in america because we don't understand
[25:50.240 --> 25:53.520]  how they're being used it's also why our constitutional court enshrined a fundamental
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.440]  right of data privacy and declared it illegal for germany to implement a u directive on
[25:58.440 --> 26:04.640]  preventative data storage you know if you remember that comedy video alex talked to
[26:04.640 --> 26:09.040]  the fellow who who did it i don't recall his name right now but he he was following people
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.000]  or he was a comedian he was following people around in public places he had a big boom
[26:13.000 --> 26:22.880]  mic and he had some fake earbuds on tom maybe thank you and he had some fake ear ear bugs
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.600]  on and he's dressed with sunglasses and a suit like a cia agent and he puts this microphone
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.840]  in people's faces and they was like hey get out of here when you understand the surveillance
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.680]  is very important and it was important to the people in germany because they understood
[26:37.680 --> 26:44.560]  it was being done by people when it's completely automated when it is completely transparent
[26:44.560 --> 26:47.680]  you don't notice the surveillance you don't notice the cameras people don't object to
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.080]  it and that's the very dangerous situation even things like free speech and we this is
[26:53.080 --> 26:58.880]  an article on info wars paul says 34% of americans say the first amendment is too extreme that's
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.040]  right we don't need our first freedom i mean why would you not want to have freedom of
[27:04.040 --> 27:10.640]  speech i mean that's the most amazing thing to me i mean that's not anything that why
[27:10.640 --> 27:14.400]  why could you how could you make a case against freedom of speech i mean this is people been
[27:14.400 --> 27:20.560]  totally brainwashed by the state by the state media the state controlled mainstream media
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.760]  to think that they have to give up everything for their freedom but you know the opposite
[27:24.760 --> 27:30.680]  of liberty is not security is slavery and liberty and security go together you can't
[27:30.680 --> 27:36.240]  have one without the others thomas jefferson said about life and liberty he said the hand
[27:36.240 --> 27:41.160]  of force can destroy them but cannot disjoin them that's the same thing with liberty and
[27:41.160 --> 27:45.240]  security you know you can have a government that destroys both your liberty and your security
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.720]  but you can't have one without the other now the interesting thing about this is a survey
[27:49.720 --> 27:55.360]  that was conducted by the museum that's a news museum and they do an annual survey about
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.160]  people's attitude toward the first amendment and what they found was that it was up from
[28:00.160 --> 28:06.800]  13% to really didn't think that the that we should have free press or free speech it
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.880]  went jumped from 13% to 34% so more than a third of the people don't think we should
[28:11.880 --> 28:16.280]  have a free press or free speech or freedom of religion and it extends to other things
[28:16.280 --> 28:20.360]  as well as we've said all along about this fight for the second amendment if people
[28:20.360 --> 28:23.440]  don't respect the second amendment they're not going to respect any of the other freedoms
[28:23.440 --> 28:26.480]  either the government if they don't respect that they're not going to respect the others
[28:26.480 --> 28:34.320]  and interestingly enough only 4% of the people valued the second amendment so they don't
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.360]  really understand their their freedoms you know they don't understand what they're about
[28:38.360 --> 28:44.120]  to lose now we've got this contest that we're going through feverishly trying to come up
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.840]  with a finalist and look at all these different films and give them a fair viewing multiple
[28:48.840 --> 28:55.120]  viewings one of the ones that I I saw just recently was a film called dream a dream revered

[29:00.480 --> 29:06.600]  slash P I think takes you there as well now in this particular film what got me about
[29:06.600 --> 29:13.960]  it was that it starts with the person's personal recollection about how his jobs have gone they've
[29:13.960 --> 29:18.480]  left this country they've gone to other countries he worked in Detroit and he's driving through
[29:18.480 --> 29:23.720]  Detroit and saying this is your future America and we're going to be talking about that right
[29:23.720 --> 29:27.960]  after we come back he talks about how the the jobs have gone he talks about the great
[29:27.960 --> 29:32.480]  sucking sound that Ross Perot warned us about and he talks about what's being put in its
[29:32.480 --> 29:50.800]  place and we'll talk about that right after we return stay tuned

[33:57.240 --> 34:04.440]  was a uh... an artist a light artist in berlin that actually shown this giant uh... projected
[34:04.440 --> 34:10.200]  a giant sign on the side of the u.s. embassy that said united stasi of america had a picture
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.360]  of kim dot com and uh... they know what the stasi is about and they see this happening

[34:18.720 --> 34:21.360]  uh... yeah they're they're trying to think of something to charge them with i don't
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.920]  know what i mean that's not even grope bt i mean it's not shining an image that's right
[34:25.920 --> 34:30.000]  but uh... i i don't know maybe uh... you know definition of character you know i mean
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.640]  yeah i'm not exactly sure also last night we had uh... jacari and i normally do the
[34:34.640 --> 34:40.560]  nightly news and uh... we had the world premiere last night of state of mind now this is a
[34:40.560 --> 34:44.480]  uh... you want to talk about how the government controls us you know there was an article
[34:44.480 --> 34:49.560]  today about uh... a guy real life jason born that was from natural news where the guy has
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.520]  no memory and he's speaking swedish that's the kind of mind control we typically think
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.560]  of you know the kind of mk ultra type of stuff but this is actually uh... covers that as
[34:58.560 --> 35:05.200]  well as covers the more the broader aspects of my and uh... yeah the more subtle aspects
[35:05.200 --> 35:10.640]  of it education the educational system and what the goals have been from very beginning
[35:10.640 --> 35:14.720]  now we premiered this last night we had the world premiere of state of mind last night
[35:14.720 --> 35:20.360]  on the uh... info wars nightly news for subscribers to prison planet tv but uh... you know you
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.320]  can still get a copy of it and where we are where we were back in uh... north carolina
[35:25.320 --> 35:28.760]  we didn't have the bandwidth to watch movies on the internet a lot of people don't like
[35:28.760 --> 35:34.160]  to to stream an entire movie on the internet and if you yeah if you get a dvd of this that's
[35:34.160 --> 35:38.520]  a great way to pass the information along to other people people are much more likely
[35:38.520 --> 35:44.400]  to watch this and enjoy it with a dvd everybody's got a dvd player blu-ray that's right blu-ray
[35:44.400 --> 35:50.080]  even so jacari what's up well i i saw this and you brought this up when i first walked
[35:50.080 --> 35:56.160]  in uh... the mcdonald's budget yeah maybe we can get a doc ham on this uh... this is
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.120]  the mcdonald's budget as you would assume by the title it's trying to teach people who
[36:00.120 --> 36:05.120]  make the mcdonald's type of income uh... how to budget their money and this article points
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.640]  out that you know can it would ask the question can you support a family on two thousand dollars
[36:09.640 --> 36:14.920]  a month now supporting myself on two thousand dollars a month is you know difficult enough
[36:14.920 --> 36:19.720]  you know family talk between uh... rent and you know various utilities over seven hundred
[36:19.720 --> 36:25.120]  dollars a month and food gas you know just uh... the bare necessities phone and so forth
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.280]  and it says mcdonald's teamed up with visa to you know to teach their employees know
[36:30.280 --> 36:36.560]  how to properly budget their minimum minimum wage but the big thing in it it says uh...
[36:36.560 --> 36:41.600]  blatantly in the document itself that they expect you to work two jobs yeah exactly
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.720]  because they're not gonna they're not gonna hire you full time because then they're gonna
[36:44.720 --> 36:50.720]  pay obama care right so they're gonna make you know to to get even like a twenty thousand
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.600]  dollar income they're going to make you work two jobs exactly so you're gonna work you
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.000]  know maybe two thirty hour jobs i guess i don't know sixty uh... sixty hours but but
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.120]  they don't they don't budget anything for food or for gas i i guess it's like uh... do
[37:05.120 --> 37:10.120]  you want fries with that budget you know i mean it's it's pretty ridiculous uh... you
[37:10.120 --> 37:14.240]  know it's just more of this trying to get people to live on less meanwhile you know obama
[37:14.240 --> 37:17.800]  is going to africa saying that african shouldn't have air conditioning i'm not making that
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.560]  up we should we play that clip before saying uh... prince charles has said the same thing
[37:21.560 --> 37:25.000]  you know you can't fly in with their jets and say you know you shouldn't drive cars
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.280]  yeah he's well he's got some of our jumps off air force one and tells people they shouldn't
[37:29.280 --> 37:34.280]  have cars in africa because that erase the standard of living too hot yeah oh yeah absolutely
[37:34.280 --> 37:38.080]  while he's running out you know private golf courses to play with tiger woods and so forth
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.120]  it's gonna melt down the uh... the entire planet yeah yeah you know it's interesting
[37:42.120 --> 37:47.080]  they they put the employees at mcdonnell's on this ridiculous budget that doesn't even
[37:47.080 --> 37:51.560]  allocate any money for food or for gas to get to your two jobs that you're gonna have
[37:51.560 --> 37:58.080]  to have right okay but meanwhile our government has supposedly this debt limit of uh... sixteen
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.960]  trillion just under sixteen trillion dollars frozen has been frozen for the last fifty
[38:01.960 --> 38:06.880]  six days they're claiming incredibly claiming that they have not spent any money for the
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.360]  last fifty six straight days evidently nobody in the federal government is getting paid
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.480]  anything they're not buying anything and uh... they they stopped at about twenty six was
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.320]  to say here twenty six million dollars short of the limit and it's been frozen there since
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.840]  uh... may seventeenth you know it's like you said nobody's got to pay check you know they
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.760]  haven't sat another seven million dollar vacation or you know whatever else they their expenses
[38:31.760 --> 38:35.840]  may incur yeah i guess they put uh... obama's trips on a credit card or something but you
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.640]  remember uh... you know obama keeps threatening and i believe it was last year to year before
[38:39.640 --> 38:43.840]  he threatened not to pay the military you know of all people you know people who uh... go
[38:43.840 --> 38:47.000]  overseas and have to send money back to the families we're not going to pay them or he
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.760]  threatened not to pay them absolutely you know we've got an interesting article you
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.520]  know we're talking about how the government scares everybody and all of these different
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.760]  uh... program you know what you we've got a spy on you we've got to go through your
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.560]  cars that there's an article on the drudge report today that tsa is now going through
[39:04.560 --> 39:10.360]  parked cars at airports right you're gonna be so afraid of al-qaeda and uh... we've got
[39:10.360 --> 39:17.840]  a clip here that uh... uh... has fox news talking about al-qaeda hijacking your car
[39:17.840 --> 39:21.800]  can we play that guy's go for a little bit of
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.840]  imagine this scenario you're driving along and suddenly you're no longer controlling
[39:26.840 --> 39:31.040]  the car that's a scary scenario from some top security analyst who warned that as our
[39:31.040 --> 39:38.600]  cars become more sophisticated they also become more vulnerable to hackers and even terrorists
[39:38.600 --> 39:43.760]  is that true morgan right it's not the government is joining us now and again one of our favorite
[39:43.760 --> 39:49.440]  stories but one that really concerned us morgan is this true i mean is this something that
[39:49.440 --> 39:54.760]  we need to be concerned about well look so the fact in fiction fact yes you can't take
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.720]  control of a car on star is an example and they work with law enforcement to do this
[39:59.720 --> 40:04.120]  last week they can actually locate your car law enforcement gets in behind it they send
[40:04.120 --> 40:08.120]  a signal to the car to start slowing it down and then it cruises off to the side of the
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.560]  road but in that scenario law enforcement saying control they block the road is a concern is
[40:12.560 --> 40:16.360]  what happens when they not only just maybe hack the car they hack the systems that control
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.400]  these cars or have access to them and then do these things so a lot of people say that's
[40:20.400 --> 40:25.240]  far-fetched but you know one of my examples on september 10th 2001 we thought it was far-fetched
[40:25.240 --> 40:29.400]  to fly four airplanes into a building never thought it could happen right there yeah they
[40:29.400 --> 40:34.240]  thought it was far-fetched to fly four airplanes into buildings and actually they got two airplanes
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.360]  flew into the twin towers and three giant skyscrapers fell straight down exactly i can control
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.360]  the demolition and so i mean yeah i think it is incredible because they don't even know
[40:43.360 --> 40:46.800]  how many planes flew into because you know obviously you would think that they would
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.680]  take a plane to make a building fall down or more than that yeah because they designed
[40:51.680 --> 40:56.000]  them to be with to withstand a direct plane hit you know since we're a let's briefly talk
[40:56.000 --> 41:02.680]  about the topic building seven nine eleven had very little exterior damage you know
[41:02.680 --> 41:07.400]  a little bit of debris some minor fires and knocked and supposedly knocked the building
[41:07.400 --> 41:10.640]  down but you think about buildings four and five that had much more damage and had to
[41:10.640 --> 41:14.360]  be torn down to the ground and that's all i'm going to say about that yeah that's incredible
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.480]  buddy yeah he talks about how it's just so incredible but the other thing i want to talk
[41:17.480 --> 41:23.920]  about here is notice how they craft the the discussion here you know now it's hackers
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.640]  and it's al-qaeda who could hack into your car but when the government does it it's for
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.520]  your own safety also brown pulls you over when when the reality is dress of highway exactly
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.440]  it's all good yeah only the government is going to be doing this you know when this
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.400]  thing came out with Hastings right immediately alex said you know they can they can crash
[41:41.400 --> 41:46.360]  a car by hacking into the system oh no you can't do that that's far better and i want
[41:46.360 --> 41:49.480]  people to see this can you guys just go to google you don't have to play the audio let's
[41:49.480 --> 41:55.040]  go type in google car and it's some trendy guy with a hat on he's driving to a exactly
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.920]  well exactly and you know but but after that came out after alex said it people are laughing
[42:00.920 --> 42:05.320]  at him but then when richard clark who is the former us national coordinator for security
[42:05.320 --> 42:10.480]  infrastructure protection and counter terrorism richard clark tells the huffington post there's
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.200]  reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers know how to remotely seize
[42:15.200 --> 42:20.120]  control of a car and he says so if there were a cyber attack on Hastings car and i'm not
[42:20.120 --> 42:24.720]  saying there was i think whoever did it would probably get away with it and then later on
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.800]  in that article they even say then just a couple of paragraphs down they say Hastings
[42:28.800 --> 42:36.880]  was driving this Mercedes when he crashed into a tree first of all if you remember the only
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.400]  eyewitness knew eyewitness that everybody was talking about the first day was louise
[42:40.400 --> 42:46.000]  cortez and what he said was it was driving very fast at jackknife parts went everywhere
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.560]  okay he didn't say that it hit the tree right caught fire that way okay and if you look
[42:51.560 --> 42:57.200]  at the way the car if you look at how the car is okay and where the engine is all right
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.640]  there's absolutely no way that those two are going to get separated with that kind of crash
[43:01.640 --> 43:05.960]  if it hit head on into the tree is going to capture the engine and drive it into the car
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.920]  exactly if it hit sideways with enough impact to somehow i mean anything i guess could be
[43:10.920 --> 43:15.720]  possible but if if it was going to eject it sideways at a right angle to the direction
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.520]  the car was going that car would have been wrapped around the tree that didn't happen
[43:18.520 --> 43:25.240]  either but i've looked at crash after crash after crash on the internet and the simple
[43:25.240 --> 43:29.080]  fact of the matter is if you got something like a pinto remember the forward pinto maybe
[43:29.080 --> 43:32.920]  you don't remember the idea i'm old enough to remember it okay it's a big deal because
[43:32.920 --> 43:39.040]  it fuel tank was compromised and rear end collisions and you can see highway traffic
[43:39.040 --> 43:44.480]  cameras of it being hit from the back and the entire contents of the of the gas can
[43:44.480 --> 43:49.800]  are atomized and sprayed everywhere and then catch fire and you see that in these car crashes
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.480]  you see car crash after car crash very very bad they don't blow up instantly like they
[43:55.480 --> 44:01.000]  do on a hollywood movie exactly that only happens when you have the rear end is hit and of course
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.960]  the rear end of the Mercedes that michael hastings was driving was completely intact so there's
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.960]  no way that's going to blow up and explode on impact there's is less than a two percent
[44:11.960 --> 44:17.200]  chance somebody's going to die in an automobile fire because that is so rare that that happens
[44:17.200 --> 44:22.440]  right because typically it starts to catch fire and it gradually builds and even if
[44:22.440 --> 44:27.000]  you watch a nas car races those guys usually have time to bail out before the car yeah
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.520]  goes up in flames if it does go up in a very good example there's a video people can see
[44:30.520 --> 44:36.440]  it on youtube it was a like a formula one race and this one car loses control and maybe
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.840]  it's like a greasy spot on the track or something goes spinning out of control crashes parts
[44:40.840 --> 44:46.040]  go flying everywhere but doesn't catch and catch on fire short while later another car
[44:46.040 --> 44:51.280]  hits the same spot same thing starts spinning out and hits this car in the back instantly
[44:51.280 --> 44:56.480]  giant fireball okay because he hit it in the back and exploded the gas tank now of course
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.880]  that guy actually walked out of a giant fireball because he had a fireproof suit had a helmet
[45:01.880 --> 45:06.640]  that sort of thing which a person typically would not have but the point being is that
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.720]  the government can hack into these systems Mercedes has been maniacal about trying to
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.480]  make their cars safer they developed any like braking systems they develop these stability
[45:17.480 --> 45:21.280]  counter steering systems and they have all kinds of systems that can accelerate and slow
[45:21.280 --> 45:25.920]  down your car now based on if it if it sees that you're going to be hitting somebody head
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.840]  on and even takes a look at people behind you to see how quickly to put the brakes on
[45:30.840 --> 45:36.120]  so they have all kinds of controls on these cars which make them safer but also makes
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.760]  them hackable we've had video that we played on the show of the DARPA official talking
[45:40.760 --> 45:46.560]  about how severe the problem that is for the government they're worried about it oh yeah
[45:46.560 --> 45:50.720]  because all it is is you know hacking they hacked drones you know the you believe us
[45:50.720 --> 45:56.320]  the University of Texas hacked one right here and so people think that it's impossible
[45:56.320 --> 45:58.960]  with something that can't happen you know if you have a older car you may not have to
[45:58.960 --> 46:02.760]  worry about such things but that's right who drive the newer models you know it's it is
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.920]  possible yeah absolutely and and if you look at this situation with a Hastings car now
[46:07.920 --> 46:11.560]  you know I believe it was a bomb that went up would cause the pieces to fly everywhere
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.600]  because there was there was one eyewitness that was interviewed by the young Turks and
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.840]  he was I didn't find him to be very credible because it seemed like he was trying to reinforce
[46:20.840 --> 46:25.760]  the official story you know and and he says oh yeah hit this bump and you know I think
[46:25.760 --> 46:29.800]  that's what caused the engine to come out it's like I'm sorry but you know what everyone
[46:29.800 --> 46:34.440]  is saying about cars especially Mercedes they're not going to have the engine fall out when
[46:34.440 --> 46:40.400]  it hits a bump okay these are cars that they designed to drive on the Autobahn with no speed
[46:40.400 --> 46:46.520]  limit and they do it all the time right and you know a high speed you know dip in the
[46:46.520 --> 46:51.400]  in the in the pavement is not going to cause the engine to come out and exactly to go a
[46:51.400 --> 46:57.080]  different direction so you know it's just not credible but it would give them cover
[46:57.080 --> 47:01.320]  a cover story as everybody has picked up as a mainstream media has picked up to have him
[47:01.320 --> 47:06.700]  driving at a high speed under hacking control and then blow the car up I mean that that
[47:06.700 --> 47:10.240]  would perfectly fit yeah and that's what they want they don't want anybody to question
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.480]  the story we've given you this story we came out we said there's no foul play we don't
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.000]  want to release the the police documents and so forth just let it go that's pretty much
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.160]  what they want us to do with the the associates of the Joker brothers not saying they're innocent
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.000]  or guilty but you know it's this repetitive thing that you know they just give you more
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.040]  information all the time all the time all the time so you forget about this I'm still
[47:32.040 --> 47:35.800]  waiting to see the surveillance footage from Sandy Hook you know yeah oh yeah oh yeah they
[47:35.800 --> 47:39.960]  never show that now you mentioned the so car trial and one of the things I think is interesting
[47:39.960 --> 47:45.880]  pull up that photo guys from the Rolling Stone magazine cover yes this Facebook photo that
[47:45.880 --> 47:49.920]  makes him look like a rock star in some people's opinion right well they're very upset about
[47:49.920 --> 47:54.480]  it but what you know what upsets me about it is the fact that it says there is a caption
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.920]  bomber the bomber the bomber you know he's the bomber right you know he's been tried
[47:58.920 --> 48:03.760]  and convicted in the media in the same way that Zimmerman has you know we have completely
[48:03.760 --> 48:08.600]  lost the whole concept of how a jury works and why you would have a jury I mean looking
[48:08.600 --> 48:14.160]  at this is a an article that's linked on a drudge right now the niece of Dr. Martin
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.440]  Luther King Jr. said that Dr. Martin Luther King would not wear a hoodie and she did that
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.120]  in reaction to a picture that somebody had photoshopped his face into a picture of a
[48:24.120 --> 48:29.320]  hoodie and she's talking about the the trial there you know one of the things that bothers
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.920]  me about this whole thing is that people don't understand why we have juries just remember
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.600]  with the with the Boston bombers the alleged Boston bombers you know it just the days after
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.080]  after they captured the younger brothers like we don't need we don't need to inform these
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.400]  guys of their rights that we don't try out we don't need this we don't need that we just
[48:47.400 --> 48:51.040]  need to convict these guys execute these guys throw them in the in the cellar for the rest
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.280]  of their lives that's right and it used to be that if the media was so irresponsible
[48:56.280 --> 48:59.520]  you know we have free speech and we should have free speech but that doesn't mean that
[48:59.520 --> 49:06.040]  you slander and demonize and libel people right and so you know when they when they
[49:06.040 --> 49:09.920]  call somebody when they talk about people before they've had a trial they used to always
[49:09.920 --> 49:15.480]  say the alleged bomber the alleged murder the alleged whatever they don't do that anymore
[49:15.480 --> 49:18.960]  no okay they don't bother with it and nobody is talking about that everybody is talking
[49:18.960 --> 49:25.240]  about how Zocar the bomber looks too good on this picture and CVS says they're not even
[49:25.240 --> 49:28.400]  going to CVS drugstore chains not even going to carry the magazine in the stores because
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.480]  of the the content but because of the image on the cover exactly that's what that's what
[49:32.480 --> 49:36.800]  people think offense to I find that amazing I'm going to be talking in the third hour
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.840]  to someone from the fully informed jury association and that's something that most people don't
[49:42.840 --> 49:49.040]  even go for jury trial anymore most of the time they're intimidated by a lot of spurious
[49:49.040 --> 49:54.120]  charges that are piled on by prosecutors and then they plea bargain to maybe what they would
[49:54.120 --> 49:59.560]  have been charged with in the first place yeah they overcharge yeah which you know I
[49:59.560 --> 50:03.720]  wish more people would understand this you know I don't know any particular examples
[50:03.720 --> 50:07.360]  off the top of my head but you know there are examples where you know you charge somebody
[50:07.360 --> 50:13.560]  with let's say murder and get them to you know go to go for manslaughter and it's very very
[50:13.560 --> 50:19.040]  few trials ever go to a jury anymore one of the reasons is because jurors don't know what
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.400]  their rights are and they usually turn into rubber stamps for the judge but not in the

[54:53.200 --> 54:59.600]  about body armor there's a bounty out on uh zimmerman's head from the new black panthers i
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.960]  always have to put that new in there to distinguish it larry pinkney always wants to uh just uh
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.480]  disassociate himself from the new black panthers with good reason uh so uh zimmerman might want
[55:10.480 --> 55:17.200]  to get some of that um infidel body armor yeah uh you know there's a uh it's amazing to see the
[55:17.200 --> 55:23.360]  double standard here when uh they're allowed to publicly put out a ten thousand dollar bounty
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.640]  on his head and yet at the same time we've got an ap news story here that police are charging a
[55:28.640 --> 55:34.720]  website that hosted a murder video yeah and you know they don't want them dead or alive we've seen
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.520]  the t-shirts that said dead or alive and it has alive scratched out and and you've got facebook
[55:39.520 --> 55:44.480]  pages the call for his murder they don't say anything to their celebrities tweeting his parents home
[55:44.480 --> 55:48.240]  home address not even think they were tweeting the correct addresses on those and and you and i
[55:48.240 --> 55:54.160]  remember the time you know we've been visited just people make a you know a comment about
[55:54.160 --> 55:59.360]  murdering the bush family or something like that on on an info plan an info wars and they show up at
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.760]  our door secret service we were both here when they showed up people don't believe us when we
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.920]  tell them that story but we actually had the secret service come up it was it's around christmas
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.320]  time this past year and i was just about to leave to get on the plane to go back to oklahoma
[56:12.320 --> 56:15.680]  and the secret service comes knocks on the door and i believe you yeah answer the door
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.560]  yeah he flashes me the bag so that badges that secret service can i come in i said no
[56:22.160 --> 56:25.760]  you got some papers to come in so yeah we went around and talked around people but
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.760]  you know they they don't hesitate to come to the door about a little spurious comment on our website
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.240]  but somebody takes out an entire facebook page right they start doing t-shirts they start putting
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.680]  out dollar bounties to have him killed they have absolutely no problem with that problem with that
[56:41.680 --> 56:45.760]  tells you right there what this whole thing is about that tells you right there this is a detective
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.480]  this is counterintelligence operation protected yeah this is a government operation to pit the
[56:50.480 --> 56:56.240]  races against each other nothing could be clear about that and you look at the black panthers how
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.600]  the department of justice just passed on doing anything about them turning voters away threatening
[57:01.600 --> 57:08.320]  voters at polling places in chicago we know that the government has used counterintelligence to
[57:08.320 --> 57:14.160]  create groups like the kooklex clan and groups like the new black panthers and this is absolute
[57:14.160 --> 57:18.640]  proof of it no other group of unless they were a government co-intel pro operation would be
[57:18.640 --> 57:22.160]  allowed to do something like that and also the i don't know if you want so much to call them an
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.880]  organized group but all these riots and i'll call them rioters because they're not protesters you
[57:26.880 --> 57:32.320]  don't protest by jumping on innocent people's cars in the midst of uh of la and tearing down
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.800]  gates of walmart that doesn't seem like a protest to me but these people are going out and regardless
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.360]  if they were really actively pursuing justice for trevon you have plenty of people who are just
[57:41.360 --> 57:46.400]  opportunists using it as a excuse to go tear up stuff and go loot people's homes and so forth right
[57:46.400 --> 57:51.600]  even if they believe that the jury made the wrong uh decision how do you justify pulling out an
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.200]  innocent person who hasn't done anything to anybody i mean don't they see the irony of this
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.800]  yeah they think that trevon was singled out for having done nothing at all and singled out because
[58:00.800 --> 58:06.240]  he was a particular race or parents or whatever he was singled out and killed well so then they
[58:06.240 --> 58:11.680]  are going to go out and then single out so they drive around and abduct joggers beat them up and
[58:11.680 --> 58:16.080]  drop them off someplace you know that's right and that's justice for trevon that's right well that's
[58:16.080 --> 58:20.480]  it for this segment we're going to be back in the next hour with stan linick he's the deputy

[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:30.080]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex jones we're going
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.680]  to be joined in this next hour by stan lenick deputy constitutional sheriff of the year
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.320]  here and we're going to talk to him about what it really looks like to be a constitutional
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.720]  sheriff what it really looks like to respect the rule of law to respect the constitution so
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.440]  we're looking forward to talking to him now we've got some breaking news here we've got
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.840]  the epa according to cryptagon is nuking the radiation rules that's right if they don't get
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.960]  the kind of results they want they just disregard the rules they have now rewritten the rules for
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.960]  what it passes for a safe exposure to radiation and raising it from the current goal of one in
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.960]  10 000 to one in a million americans they're going to have fatal cancers but and they they have
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.520]  raised this by about a factor of i think a thousand in the article it says here
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.400]  so they if you don't get the if they're worried about radiation from
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.160]  Fukushima then the solution is not to actually address the problem it's just to change the
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:43.200]  rules this is the same epa that did human testing in order to justify their fine particular
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:50.000]  matter regulations they did human testing feeding diesel exhaust directly into people's
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:56.720]  aspirators deliberately searching for people who had respiratory and heart problems so they could
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.280]  create an incident which would justify their regulations exposing them to levels that were
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.800]  up to 70 times what the epa had already said would not just make you sick as as the epa
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.440]  administrator lisa jackson said she clarified this in uh congressional hearing she said this
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.760]  is not just going to make you sick i'm talking about stuff that will kill you and so they took
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.480]  that level that they had presumably determined already and fed that at set up to 70 times that
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.160]  level to people trying to provoke an incident so is the epa really looking after our health
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.360]  or is it trying to build an empire is it trying to find a way to control our economy is it trying
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.880]  to find a way to shut down our industry and shut down our power generation i think it's the latter
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.680]  we also have some other interesting news here about monsanto patents
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:52.560]  getting rejected by the indian government now you know monsanto can get pretty much
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.960]  anything they want in america but not in india if you recall in india they already had farmers
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:05.920]  committing suicide by the thousands because they were being sued by monsanto just like the supreme
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:12.800]  court case that the supreme court found in nine to zero in favor of monsanto that was rejected
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.760]  in india because what they said was monsanto's wheat or corn was cross pollinating with other
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:25.360]  farmers corn and wheat and it was and they would come around then and look at that and say we have
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.920]  some genetic material from monsanto they would sue them for royalties and essentially destroy
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.400]  these people's lives financially and the farmers were committing suicide there but in america
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.800]  that's okay in america we serve the interests of monsanto you might remember clarence thomas
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.760]  was formerly a lawyer for monsanto did not recuse himself from that court decision either
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.240]  and some other news here you may have seen the preview for the new movie elysium that is coming
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:03.280]  up and has a science fiction film and there's an article today in wired magazine with the director
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:09.600]  and this director is originally from south africa and he says that he kind of likes la because it
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:16.320]  has this thermonuclear weapons feel like it feel like it's about to go off at any point he says la
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.640]  can't quite match the level of intensity of johannesburg south africa but he says it's getting
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:27.920]  there it's getting pretty close and this takes place elysium is in set in 2154 where you have
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.560]  this wealthy one percent live in this orbiting satellite and and they have everything provided
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:40.960]  for them the rest of the people are brutalized by robots by robo cops and that's basically where
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:46.960]  we're headed and he's perfectly fine with that he thinks that so this is maybe some predictive
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.120]  programming and not really complaining about it but it'll be an interesting film to see
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.200]  we'll be right back with stan linick constitutional deputy chair for the air stay tuned

[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:37.600]  joining us in this segment stan lenick now if you've seen that video about the uh
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.960]  uh opt-out-and-film campaign where actually jessica and jason bermas went to an airport
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.840]  and they were trying to hand out some literature and the airport official took exception of that
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:54.080]  and tried to uh really tried to bully a police officer into uh arresting them throwing them off
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.280]  the property and uh there's some video if you're watching this right now that is officer lenick
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:06.320]  right there and he basically mediated uh this dispute and uh listened to both sides and he
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.120]  understood that they were not doing anything in this public place that was against the law
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.880]  and he stood up for their free speech rights and then as a result of that uh officer lenick was
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.800]  given the award from the constitutional sheriffs and police officers association this year
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.320]  he was given the award of a deputy sheriff of the year because that video went pretty viral
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.480]  a lot of people saw that now he's had a law enforcement experience six and a half years
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.440]  as a deputy there and uh we've got him on the line right now officer lenick how you doing
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.880]  good good how are you doing fine thank you for joining us i've seen that video many times and
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.080]  i tell you what what you did there in that airport is what we all wish the police would do everywhere
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:56.320]  uh be calm about that and and um just listen to both sides make a determination uh we so many
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:03.040]  times we see the police uh just losing it and going out of control tell us uh you know how
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:09.120]  you approach law enforcement what's your philosophy well my philosophy is is the golden rule treat others
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:16.640]  how they treat you um and that's that's basically it you know um when ashley jessica and jason
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.720]  bermas came to the airport uh as i talked to you a little bit earlier about is they were polite
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.120]  they were kind they stood their ground they knew their rights and you know it actually
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.560]  made my job a little easier you know when when you're dealing with someone who is who is uh
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.640]  courteous and and you know and they showed me you know of most respect and i i really appreciate
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.760]  that that's right that's right well you know a lot of times we have officers though who
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.280]  essentially initiate a conflict and this is a case i don't imagine you've seen this
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:57.280]  we just had uh just south of uh austin here is a town called san marcos and uh there's an article
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.960]  here it's actually made national news san marcos cop faces a felony rap for assaulting a woman
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:09.040]  during an illegal arrest now according to the police chief howard e williams he said i won't
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.840]  prejudge the internal investigation i haven't heard what the officer has to say yet and i'll
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:18.000]  reserve judgment until that happens he said but there are standards and i think it's fairly obvious
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.760]  that what we think about his conduct that night and that we were the ones that went down and
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.360]  filed the criminal charges it was actually the police chief who filed the criminal charges
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.400]  after reviewing surveillance camera footage he says i believe what he did was criminal
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:38.720]  and a corporal polermo said that uh uh actually it was a commander parry dunn said that corporal
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:44.720]  polermo who's the one who's charged uh the woman in in question did not make contact with the driver
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.480]  or with the police officer what was happening with this from what we've been told with the
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:54.240]  the surveillance camera what the police department has said was he had pulled somebody over on a stop
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.760]  and they were over on the side she walked by she didn't look at them she didn't say anything to them
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.200]  she walked kind of close and he got confrontational with her and wanted her idea and she said for
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:11.280]  what i haven't done anything and it escalated from there and at at one point you know the back
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  and forth that she was essentially standing up she had not done anything wrong and he was
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.680]  somehow offended because she had walked too close or something and uh at at eventually what he did
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.320]  was he slammed her in the concrete broke out several of her teeth and gave her a concussion
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.520]  and so what we see yeah and i mean that's how it escalates and you know from our standpoint
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.000]  from the public standpoint we're seeing this happen so many times we say why is that apparently
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.400]  more the more often the case than a situation the way you handled it with uh actually and with
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:50.000]  jason you know why is that getting out of control and what do we do what kind of systemic controls
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.040]  can we have to watch the watchers to essentially control that to make sure that doesn't happen do
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:04.400]  you have any idea about that well first of all uh you know in any uh job or profession there are
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:11.280]  you know bad apples um i mean you you you see it every day you see it in the news
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:18.400]  and exactly what you just uh you know told me um you know it i i did not see the the uh the video
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:24.480]  of it um so i i kind of you know which i did before uh you know talking to you about this right i
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.480]  understand you can't comment on on the specifics of it right right but uh i mean uh you know how
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.040]  far away was she from the traffic stuff well evidently they were right up beside the the
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.520]  sidewalk i haven't seen the video either i'm just reading the article based on the fact that after
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:46.800]  the police chief and the uh the police commander looked at reviewed the video uh he essentially
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.840]  arrested her you know he threw her to the ground and then arrested her they released her and then
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.120]  after they reviewed the footage they charged him with a felony right so this is yet to be determined
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.440]  so you know he she wasn't like brushing right up against them i don't believe but for some reason
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.360]  he took exception to it and i i guess the question that we all have you know we know that when there's
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.400]  a when there's a shooting involved uh there's always going to be an internal investigation
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.440]  correct oh of course okay but when there's a taser involved or some other form of quote
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:20.080]  unquote non-lethal four shoes because you don't always have uh you know tasers are not always
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.400]  non-lethal people die from that sometimes people have permanent injuries brain injuries from that
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.840]  when they hit the ground so i don't believe no correct me if i'm wrong are there automatic
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.600]  investigations when non-lethal force like tasers are used well i can tell you this and like just
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:42.400]  speaking from experience with my department um anytime uh use the force is committed whether
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:49.120]  it's deployment of a taser or uh pepper spray or anything like that uh the officer involved
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.960]  has to fill out a use of force form and when he fills that out yes the state specifics of why
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:02.080]  he used that force and it goes directly to the immediate supervisor and the supervisor reviews
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:09.600]  that and basically says okay he used the appropriate amount of force you know and and with it you know
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.160]  all of our traffic stops and everything that pretty much that we deal with it everything is
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:22.000]  recorded we have cameras in all our cars and the supervisor reviews that and he makes a
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.720]  determination now if he used the appropriate amount of force yes or no if if if excessive
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:36.320]  force was used it goes up the up the chain to our internal affairs so you know there is definitely
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:42.480]  you know each each officer my department is held accountable for what what they do out on the road
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.800]  how does that differ from uh let's say there's a shooting how is that different from just the
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.840]  use of force how's that how's the review of if a shooting if a if a firearm is discharged how is
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.240]  that review process different or is it different it's it's actually not different because it's the
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:04.240]  same form um that you felt that you'd have to fill out uh what this you know i've never been
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:11.680]  involved in a shooting i uh one of my co-workers has so i can't really specifically you know state
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:18.160]  as to you know what exactly happened uh you know i'm not in a supervisory role so i can't really
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:26.960]  you know right understand give you specifics on that but um i mean as far as i know especially
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:35.040]  with the shooting that my uh co-worker was involved with um you know the the sheriff himself came out
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:41.600]  i mean all the supervisors were there it it it it started the investigation starts right away
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:48.560]  i see i see well so you know we've had situations where uh there was a video perhaps you've seen
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:55.280]  this one this all went also went viral um a woman is sitting on a curb handcuffed with her hands behind
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:00.560]  her and she's smart mouthing obviously the cop and and getting him really annoyed and he basically
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.000]  does a roundhouse kick to her head yeah i did see that remember that and and if i remember correctly i
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.800]  think that the police department the police chief fired him and relieved him of duty and then he
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.960]  but he was reinstated i believe by the police union got his job back and fought against that so i mean
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.280]  you know what you know we have this situation where we're looking at it was like well you know how do
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:29.040]  you the the the old expression is how who watches the watchers you know how do we police the police
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.120]  you know if it's if there's like as you mentioned there can be bad apples there can be good apples
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.920]  but you know there's a you have to have some kind of a system uh some kind of a systemic
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:43.520]  check against a bad apple you know what i'm saying you can't just uh you know i wish everybody was
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.960]  like you when was level-headed and respected the law but you know when you've got bad cops i mean
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.880]  what you know what do we do to uh to to correct that because we can have corruption inside the
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.760]  police force i mean do you have any suggestion about that having you know i wish i had the answer to that
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:09.200]  uh because if i did um you know i'm sure everybody would be looking to me for advice with that but
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:17.840]  i really i really can't you know give a definitive answer as to you know i guess what what each police
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:23.040]  officer needs to do is remember their oath of office remember why they are in law enforcement
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:31.120]  to begin with and you know it's and that brings us to your award from the constitutional sheriffs
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.120]  and peace officers association tell us a little bit about that organization uh i actually had
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:45.760]  the opportunity to go up to uh the convention out in missouri uh sherif mac was kind and generous
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.520]  and blew me out there for the convention and uh it was very interesting it was very eye opening
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:59.120]  as to uh you know the things that are going on in this country that uh you know it is just you
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.360]  know abusive government abuse of the federal government on on you know law-abiding citizens
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.640]  and you know it's it's actually thickening as to what you know things are happening in the federal
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.440]  government yeah absolutely and that's one of the that's the other big concern i think of
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:23.680]  americans everywhere it's not just uh you know a rogue cop and and that they can brutalize people
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.880]  and many times get away with it but it's this systemic corruption that is coming from the
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.320]  militarization of the police and from the central control of the police in washington and we're
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.160]  going to talk to you more about that right after the break we're talking to stan linick the deputy

[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:26.400]  linick he's a police officer from new york actually a deputy sheriff and he was given the
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.720]  deputy sheriff of the year award by the constitutional sheriffs and peace officers association
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:37.440]  and he did it for a video that you probably have seen it it went viral it was uh actually jessica
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:44.240]  and jason bermas were filming and and handing out flyers at the airport in relation to the opt out
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:50.080]  and film campaign that was going on uh this this last uh i guess it was just before christmas was a
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:57.680]  guys uh and that's officer linick and he basically defended their right to do that against a local
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:04.640]  airport official who is trying to um get him to shove them along uh officer linick i guess one
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:10.000]  of the things that i found interesting about that was the fact that you had absolutely no problem
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.920]  being videotaped we see cops go absolutely ballistic and get violent over the fact that
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.840]  somebody is videotaping them but you had no problem with that tell us why no of course not
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.800]  because the fact of the matter is is whenever i'm on a traffic stop and walking around the
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.720]  airport and everything i'm being videotaped everything everything is audio and videotape
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:36.720]  especially the patrol car so i mean i have no problem being videotaped um well you know there
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.840]  there seems to be nothing to hide that's the point that's the point exactly you know when i see a cop
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.280]  who gets so upset about being videotaped it's like you know if you're doing your job if you're
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.080]  doing the right thing why would you be concerned about that and that was precisely the point is
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.520]  that you weren't doing anything that you had to be ashamed of and we had court decision after court
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.960]  decision after court decision overturning local regulations overturning laws and standing with
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.720]  the fact that citizens have a right to videotape in public there is no expectation of privacy
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.200]  for anyone if you're walking around in public especially no expectation of privacy for someone
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:18.640]  who is a representative of the government essentially you know doing law enforcement that
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:24.000]  sort of thing so i found that very interesting that you know as opposed to the officers who
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.080]  will basically get in people's faces and start punching them if they're videotaping you had
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.400]  no problem doing that because you were not doing anything wrong exactly and i might add too that
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:41.600]  you know several times when i've stopped so long um they pulled out their cellular fault
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.800]  and they videotaped and whether they told me if they were doing it or not i personally really
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.440]  don't care because like i said i do everything you know every time i do a traffic stop or
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:58.400]  you know what have you a deal with this i have i have you know it's kind of like the same speech
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:06.080]  you know and i just do it the same way every single time and you know like i said i got nothing
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.960]  to hide and i don't mind being videotaped absolutely you know if you're do if you're not
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.800]  doing anything wrong if you're doing the right thing and if the person is doing the right thing
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.840]  you know they're videotaping why for their own protection you know you're videotaping for your
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.000]  own protection you're videotaping out of your car for your own protection if everybody's doing
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.200]  everything the way they should be doing it in this uh and that's the whole point of the opt-out
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:36.400]  and film campaign ashley jessica was really getting manhandled by the tsa and once her brother started
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.840]  filming it they completely changed the way they approached her the way they uh everything that they
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.960]  did completely changed the point is is that they knew they were being filmed and and they knew that
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.560]  this is a film but they were not going to control that's the other part of it you know the police
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.040]  know that they're being filmed but they believe in many cases i think that they can control that
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.560]  you know i've called my family what they need to do they get pulled over they need to start
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.760]  filming it and they need to make sure that it is streaming live to a service like you stream
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.120]  or something like that so that even if the police officer uh takes away the camera or stomps it as
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:15.040]  we've seen in many cases uh that's already gone up and it's already preserved up their lives so
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.560]  they've got it basically got a record of what's going on for their protection you know if the
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:25.520]  police officer is not going to do that right let me ask you about the practice that is happening
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.600]  in new york city because you're in what upstate new york is that correct upstate new york yeah
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:34.400]  all over the area actually a capital of the state well you know down in new york city you know there's
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.520]  a lot of things that happen down in new york city that are at this point in time aberrant behavior
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:43.440]  we hope they don't become standard behavior throughout the the rest of the country but one
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  of the things that they're doing is this uh just kind of stopping people on the streets and uh you
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.560]  know uh kind of like the you know the gestapo you know your identity papers you know kind of doing a
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.600]  sidewalk audit what do you how do you feel about that well i mean if you haven't been as a police
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:05.760]  officer if you have no reasonable expectation that criminal activity is afloat and you know
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.600]  you want to talk to somebody there's something that says you can't talk to somebody but they don't
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:16.800]  want to um give up their you know information or their driver's license if they're doing anything
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:24.000]  wrong there's really nothing you know you can do that's right they're not doing anything wrong
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.640]  let them go you know it's it's simple now i don't know how you know new york city's policies and
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.440]  procedures are um they're totally different than the rest of the state hang on a second officer

[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:26.080]  back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're talking to stan linick he's a constitutional
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.520]  sheriff and police officer's association deputy sheriff of the year and we're talking to him about
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.560]  about what it's like to actually respect the constitution as a sheriff as a law officer
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.000]  stan thank you for joining us and you know we were talking just before the break about these
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:48.080]  kind of these sidewalk massive uh i guess sidewalk blocks are not roadblocks you know
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.840]  they're doing in new york city where they're auditing people there i guess that's one of the
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:57.280]  things that people are really concerned about is almost kind of like reverting to a gestapo type
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:03.280]  of environment where the police can walk up to you and without any reason that you're breaking a law
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.000]  and start demanding identity papers from you and you know there's other things like that um you
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.760]  know how do you feel about that that's that's not something that you're doing in your jurisdiction
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:18.880]  right now but uh we're seeing that all the time uh near the border of our country not too far from
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.200]  where we are they've essentially declared it a constitution-free zone where they believe that
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:27.840]  they can search and frisk you in your car without any reason kind of like we see the nsa going through
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  people's uh metadata going through their actual phone calls and their email messages without any
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:41.600]  reason for suspicion without taking it before a judge right right yeah i i you know like i was
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:47.920]  telling you before i mean you know any police officer can go up to somebody and you know talk to
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:53.360]  them um you know well like if i go up to somebody i strike up a conversation
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.520]  i'm not going to immediately ask you i need your driver's license you know sometimes you know
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:04.960]  you know we're human too we like you know to talk to people and you know people shouldn't
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:12.080]  feel the fear of talking to us um but you know it goes a step further when you know you start
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.640]  demanding information when somebody has done nothing wrong right um right and that's that's
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:24.160]  where you know you're getting yourself into you know the police officer himself could be getting
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:32.240]  himself in trouble by you know taking it that's that further and and not having a a reason to
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:37.920]  you know ask somebody for their identification exactly you know i was we've got this competition
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.480]  this film competition that's going on operation paul revere and i was just reviewing one of the
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.880]  films last night it was called a drop of water people can find that at info wars.com forward slash
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.640]  p or forward slash paul revere one of the things that they were talking about how tyranny had looked
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:00.960]  under the camere rouge in cambodia and they had a picture of some signs and this sign was up in
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:07.360]  multiple languages uh french english cambodian and the in english it says the security of
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.160]  regulation and it has several different steps here one you must answer according to my questions
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:17.360]  don't turn them away next one is don't try to hide facts by making pretexts of this or that you're
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:24.160]  strictly prohibited to contest me uh you must immediately answer my questions without wasting
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.280]  time to reflect don't tell me about your immoralities or about the essence of the revolution in other
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.680]  words don't appeal to the rule of law and the last one was while getting lashes or electrification
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:42.560]  you must not cry at all i mean this i mean this is not a joke this is actually what is in
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:50.800]  cambodia this is the kind you know this is where tyranny essentially what it eventually winds up
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.160]  with when you have people who don't respect the rule of law who don't respect the constitution now
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:02.560]  you said that uh you uh learned quite a bit when you went to the constitutional sheriffs convention
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.320]  about that tell us a little bit about that well you know first of all i just want to comment on
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:15.840]  on that sign um first of all i feel sorry for the people of cambodia they have to deal with this
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.360]  this tyranny um second of all that's why our constitution is at place absolutely because
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:27.760]  our forefathers left the country that was like that and they came here and they wanted to be
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:35.840]  free people and they they wrote this precious document um to to protect themselves from stuff
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:45.440]  like that and and going and uh to missouri to uh the constitutional sheriffs convention um
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:52.960]  but you know it was all about you know the constitution and that's what that is the supreme
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:00.080]  law of the land all right uh you've taken out to that right from the walkie uh i remember correctly
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:08.080]  him saying you know god wrote the constitution and you know and gave it to us he wrote the
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.480]  ten commandments and he gave us the constitution and you know well you know you really don't need
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:24.880]  any other you know laws than that i mean you know it's it's and it's a very dangerous thing when
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:31.040]  you have as we began the program we had quotes from jimmy carter we had quotes from former senator
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:37.040]  from new hampshire gordon humphreys we had a quote from the former um treasury department
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.840]  official paul craig roberts all of them talking about how illegitimate our government has become
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:48.400]  because it has separated itself from the constitution and once you do that your government is illegitimate
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.600]  and it's even more dangerous than that because we see it from the police officer on the street
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:59.200]  to the occupant of the oval office that when they sever themselves from the constitution
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.480]  basically they become dictators that's literally what dictator means it means the law is in my
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.360]  mouth i'm going to dictate to you whatever the law is at this moment there is no authority
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.560]  higher than me it's essential that we have a rule of law that we have something that people
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.280]  swear allegiance to and that we hold them to that uh allegiance we're going to take some calls right
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.560]  now we've got uh chat in kentucky chad what have you got it you have you got a question for uh stan
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:31.120]  linick yeah i just want to i got two kind of questions uh the first thing um i mean it it's
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.760]  hard for me it's kind of a hard question to ask but like you really think that we're still living
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.120]  under the constitution with people you know judges saying that they don't allow the constitution in
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.240]  court and you know people getting arrested for playing with toy guns and stuff like that i mean
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:54.320]  i mean are we really under that or what's going on here you know you know getting arrested for
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:01.840]  toy guns i mean that's absolutely ridiculous you know i mean what is what is this country
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:08.400]  coming to when you know you have you have you know kids you know like when we were kids we
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:15.200]  played with toy guns nobody got hurt you know it's just we had to draw the lines somewhere
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.120]  absolutely it gets even worse than that uh stan that there was a couple of cases
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.480]  one one kid was eating a pop tartan because he took some bites out of one side the other
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:26.160]  kid said look he's making a gun and then they kicked him out of school had another kid
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.840]  had actually physically arrested by the police i think he was uh eight or nine years old actually
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:36.000]  physically arrested handcuffed and taken away by the police there at the school because he was
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.040]  belching in class absolutely ridiculous yeah i mean you know there's no sense of proportion we
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:50.560]  have you know drug dealers and and and and you know bad crime and and a lot of these cities in
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:56.880]  our country and we're worried about if the kid is saying gun in school i mean come on where are
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.280]  priorities absolutely you know absolutely let's take a question from robert in california robert
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:10.560]  you're live on the show how are you done okay what's your question okay i just wanted to bounce
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:18.240]  an experience off of off of your guess there about um what happened to me i was in a federal park
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:25.120]  with a friend of mine on my mountain bike and um ran into this federal park ranger who like you're
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.520]  saying he just he acted like he was just a complete gestapo you know officer towards us you know he
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.400]  he's you know we were on a dirt road and he says you know put your bike over there and get down on
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.720]  the ground what were you doing you were just riding your bike and he just he just ordered
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.960]  you to get off of your bike were you writing it down on the ground and um why do you think he did
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.760]  that american you know being an american and being you know raised to believe that i live in a free
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:58.240]  society i said well you know what authority do you have to make me sit on the ground and that's
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:05.040]  when he just he really freaked out you know and um was he exactly what was it what exactly were the
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:11.600]  precursors to him coming up to you that i i guess i i i need a little bit of elaboration on that
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.960]  yeah was that an area where you were not allowed to ride a bike or something like that were the
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.160]  regulations about not riding a bike in the park or apparently so on that but there was no sign
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:28.160]  posted and i thought it was uh uh you know a place where you could ride i see i see so so anyways
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.040]  instead of just instead of just tell you you were concerned about the uh the way that he
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.560]  imported himself towards you that that he would uh uh get real hostile immediately in the in the
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:44.800]  situations that are just telling you informing you that you you've got to stop yeah yeah and um just
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.880]  just to force you down on the ground because if you look at if you just look at world history
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.080]  who was that person who told you you can sit on the ground and now you can ride that was a king
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.040]  right i mean a king said you know when you went to go see the king you would bow down on the ground
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.840]  right and then he would say okay you can rise now so i mean what what i'm saying is all you have
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:09.280]  to do is get a job with the federal government now and you're a king and we in america we were
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:17.360]  getting rid of kings yeah right i mean and and now i look at history and um i mean you can
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.720]  mouth off to the king back you know hundreds of years ago or the queen i mean you know ann
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:27.360]  belin who is queen of england would ride down the street her carriage and everyone would shout
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:33.280]  or add her because she wasn't that popular and now you can't even blink at a at a at a government
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.200]  employee well you know i think i think stan that kind of goes back to respect for the
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.320]  constitution what we're just saying that if you don't have any respect for the constitution the
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.600]  rule of law you can kind of become following that trap of being a dictator right that's correct
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:51.840]  power corrupts people and if you uh if you are if you were the law instead of enforcing the law
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:59.120]  then basically uh that is the ultimate corruption let's talk to uh kevin in florida kevin hey
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.120]  mr night thank you for taking my call i just want to say that you and the crew are doing a great
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:08.640]  job on the nightly news every night and i love watching it on my roku oh thank you mr linick
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:16.720]  thank you so much for keeping your oath and being human we need more of it i got a question um
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:23.440]  let me just give you a little background i noticed shortly before fast and furious was busted that my
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:30.560]  county pd worked with the atf in order to create a sting operation using a fake pawn shop to purchase
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:39.280]  illegal firearms and they got over 270 stolen firearms and you know dirty dirty guns uh also
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.000]  they infiltrated the drug culture of their own drug culture even more and uh fed system um the same
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.560]  operation occurred in many other large cities in the same time period shortly before fast and
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:58.880]  furious mr linick and mr night uh do you think that police departments may have helped the atf
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:05.600]  find dirty firearms in order to fund the mexican drug cartels that were supported by welsh bargo
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:13.120]  and walk over you i don't know what do you think stan any opinion on that um you know i honestly you
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:19.760]  don't we can't really say for sure you know right i i i don't know for sure i mean i can't uh i mean
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:26.400]  the especially where we're we're on that it's it's pretty rural i mean our airport
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.280]  is not really that big it it's called an international airport for the fact that we
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:39.440]  have one flight to canada there and back a day um you know so as far as you know what we do here
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:48.720]  is um there's a a gentleman by uh pastor moeller who works in the city and what he does is he um
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.240]  he takes he takes in cooperation with the albany police and the sheriff's department
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:46:02.560]  um it's kind of like a gun buyback um whether the gun is legal illegal whatever uh you bring a gun
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:10.560]  to one of these um one of these events and you're given a hundred dollar gift card to to you know
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:19.280]  wherever um no questions asked and it's been very successful um you know you you turn a gun in
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.520]  and no questions are asked and it you know and you get a hundred dollar gift card um i think
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.120]  that that's a great program but don't you think that they're going to turn in a lot of guns that
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.920]  really don't have any value i mean you know if somebody could sell a gun uh if it's worth more
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.960]  than a hundred dollars don't you think they could could sell that somewhere else well they probably
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.680]  could but you know a lot of times you know you know people don't nowadays people don't want guns
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:52.080]  they're afraid of guns and you know this is a way of you know getting a gun off the street or
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:59.360]  instead of you know you know given it to somebody else or you know you get something out of it
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.280]  yeah it's uh yeah i guess uh that could work i guess concern some people have had is that um
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:08.960]  you know a lot of times if somebody's gotta get maybe they got it from a relative who used to
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.280]  know how to use it and wasn't afraid of them but sometimes they might get those guns if there's no
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.080]  questions asked they it might be a stolen gun you know we see uh many cases where they're putting
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.160]  information out as to the location of gun owners and that's almost an open invitation for somebody
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:26.160]  break in there steal it and if there's a program out there where they can just turn it in with no
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:32.240]  questions asked that that's also a concern i have um let's go to uh ronnie in texas ronnie are you
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:39.840]  there thank you sir and deputy sheriff i'm asking your opinion i was attending a public meeting and
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:45.680]  i wanted to address an item on the agenda and waited my turn and when was my turn after taking
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:51.920]  three pages and notes about this very issue the county judge broke the courtroom and before
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:57.200]  allowing me to ask my question about the 25 million tax payer dollars going to a profit making
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:05.600]  hospital he asked me and only me he said well do you have anything relevant to say to which i
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:11.760]  responded please judge stop asking me such any other questions that was reason enough for him to
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:20.320]  to call over the deputy sheriff escort me out of the building ban me for actually ban me for four
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:28.400]  months they took me out of the building and put me in handcuffs luckily uh a more mature uh knowledgeable
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:35.040]  sheriff or sheriff deputy uh stopped them from taking me to jail on that question but i'm still
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:43.920]  to this day i'm banned from public speaking at a public meeting for what i just described to you
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.960]  and it's interesting you know because that's interesting judges have uh they basically
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:53.360]  have their own little beef and beef them in kingdom you know that they operate under and
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.880]  we're going to be talking about that in the next hour with someone from the fully informed jury
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:01.360]  association but you know they can basically they have a lot of leeway with what they can do charging
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:07.040]  you with contempt issues but to go that far and ban you from speaking at any public meeting i don't
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.680]  see uh what the legal support for that is that's against your first amendment right of freedom
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:16.640]  speech yeah i would think so that goes totally against that yeah what right does he have to
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.960]  you know to ban you from speaking in a public place yeah that's pretty amazing right well let's
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:30.720]  go to scott in iowa scott how you doing are you doing good what's your question scott well um we've
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:39.200]  seen uh i i know i've seen quite a handful of videos where um a police officer is man handling or
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.960]  what appears to be an assault on camera and later on it turns out that the uh that his boss or a
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.000]  prosecutor or somebody actually charged that officer with assault um one video in particular
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.360]  was down in texas where uh one officer ran up to another officer who had a guy in handcuffs
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.680]  the guy in handcuffs wasn't struggling but he ran up put a knee in his back threatened to kill him
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:06.080]  if he moved um and then was subsequently fired shortly after the fact my question to you is is
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:11.120]  if you were in that situation and you saw an officer doing something like that that you knew
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.040]  wholeheartedly and and within the law was completely and totally uh uncalled for would you
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:24.400]  act uh on that by i don't know maybe arresting them or um you know doing whatever you could
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:30.480]  to stop them from assaulting that person well what i would do of course is you know that the
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.960]  threat is immediate you know i'd call and say hey back off he's already in cops leave him alone
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:39.920]  number one and then i would you know i would have to you know go to my supervisor and say hey look
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:46.240]  at you know he's already in cops and i know the guys that i work with and i know this you know i
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:51.760]  believe this wholeheartedly that all the guys that i work with would not do such a thing we're coming

[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.880]  linick deputy sheriff of the year from the constitutional sheriffs and police peace
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:33.200]  officers association and we want to talk to him a little bit about what was discussed at the
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.480]  constitutional sheriffs convention where he got the award stan i've got a question for you you know
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:45.600]  what is it that the public can do to stand with constitutional sheriffs and law enforcement
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:52.480]  officers i mean we've got a situation right now where there's a sheriff in florida that was deposed
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:59.760]  and is facing uh criminal charges because uh he let someone go that he he felt was falsely arrested
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.680]  and uh his deputies i guess complained to local law enforcement but but what things other than a
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:11.280]  full blown conflict like that what what can we do to uh to kind of sort that out how do we tell who
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.720]  the uh who the good guys are uh when we're voting for sheriff because that's an elected position
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:23.680]  well yes of course uh you know sheriff is an elected position and uh you know i'm sure you know
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.960]  their opponents or whoever is running against them uh if they hold a public forum a question
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:39.120]  and answer forum um i think that's an opportune time to pose these questions to um your your local
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:43.520]  elected sheriffs now you said you learned some things sorry you said you learned some things

[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:09.680]  the constitution it's just like a lot of people i see are intellectualizing about kids with guns
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:16.720]  pop tart guns to me it's all coming down to conditioning the public but they're saying
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:24.240]  all these new laws are for our safety now do you feel that all these new additional laws like i
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.560]  understand the common sense of no texting because a lot of people don't have common sense of drive
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:35.120]  let alone text and drive do you do you think a lot of these additional laws quote unquote for our
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:41.680]  safety are just giving the police more probable cause to pull people over and that's number one
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:51.040]  number two based on Holden you know um eric himler i call him um he's has the uh perjury he has

[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:16.880]  to bring charges additional charges against zimmerman i mean first of all now you want to

[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:13.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:22.480]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:33.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and we were just
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:39.120]  talking to stan lenick deputy sheriff of the year from the constitutional sheriffs and police
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:44.720]  officers association you know it's really important for us to understand that there are good police
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:50.480]  officers out there there are police officers who respect the rule of law who respect the
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:55.920]  constitution who are not afraid to be videotaped that was one of the things i think when i saw
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:01.760]  that videotape of officer lenick that went viral there in the airport he was absolutely not afraid
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:07.200]  to be videotaped as he said when we were talking to him if he's not doing anything wrong that's
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.400]  actually there for his protection and that's why we as citizens videotape the police in our
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:18.000]  encounters is for our protection and so you should not shy away from doing that that is your legal
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:25.840]  right he recognizes that as though all officers who really follow the law now we're going to have
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:29.920]  in the next segment we're going to be talking to a representative from the fully informed jury
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:35.200]  association and we're going to talk about what goes on in court we're going to talk about something
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:42.240]  that actually you can do directly to change this country many people don't realize that one of the
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:48.240]  key things that caused the alcohol prohibition and we know what a corrupting influence that was
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:54.800]  unfortunately alcoholism went up addiction rates went up violent crime and corruption of the police
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:02:00.080]  went up during alcohol prohibition the same thing that we have seen with drug prohibition
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.680]  it's not about whether or not alcohol is good for you or bad for you it's not even about
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:09.040]  whether the drugs are good or bad for you it's about what prohibition does the way it corrupts
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:14.480]  society the way it destroys the rule of law destroys our rights and so you have certain
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.600]  rights and and that prohibition was ended effectively by a lot of juries who refused to
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:25.280]  send people to prison for violating alcohol prohibition rules we've seen the same sort
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.160]  of thing happen in some notable trials about marijuana and some other issues and so we're
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:36.080]  going to be talking to kirsten uh about from the fully informed jury association about the role of
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:41.280]  juries not only what their rights are but what their duties are you know you're there to make
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:47.440]  sure that justice is done for your fellow man and i know that uh when we had the reporters
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:54.400]  contest which is how i got here uh my video was on fully informed juries and i was amazed to find
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:03:00.240]  when i talked to people on the street so many people believed that it was their role as a juror
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:06.800]  to do what the judge told them to do because the judge knew better you know they had basically
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:14.080]  turned over their reason and their rational thought and any skepticism to just a blind
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.840]  obedience to authority and that's why so many of us who are called conspiracy theorists we're
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:26.880]  actually conspiracy researchers we're conspiracy uh fact finders because we don't blindly follow
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:30.880]  everything the government tells us because just because someone works for the government doesn't
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:36.640]  make them an angel it also doesn't make them an authority figure uh if they get outside the rule
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:42.800]  of law if they get outside the constitution they don't have any authority they're now a criminal
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:48.800]  and we're going to talk about what is is told to people in uh courtrooms by judges and uh we're
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:53.840]  going to be having her coming up in the next segment now one news article that really caught my
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:04:01.360]  eye today excuse me came from um wired magazine and they were talking about this uh chinese fellow
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:10.160]  his name is uh uh zao bowen and uh he's actually doing he's a genius and he's doing some genetics
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:16.240]  research uh this is something that could very easily go into a uh real nightmare science fiction
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:23.120]  scenario but listen to how this wired magazine article starts so zao bowen is late for a satanic
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:27.920]  heavy metal concert after haggling the doorman down to half price he pushes into a beijing bar
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.720]  with a ceiling low enough to punch he follows a shriek of guitars and a corridor into a mosh pit
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:37.760]  by strobe lights it's hot as hell and looks like it too men on stage are made up as demons and
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:43.360]  slashing through a song about damnation it seems like when you get into eugenics there's always
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:48.720]  some kind of a satanic connection even at this level and although it may have some beneficial
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:54.560]  effects we have to worry about things like gattaca if you've ever seen that science fiction movie
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:58.880]  but we're gonna be right back and we're gonna talk about fully informed juries so stay tuned
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.200]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:12.560]  every great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars

[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:29.840]  mind of man thomas jefferson welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night fill in for alex
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.640]  and we're going to be talking about a form of tyranny that is not just over the mind of man
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:42.880]  but is uh creeping over our entire society and that is the loss of a time honored tradition of
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:50.240]  liberty of not even a tradition really a mechanism of liberty that's the jury and we're going to be
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:56.800]  talking to kirsten tinen who is with the fully informed jury association she is trying to inform
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:02.960]  jurors what their rights are as well as their duties under the law this is one of the most
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:09.840]  important things that we have as citizens it's it's uh you know you've got the spin said you've
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:15.120]  got the ballot box the jury box and the cartridge box well we don't want to have to use the cartridge
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:22.320]  box in the electoral box is really pretty well corrupted and the jury box is very rarely even
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:32.080]  being used now nearly every trial every everyone who is charged with a a crime does a plea bargain
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.360]  rather than going for a jury trial and so we're going to talk to kirsten and we've got her on
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:43.040]  the line right now kirsten how you doing how are you thank you for joining us now uh let me
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:48.400]  tell people a little bit about you uh you've uh it says on your bio here that uh your pro-liberty
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.440]  activism began in school while you're studying mechanical engineering um actually uh i'm an
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.360]  engineering student myself um i've worked for a while but not as a mechanical engineer but as
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:03.120]  electrical engineer so um you know we've uh what what did you do as uh in college when you were
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:09.440]  starting your activism um i was a member of a political group and we did things like um we
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:14.880]  hosted the million marijuana march in tusan and we hosted debates on campus and things like that so
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:19.520]  well it's interesting that uh you bring that up because i talked this last fall to the new jersey
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:26.640]  weed man who basically uh this is a fellow who had marijuana medical marijuana exemption in
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:32.640]  california and uh he took a lot of marijuana with him to new jersey i think he had something
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.400]  like over a pound of it is a huge quantity so much so that they were charging him with being a uh
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:45.360]  dealer and he decided that um he thought he could get hung juries to let him off if he went with
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.000]  fully informed jury association of course a lawyer won't make that kind of a plea so he
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.560]  represented himself pro se and in his first trial he actually put up a placard of the new
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:02.000]  jersey constitution which says that jurors have a right to judge the law as well as the facts of
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.120]  a case and in that case he got a hung jury even though the judge told him to put it down or he's
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:12.000]  going to throw him in jail the next case the judge was friendly and let him keep that sign up which
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:17.920]  is basically just a printed sign of the state constitution and that's the first judge censored
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:22.720]  that the second judge didn't and in the second trial he got off by uh 12 to nothing he was acquitted
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:29.360]  right and there are many state constitutions that explicitly discussed during nullification
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:36.080]  in one context or another and yet in virtually no state except for new hampshire now um a recent
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:40.400]  development happened last year there but in virtually no state except new hampshire will a
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:46.480]  judge let anyone argue jury nullification directly to the jury even though you know if you look back
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:53.360]  in america's history one of our um supreme court justices was impeached in part because he was trying
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.400]  to deny this right of juries that's right that's right i think the only in uh u.s supreme court
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:02.560]  judged ever be impeached right those one of the articles one of the articles of impeachment against
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:08.640]  the only supreme court justice ever impeached was that he did not in fully inform the jury and yet
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.080]  what we have today and this is why as we get in the show we were talking about how jimmy carter says
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:20.640]  we're no longer democracy we've got a senator gordon humphrey saying that ed snowden has exposed
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.520]  unconstitutional illegitimate functions of government and what he's concerned about is
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:29.520]  that nobody is talking about punishing the people who are doing this and then we have paul craig roberts
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.600]  who is one of the chief economists for ronald reagan saying that our government is no longer
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:39.040]  legitimate because why it doesn't follow the constitution and it doesn't follow the traditions
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:45.280]  that are behind all of this is very very disturbing when we see uh first of all most people are not
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:50.560]  bothering to get jury trials because the juries have become such rubber stamps for the judges because
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:57.040]  they they basically lied to them about their rights and their duties right even in new hampshire
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  new hampshire last year passed a statute stating that the defense must be allowed to argue jury
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:10.320]  nullification to the jury and this was invoked in the case of doug darrell a medical or sorry
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:16.160]  i think a religious marijuana user and he actually won his case but in a more recent
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:22.880]  case that of rich paul the defense argued jury nullification the prosecutor in the closing
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:28.320]  statement acknowledged the right of jury nullification but discouraged the jury from using it and then
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:34.480]  the judge went ahead and used the standard uh spiel that judges give juries telling them that you
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:40.800]  must follow the law as i have given it to you so that is now an appeal and i think part of the
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:47.360]  grounds for that may relate to jury instructions now the and that's the key thing like you said
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:53.040]  that even though they've had this law recently passed in new hampshire what that law said was
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:58.800]  that the judge could not punish anybody for bringing up jury nullification but it didn't
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:03.360]  mandate that they actually tell them what the law is they could actually it allows judges to
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:09.200]  essentially lie to the jurors it's not clear that it allows judges to lie to the jurors
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:16.480]  i think that will be um something that will have to be hashed out in court but i think there's good
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:21.440]  reason to think that that is not what the law says it doesn't if you read the law it doesn't
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:27.520]  specifically state anything about what the judge is or is not to do it it's specifically addressing
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:34.320]  what the defense must be permitted to do so right right exactly but we have these these cases and
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:40.800]  virtually all courts now where the the judge tells them you must do what i say and in most cases he'll
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.520]  tell them that they're not allowed to judge the law they only have to they're only allowed to look
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:51.920]  at the facts of the case and that simply is not true that's not true from our historical background
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:57.360]  and it is not true from the letter of the law that is actually totally incorrect what the judges
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:02.720]  tell people if you look at one of the earliest supreme court cases in the united states history
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:09.360]  uh our first chief justice of the supreme court john j in fact explicitly stated that it was a
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.560]  right of jurors to interpret the law as well as the facts he he said that judges are assumed to
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:19.520]  be the better interpreters but it is in fact the right of juries to do their own interpretation
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:27.040]  if they see fit and that has never been overturned uh there was a court case which uh a supreme court
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:32.960]  case which ruled that judges no longer had to inform jurors of their rights and responsibilities
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:39.680]  but it did not overturn that right so by simply not informing them you know it used to be it used
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:46.560]  to be as commonly understood that that jurors could refuse to enforce unjust laws as it's
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:50.320]  understood today that we're going to get called for jury duty it was it was just a part of the
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:56.240]  culture but once that was um ruled that that jurors judges no longer had to inform jurors of
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:01.760]  that it kind of fell out of common knowledge and so what the fully informed jury association does is
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:08.400]  try to document and and spread the history of that where it comes from it's rooted in English
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:13.440]  common law yeah let's talk about that a little bit you know that goes back most people have heard of
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:19.600]  William Penn the founder of Pennsylvania Quaker and and really it kind of goes back to his trial
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:26.720]  back in England uh where he was arrested because you know they had a law that was uh uh said they
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:30.400]  they could not they didn't have freedom of religion basically and so uh they told him
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.920]  that they could not meet his Quakers they violated that law as a as a matter of conscience and they
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:41.840]  met and the uh they actually chain locked the uh the church house building so they met on the steps
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:48.400]  they arrested him it was a clear violation of the law yet the jury let him go and uh it established
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:53.200]  habeas corpus which says you know show us that you know we uh actually what what they did was they
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:17:00.000]  tried the the judge was so outraged that he locked up the uh the chief uh foreman of the jury uh
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.840]  Edward Bushnell locked him up for quite a period of time and uh he was eventually let go by habeas
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:11.440]  corpus where people said show us the law that the foreman broke when he allowed him to go and they
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:15.120]  didn't have a law and so they established habeas corpus as well as the right of jury
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:19.840]  nullification in that trial right as well as freedom of religion and freedom of speech yes
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:24.960]  and and that juror wasn't just locked up he was denied food and water i mean that guy
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:31.520]  really was essentially you know it was torture of the day and still stuck to his guns and so
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:37.120]  that's something that i i wish people would really take to heart because so many times i get calls
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:43.200]  in the office from someone who will say things like well i didn't want to vote guilty but everyone
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:49.280]  else was and i felt pressured well buck up you need to have a backbone absolutely we have to
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:54.160]  we have to watch each other's backs and that was something that uh that was explicitly said by uh
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:59.200]  patrick henry and others they said that you know the only way this is going to work is if we
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:03.840]  cover each other's backs essentially to paraphrase what he said if we cover each other's backs and
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:08.720]  we are you know in in a trial when the government brings something against us we talk all the time
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.600]  about laws that are absolutely absurd laws that are unconstitutional laws that are
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:20.240]  unjustifiable unlawful and yet where it can actually be stopped we don't have to beg for
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:24.560]  our political leaders to do some of these things we can refuse to send our fellow citizens to jail
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:30.560]  and yet we have the highest percentage of people incarcerated of any country in the world we have
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:36.560]  more people actually in absolute numbers than china with a population many times ours we have more
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:41.920]  people in jail than communist china does so we basically don't have juries who are standing up
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.080]  who are seeing that justice is done for them and and as i said in a report that i did in a man on
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:51.200]  the street i was absolutely amazed this to have people argue with me that no no no you have to
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:55.440]  do what the judge says you you shouldn't seek justice for your fellow citizen you should just
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:01.360]  do what the judge says and in fact i i'm actually encouraged um because we have recently had several
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:07.840]  cases that have been very public where jurors have in fact refused to convict and you can see you
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:13.200]  know look at them they're the jurors aren't getting in trouble it's very clear that they're doing it
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:18.240]  let's take the case of jeff olson in san diego from a week or two ago well let's let's let's cover
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:22.720]  that case right after we get back to break because i want people to call in and talk to us we're

[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:09.120]  keeps getting better better tasting and better stuff in it now just before the break Kirsten
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.280]  you were telling us about some current you're beginning to tell us about some current cases
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:18.800]  that involved fully informed juries yes and I just want to mention everyone can go look on our
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:25.840]  website fija.org for more information about each of these there the most recent one that I'm aware
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:32.800]  of is the case of Jeff Olson in San Diego who was outside of Bank America on a public sidewalk
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:38.880]  and in chalk you know the stuff that washes off when it rains right someone walks on it wrote
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:46.080]  some you know political statements on the sidewalk and was eventually charged with 13 counts of
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:52.720]  vandalism for that putting him at risk of a maximum penalty of $13,000 fine and 13 years in jail
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:59.440]  this is what the city attorney thought was appropriate to charge him with and offered him a plea deal
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:04.480]  that he turned down he wanted to take it before a jury and good for him for doing that because the
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:10.800]  jury acquitted him on all 13 charges and it what was especially funny about this case was that
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:15.840]  while it was going on inside the courthouse police had chalked off an area on the sidewalk outside
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:21.440]  where they were permitting people to chalk messages in his defense and that was not considered
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:27.120]  vandalism it was a clear clear case of selective enforcement it's just amazing it's just amazing
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.160]  how absurd the laws have become you know because we've cut ourselves loose from you know the
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.840]  constitution from basically you know the these these rational boundaries and when you don't have
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:41.840]  boundaries like that anything can happen I mean that's absolutely insane yeah we've covered that
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:48.160]  with info wars that's truly amazing the key thing being that he went to a jury trial because you
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:52.960]  know when you've got really absurd laws like that you need to go before a jury but quite often
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.320]  jurors don't really understand what their rights are so that's what you're trying to do and and
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:02.720]  what do you do with fija to educate people I know that whenever they buy anything from info wars
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:08.000]  we always have these little pocket constitutions that we put in every order and part of that is
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.720]  not just the constitution but it talks in that little in that little booklet that we put in
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:18.240]  there talks a lot about juries and the importance of juries and and your right to judge the law as
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:24.080]  well as the facts of the case exactly well we publish a variety of literature and anyone can
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:32.640]  request a free jury power information kit from us by calling us at 1-800 TEL JURY 1-800 tell jury
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:37.280]  and that same literature that you'll receive in there we have activists across the country
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:43.200]  distributing at courthouses at festivals at community meetings we have people who speak
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:50.720]  across the country do all sorts of outreach and so we also we also celebrate since you mentioned
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:56.320]  the William Penn case this we're getting ready for September 5th which is jury rights day in
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:03.120]  commemoration of that case and on jury rights day we have people out all across the country doing
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:08.880]  all kinds of community events we have banners that people will hold outside we've had people
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:14.160]  march in parades with our banners and give out information at tables at county fairs around
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:20.240]  that time because it's labor around labor day so we have a lot of different ways and we invite
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:25.280]  everyone to visit us at fija.org to find out how they can get involved and volunteer if they'd be
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:30.080]  interested that's great yeah it's it really is an educational effort at this point because people
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:33.920]  have been so hoodwinked and lied to about their rights it's one of the reasons this is the
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:39.520]  citizens rulebook that we put in every order that we send out and if you look at this right the very
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.160]  front of it even before it gets into the constitution it talks about jury rights the jury has a right
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.800]  to judge both the law as well as the facts of the case in controversy that's from our first chief
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:55.600]  justice John Jay over and over again as you mentioned it's a tradition that has been reinforced by
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:01.440]  chief justices by history by the law itself many state constitutions have that written into the law
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:06.160]  let's take some calls from people about this issue we've got tyler in oklahoma tyler what's your
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:14.000]  question hello yes what's your question tyler um it was more of a suggestion um you know you're
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.800]  talking about the importance of a jury trial well it goes to you know traffic um court especially
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:25.840]  here in oklahoma it's a criminal offense and if they change the system limit into where unless
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:29.200]  there's six months in prison or fifteen hundred dollars in fine you don't have the right to a
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:34.480]  trial by jury well therefore becomes a bench trial and so you don't have a chance to win
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:38.960]  in a bench trial because the state is prosecuting you the state is testifying against you you know
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:44.160]  the state is judging you um my suggestion would be us try to get the system then to change back
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.760]  because hang on hang on we'll get to you right after the break we'll be right back we're taking

[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:31.040]  the info war welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex today and our
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:37.520]  guest is christin tynan and we're talking about juries about their rights and their duties you
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:41.600]  know juries are there to watch your back and if you're ever fortunate enough to be on a jury you
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:47.120]  need to watch the other person's back you need to make sure that the laws are really just laws
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:51.040]  that they're constitutional laws and that they're also just laws and that's what juries are there
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:55.680]  for and we were just talking on the we had a call on the line tyler from oklahoma and he was
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:01.760]  telling us tyler you were telling us that they have basically done away with juries in oklahoma
[02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:07.760]  unless it's over a certain amount of money is that correct yes the sixth amendment was changed
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:13.360]  i believe it everywhere um is that unless they're six months in prison or fifteen hundred dollars in
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.880]  fines you don't have a right to a trial by jury so therefore in traffic violations you know they'll
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.600]  give you a $250 ticket and it doesn't make sense to go hire an attorney for a thousand fifteen
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:27.440]  hundred dollars to represent you so of course you're just going to plead guilty and it's just
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:35.600]  to create a monopoly and a cheap one um my issue is go ahead go ahead go ahead sorry um my issue
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.000]  is is i think if we get the sixth amendment changed to where we don't have that restriction and we
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.000]  would have juries um you know we would be able to have the opportunity to present cases such as
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.160]  you know the right to travel there's been yet several u.s supreme court cases saying that you
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:55.600]  have the right to travel and you know of course you're never going to win that type of case and
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:35:00.800]  they've been to trial so if you had a jury actually reading cases such as the the right of a citizen
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:05.920]  to travel upon public highways and to transport his property their own either by carriage or by
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:11.200]  automobile automobile is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit permanent at will
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:15.600]  but a common law right which he has under the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:20.560]  thompson vs smith if they were to read stuff like that they would wake up and realize that the
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:25.600]  government has conditioned us starting off with such things as powers license marriage license
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:29.520]  hunting license well you know and it's broader it's broader than that tyler because you know we
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:34.960]  have situations like uh the irs has their own tax court right which is an administrative court it's
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:40.720]  not really a uh constitutional court you've got the epa has its own court so in many of these cases
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:46.320]  you have these created entities that uh write their own law as regulators they enforce their own
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:50.560]  law and they judge with a panel like you said a bench trial without juries they judge whether
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:54.480]  or not you're in violation of that law what do you think about that kirsten well i have good news
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:36:00.720]  the sixth amendment has not been changed the bad news is that it is being disregarded so
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:05.280]  changing it back is not going to help because it hasn't been changed in the first place it still
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:11.840]  states that in all criminal prosecutions you have the right to trial by jury that's right it's simply
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:16.720]  it's simply being ignored that's right and if they if they have a law that says uh well the
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:22.000]  sixth amendment doesn't apply uh unless it's over a certain amount that has no more effect than if
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.520]  they say well if you're within a hundred uh miles of the border that's a constitution free zone i mean
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:32.160]  they don't have the authority and neither actually does the supreme court have the authority to them
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:37.760]  to amend the constitution there's a very specific process for where the constitution is amended
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:41.680]  and it isn't done by fiat of some state legislature or even by the congress
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:47.440]  and one one tactic that i want to mention that is similar to what the caller was talking about
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.400]  is that in the state of oregon there is a situation that i became aware of last year where several
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:59.360]  i mean dozens and dozens of occupy protesters have been arrested and treated like criminals
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.840]  they were handcuffed they were taken to jail they were held then once they were once the public
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:10.640]  spectacle was over and it became clear that that that was going to be a big problem the court system
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.400]  the district attorney decided to drop the charges to the level of essentially a traffic ticket and
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:22.560]  so they started getting bench trials for for things for which they have been treated as criminals
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:27.280]  well a non-related case was going through the appeals court in oregon at the time
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:33.280]  um and it was ruled that these defendants could not you couldn't do this bait and switch on these
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:38.720]  defendants they were to be given the right to trial by jury and last i checked that's still
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:43.600]  being argued but um it was a question of whether or not they were going to get jury trials whether
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:47.920]  or not all the charges were just going to be dropped because it was clogging the courts or
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:52.480]  whether um the district attorney i guess in that case was going to appeal the charges so
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:57.680]  but it's a very common tactic that they will treat you as a criminal when they're arresting you when
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:01.840]  they're jailing you before you have you get to court but once you get to court they want to
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:06.400]  change the rules so it's more favorable for them in court well you know and and and people are
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:10.400]  listening to their sir thinking maybe well you know i'm a law-abiding citizen i would never do
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:16.080]  anything to offend the government or whatever let's remind people that it wasn't uh it was just a
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:22.960]  couple of months ago that we had a fellow on a beach uh release three or four heart-shaped balloons
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:28.320]  as part of a uh anniversary or proposal it was something like that and he was charged with
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:33.760]  multiple felonies because each release of a balloon was considered to be a felony right you never
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:38.080]  know when you're going to be swooped up by the police state that's here and there's the article
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:43.360]  right there we've got up there um man faces five years in prison for releasing balloons on the beach
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:48.240]  as a romantic gesture you never know when you're going to be swept up by these insane laws and you
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:53.360]  need a jury of people who have a mind and a backbone to stand up for you against these
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:57.360]  ridiculous laws and you need to stand up for other people as well and let me tell you what's
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:03.840]  going on there we are seeing a huge trend in this country of prosecutors overcharging people
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:10.320]  just increasingly excessively because what they want to they don't want a jury trial they don't
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:15.040]  want you to go to a jury trial they want you to take a plea deal so they will charge you with
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:22.000]  something that is ridiculously excessive and then they will offer you the carrot of you can get off
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.760]  with a slap on the wrist kind of thing and what I like to tell people is that if the if the prosecutor
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:34.080]  is willing to settle for I don't know a fine or community service but if you go to jury trial
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:41.120]  they want to nail you for 80 years and that's an actual case then what is it what is the math there
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:45.920]  the math is that your right to trial by jury they're charging you 80 years of your life to
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.640]  exercise that that's what they're doing yeah the difference between what they're willing to settle
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:55.920]  for in court and what they're willing to settle for if you simply knuckle under to petty authority
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:01.120]  that is your the price you're paying for a jury trial and that is disrespecting our right to jury
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:05.760]  trial it's using it against us if we exercise it you're better off to represent yourself pro se
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:10.720]  than to give into that kind of stuff like that I mean you know and go for a fully informed jury
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:15.760]  plea just like the new jersey weed man said you know in that first trial where he got over half of
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:21.760]  the jurors to let him go he said he put up the the law from the new jersey constitution even
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:26.080]  though the judge threatened him and made him take it down right away threatened him with contempt
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:31.280]  and is going to throw him in jail he said it was too late the information was already out there you
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:36.640]  know one of the things that this citizens rule book says it says the only power the judge has
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.080]  over the jury is their ignorance that's what we're trying to cure here with a fully informed
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:47.280]  jury association we're trying to inform people about what their rights and their duties are
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.840]  as jurors we've got a caller here cletus in california cletus do you have a question for us
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:59.040]  hello cletus are you there okay we'll move on to the next one clay in in north carolina
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:07.760]  hi david hi kirsten hi hi what's your question clay um boy what you folks are saying here i just
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:14.000]  there's so many things that's running through my mind the main thing though that the comment i had was
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:24.320]  um the uh emphasis also needs to be just as much on grand juries as pedigrees uh this
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:30.400]  way we uh fight over zealous prosecutors to to tell on what you were just talking about
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:35.280]  right and we actually do deal with grand juries as well i just got an email
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:41.760]  last night from someone who is actually on a grand jury asking for information on what grand
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:48.240]  juries are all about he said um it seems like all we're doing is rubber stamping what the
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:53.360]  prosecution hands us and i'm not sure that's what we're supposed to be doing so uh hopefully we'll
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:58.560]  get him straightened out but in fact grand juries are meant to be a barrier between
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:03.920]  government and the defendant it's there it's supposed to be a hurdle that they have to
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:08.960]  that they have to overcome in order to charge someone it's not supposed to be this rubber
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.240]  stamp um hand sandwich situation that we're also familiar with yeah unfortunately we're
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.440]  seeing that rubber stamp happen at all levels uh you know it's just the grand jury is particularly
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:25.360]  notable about that uh marine in virginia marine have you got a question for us actually what you
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:32.400]  were just talking about when i was in charleston south carolina i was i found out who the chairman
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:37.840]  of the grand jury was i had to sneak into the grand jury behind the prosecutor's back
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:46.160]  and when i was there i saw a cop come in and hand the woman in charge two stacks one he said true
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:51.200]  bill this back the other one he said no bill this stack she came over to me she says i'll just be a
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:55.920]  few minutes i'm thinking yeah right it's going to take hours but within a couple minutes she
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:02.320]  brought them out true bill this deck no bill this deck they don't even have five not even reading him
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:10.640]  to read any of them but that's not why i called i called because unfortunately i called because
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:18.560]  i wanted to know if both the sheriff and the prosecutor are involved in criminal activity
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:25.280]  how in the world can you get that to stop with a jury especially when the grand jury thing is a
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:31.040]  scam and the people basically have to come in if they don't come in to be on the grand jury they
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:36.800]  are arrested and they have to stay there until they true bill or no bill this back and they're
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:43.440]  not allowed to investigate anything how do you get around that that's a pretty complex question
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:50.320]  there's not much that a jury can do in terms of getting rid of a sheriff or a judge who is corrupt
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:54.880]  if that if that doesn't end up in court that's not just not something that a jury can do but what a
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:44:00.960]  jury can do is refuse to check their conscience at the courthouse door and refuse to enforce
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:07.760]  the things that that such a government agent as a corrupt judge or a corrupt sheriff is trying to
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:14.320]  push simply vote not guilty and what i encourage people to do is to keep their mouth shut about
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:20.400]  jury nullification once they get to the courthouse because if it becomes clear at any point that you
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:27.280]  are aware of your full authority as a juror to refuse to enforce unjust laws you can be excluded
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:33.840]  during for a deer or you can even be removed during deliberations what you cannot be what you cannot
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:40.240]  be removed from a jury for is for expressing doubt about a juror's guilt so i suggest not
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:46.640]  trying to convince anyone else on the jury to nullify simply vote not guilty stick to your
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:51.200]  not guilty vote hang the jury if you have to a hung jury is okay it's much better for a defendant
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:56.720]  to have a hung jury than to have a guilty vote against them that they have to appeal so what
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:02.960]  i tell people is show up get on the jury stand up for what is right and then shut up just don't
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:08.560]  discuss jury nullification unless you're you're sure like in new hampshire that's a different
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:13.280]  situation if you're sure that everyone else is kind of on board with that already that's that's
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:18.640]  one thing but don't try and do a 12 angry men's scenario where you're the one lone juror convincing
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:23.520]  everyone else that jury nullification is the way to go because as uh exciting and dramatic as that
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:27.760]  seems it's not likely to play out that way in real life and that's a real important point to make
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:33.440]  there christen i'm i'm glad you brought that up because at any point you know you can get you
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:38.080]  come in there as a juror the defense or the prosecutor can throw you out for any reason
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:43.280]  and the judge can take you off if you're in jury deliberations and you start talking about jury
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:46.640]  nullification he can remove you at that point you know because i always have jurors and they
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.840]  always have alternate jurors so the point that christen just made is very very important inform
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:58.160]  yourself inform other people outside of the trial but once you're there in a courtroom situation
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:04.480]  keep your mouth shut about jury nullification focus on it talk about your objections you know
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:09.840]  to what's going on even if it was clear that uh the person violated the law but like it was in
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:14.560]  the case of the new jersey weed man uh it's clear that he violated the law there was no question
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:19.840]  about that and he didn't deny that he had that quantity of marijuana with him but he was he
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:25.280]  was made that case specifically about jury nullification but once you're there even if
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:29.840]  you're going to nullify it because you disagree with the law you can still say that you find
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:34.720]  issues with the court's case and you can hang the jury if you hang tough eventually they'll
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:38.320]  have to just declare that it's a hung jury and go but if you tell people that you're there to
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:44.960]  nullify the law they're going to remove you in most cases let's go to bill in california bill
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:51.040]  you have a question i've been happy to see you there it's nice to have a sane man at the microphone
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:59.040]  a little humor here we have a uh district attorney who's not the sharpest knife in the drawer
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:07.200]  and he arrested a woman for passing out fija information on the courthouse steps he called it
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:14.240]  jury tampering mm-hmm well any hemdenhard and hemdenhard and about six months later
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:21.440]  it finally dawns on him that the only way to prosecute this case is to show the jury the
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:31.440]  literature she was passing out as we catch 22 right one thing i'll say about that is that um
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:37.760]  people are starting to figure out that um if they go for a bench trial of some sort
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:43.520]  then they can get around the jury in that case but it is in fact not jury tampering to hand out our
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:50.560]  literature our literature discusses no cases we as an organization advocate neither for nor against
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:57.120]  any case in progress we are simply doing general jury education outreach and so what we encourage
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:03.200]  activists to do to try and help protect themselves from these inaccurate kinds of charges is not to
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:10.960]  not to do this in conjunction with any sort of um court case advocacy just do it as a standalone
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:18.320]  effort and if there is a case that is of particular interest in the the community at the time
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.880]  i suggest going out a few weeks in advance and go out every monday or you know whatever once a
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.160]  week in advance to establish yourself as part of the landscape and establish that you are not
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:34.000]  they're advocating for against that case you're simply doing general jury education outreach
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:40.960]  but um do you be aware that in some cases if there's a court an order from the court or something of
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:48.640]  that nature um they may um harass you in a way that does not get you before a jury so that's right
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:54.240]  yeah you know julian hightland that i talked to he he has a video of uh some officers coming out of
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:58.960]  a court and uh trying to entrap him by saying you know tell me what you're doing here what you're
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:02.720]  doing this and you know and he basically handed in the literature and said here read it for yourself
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:08.480]  it speaks for itself all he would say is here it speaks for itself you're safe as long as you do that
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:14.720]  they can't charge you with jury tampering if you're handing out general literature talking about the
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:21.600]  rights of jurors and not specifically mentioning your case well that's that's semi-true they can
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:25.680]  charge you oh yeah oh yeah they can charge you with anything but then they have to it'll be hard to
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:31.120]  make it stick exactly then they have to say why they have to show lies the caller said yeah that's
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:37.120]  great there's certainly not supposed to charge you and but what you know what the what following
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:40.960]  the law is apparently a very challenging thing for law enforcement officers well i mean they're
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:45.440]  still they're still charging people about for videotaping officers and public even though there
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:50.080]  has been court case after court case after court case and people keep winning judgements yeah they
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:54.960]  still they still do it so uh yeah they can do anything they want but at some point and that's
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:58.400]  what we're talking about some point if the jurors are informed they're going to stand behind you
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:05.520]  mark in florida do you have a question for kirsten oh yes i do and i'd like to tag along on the last
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:12.320]  caller uh you can file uh bar grievance against every attorney bar grievance dot nettle help

[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:26.160]  the prosecutor would learn how to to do the paperwork a gentleman was jailed in florida
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:34.160]  for handing out f5j a and i was wondering if f5j a has a uh haby is called this template or something
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:39.600]  to help get these people out of jail because they are falsely accused falsely charged and once they
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:45.600]  can get out then they can file the complaints against the the officers that are locking them up

[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:24.160]  kirsten tinen with the fully informed jury association we're talking about your rights and
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:30.480]  your duties as a juror and just as we got dr who there yes we've taken some time travel here we've
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:37.120]  also we've talked about the tradition of fully informed juries as well as the legal rights of
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:40.560]  fully informed jurors and whenever you order anything from info war store dot com you're
[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:44.560]  going to get one of these citizen rule books and it is not just a citizen rule book of the
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:49.920]  constitution it actually says it's got a bill of rights and a jury handbook and i like this little
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:54.320]  tag here that's on the cover says the fireworks are in the document that's right they're not just
[02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:58.240]  something we shoot off on the 4th of july and inside there you're going to find one of the
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:04.000]  first things you come across is about jurors and it says the only power the judge has over the jury
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.040]  is their ignorance and we're trying to end that ignorance by informing people what their rights
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:14.240]  and duties are and we've got kirsten tinen as i mentioned from fija dot org on the line and we
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:19.680]  just had a caller ask you about if you're doing a literature handout on the courthouse steps
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:25.840]  and they decide to unlawfully charge you do you have an information packet that helps with that
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:31.520]  we actually have guidelines for activists to avoid getting arrested in the first place
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:37.200]  that's even better exactly we we don't want anyone getting arrested that plays right into
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:42.000]  the hands of the government it's a script that's been written by the government and they know how
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:48.880]  to act that out very well so in the in the case in florida where there was an order not to hand
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.400]  out a certain literature we actually were in the process of challenging that civilly when it was
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:56:00.080]  violated and unfortunately once someone got arrested and it was reported in the news that
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:05.440]  they were associated with us our court challenge was thrown out of court which was unfortunate we
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:10.320]  had pro bono representation from the aclu and from the walters first amendment law group down in
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:17.520]  florida but we have elsewhere in florida been very successful we had an activist who did indeed
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:22.880]  assert his rights and go through the process without getting arrested to insist upon those
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:28.880]  rights and there's now a memo on our website from david b eddie administrative judge of the
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:35.120]  circuit court fifth judicial circuit state of florida that states and i quote based on principles
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:39.200]  of free speech i believe that whoever is distributing the hands up handouts and questions are right to
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:45.040]  do so accordingly i see no reason why the handouts must be excluded from the jury assembly room
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:50.640]  i believe we may trust yours to follow the law as instructed by the judge right so this this person
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:56.640]  obviously disagrees with jury nullification but he is he has stated it's perfectly you know within
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:02.080]  our rights to distribute that and without anyone getting arrested we have a memo from this judge
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:06.160]  in that district so well that's great you know that that's the important thing is that you get
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:12.000]  the word out that we establish a legal precedence that we don't have the bad publicity that somebody
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.640]  got arrested for exercising their constitutional rights but again i would remind people that you
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:21.280]  know uh just as we occasionally have police jurisdictions where they arrest people for
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:27.120]  videotaping that is your right and if you don't exercise your rights you will lose them to uh
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:31.920]  through apathy through non-use and so it is important that you stand up even though you may
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:37.520]  there may be some consequences for it but it is not illegal right and you definitely can insist
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:44.640]  upon your rights in a way that is not going to put you as at as much risk as in in the case where
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:49.920]  the arrest happened in florida that individual didn't even get a jury trial that is a huge risk
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:54.960]  he not only lost his freedom for that amount of time but he lost income you know and all of that
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:02.640]  whereas you know that person just before we had you we had stan linick who is the constitutional
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:07.600]  sheriff's and police officer's association uh deputy sheriff of the year and one of the things
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:12.240]  he said was you know it's the way you interact with the police sometimes you can defuse a
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:17.760]  confrontational issue like that just by being wise about what you say and that's where your
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:22.400]  materials that you have at fija come in they not only educate people but they show them how to do
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:28.320]  it we're out of time thank you so much for talking to us and explaining that to us and uh we want to
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:32.240]  keep up on this and it's an information war we want to inform people of what their rights and
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:36.240]  their duties are thank you so much for joining us today kirsten tinen thank you for having me
[02:58:36.240 --> 02:59:01.520]  that's it for today we'll be back tomorrow at 11 central
