[00:00.000 --> 00:08.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now already the second day hard to believe of April 2015.
[00:08.400 --> 00:13.680]  I'm back for my successful hernia surgery yesterday. Praise God. Thank you all for your prayers.
[00:13.680 --> 00:18.880]  Here's two excerpts of reports filed by Joe Biggs and John Bowman. We'll be back to kick off
[00:18.880 --> 00:20.720]  the main transmission. Stay with us.
[00:20.720 --> 00:32.320]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Now over the weekend, the 143rd Airborne Battalion conducted
[00:32.320 --> 00:38.560]  exercise at a north regional Texas airport. Soldiers hit the ground running Saturday morning,
[00:38.560 --> 00:45.200]  taking part in an assault landing exercise at the north Texas regional airport in Denison.
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.280]  We had a fictitious enemy situation in which we did detailed mission planning for said
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.240]  Lieutenant Colonel Krupp. We had a fictitious enemy situation in which we did detailed mission
[00:56.240 --> 01:02.640]  planning for. Why is Texas continuously being labeled as hostile? Why are all these enemy
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.760]  situations happening in Texas? What is going on? What is the military really truly planning for?
[01:08.320 --> 01:12.880]  And my other question is, is we spend millions and millions of dollars in taxpayer money
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.120]  to build these training facilities on government property. So the soldiers themselves
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.720]  and their, their officers can train without being bothered, without bothering other people
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.160]  and go about it, you know, in a professional manner. We have no problem with that because
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.280]  that's what the money is for. But there is a big problem when you start bringing these training
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.400]  exercises off of government property and into people's backyards. It is a conditioning. It is
[01:36.400 --> 01:45.040]  a scythe to get people used to seeing military presence every day. Around 250 of the over 800
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.000]  soldiers in the battalion took part in the airfield seizure operations, learning to take down an
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.520]  enemy. But this exercise was different. In the video that we're going to go to, the Lieutenant
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.200]  Colonel even says that typically training like this does not happen off base. This happens on
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.440]  base. This is the reason we spend the money on these facilities. And the fact that these guys
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.880]  are not using the facilities is why it's alarming that they keep moving all of a sudden from these
[02:12.880 --> 02:19.840]  bases and off into the civilian population. Typically training is done on an active military
[02:19.840 --> 02:26.720]  base, not a public airport, but the changing location benefits the soldiers. It gives us a
[02:26.720 --> 02:30.160]  different look and a different piece of terrain to actually operate over. We're not doing this
[02:30.160 --> 02:34.080]  to scare people. We're doing this to bring awareness to the fact that this is conditioning.
[02:34.080 --> 02:39.920]  This is used as a scythe to get you the public to being used to seeing this kind of stuff happening
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.320]  all the time. So when it does happen, you're not quite ready. You just think it's another
[02:44.320 --> 02:50.560]  training operation. Inside of the house, they located a body of a male individual Caucasian
[02:51.200 --> 02:56.480]  mid forties and who appeared to be deceased. They contacted paramedics. LA city paramedics
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.880]  responded, checked the individual and confirmed that he was in fact deceased inside of the house.
[03:00.880 --> 03:08.080]  Andrew Getty, grandson and heir to the fortune of oil Baron J. Paul Getty is dead. A law enforcement
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.720]  source told the LA Times that Getty was found naked from the waist down in the bathroom of
[03:12.720 --> 03:18.080]  his Hollywood Hills estate and appeared to have suffered from some type of blunt force trauma.
[03:18.080 --> 03:23.760]  It's unclear whether the injury was caused by a fall or something else. A woman found in the
[03:23.760 --> 03:29.200]  Los Angeles home when Getty's body was discovered by police is being questioned. The same woman,
[03:29.200 --> 03:37.360]  Andrew Getty, worth $2.1 billion, sought a restraining order against two weeks ago. In 1966,
[03:37.360 --> 03:42.240]  the Guinness Book of World Records named J. Paul Getty, the world's richest private citizen.
[03:42.240 --> 03:48.080]  Getty's legacy as a hoarder of wealth and antiquities is unparalleled. He was so miserly,
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.840]  it cost him his grandson's right year when he would not pay the Italian gangsters the $17
[03:53.840 --> 03:59.360]  million ransom they demanded. During the Great Depression, Getty shrewdly diversified his
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.920]  earnings picking up American oil companies. Oil reserves were discovered in Saudi Arabia 1938.
[04:05.920 --> 04:14.000]  Just 11 years later, J. Paul Getty plunked down $9.5 million in cash on a tract of barren land
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.560]  on the border of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. $30 million and four years later, that tract was
[04:20.560 --> 04:27.760]  producing 16 million barrels a year. The Russian oil goliath Boucan bought Getty oil in 2000,
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.920]  sold it in 2011, and Getty petroleum oil spiraled into bankruptcy.
[04:31.920 --> 04:38.720]  And LA County Coroner says the death appears to be from natural causes. It was originally
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.440]  thought to be accidental because of medication found at the scene. Why blunt force trauma?
[04:43.440 --> 04:48.880]  Why is a hostile woman cooperating with the LAPD? Why were there massive amounts of blood
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.840]  all over the crime scene? And last but not least was Andrew Getty really murdered. John Bown for
[04:55.840 --> 05:01.680]  infowars.com. Yeah, the blunt force trauma was to his rectum. Used since before the days of the Roman

[08:25.600 --> 08:32.880]  In the info war I'm back. 24 hours after herning a surgery praise god it went off really well.
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.520]  I'm just concerned I feel so good that I might end up busting internal or external
[08:37.520 --> 08:45.520]  stitches I mean I felt like a billion dollars yesterday after I had the surgery I'm taking
[08:45.520 --> 08:49.520]  about half of the pain medication that I'm supposed to take and I don't even think about
[08:49.520 --> 08:54.000]  tomorrow I'll need pain medication getting out of the car today walking into the office I had a
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.040]  little bit of pain a little bit now but it's just amazing the developments in MD surgery
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.240]  that are out there and that's where I believe in MD medicine as I've always have is truly
[09:06.240 --> 09:13.840]  catastrophic stuff broken legs hernias gunshot wounds root canals all of it amazing science
[09:14.720 --> 09:20.320]  and if you shop around and find the best surgeon so really did a great job at Seton
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.840]  outpatient medical center doctor Livingston did the surgery and I know a lot of folks have had
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.400]  problems obviously because nothing's perfect in this world with hernia surgeries and all
[09:30.400 --> 09:37.280]  doctors are not created equal but praise god it has been miraculous how good I feel and I'm very
[09:37.280 --> 09:42.320]  very thankful for your prayers because hernia surgeries can go bad they had to I literally
[09:42.320 --> 09:47.120]  had intestines sticking out of a peritoneal hernia in my belly button because it's gotten
[09:47.120 --> 09:54.640]  bigger over 14 years from a size of a pencil eraser to the size of a silver dollar and it was
[09:54.640 --> 10:01.120]  it was bad so it basically killed me if it pinched the gut killed my guts that is and then I'd have
[10:01.120 --> 10:07.600]  to you know go ahead something like a colostomy bag so it's it's a good thing when I got over
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.920]  my phobia of surgery after had a bad experience when I was 16 and got in there and got it done
[10:12.640 --> 10:18.080]  before I continued to pinch my intestine they had to bring me down to the lowest level of sedation
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.400]  where they even turned my lungs off so that all the muscles would loosen up so they could do it
[10:22.400 --> 10:28.480]  properly and not hurt me more and so I was pretty much basically almost dead I was on a respirator
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.560]  yesterday for the hour-long surgery that's never happened in my life but I just feel so good and
[10:34.560 --> 10:41.280]  it's not the pain medication I'm on one hydrocodone every six hours instead of two and I got up this
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.680]  morning and hadn't been on it for 10 hours and felt great and I kind of hurt walking around so I
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.440]  took one so it's not the pain medication I've been on hydrocodone before for a broken leg and
[10:51.440 --> 10:57.120]  things like that and hated it so just miraculous maybe I was so stressed out I was like a reset
[10:57.120 --> 11:03.360]  turn the computer off turn it back on but man I feel 10 years younger and it's just a miracle
[11:03.360 --> 11:08.960]  basically so thank you all for your prayers and a great job to the surgeon at least so far
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.240]  but he is rated top of the state right here in Austin I got the top guy rated by WebMD and the
[11:14.240 --> 11:22.240]  rest of it so I want to put a big shout out and thank him as well does 15 hernia surgeries a week
[11:23.840 --> 11:30.960]  did two yesterday so he certainly knocked it out and that's what it's all about now I can really hit
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.600]  the weights hard in about three four weeks and get the rest of this weight off and by the way
[11:35.600 --> 11:40.560]  today when I get off air I want to do an ad for supermill vitality because we've got the photos I
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.160]  took last Friday before the surgery showing what happened in the month or that I guess I went further
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.360]  45 days forgot about the ad I was going to do so now it'll be 45 days 45 days later I lost another
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.760]  six seven pounds but what was most important is I got a big head folks and I've got obviously
[11:58.400 --> 12:03.920]  stress and cortisol has released my body so I have a little bit of jowls left but my gut you
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.840]  could actually see the six pack now see the six pack that's why the hernia got worse because it
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.960]  was all just sucking in I thought you lost weight and they got better but it was the opposite effect
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.640]  that photos there that we took last Friday or a group of photos I want to mesh that with photos
[12:20.640 --> 12:27.760]  of myself five years ago when I hit almost 280 279 and then right through losing 40 plus pounds
[12:27.760 --> 12:33.120]  and then losing that final six seven pounds the six pack I mean we've got it where I actually
[12:33.120 --> 12:37.680]  have a six pack with a tiny bit of fat right on each side and a little bit on I mean it's just
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.120]  amazing what supermail vitality has done for me I'm not trying to go off into a jag here
[12:43.120 --> 12:47.760]  it's just that was the final part of the equation along with the nation I died in the informers
[12:47.760 --> 12:54.080]  life.com products so I'm going to voice that today at two o'clock just a quick ad you know
[12:54.080 --> 13:00.000]  explaining that to people I'm going off on this jag with all this incredible world news just because
[13:00.640 --> 13:07.600]  I'm so glad to be alive when I was 16 I got my leg broken had to have a pin I've told the story
[13:07.600 --> 13:15.120]  before and they had to give me nine times the medication to put me under I kept waking up on
[13:15.120 --> 13:21.040]  the operating table they had to restrain me I remember part of it and then I still was waking
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.600]  up and they just basically finished the procedure with me growling at them and snapping because
[13:25.600 --> 13:29.760]  they were scared to give me more and they already had my leg open and the pin in from the compound
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.760]  fracture. It wasn't a total compound fracture they have another name for it where it doesn't come out
[13:33.760 --> 13:38.480]  of the skin but it basically comes within you know a tenth of a millimeter it's called a spiral
[13:38.480 --> 13:44.720]  fracture a spiral fracture CJ literally knows everything I had a spiral fracture being a long
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.480]  one down the side and they had to fix it put a bunch of screws and stuff in there and it was
[13:50.480 --> 13:58.880]  hell on earth I mean I was alive for awake for surgery it's like a slayer song surgery with
[13:58.880 --> 14:06.720]  no anesthesia rain blood angel of death flying free it was not fun needless to say I mean this
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.760]  I mean I remember the surgeon cussing he had a heart attack and died two weeks later I'm not
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.040]  saying I did that to him he was a former NFL player at the top orthopedic surgeon in Dallas
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.640]  so my dad got me a really great guy he he had a heart attack like a week and a half later
[14:21.360 --> 14:26.960]  and then died about a week after that I guess but the point is is remember this huge surgeon going
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.440]  down with DD what's going on there and what are you doing and they said they never saw anything
[14:31.440 --> 14:35.760]  like it the thrashing the fighting but then I was talking to this anesthesiologist this doctor
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.320]  who was a listener it turned out who I actually knew through one of our sources at the University
[14:40.320 --> 14:48.320]  of Texas in the psychology department from a film we made and I had drinks with him like 15 years
[14:48.320 --> 14:55.360]  ago a couple times at parties and he said don't worry the new stuff will give you a regular dose
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.080]  I predict it's gonna knock you out we'll give you some other stuff to basically turn your lungs off
[15:00.080 --> 15:06.080]  and and and you'll get all your muscles relaxed and he came in at the end he goes no it it took
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.600]  double it took double sorry I'm harping on this I've got all this news to cover it was just so
[15:11.600 --> 15:18.000]  interesting but he was like that's a lot we gave you you know for a 235 pound man we gave you
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.600]  a good dose and then it took four pins not two four injections full to keep me under
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.920]  so I don't know what's going on my physiology but it's not nine times and then they were unsuccessful
[15:31.920 --> 15:37.200]  basically they gave me enough to kill a horse and it wouldn't work that didn't happen yesterday so
[15:37.200 --> 15:43.040]  thank god do you imagine why I was scared but I just got up and did it so thank you I'm not scared
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.400]  of a lot of stuff but I was scared of leaving my kids behind leaving the info war behind
[15:46.400 --> 15:51.040]  but I'm here again not the surgery I was worried about what the anesthesia
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.000]  there is so much news to cover it is all off the charts as usual
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.960]  remember a couple years ago the amazing statements in Reuters of all places
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.560]  Interpol chief armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks he said do like
[16:10.560 --> 16:16.960]  western and southern states in the u.s and vermont has done have open or concealed carry to stop
[16:16.960 --> 16:29.520]  islamic jihad al qaeda attacks amazing common sense well now we've had the very group islamic
[16:29.520 --> 16:35.280]  state that that's who runs this group in kenyon go into a christian college and kill 15 people
[16:35.280 --> 16:40.720]  and the christian college is nice and open so it allows muslims to go there as well they would
[16:40.720 --> 16:46.000]  ask are you muslim and they would ask you to quote different parts of the korean if you didn't
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.520]  they would blow your head off with pleasure and obama will not call them radical islamics he
[16:51.520 --> 16:56.320]  will not even say radical but they'll spend all day on msnbc saying arrest the tea party
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.960]  and died everyone and they've decided not to investigate lowest learner all charges have been
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.880]  dropped so they're going to persecute christians and then let islamic state that's what it is under
[17:06.880 --> 17:13.120]  a new name al qaeda al qaeda islamic state come in kill 15 people and they've promised to hit the
[17:13.120 --> 17:21.280]  u.s and remember a month ago the fbi said all 50 states have isis in them and guess what they do
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.400]  they're all over the internet they're real people they're threatening us on a routine basis
[17:26.960 --> 17:30.240]  to the point of there's been awesome police department investigations not supposed to say
[17:30.240 --> 17:37.280]  more than that but we actually have these people running around and awesome it's a total infiltration
[17:38.480 --> 17:43.440]  this government is treason at the top they're going to use these crises and the
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.040]  stinger missiles hillary clinton gave him from mingazi and she's not getting in trouble
[17:48.560 --> 17:53.840]  makes me so angry islamic gunmen's and you see it in the news now they're threatening other
[17:53.840 --> 17:58.240]  reporters they're threatening police departments and isis just gets to sit there and do whatever
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.480]  they want because they're not even extreme when they killed 300 plus thousand people under the
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.760]  al qaeda banner in libya and syria the last five years islamic gunman storm kenyan college killed
[18:07.760 --> 18:15.200]  15 christians targeted this is out of cnn kenyan soldiers take cover as shots are fired in front
[18:15.200 --> 18:23.440]  of the garissa university college at least 15 people were killed today when a swarm of gunmen
[18:23.440 --> 18:31.920]  stormed the university before dawn and it goes over to um any al qaeda gunman come around here
[18:32.880 --> 18:39.040]  we got every door covered i mean al qaeda show up in armored vehicle we got two barrett's ready
[18:39.840 --> 18:46.880]  lapua's ready uh m4 is ready riot shotgun's ready whole nine yards and and we don't think that's
[18:46.880 --> 18:53.280]  going to happen because they don't attack hard targets they attack soft targets we've got
[18:53.280 --> 19:01.520]  i put in armored doors now oh that's right so that's just how we operate in texas
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.040]  but not in places where the citizens can't own guns and in kenya
[19:09.040 --> 19:13.680]  they're calling for arming citizens that that men and women who want to go take a quick week
[19:13.680 --> 19:18.240]  long course can then be given a government registered gun and that's that's that's not
[19:18.240 --> 19:22.640]  perfect but at least they're recognizing the answer is arming the good guys to take out the
[19:22.640 --> 19:26.080]  bad guys so you don't just sit there and get down in a ditch and have your head blown off
[19:27.040 --> 19:35.440]  i mean i've got firearms right here people think that's so alien no i'm not a prey i'm not a predator

[25:03.200 --> 25:09.680]  injury to the rectal area andrew getty took so much cocaine according to the daily mail and witnesses
[25:09.680 --> 25:14.720]  i wouldn't be surprised if his heart just gave out old friend reveals the party hard lifestyle
[25:14.720 --> 25:22.880]  of oil air who died in his mansion yeah i was out in california last weekend and was in some of
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.880]  these hollywood circles and i tell you it is very sad to see what power and money does to most people
[25:28.880 --> 25:39.200]  and of course it was uh john paul getty the oil baron who brought arnold sortzenegger to england
[25:39.200 --> 25:45.280]  and then the united states i'll just leave it at that but uh i guess his tastes were a little
[25:45.280 --> 25:51.920]  different than his grandsons who likes women just just saying i mean it's okay that hillary likes
[25:51.920 --> 25:57.760]  women or sortzenegger was on the cover of gay porno mags i just don't want to hear the democrats
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.480]  always claiming that the republican party's homophobic when most of leadership is homosexual
[26:03.440 --> 26:10.320]  and uh that's how they blackmail them using these strictures to follow along with the entire
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.680]  globalist program but here it is paramedics found getty bleeding i saw that in the la times but
[26:15.680 --> 26:22.000]  here is it in the daily mail from traumatic injury to the rectal area so looks like he was probably
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.120]  having a little too much fun with his girlfriend so there you have it ladies and gentlemen just
[26:30.080 --> 26:38.160]  not a senseless piece of tabloid news i don't normally cover things like that but when it ties
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.920]  into the getties who are big new world order globalist and so stingy that the main baron
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.800]  would make family when they said at his house make phone calls on a payphone he had in the living
[26:50.800 --> 26:58.560]  room and pay like a hotel hundreds of dollars a night that's going to thousands today to stay
[26:58.560 --> 27:04.640]  in one of the rooms even though he was the quote richest man on paper uh in the world these are
[27:04.640 --> 27:10.720]  the type of people we're talking about in fact at bilderberg they never tip uh people like hillary
[27:10.720 --> 27:15.520]  and others that comes out in the news do not give tips they're all about love and liberalness and
[27:15.520 --> 27:22.960]  then you catch them fencing blood out of prisons to canada to give over a million people hiv and
[27:23.600 --> 27:32.320]  hepatitis as well as other deadly pathogens remember the whole blood scandal of the 90s
[27:32.320 --> 27:39.040]  i mean you name it raiding half the money that was given for kids in haiti comes out in the news
[27:39.040 --> 27:45.840]  nobody gets in trouble the clinton's uh murders all around them just incredible corruption um
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.160]  hillary going after cocktail waitresses two three at a time that's not chauvinistic because she's a
[27:56.160 --> 28:03.280]  woman see they're above the law they are the liberals so if they want to feed your kids rotten
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.480]  food literally slated to be fed to pigs we have that news report coming up video michelle obama's
[28:08.480 --> 28:15.920]  healthy lunches are literally pig food if they want to do all that it's a okay if hillary doesn't
[28:15.920 --> 28:22.720]  want to tip people it's a okay if they want to skimp out on bills it's a okay and then you get to pay
[28:22.720 --> 28:27.920]  for the clinton's new year's vacation to the dominican republic even though he's a former
[28:27.920 --> 28:33.040]  president over a hundred thousand dollars for hillary and all of her friends to go have a good
[28:33.040 --> 28:36.480]  time that's nothing compared to the tens of millions every time obama goes somewhere it's
[28:36.480 --> 28:42.800]  just this corrupt ruling class that then criticizes capitalism and the middle class and the middle
[28:42.800 --> 28:47.520]  class wanting to have nice houses or swimming pools and cars and tells africans you can't have
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.120]  air conditioning or a car not we should get clean cars and air conditioning no you can't have it
[28:53.760 --> 29:00.080]  because if you have it you might get uppity if you have it you might start actually wanting to

[29:11.920 --> 29:17.040]  was done in this country is you kept people illiterate and you kept them at a subservient
[29:17.040 --> 29:22.800]  subsistence level and you broke the men up from the women and you kept the women as the house slaves
[29:22.800 --> 29:30.480]  over the men that's modern feminism is directly translated out of a roman slave manual
[29:30.480 --> 29:36.000]  uncontrolling gall and germanic slaves then translated into french over 350 years ago

[33:56.080 --> 34:02.320]  the scientific technocratic takeover that has been designed publicly announced and is being
[34:02.320 --> 34:12.160]  launched against humanity currently here's how my brain works i get up at about 6 30 this morning
[34:13.440 --> 34:21.040]  i go down to the government computer interface that's what the internet is i interface with
[34:22.480 --> 34:29.440]  info wars dot com on that DARPA system and i am aware of the surveillance grid the entire time i am
[34:29.440 --> 34:36.000]  and i then notice the headline on info wars dot com and drug report dot com islamic gunman storm
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.480]  kenyan college 15 killed christians targeted and i read the article in the latest updates and then
[34:42.480 --> 34:53.200]  i immediately remember boom when they attacked the mall a couple years ago killing a huge amount
[34:53.200 --> 35:00.080]  of people much larger than this attack asking if they were christians and then killing them the media
[35:00.080 --> 35:04.880]  first tried to just say they weren't just targeting christians that's the political correctness and
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.200]  obama of course came out and said there is not such a thing as radical islam we will not even call it
[35:09.200 --> 35:15.600]  terrorism and he said it again recently and then i remember the inner pole chief coming out with a
[35:15.600 --> 35:22.880]  moment of sanity a tiny light in a vast ocean of dark fraud and the headline inner pole chief
[35:22.880 --> 35:26.560]  and of course we have it from info wars dot com we pull it up in reuters that's where it was let's
[35:26.560 --> 35:31.760]  pull the original article if we can arm citizens globally to prevent terror attacks inner pole
[35:31.760 --> 35:38.560]  secretary general ronald noble said something noble told abc news that one of the only ways
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.440]  to prevent terrorist from hitting soft targets was to arm citizens globally noting that the west
[35:43.440 --> 35:48.080]  gate mall siege would have averted and would have been over far quicker if it had taken place
[35:48.080 --> 35:53.840]  and gunfully areas like denver or texas showing he doesn't really get his social topography down
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.320]  correctly denver's not as free as it used to be but let's just say vermont or texas or
[35:59.120 --> 36:05.120]  arizona and that's why these these these these islamists don't hit those targets because i'll
[36:05.120 --> 36:13.600]  assure you you had a mall in texas you're going to have probably if it's a full mall a hundred
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.360]  good old boys who aren't going to wait around the corner under their training like the police
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.120]  and i'm not knocking that training but they train a lot of the cops to wait for backup some
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.320]  departments they charge in a lot of cops do charge yet but in texas when you had the tower
[36:28.320 --> 36:33.600]  shooting citizens just pulled up got their dear rifles out sort of shooting to pin him down or
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.400]  he would have probably killed double the police estimated and then a citizen found an austin cop
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.640]  who i've had on the show he's now a texas ranger retired and the citizens dead i forget his name
[36:42.640 --> 36:49.360]  my grandpa knew him and said let's go grabbed his shotgun out of his truck grabbed the cop and said
[36:49.360 --> 36:57.040]  let's go and they stormed up the tower and took him out and i'm nothing special but i i guarantee
[36:57.040 --> 37:03.120]  if somebody would say mass shooting across the street it wouldn't even the default is i'd grab
[37:03.120 --> 37:11.840]  an m4 run out the door and open fire on them i mean just guaranteed instantly that's my default
[37:11.840 --> 37:18.800]  that is now a bizarre instinct i've had the bbc and others here when they see under my desk
[37:18.800 --> 37:27.120]  an ak-47 you know semi-auto or they see an m4 or they see a 357 magnum and they go oh what is that
[37:28.480 --> 37:31.840]  i mean i'm not exaggerating it's worse than that stop the taping excuse me
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.640]  they've been brainwashed so conditioned with psychological triggers that the sign of a slave
[37:38.640 --> 37:44.880]  with a gun scares them to the point of almost collapsing and it's the same thing you see over
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.640]  and over and i told the story of my dad's college friend who i've been on probably
[37:50.640 --> 37:56.000]  it's not exaggerate 15 camping and fishing trips and beach trips with him my life or more
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.880]  i was in college but i had had a gun safe in his closet i didn't keep my really nice guns at my
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.560]  apartment because they could get stolen i was getting some guns to go to the shooting range
[38:06.560 --> 38:11.680]  then hunting later and i was just walking out of their bedroom past living room with a rifle and a
[38:11.680 --> 38:20.400]  handgun the handgun was in a case memory serves and he just went oh back oh oh oh and had his hands
[38:20.400 --> 38:24.640]  back oh David David i might add my mom like what's wrong what's wrong they're in there drinking coffee
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.440]  the gun gun gun and they said it's okay
[38:29.440 --> 38:37.680]  hey he was just get it out get it out get it out the aversion to seeing a fellow slave armed
[38:38.320 --> 38:43.200]  but if he's a cop armed he feels fine and i've experienced this but see here's the
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.400]  Interpol chief saying arm people all over the world like this and it will stop the mass shootings
[38:48.400 --> 38:55.120]  of course it will we're going to trust pilots with how much does a 747 or a seven how much
[38:55.120 --> 39:04.560]  is a 77 way how many tons is it is it a 50 ton torpedo 100 ton 300 ton tell me how much a 777
[39:04.560 --> 39:10.800]  ways you're going to trust him with this giant torpedo that flies 580 miles an hour they can
[39:10.800 --> 39:14.240]  actually go for 600 closest pita sound but they don't do that because the gas it uses
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.840]  in fact some of those big jets i'm told can actually break the sound barrier the point is is
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.600]  that you've got a missile that goes 600 miles an hour you can fly it into buildings you can kill
[39:25.600 --> 39:31.520]  tens of thousands with it but we're not going to trust the pilots with a gun see the world's not
[39:31.520 --> 39:40.800]  perfect so they harden the doors so a guy on prozac a man on prozac can be depressed and
[39:40.800 --> 39:44.320]  want to show off his girlfriend and fly it into the ground then the answer is have everything
[39:44.320 --> 39:48.320]  remote controlled oh what happens when a crazy person in the government who controls that
[39:48.320 --> 39:54.240]  comm center flies all the planes into the ground see the more you try to restrict people you only
[39:54.240 --> 40:01.200]  restrict good people so bad people can act the cockpits now hardened allow this to happen
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.760]  so you close one door it opens another door how many tons is a 777 way guys
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.400]  not even loaded with fuel we didn't find it we're still looking just just just search the term
[40:12.400 --> 40:19.120]  how much is a 777 way yeah that's what i did but we're not having any luck with okay well i was on
[40:20.720 --> 40:24.800]  according to bowing the maximum takeoff weight is 660 000 pound
[40:26.240 --> 40:32.720]  i believe 660 000 pounds that can't be that's too many tons well we're gonna find out the
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.520]  point is planes are big i'll look it up you guys are great but let me just see if i can find it
[40:37.520 --> 40:46.880]  oh there it is it says 660 000 pounds so how many tons is that 660 000 pounds
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.520]  330 tons 330 tons yeah i was on a
[40:55.280 --> 41:00.960]  american airlines flight and that's what they said they talked about when you're on our 777
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.160]  you're flying through the air and i was on a 777 system i had in a 300 ton aircraft and i wanted
[41:06.160 --> 41:13.760]  to almost a 300 ton but i just it sounded so big i didn't believe it 300 ton plus missile
[41:15.280 --> 41:24.080]  that goes 600 miles per hour and we're going to keep pilots from having guns we're gonna keep
[41:24.080 --> 41:29.120]  citizens from having guns so the bad guys can get the guns so the bad guys can take action
[41:29.120 --> 41:36.640]  what do they claim to top speed it'll depend on the engines in a 777 but i know i was on one
[41:36.640 --> 41:43.440]  flying to england one time on a continental out of houston and it was kilometers but it said
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.280]  when i woke up right in the middle of the night it said like 780 kilometers an hour i guess that's
[41:49.280 --> 42:00.160]  600 something i don't know what's this top speed looks like 945 945 kilometers 945 kilometers
[42:00.160 --> 42:04.160]  and then if you reduce that down into miles what is that the point is they're faster than 600 miles
[42:04.160 --> 42:13.440]  an hour so you got a 600 see i'm obsessing on factoids sorry 600 mile an hour 300 plus ton
[42:13.440 --> 42:18.960]  weapon and now they're saying have them all remote control can't trust humans see one human
[42:18.960 --> 42:24.400]  does something bad now all of us have to lose our freedoms every pilot is now a criminal
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.200]  even though statistically everyone knows that jet pilots have one of the highest levels of
[42:29.200 --> 42:35.520]  competency one of the highest levels of low crime rate but one does something bad now we've
[42:35.520 --> 42:42.240]  got to change everything all right i'm i'm perseverating that's how my brain works i see an article
[42:42.240 --> 42:52.480]  about the latest kenya mass murder with a bunch of disarmed victim christians with the military
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.120]  and the police cowering outside while they get shot at set of storming in and taking those people out
[42:59.600 --> 43:04.880]  i'll guarantee you if this was 1960 texas those gunmen would have been dead in minutes
[43:05.920 --> 43:09.680]  people would have poured out of their cars they'd have kicked those doors down for the cops ever
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.480]  got there and texas has proven it that's what texas does now i'm not saying texas has done that now
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.760]  texas had its wave those chopped off you know a long time ago and mailed into obama but at the
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.480]  same time still texas is falling but it's like helter skelter song i'm coming down fast but a
[43:24.480 --> 43:34.560]  miles above you i'm you go to california man it's jellyfish world i'm not saying everybody in california
[43:34.560 --> 43:41.200]  but you know what i'm getting at now let's shift gears into something even more important warren
[43:41.200 --> 43:46.720]  buffett artificial intelligence will play this clip in a moment will decide whether humans live or
[43:46.720 --> 43:53.680]  die info wars dot com now of course when i read this article what did i think about well i thought
[43:53.680 --> 43:58.160]  about the fact that he's the co-owner of the bill and the gates foundation that fences about 50
[43:58.160 --> 44:02.000]  million dollars a year of profits through it so it's tax free i thought about the fact that he's
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.120]  a sickening evil person whose wells fargo and wilcovia banks have been caught laundering hundreds
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.720]  of billions of dollars in drug money and he got no trouble i think about what an organized
[44:10.720 --> 44:16.160]  gangster crime lord he is and now he's the biggest recipient of the last three banker bailouts
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.320]  just look it up it's a mclashy newspaper ap royers just the headline warren buffett biggest
[44:20.320 --> 44:27.200]  recipient of bailout himself but he gets up on abc news this week almost every week they have
[44:27.200 --> 44:31.600]  pieces going we need to raise taxes on the rich i don't pay taxes that's wrong i'm warren buffett
[44:31.600 --> 44:36.080]  i want to give you my money my secretary makes more than i he doesn't tell you he helped write the laws
[44:37.920 --> 44:43.360]  helped write the laws to exempt the billionaires and people like him see the regulators don't come
[44:43.360 --> 44:47.760]  after him when he doesn't pay taxes he's allowed to take tax breaks you're making two hundred
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.320]  three thousand dollars a year you try to take tax breaks that are on the books no cpa will give
[44:52.320 --> 44:56.400]  them to you because they've been held libel you have to go to a tax lawyer and and and then have
[44:56.400 --> 45:01.200]  them certify it and then the irs still comes after you let's say make a million dollars a year
[45:01.200 --> 45:05.600]  you got a hundred employees over the years you want to put away a couple hundred thousand dollars a
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.760]  year offshore if you don't trust this government they call that illegal even though it's not
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.080]  so so so see i see an article about warren buffett i think about him shutting down the keystone
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.440]  pipelines so he can trans ship it with jorge soros to china via railways he owns in canada
[45:21.440 --> 45:26.000]  i think about all his sabotage all he's done and then he's like everything's going to be fair under
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.440]  obama care because computers that are already commanding the doctors will tell you everything
[45:33.440 --> 45:37.760]  to do and it'll decide whether you live or die well who programs the computers see that's the whole
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.400]  zeitgeist movement the new york times promotes a computer will decide where you work where you
[45:42.400 --> 45:46.720]  live and what you do and we'll all live in big communal buildings that sounds like prison doesn't
[45:46.720 --> 45:52.080]  it is but it's see if you say it with long hair you talk real soft and condescending and
[45:52.080 --> 46:01.360]  lisping and fake an electoral and then do alex if you don't agree you'll be sent to a reeducation
[46:01.360 --> 46:07.040]  camp and then later the guy Peter joseph comes back and says i'll come on your show you apologize
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.760]  for saying i said you'd be reeducated and i went back and watched the interview and he said you'll
[46:11.760 --> 46:19.520]  be sent for reeducation and he went on the phone he goes i never said that we know the truth yes
[46:19.520 --> 46:27.280]  two plus two equals whatever you say because you talk with a condescending voice come here
[46:27.840 --> 46:36.320]  i count dracula devon helson come here i did not say that come here you have a strong will
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.760]  for one who's only lived one life i mean you think that stuff really works on me like your job with
[46:41.760 --> 46:49.760]  a hut oh teeny jedi think so you think all your games work on me it doesn't work on me and once
[46:49.760 --> 46:54.080]  the human spirit ignites it doesn't work on anybody i'm not here doing anything but opening the blinds
[46:54.080 --> 47:00.240]  to wake people up and you don't like the light do you pull those blinds if i like sun i love it
[47:00.240 --> 47:07.200]  and red blooded humans i don't care what color they are will never be your slaves now the explosion
[47:07.200 --> 47:10.400]  when i read this article this is how my brain works you gotta have hundreds of articles only
[47:10.400 --> 47:14.960]  covered two or three not because i don't have more news i've got hundreds hundreds of articles
[47:14.960 --> 47:18.640]  tons of video clips special reports but i'm just showing you how the world really works here
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.440]  i read this article my brain explodes i watched the clip
[47:24.880 --> 47:28.080]  and then what's the little crème de la crème what do i instantly think in the explosion
[47:29.120 --> 47:32.800]  two weeks ago joe begs report that was hidden in plain view in the associated press
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.880]  going don't worry it's no big deal that they have no treat list for hundreds of thousands of veterans
[47:38.880 --> 47:45.440]  for operable things and they just let them die it's okay there was no bad intent a human didn't
[47:45.440 --> 47:54.480]  decide it's an ibm computer named watson they see they just announced like don't worry we have
[47:54.480 --> 48:01.600]  giant death camps we call them vas literally but don't worry it wasn't people in the bioethics
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.000]  boards because they won't sign off on it they just get orders from a central computer called
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.520]  watson made by ibm do you know what they called one of the main versions of the hollereth
[48:12.160 --> 48:17.280]  ibm thomas watson owned computer that was first designed for race mixing studies
[48:17.840 --> 48:24.400]  this is new york times best-selling books on it it was called the watson the actual
[48:27.840 --> 48:33.760]  progeny of the death camp slave camp forced labor camp computers that people had tattoos on their
[48:33.760 --> 48:40.480]  arms to be entered into decides who to kill and i told you the vas the model for obama care
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.320]  and we got bill gates going out and going we do have death panels get rid of one teacher higher
[48:48.320 --> 48:52.800]  i mean get one an old lady and get higher 10 teachers everyone's being taught people die
[48:52.800 --> 48:58.240]  then you get resources not build civilizations of the stars then we empower humanity no
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.840]  we have predatory economy we feed on humans we dumb them down we control them then some
[49:03.840 --> 49:09.280]  of you that go along with us you might get to survive everyone sits there in the audience

[49:45.120 --> 49:47.360]  that were being partially enforced in the 60s and 70s
[49:47.360 --> 49:55.680]  it is a wholly owned it's basically the nazi submerged government it's hydra and and that's
[49:55.680 --> 50:00.480]  more that's what intelligence called the underground nazi women was hydra that isn't in

[57:35.920 --> 57:39.360]  another car coming the other direction with four people in it and the computer's going to make
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.960]  the decision as to whether to hit the kid or hit the other car you know i'm not sure who gets sued
[57:44.960 --> 57:51.600]  under those you're gonna kill somebody and and uh it will be the computer that makes the decision
[57:51.600 --> 57:58.400]  in a nanosecond and um it'll be interesting to know who programs that computer and what their
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.600]  thoughts are about the values of human lives and things all right let's stop right there see
[58:03.600 --> 58:07.760]  and i see an article like this and i think about the machines they're using to already do it so

[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.440]  for prime minister in a mood that was sure to shake up political status quo the country ibm has
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.560]  announced that its artificial intelligence peter system wants him will run for prime minister
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:25.200]  during uk general election as if you could do that says the company announced that the computer
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.120]  would also just do a job as two leading candidates so they're already introducing the idea that
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.280]  computers do a better job and i guess ibm programs though so they'll take over for us

[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:57.440]  treatments at the va that was the big issue thanks because that ties into the warren ruffin article
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.920]  that i was mentioning artificial intelligence will decide whether humans will live or die
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.480]  and again who programs the computers even if the computer is better who's making that claim

[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.720]  exempt the eu's openly tax exempt they have swiss bank accounts but the general public
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.640]  pays 101 tax you say that sounds insane well they quote give some of it back as socialist
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.640]  services but that's total control when you you said well how do you get 101 well there was
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:19.440]  some savings from before so it's a clawback where you can't have anything we're having one percent
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:25.440]  of your own money that simple vote of controlling your one percent deciding where you can spend
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.640]  and we can do would cause renaissance and revolutionize they want stagnation and control they don't

[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:31.680]  network as of a few hours ago western media was still refusing to call radical islamics
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:39.040]  radical islamics or even terrorists they were saying the number was 15 dead now sky news is
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:48.640]  reporting at least 70 dead as hostage is taken at college and you basically have radical jihadis
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:09:00.640]  al qaeda affiliated pouring in to kenya and waging war on the nation when they started having
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.280]  infiltrators come in from the north kenya began fighting back and now they're getting attacked
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.000]  on a routine basis and the head of inter poll two years ago when they had the mall massacre
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.560]  there in kenya said armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks he told roiders and abc news
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:22.240]  inter poll secretary general ronald nobel the u n openly wants to ban the guns and civilian
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.760]  hands worldwide there's the abc news headline exclusive after westgate inter poll chief ponders
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:34.320]  armed citizenry that's obviously the answer but instead you have a total demonization of that
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:40.640]  and our own government arming islamic state al qaeda and others in creating a sunni shiai civil
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:48.080]  war destabilization program the fbi a month ago five weeks ago now saying isis which is al qaeda
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.360]  same group same flags same mindset saudi arabia funded is in all 50 states
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.160]  this is just the biggest false flag ever these are real jihadis many of them some of them are
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.440]  windup toys provocateurs but there are undoubtedly real groups here operating that are going to be
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.040]  allowed to operate which again will be used to bring in more control not arming citizens but
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:19.440]  disarming citizens is their answer truly unprecedented truly unprecedented france as i
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.920]  mentioned is moving in the direction of banning cash france will begin more closely monitoring
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.960]  its citizens transactions and withdrawals of money they have according to forbes a 101 percent tax
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.760]  now in upper middle class to claw back and make sure no one has any savings but the ruling class
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.800]  that doesn't pay taxes been caught not paying taxes and has swiss bank accounts as i mentioned
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:45.760]  and exempt themselves at the eu bureaucracy level from the tax so france is the model because again
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.960]  if you've got one or even five percent or ten percent of your own money you'll be able to vote
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.080]  with your dollars with your euros with your pocketbook to create new economies of free will
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.880]  that will become so popular they will change society that's why in a centralized society
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.320]  they can have no free will that's why you got to vote with your dollars with your euros with your
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.360]  different currencies with your purchases now that's why you've got to tell neighbors and
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.520]  co-workers and friends in your church about info wars dot com and this show but we've got to

[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.400]  that's in a headwind that's what the system we're like salmon going upstream by sheer will
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.920]  they are turning up the heat in the attacks they are going after our show on stations
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.200]  they're offering to buy during the week our time all across the country to get us off
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.760]  there is a major move to shut down info wars dot com right now and i ought to be happy at least
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:58.160]  they're not killing me or setting me up though i'm sure that's in the cards so please understand
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.000]  obama i forgot this in fact it's i couldn't find it the stack sign an executive order
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.800]  saying what they're going to do with the new fcc power grab with his head guy tax it regulate it
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.400]  totally take it over i mean i forgot that executive order please give me that guys
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:21.280]  it's all moving in high gear right now it's accelerating right now and you've got major
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:28.320]  preparations for war you've got uh russian strategists that advise putin calling for
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:35.520]  nukes to be smuggled in the u.s to be detonated on the san andres fault line and on the uh big area
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.320]  there in yellowstone to to trigger the the caldera i'm not saying that's going to happen
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:45.280]  but the point is the rhetoric is escalating there it is singing in obama announces executive order
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:51.200]  on sanctions against hackers and you actually read it it's executive order where they claim
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.840]  downloading something's hacking just huge power grabs happening we have an article on info wars
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.520]  though that decipheres it from e f f the electronic frontier foundation new executive order obama
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.160]  takes total control the internet declares national cyber security emergency we're going to discuss all
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.920]  of this today now i wanted to get joe scowles on last week but he was busy he joins us now
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.480]  to get into all of this but the first thing i want to cover with him is these military drills
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:25.680]  which we never said that jade helm and others were the takeover from day one we said it's
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.120]  conditioning it's militarization it's all in a rand corporation plan uh from the 80s repackage
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.280]  of the 90s and again last year called the national stability force or national police
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.800]  stability force the pentagon's called for it it's happening it's north com with south com
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:48.240]  they mentioned texas and utah is hostile and orange county that's subliminal folks basically
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.360]  in plain view because sure there's a lot of legitimate training going on within it but nested
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:14:00.240]  is the main program of gun owners veterans christians mormons anybody who doesn't want to be a
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:06.720]  domesticated anyone that wants to be self-sufficient is the enemy because again if you're self-sufficient
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.320]  you're not under their control it's it's elementary so i i don't know joe scowles' take on this editor
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.240]  of world affairs brief dot com and of course the author of several bestselling the bestselling book
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.280]  the secure home uh and of course uh he also wrote strategic relocation and made a film with me
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.880]  both the book and the film i produced are available at info war store dot com you're insane
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.960]  if you haven't watched the video and read the book it really is the best intel out there
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.280]  from joe scowles and marine corps fighter pilot aviator in the vietnam era and of course the
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.800]  nephew of clion scowles and wrote the naked communist and of course he's headed up some of
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.920]  the largest conservative organizations in the united states joel thank you for coming on with us
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.520]  i threw out a lot of information on last five minutes but are you happy to tackle jade helm first
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:01.920]  yes let's go with that alex uh my major concern about the internet hype is what you started out
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:08.400]  in saying that you did not say and i think that's important that this is not the implementation of
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.880]  martial law it takes a very big excuse to imitate or to initiate martial law and uh
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.520]  there's nothing that they could throw at the us that they wouldn't get blamed for unless we get
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:28.320]  to a war scenario but clearly as you pointed out this is a major escalation of the exercises the
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.400]  domestic terrorism exercises and and you know you won't be able to prove that directly unless you saw
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:39.120]  some of the scenarios but we know from the forewater lotterdale exercise for example where
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:46.400]  they were rounding up people and practicing putting them into prison uh that this is part of a taking
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:54.320]  of dissidents it's not imminent it's a long crescendo growth of training and conditioning
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.400]  military people to do this without question just like the marine corps survey asking or testing
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.360]  Marines to see who would be willing to confiscate american weapons that's very very disturbing that
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:11.200]  there is the intent to do that obviously there are thinkers globalist at the national level
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.840]  in the various armed services that are projecting these scenarios they're not going to tell the
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.120]  military directly a lot of things uh because they know that there's a lot of objections in the
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.720]  military but we have seen the papers of the army war college by colonels and generals
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.960]  in the last few years saying our main enemy will be the tea party mimicking justice department
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:35.600]  statements absolutely no there's no question about that uh what's different about jade helm is first
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:42.160]  of all the scope of it this is a nationwide exercise which differs significantly you know as a
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.120]  former military pilot and someone who's taken part in a lot of exercise i can tell you that
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:54.240]  everything we did in the 80s and the 90s in the you know 2000 this was locally based uh there was
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.880]  no flying clear across the country with uh you know prisoners that you take in and practice in
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.320]  cars that's a huge waste of resources doesn't it escalate the price of the operation oh absolutely
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:12.160]  i mean these things are you know nearly half a billion dollars just to even start talking
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:18.320]  about this kind of an exercise but the second part that's more worrisome is the covert nature of this
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.600]  that you're going to have people claiming to be blending in with citizens and then putting out
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:30.960]  the the hype you know if you see anything suspicious tell us well let me tell you you
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.240]  can't practice blending in for a foreign scenario by using the united states exactly the techniques
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:44.080]  are absolutely different yes it's easy to blend in if you're americans blending in with americans
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:50.240]  but you try that in latin america you try that in kazakhstan or uh you know the middle east
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:57.040]  and you can't use american soldiers to blend in so this is clearly uh without telling perhaps the
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:04.240]  participants that you're practicing for blending in in a covert way and spying on and extracting
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.960]  they use that word practice extracting that means kidnapping basically taking people on
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:17.120]  then flying them off to a unknown prison this is uh you know jade helm is really uh meshing
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.960]  together all of the preparations for fema camps and then actually there's more fema prisons being
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:29.520]  built on former military bases than there are actual camps well they admit that i mean as you
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.840]  know they've escalated uh that the hiring for internment specials how to process americans
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.000]  the social security numbers it's all there but i mean i remember back when they tried this with
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.320]  clinton they're also having the military go in and create relationships with the local police
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:50.640]  to to create the the the preparation on the road to find out who's going along with it and who isn't
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:57.040]  in when the delta force tried to bribe the san antonio police chief and that's why we had uh
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.280]  leaks from new mexico for example telling us that they were monitoring right wing radio stations
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:11.120]  your broadcast uh taking names of people who comment on these blogs or who respond on the radio
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:18.640]  to call in television radio shows this is very serious when local police are joining with the
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.240]  federal services in monitoring american people especially targeting american dissidents people
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:31.040]  like uh you and i and others who object to the spying on americans as well as the preparations
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.720]  for marshal law eventually and the militarization of police but i i repeat i don't think marshal
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:43.600]  law is imminent i agree or anywhere close i think uh this is a long preparatory process they're
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:48.160]  running into a lot of objections with military people that's why they're using a lot of mercenaries
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:55.280]  now and i think part of these exercises try to weed out or vet who in the military objects to
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:01.920]  some of these scenarios and precisely they get on lists themselves so that when it comes time to
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:09.520]  putting forth your baddest most unprincipled mercenaries they won't be among them that's right
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:14.000]  and then they said those guys overseas to deploy them over deployment they get put on the no treat
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.960]  va list uh they get put on the extremist list and the government knows that the vast majority
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:23.200]  of the veterans who actually fought and sworn off the bill of rights and constitution will
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.120]  say no to this takeover and so that's why they're listed in all the just department documents that
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.720]  are public some were secret we broke it that they're the enemy i mean this tells you how alien
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.760]  and unamerican and corrupt this is let me ask you this question in drill after drill not just this
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:47.200]  one texas utah and other areas are listed as hostile i don't think that there was a mistake
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:51.680]  there i think they're testing the military as well to see if they get it what do you think that was
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:21:00.080]  about you know i was surprised they didn't include idaho as one of those states uh there's probably
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.560]  just as many if not more dissidents from our movement in idaho uh utah's kind of interesting
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:14.000]  because right now the mormon base there is basically at least the leadership of the church
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.320]  there is kind of placating the the government going along with government making sure that
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:23.040]  you don't say anything negative about government that said there's a tremendous amount of mormons
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.920]  who are constitutional conservatives that are the dissidents so it probably isn't the state like
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:35.120]  idaho you know utah and idaho and my book strategy relocation of the two top rated states they are
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:41.440]  the most conservative states they have a great deal of places that are safe places in those states
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:46.320]  but both of those conservative states like every other state union are tending to be more liberal
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.720]  over time the governors that is you know the governors of idaho and utah both are trying
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:58.000]  to placate the establishment the legislators however in those two states are very conservative
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.280]  and they keep putting tremendous resistance on that and i was about to add i know for a fact that
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.560]  the new governor of texas has met with some top people and is aware of the conspiracy
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:14.080]  and you know their nsa wiretapping the leadership in utah and know that the whole cosmology
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:20.320]  recognizes a globalist takeover a hundred plus years ago so i think that's why the system doesn't
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.600]  like it from the get go is because it fundamentally doesn't recognize the globalist takeover that's
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.200]  right and there is inherent resistance in those two states especially it's unlike indiana i never
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:39.280]  saw a state fold so fast to tremendous at the wave of pressure against their religious freedom law and
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.520]  you know they've turned around tail between their legs and and passing an anti-discriminate which
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:50.240]  is a violation of people's fundamental rights if you don't have the right to choose with whom you
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:55.120]  will associate even on your property and your business property then you've lost a tremendous
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.880]  fundamental right and not a single person alex came forward to defend the principle of discrimination
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.720]  we have a gutless people especially conservatives who really don't understand what they need to be
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:13.120]  defending sure because i mean if you discriminate against somebody on the basis of say they're a
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:19.680]  felon uh or you discriminate against a restaurant because the food is rotten i mean they're taking
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:27.120]  that word to the trillionth degree where you have no free will if you have no discrimination powers
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:34.960]  then you have no direction i mean again they manipulate words to just incredible degrees
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.680]  where people basically i mean it's like saying you don't like a dead dog in the street because
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:45.680]  it stinks your olfactory nerve is racist against against carrion well you know there's
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.640]  there's a real misunderstanding among people about uh discrimination really it is a fundamental right
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.160]  like free speech we may not like what a person uses his free speech on his own property but he's
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.800]  absolutely free to say anything he wants on his own property it's the same thing with your right
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.280]  to choice they don't want us to have discriminating powers because they eventually intend to pigeon
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:15.200]  hole us into accepting things that we would not accept such as gay relationships uh which
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.160]  this was incredible i mean it wasn't just a few years ago when it was barely uttered that we have
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.640]  to tolerate gays and now it is protecting and defending gays almost as if they have super rights
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.960]  and promoting it to five-year-olds without discussing any of the health issues with the
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:38.560]  gays lifestyle which are horrendous for them and which are contagious and the problems
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:43.360]  involved and there's a tremendous protection but as a legal matter it's essential to understand
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.680]  that anti-discrimination laws are what i call an unlimited extension of lawmaking power in
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.120]  other words once you allow government to enter in to what they will determine you can use to
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.080]  discriminate and what you can't it's literally unlimited they can keep adding to the choices
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.680]  it started with race and i in 1984 was in washington dc when they passed the civil rights deal and i
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:11.120]  said on national television said this is the violation of people's fundamental rights to
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.160]  discriminate for whatever reason and they said well how can that be a fundamental right and when
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.680]  went through the same arguments and i prophesied i said eventually they're going to increase this to
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.520]  women to gays to other things and we're living through that day today i remember seeing an
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.240]  article yesterday right before i went into surgery praise god it was a successful hernia
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.640]  surgery doctor did a great job and it was they're gonna bring the article in was a major university
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.920]  said there it is university requires students to apply for free speech permits content of student
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.280]  handouts also must be reviewed and approved by school officials even down to speech kit daniels
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:53.760]  if you scroll down i'll give folks the university california polytechnic state university uh pomona
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.600]  is now requiring students who engage in free speech activities on campus to apply for a
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.840]  permit issued weekdays between 8 a.m but it isn't just a permit for where they want to give a speech
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:08.240]  with a megaphone or something so that's how it started 12 was against it at ut 20 years ago
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:16.320]  now they're saying that you have to get pre approved for what you even utter i mean this is hard
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.640]  core totalitarianism and they call it liberal liberals thomas jefferson saying religious freedom
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.360]  government can't be involved i mean they invert separation church the state saying congress shall
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.440]  make no law restricting the establishment of religion or premium exercise thereof that says
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.680]  the government can't get involved and so the church can do whatever it wants not the other way
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:41.600]  around i mean it but that that was even for the first amendment in europe the church had sanctuary
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.280]  where if you could get into the church and they would hear your case then then then there was no
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.240]  jurisdiction within those walls and they just invert reality uh jules calzen that's right and
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:58.480]  it's very very important to understand that part the free markets operate on judgment
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.080]  and these are restrictions on judgment restrictions on free speech restrictions on
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:10.800]  discriminatory judgments are restrictions on as you say the exercise of free will and the ability
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.720]  to disseminate objections to the government position and that's why i think even in the
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.920]  military we do have civilian control of the military but we ought never to say that the
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:28.800]  military cannot publicly disagree with and lobby the american public against the politicians
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:35.120]  decisions in the military field and because we have put a clamp on them they are no longer able
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.360]  to protest and that's why we get so many frustrated military people to leave because
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.080]  they're simply muzzled well remember two years ago we reported it when army saw ups at fort hood
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.320]  gave it to us in a rally they brought it to me and then a week later it was on fox news and the
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:54.640]  headline of fox news was our christians the military extremist or terrorist and in there it said you
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:01.360]  will be court marshaled or maybe court marshaled if you're evangelical or if you are in the tea party
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.240]  well you can do anything you want when you're off duty imagine because again people say well
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.240]  why do you see the military so good but now they're trying to take over that's how ignorant the
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.400]  public is the military is the most awake because they're in the middle of it and no we're telling
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:20.640]  the truth but they're being asked to do bad things the military separate from the politicians
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.600]  that are commanding them we're supporting the military uh just like you were an officer in
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:32.080]  the marine corps are when you fight for their free speech correct joel that's right it's but
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.320]  there's a tremendous pressure in the military because they can threaten you with court marshals
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.760]  with the lack of retirement benefits to go along and say yes you know they give lip service to the
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:48.320]  fact that there are illegal uh houses there you could only have to follow legal orders but they
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.840]  will never admit that there has ever been an illegal order and in fact if you go up as the
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.280]  military and say i'm not going along this because it's illegal you're up for a media court marshal
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:05.120]  and i don't know many judges and i'm sorry any general officers and i've been up against a few

[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.520]  and there's a tremendous amount of pressure in the military but you know it was going to undermine

[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:11.360]  you're supporting our operation but most importantly if you want to get a real map of not just here
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.120]  in the u.s but every other major country it is incredible the work joles calzen put into this
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.960]  that's why his book the secure home is the bible of secure homes and why he's such a consultant to
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.040]  billionaires right down to average folks and builds secure homes all over the world that's
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:32.720]  another question joel before we get back into tail hook in russia and isis and the rest of it
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.080]  you talked on our show without giving away client information years ago about former cia fbi building
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.760]  building more inexpensive safe houses and bunkers under their houses uh or you know really rich
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.680]  people building bunkers in an accelerated rate now it's been in the guardian that they're building
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:53.200]  bunkers all over the world they're building them in the ozarks they're uh building a secret
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:58.560]  airfields in new zealand and building garrison guard shacks and are really scared and most
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:05.760]  the billionaires have left israel what is happening with this exodus of the elite and this hardening
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:11.040]  of elitist positions and then russia building giant underground bunkers but we don't have those for
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:16.960]  the general public what's going on on that front joles calzen well the the answer to that is that
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:26.720]  the people in the know insiders if you will i'm talking about x cia dea anybody who's involved
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:31.040]  in the dark side of government knows that a major war is coming and it's going to be a nuclear war
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.080]  they're not doing these bunkers because of terrorism your chances of really getting hurt
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:42.000]  from even one you know the false flag terrorism which all the big events are is really less than
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.920]  one half of one percent or less uh but your chances of being affected by this coming nuclear war
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.360]  with russia and china are are absolute assured everybody's going to be affected by it and
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.640]  so that really tells you something you know the insiders see the government building brand new
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:04.240]  new deep underground bunkers abandoning old bunkers like shayan mountain because they know
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.880]  they're targeted so there's a whole new series of bunkers being built and when they retire
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.720]  they're doing the same thing but you'll notice alexa fema is not warning american people
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:19.760]  that there's any nuclear threat at all but we you know i used to get a lot of flak from people
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:25.200]  because of my predictions about russia and china being the real target not terrorism but nobody's
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.360]  nobody's laughing now everybody sees russia getting more aggressive china getting more
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.840]  aggressive it's really just a matter of time it's driving the elite to do this and i might say
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.120]  even though i am aware of high-level government officials doing these i do not design for these
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:45.680]  people i will not work for ex-government sure i know you just talked about i guess your other
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:51.520]  contacts and sources that and them approaching you right um joel if we had the engineers and we
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.800]  i mean we had the time the media people we could go back to you 10 years ago here 15 years ago here
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.240]  you've been coming on the show 16 17 years i guess you've been on since about 1998 or so memory
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.760]  serves so that's about 16 17 years but we could go back two three years ago and you were saying
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.160]  china's be the new enemy russia that we're going to start escalating crises there and then sure
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.880]  enough now you're right people say new nuclear war that's all over now we have banners saying the
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.680]  world's on fire all these top analysts saying we're in greater danger of nuclear war than any other
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.680]  time uh you can see the move you see russia feverishly digging in building some estimates
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:36.400]  are 400 square mile underground bunkers under mountains i mean this is this is wild and then
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:43.040]  you see fema demonizing anybody who's a prepper uh and and and you can see it finance the radicals
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:48.720]  lomasis get some attacks going use the islamic threat as the cover for the hardening and the
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.400]  domestic police state that emerges after the war and you can really see that more and more
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:01.360]  your analysis is coming true going back how long ago did you come up with this hypothesis
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:08.000]  and and if why did you come up with it well i came up with it clear back in the 80s believe it or
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.200]  not um and published it uh in 1998 when i was starting my world affairs brief i put out my
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.600]  general theory and in a piece called strategic threats of the coming decade and uh the reason
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:28.320]  i came up with this is because i continued to see how the cia was covering for uh russian war
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:34.560]  preparations in 1997 for example the new york times published the first article on this big
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.880]  400 square mile underground bunker system in yamanto mountain in the url mountains of russia
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.400]  and they went to this and it basically was a cover piece to downplay the issue they went
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.040]  to the cia and said what about this underground bunker system oh yeah we know about it but
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.680]  we're not worried about it it's just defensive and you know i asked the immediate question why is
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:01.200]  it how do they know it's defensive they've never been in it general hobby girl of our strategic
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.640]  missile command admitted the united states inspectors have never been in yamanto mountain
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:12.560]  it's got six railroad lines going in russians claim it's for mining but you never see any
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.200]  mining cars other than removing earth you know coming out of it there's nothing going in there
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:23.520]  except factory closed box cars i think they're building underground nuclear factories missile
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:30.480]  factories they're going to be able to continue to wage war even after nuclear war starts so i've
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:36.160]  warned about this for many years it's not possible necessarily to predict when it's gonna happen i
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:41.440]  think we're dealing with multiple conspiracies here we have our globalist anglo-american globalist
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:49.680]  conspiracy trying to take down our liberty who are actively helping russian china arm just like
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.120]  just like the west is declassified basically help build up hitler that's exactly right they're
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.880]  building up enemies in order to create a major crisis to justify the kinds of militarization
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.520]  of police taking down a dissidents fema camps and prisons as we've been telling me it's going to
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:11.440]  take a war to justify that and they want that war but they cannot control the war they can't start
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:15.280]  it they have to make it look right because the globalist enemy is the russians and the american
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:21.120]  people and anybody else under their control so it's the old trick in the book cause the cataclysm
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.600]  so you can then have the excuse to take over completely right and they're going to use what
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:30.960]  better excuse to be able to justify a militarized global government where we lose our sovereignty
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.840]  than a nuclear attack on the u.s military now everyone says that's inconceivable that the
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.000]  u.s government will want an attack and destroy what is that what is the real u.s government that
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.680]  the justice department homeless security say they say the veterans are the enemy yeah but you see
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:51.440]  our government knows that russian china don't intend to nuke cities they intend to nuke the military
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.240]  and then blackmail the u.s into submission you know russian china want to run their own version
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.720]  of the new world order under their control and eventually they plan to attack each other too
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:06.400]  i mean their co their predators that are temporarily joined but the the western globalist are the
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:12.720]  most insidious in my opinion satanic revealed and driven uh it's the only way to explain this
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:18.080]  conspiracy has been going on for a couple hundred years but they have the blessing of the devil and
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.880]  in your research do you think the angle american establishment is actually going to be at the core
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.440]  of the satanic takeover or are they going to be betrayed as well no i think they're going to be
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.760]  the core they're the ones that are intended to win i think russia is going to go down in the
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:38.240]  next third world war i think china will be induced to attack attack russia's rear at some point during
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.400]  the war in exchange for more and more military assistance just like we gave stalin during world
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.080]  war two and then you see that serves globalist purposes too because after the war then you've
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:55.600]  got a new cold war enemy a huge china military and the globalist can say that's why we have to
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:01.280]  keep this global military force in in force and that's why we can't go back to to individual
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:07.520]  sovereignty and in fact we see a nato army and now a new arab unified army being put together
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:13.120]  at least those that are puppet states to the west and i think those will merge eventually
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.880]  through the middle east war that will come up through this iran deal it will merge into the
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:25.040]  beginning of this global military that we're going to have to face someday that americans will
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.360]  will plead for basically because our military has been taken down and the reason our military is
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.800]  going to be taken down is the us is not going government is not going to give the the nuclear
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.800]  codes so that we can respond until after we've absorbed a nuclear first strike and i've written
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.040]  about that extensively pdd 60 that secret order instructing the military to not rely on launch
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.840]  on warning but to be prepared to absorb a nuclear first strike i think you're going to see that
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:57.520]  happen and it's going to take out the military and that's why as much as i'm in favor of um
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:04.000]  defending our country and military service i do no longer recommend that good people join the
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.800]  military our government will not protect you they're setting up the military to take the hit
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:14.000]  in this next war and if you're in the military it's not enough that the vaccines that are forced
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.480]  upon you but if you're in the military chances are very very high that you're going to be nuked
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:26.960]  and the time frame 2020 2025 i can't tell when it's going to happen but i can tell you i don't
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:32.160]  think russian china are ready until the beginning of the next decade all of their top line weapon new
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.120]  weapon systems aren't coming online they admit that in fact their deadline is about 2021 they say
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.200]  and they may be cheating a little bit but i'll tell you it just takes years to build the kinds of
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.480]  blue water navy things that china needs the new submarines the new aircraft carriers uh they're
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.040]  not relying a lot on aircraft carriers by the way because they know that's obsolete technology
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:59.040]  submarines super uh hyper missiles and nuclear weapons you can take out aircraft carrier task force
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:04.160]  in an instant absolutely and you've operated off those well rt reports and and again when we're
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:10.160]  being told about something it's already there and this is what i was told by a lot of folks plus
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.080]  it's been admitted that a long time ago they were developing this that they have these basically
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.280]  subs these well these containers these packages that sit on the bottom they pop up and the device
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.880]  goes to the surface it's basically a huge cruise missile carrying other smaller cruise missiles
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.800]  then it goes in below the radar uh and takes out targets i mean for me even in my research into
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:36.320]  nukes isn't this really the ultimate weapon compared to even space baser icbm isn't this
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.640]  what's hard to really shoot down even if you think you have jamming equipment on the ground joel
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:46.720]  it is and a lot of it depends on the jamming this is a real high-tech war that both russia and the
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.320]  us are preparing for russia feels like they've got the electronic that's why they're they permit
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.280]  the u.s to take down iraq even though they promise to defend saddam hussein they learn
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.720]  more about us military technology by eavesdropping on our war capabilities against defenseless
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:08.880]  countries uh and that's the reason we can go in and obliterate any country we we attack because
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.760]  we can jam all their radar all of the stuff that russia sends over there can be jammed we can go
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:20.800]  in almost undetected and this new and i've always said the reason why the globalists who run our
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:27.440]  government are um are going to let the military taken down is they have secret weapon systems
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:33.280]  that they can be used afterwards to keep any further attacks from happening and i think what
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.520]  you've just described are some of those top secret weapon systems that can then keep the
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.960]  enemy of bay while we regroup under the name of of a globalist military that's right i mean it's
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.600]  real simple you just got a container on the bottom of the ocean totally undetected turned off
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.920]  it gets activated by some of these different classified systems they've got systems that
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.840]  should radio wave through the earth's activated satellites you name it what about the incredible
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.480]  reliance on gps we know the chinese and the russians plan to shoot down in a matter of hours
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:08.240]  the gps satellites do they have backups are they going to go back to these uh these uh
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.280]  antenna systems that they use to communicate through the earth uh that they've got up by
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:20.800]  dalis i mean what's the plan there the two plans uh according to my sources one is backups which
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.640]  they have several satellites ready to be launched but more interestingly is they have backups already
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:33.600]  in space that are turned off and that cannot be detected so when certain ones are shot down the
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:39.520]  obvious ones they simply turn on others and deplete you know the resources the the anti-sat
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.760]  that's what i was told is a miniaturization they've got packages up there where a whole bunch of
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:50.000]  backups are then released it's amazing joe scowzen we're talking near future which is already our
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.760]  present we'll be right back stay with us
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.800]  communist china freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our u.s politicians

[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:37.920]  things like worth like eight billion dollars last time i checked
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:42.240]  invented so many things we use today came out last week and a patient said
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:50.000]  ai is being designed to end humans usefulness the the architecture is being set up basically
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.560]  echoing what i've said others have said to where we're building a world that's not for people
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:59.120]  and of course that's what bill joy said 16 years ago and why the future doesn't need us
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.840]  and why our magazine himself a billionaire one of the owners of sun microsystems
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.040]  co-chairman
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:12.480]  what we're talking about is a predatory system and and joel scousen's agreed to stay with us

[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:47.520]  callers 800-259-9231 but joel pulling back from this the more i research it the more i see how
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.320]  it operates you really come face to face with the fact in their own writings they admit they're
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:57.680]  into the occult these are people that believe they serve the god of this world who if they
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:04.640]  carry out these plans will be given eternal life through the machines they will escape judgment
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:09.200]  you and i've talked about this before but folks need to understand this isn't us saying this
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.360]  this is what we get out of skull and bones and bohemian growth this is what rake hers well
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:19.200]  and and and all these guys are saying they're now externalizing the hierarchy they're now
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:24.800]  selling this to the general public except giving up your humanity turn yourself over to the robots
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:31.760]  making the decisions and you will be allowed to live forever how would anyone believe these people
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:38.240]  or i mean it's just so fantastical it's out of this world it is satanic can you speak to that
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:46.640]  well what what drives the the globalist is that you know everybody has a conscience everybody
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:51.760]  is part of humanity you get information from a divine source criticizing you
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:58.160]  prompting you to do the right thing and people who are bad who want to do the thing that are in
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:03.120]  constant rebellion against conscience and there's another voice comes through that center of the
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:08.400]  mind that perceives spiritual information from satan you know temptations trying to get you to
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.440]  do things countering what the lord wants you to do oh you don't want to do that you're too tired
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:20.400]  or you want to do this ultimately the people who migrate towards the dark side end up with a real
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:26.720]  problem is that they inwardly still know there's going to be a judgment day someday and what the
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:33.360]  oil that makes the conspiracy work is the promise of immunity we see it on earth they promise an
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:39.680]  immunity from prosecution you look at the people who get off scott fray free this irs director who
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:44.480]  congress isn't going to prosecute for contempt she should be why does that happen why do some
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:49.280]  people get off because they're part of the system they've got immunity bill clinton obviously had
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.400]  immunity they've got him off and it's not just the democrats that get him off it's the republicans
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.760]  that buy into this too but ultimately i think and this is my own theory alex that there's a
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:07.120]  larger promise of immunity to probably only at the higher revelatory states to the top levels
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:14.000]  of globalism who probably do have their own revelation or seance with this with satan or god
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:20.240]  of this world they're promised immunity from god's judgment if he helps them overthrow what is good
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:25.760]  in life and they need immunity from god judge i mean they got a mountain of sins they're facing
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:31.920]  the chains of hell they they try not to believe it but it's there they feel it they know it's true
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.760]  and they understand they're scared back in 60 seconds i want you to continue
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:39.920]  getting into this it's the big secret they don't want you to know about folks third hour call your

[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.800]  to admitting it's a planetary takeover and then it's even authoritarian as the financial
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.920]  towns of london did a few years ago but saying it's a good totalitarianism while separately
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:45.680]  attacking us for saying it's not a good plan jones scowles and this is a short segment i want to
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:52.160]  give you the floor to finish up getting into free will why they're attacking it they claim
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:57.760]  they're here to empower people the truth is they're openly here to enslave people and ultimately
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:02.400]  in humanity as we know it and you were getting into this attack on free will and then at the
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:08.960]  highest level of pyramid the satan wants to play god because he wants to escape judgment as well
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:14.640]  not just his minions well you know that you talk about empower the promise of empower there's a lot
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:22.880]  of subtle enticements that this satanic conspiracy operates you know very few at the top level
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.960]  except the top level i think have a regulatory relationship with satan you know there's this
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.640]  generational effect in this conspiracy goes on generation after generation no single person
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:40.320]  could design a system of conflict so complex that would exceed his lifetime three times
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.720]  and plan that and see that it's carried forth it has to be revelatory in nature
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:49.760]  but most of the people at the second and third and fourth level down from the hierarchy
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:55.520]  they use all kinds of inducements climbing the ladder wine women's song the promise of immunity
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:00.800]  other things to keep people they even hire mostly just predictable people that they don't have to
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:06.320]  tell there's a conspiracy operating they will do the liberal agenda because they've shown that
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:12.400]  proclivity but for the general public they promise empowerment but what that really means is empowerment
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:17.280]  through government power through linking yourself with government that's how they lure in these
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.960]  corporations we give you first contracts and think will make you wealthy in fact you cannot
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.160]  hardly compete nowadays in a tough economy without government contracts and these insider
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:34.000]  relations so it's empowerment through government the free market runs on the empowerment through
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.240]  good judgment through the proper use of of of self-control through listening to conscience
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:46.400]  rather than a rulemaking approach it's a very fluid thing and the serious thing about this
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:52.720]  conscience that i've been talking about is that these meds that are mood altering drugs
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:58.800]  actually i have found dead in the center of the mind which receives divine inspiration it
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:02.880]  deadens it and that's why there's such a very interesting relationship between these mood
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:08.560]  altering drugs and the withdrawal from them that allow satan to come in and have near total
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.480]  compulsion there to drive people to suicide and do other evil things such as been happening
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.920]  but going back to what i was saying about the immunity pack that makes this drive at the highest
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:27.280]  levels there's this promise of making you safe from the judgments of god and that's very attractive
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:35.200]  to a lot of people who have a lot of sins and you know there's a vision that isaia had about
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:42.560]  that in isaia chapter 14 where he talks about seeing all of the great and powerful in prison
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.760]  in the chains of hell and that kind of gives you an indication that the great and powerful
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:52.720]  the world will get that way because of this pact with satan the fousty impact if you will and then
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:59.040]  they see satan descend or he that was going to thrash the world with the power of his hand descend
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:06.080]  into hell in chains and they realize the jig is up he's not going to be able to save them and they
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:14.480]  utter art thou become low like undo us i think that's a tight and a parable of indicating that
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:18.880]  of this pact that's been going on since the beginning of the time work with me and i'll
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:24.800]  promise to dethrone god you won't suffer the chains of hell then they see him eventually
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:30.400]  descend into hell they realize it didn't work they are so deceived though in my gut in my spirit
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:36.480]  but historically as well you can see the fall of tyrants always comes you can see that the elite
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:45.200]  are following lucifer don't they know he will fall they don't it works what i'm just saying
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:51.120]  that he lures in a lot of people and uh yeah but i can see being lured by sin i mean we're all sinners
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:56.480]  but i know it's bad i know it loses i i just i guess they've been given over to great delusion

[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:42.400]  big evil wars are about blood sacrifice to the god of this world you know satan has already fallen
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:49.040]  but he'll have another fall and not be in control of this planet anymore and look i have a personal
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.280]  relationship with christ i know this stuff's true i infiltrated bohemian grove the only person to
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:58.240]  ever get in and out and not get arrested i'm not bragging that was god's hand in that i was
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:02.880]  questioned by the secret service and by sheriff's deputies didn't even lie to him i just said i'm
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:09.040]  here visiting the hillbillies that's the bushes club they said are you a member and i would say
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:14.560]  no i'm visiting and i did go visit their camp they weren't there they were off getting drunk
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:22.640]  and you could laugh at the ritual there in 2016 years ago it's in my film dark secrets
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.840]  inside bohemian grove and during the ritual with over a thousand worldly powerful billionaires and
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:35.200]  others movie stars you name it watching them do the molok ritual people say molok is uh
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:41.120]  you know a a bull not an owl this is all interchangeable it really is a bull if you
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:46.080]  look at it it's a horned owl slash bull they burn a child in heaven to chew it those men were in
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:52.720]  religious ecstasy i grew up a southern baptist slash evangelical slash methodist we would go to
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.040]  all those churches my grandmother my dad's that was a methodist his dad was a baptist my mom's family
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:02.240]  was southern baptist so i went to we also had evangelical churches we went to i haven't seen
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:07.600]  ecstasy people in religious rapture like i did at bohemian grove and i with mike hanson who was
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.600]  there with me simply said my sidekick at the time mike now does a great job in private business
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:19.360]  got him on as a guest sometimes he's so humble he's seen it all i said this is very interesting
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:22.800]  and those men looked at me like they wanted to tear my head off they
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:31.600]  were there just like the ancient jews in a good way this was a bad way wanted to go to the temple
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:38.000]  and go and have the priest go beyond the veil to relieve them of their sins to have the blood
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.280]  pass over them so that the judgment the angel of death wouldn't get them that was what i was seeing
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:49.520]  and they even talked about fowlst it was a mix of fowlst canaanite babelonian
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:56.640]  druidic magic men in power is a political retrospective written by the former german
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:01.200]  chancellor helmut schmidt he says we have our own groves we do rituals in i have blow ups the book
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:05.040]  in the film the book's back on the bookshelf that guy's i think it's back on that bookshelf
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:10.640]  in there in that room and in that studio and he says but i love the rituals at bohemian grove
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:16.800]  and more gets done with the trilateral commission and cfr there and then they admit in mainstream
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:24.720]  news it's giant gay orgies homosexual orgies and so you need to understand it's all about rebellion
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.400]  against the order of things and it leads to destruction and i'm not here at some level of
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:37.200]  hating gay people it's that historically whether it's sodomy and demora or the fall of rom or now
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:42.240]  that is pushed at the center of it uh joe scowles and final comments on this deal with the devil
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:48.000]  then i want to go to some phone calls well it works by the lure of immunity at the top the
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.680]  immunity against the chains of hell and at the lower levels immunity against earthly sins by
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:59.520]  controlling judges in congress and other uh aspects of law enforcement as above so below
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:09.360]  that's right uh at various forms of uh of um you know control and that's very important to have the
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:17.280]  the control of uh of the judiciary so this system is not going away uh at best what we can do i think
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.880]  is to try to build a resistance movement and that's why even though i don't believe that we're
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.840]  powerful enough to stop them i think that we have to educate as many people to build the remnant
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:34.640]  the remnant which god will inspire to resist and ultimately i think the second coming comes
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:40.640]  is to stop the satanic control and to take it down and then they will know that the promises of
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:47.280]  immunity do not hold and that they will in fact experience the chains of hell but really they
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:53.920]  do it does drive them tremendously uh to have this promise of immunity it's very very effective
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:59.120]  you're seeing it all through history and it's uh we're watching it at this very time
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:06.560]  god is a just god and gives us all these blessings our wonderful consciousness our free will everything
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.600]  good flows out of god that created reality anyone who has their head screwed on halfway straight
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:15.840]  feels it knows it sees it and i've had experiences that are private i want to get into on air it's
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:22.560]  real folks the enemy knows that how could these people not know that lucifer is the counterfeit
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:29.360]  they believe christ is the counterfeit how do they not in their very soul know it as prima facia joel
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.200]  it doesn't matter if they know it or not i mean satan knows what's real he still fights against
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.840]  it that's the point when you get a history of backlog of sin and i'm one of the point i wanted
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:47.760]  me the reason why the gay agenda is so important to this globalist agenda is because uh part of
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:54.800]  the lure is to have dirt on people to control them to tell them you look we've got this and this so
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.200]  you're going to do what we ask you to do or we will reveal these things and then they get deeper
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:05.200]  into it once you get deep enough into it in these kinds of sins and they love black maleable sins
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:10.720]  homosexual it used to be the ultimate black maleable sin it isn't as much today but it still
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:18.960]  is significant and they use that to cause people to say look this is your best choice out it doesn't
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:23.440]  matter if you know that hell is coming they're promising them immunity from that and that's
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:31.280]  an illusory hope that in fact lures a lot of people in it does work so they just do it out of fear
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:41.040]  yeah fear of the two bad choices you know admitting and what i'm doing is wrong and taking the
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:46.960]  consequences or the promise the illusory promise that somehow someone's going to give me immunity
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:52.240]  in there i can keep going in the same direction i i can do and get rewarded along the way with
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.120]  wine women and so on well there is a thrill in sin at a certain level but then it always gets
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:02.400]  really scary down that road i just and again i'm not up here on some high horse saying well
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.960]  i you know the fake church up there acting foolish attacking everybody which actually drives folks
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:14.720]  away but clearly uh clearly uh you know boarding our children this whole anti-human agenda we can
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.800]  see where it leads it's just it it's hellish it seems to me hell is almost of its own making i know
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:28.240]  god judges us but at the same time to me hell is just a place where all the bad spirits who
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.680]  resonate towards that go and that's what makes it hell is that the parasites the vampires don't
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.480]  have a god's creation to feed on it's almost like a phantom zone that they're being sent to i mean
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:45.280]  what is your idea hell from a biblical perspective well i think that there really is extreme suffering
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:51.840]  in hell and uh you know the reason is it's like you didn't learn the lessons of earth through
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:57.520]  listening to conscience and so you're going to get the extreme pain of consequences all poured
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:02.960]  onto your mind and it tends to purge out of people and god's own mercy tends to purge
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:09.360]  any desire to do those things again because they remember the pain and that's what i think hell does
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:15.840]  from a godly standpoint is help the people purge those evil desires because they experience the
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:22.400]  full pain or remember the entire concept of satanic driven government is to exclude people from the
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:26.960]  pain of their consequences so that they aren't judged so that they you know they get immunity
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:34.240]  from things you can see that god needs to give consequences and pain that we might learn if
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:40.560]  only by at the end of this world through the chains of hell it's pretty heavy stuff and whether
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:46.640]  folks believe in god the devil or not as a group consciousness it is manifesting and the world
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:52.480]  elite do follow luciferianism and then their minions are satanists it's just it's hardcore
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:56.640]  chris you're on the air with jill scowles and thanks for holding then we'll go to uh john mario
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:04.960]  alex and uh ian go ahead hey how's it going mr scouton fine thank you have a good question i'm
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:11.280]  a college student here in liberal california you know and um by a lot of my uh colleagues uh i've
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:16.480]  noticed aren't really you know that educated unfortunately and uh not trying to be arrogant
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:21.520]  or anything but you know the education level here is like really dumbed down um and you know
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.600]  it's ridiculous i live over here in the midst of what's happening with jade helmet everything
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.520]  and you know it's pretty scary stuff but um you know i just my question was for you is what do you
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:36.560]  think about you know the whole uh edward stoden revelations and whatnot because uh my colleagues
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:40.880]  when i told him about it they couldn't care less i mean they don't even know who their governor is
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:46.640]  loaded on the vice president so what's your opinion on that well the edner stoden revelations
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:52.480]  and i think he's sincere by the way um i think that they're the most significant revelation
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:58.880]  because it gave the mainstream world at least a glimpse into the fact of this total awareness
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:04.320]  spying program that the governments have involved in and stoden didn't even know half the picture
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:12.400]  i mean they've been spying on everyone and everything for years uh even before 9 11 it's
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:18.000]  very very significant and it's a good test for people if they aren't concerned with total spying
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  of people it's because they've been told it's just metadata that it isn't the content let me tell you
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.120]  it's impossible to extract the metadata until you have the the total content they've got it all
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.280]  and you have to understand the reason the reason is eventually to take down dissidents you know
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:40.000]  it can't be for terrorism because terrorism is mostly a controlled government operation
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:45.680]  so this is a litmus test to me to see if people have a good conscience they should be concerned
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:50.400]  if they aren't i don't really deal with a lot of people who don't sense that something's wrong
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:56.800]  i only concentrate my efforts on those that are at least aware enough to sense that something's
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:01.120]  wrong i was about to say christ said knock the dust off your feet it's not that we don't love these
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:07.280]  people but when they laugh at us and they show that spirit of contempt it means they're probably too
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.280]  far gone you need to move on to those that are receptive that's where you want to plant your
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:17.920]  seeds is in the good soil where it actually bears fruit he definitely you know i have a

[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:16.800]  let's move quickly through your calls john in texas you've got a question for joel go ahead
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:25.440]  uh yes my my my question is um i'm a black male i'm i speak spanish fully and i just bought uh i
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:32.880]  went down got some property down in panama i like joe's um uh expert opinion on panama i'm just
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:37.040]  really concerned i love the country i'm just concerned about china in panama with the panama
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:42.720]  canal well it's a good question you ought to be concerned i've spent a lot of time in central
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:50.640]  america including panama it's got uh you know perhaps the best banking uh ability for americans
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:56.880]  even despite the new shut down of most uh a lot of banks in central america aren't dealing with
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:02.880]  americans anymore but you can get service in panama um you've got to remember though that uh
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:08.480]  panama is not a principled country it'll make a deal with anybody who plans to bail them out
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:14.400]  that's why they made their extensive deals with uh red china china is intending to take the panama
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:21.040]  canal and that means occupying the country someday what i'm telling you is that all of the expat
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:26.480]  experience about the nice cheap easy living in in latin america especially central america won't
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:32.080]  hold up during a wartime scenario the tourist economy will disappear they'll be in constant
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:36.480]  deficit i think they'll confiscate american bank accounts and perhaps american property
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:43.200]  so i think while you still have a few years to enjoy that you ought to make plans to come back
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:50.080]  and strategically uh locate in the united states um and you might reference my book on that but
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:56.480]  absolutely let me ask a question is there anywhere in the world you think is better than the united
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:03.040]  states no not for americans especially americans can blend in here we're going to lose our liberty
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.960]  as a nation in my opinion but there'll be pockets large pockets of resistance especially out west
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:15.920]  where a lot of the good people will migrate after enduring war uh and there'll be majorities new
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.600]  majorities formed that i think we'll be able to resist i mean the preppers are the people that see
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.560]  it coming thank you for the great call john uh and and just by the source of our economy and
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:30.000]  we'll build new new little societies uh let's talk to alex in wisconsin you're on the air go ahead
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:37.440]  uh salutations joel alex uh i have two questions first question from joel is uh i've heard alex
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:40.560]  answer this one but uh what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:49.680]  uh and you're talking about the globalist conspiracy uh well where does it all end with
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:57.360]  you know is it just satanism as alex says or is uh you know where does it all get to the bottom of
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:04.560]  it you know what's the end game bottom well thank you you know the end game is uh total control
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:09.920]  without you realizing that you're under total control in other words sufficient crises so
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:14.800]  that people yield up their sovereignty and they for in their free will and keeping you in constant
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:21.280]  crisis uh so that you will continue to do that but ultimately satan is interested in the corruption
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:28.400]  of the soul it is a satanic agenda and that's why he's not content only for control he wants
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:33.840]  corruption as well that's why he's working on hollywood literature you know books movies you
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.880]  can see the acceleration they're now in major newspapers saying pedophilia is not a big deal
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:44.240]  and you're basically a pedophobe i mean there really there is no bottom of the pit
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:50.800]  thank you caller appreciate that one last call and i'll come back to other colors
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:53.840]  Joel's got to go mario you're our tail gunner with joles calcium go ahead
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:01.040]  hi alex that joel just want to say i'm huge fans uh me and my girlfriend we're at cal jam we just
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:07.440]  love the energy you brought uh people are waking up there's no question about that um joel for you
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:11.200]  people are waking you know to the atrocities that our government are part of but some
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.480]  are still worried about questions like conspiracies about inflatable balls and inifel
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:20.560]  but they don't want to believe that there's evil people in control in the government
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:27.520]  what would you say to that well that's a that's a big question first of all you've got to remember
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:32.880]  that there's a lot of phony conspiracies theories put out there specifically to discredit true
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:38.400]  conspiracies kassunstein admitted that white house plan right i i spent a lot of time for
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:42.640]  his brief debunking what i consider the false conspiracies and they're all over the place
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:47.360]  there's a lot of conspiracies talking about imminent nuclear war because of ukraine it's not
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:54.320]  going to happen russia isn't ready yet and they're going to get people tired of who who buy into that
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:29:00.000]  and run around with their like a head with their uh cut off claiming that nuclear war is imminent
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.680]  when it doesn't happen then when the real threat gets close nobody nobody will listen well look
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:10.800]  at how we never said marshal law this summer that it was training for that and part of a long-term
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:16.480]  conditioning they never quoted us or linked to us they just said we said imminent you know war
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:21.280]  takeover this summer so when it doesn't happen they'll write articles and say we said that so
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:26.800]  obviously that's their agenda and then even in the economy we've had people notable people from
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:35.360]  peter schiff to uh john um williams williams and uh jerald selenny uh for the past three years
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:39.760]  predicting imminent collapse and they don't understand sure the economy in the free market
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:44.640]  it should collapse but they don't understand the power the powers that be to keep things going
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:51.120]  and do not do that so we're out of time thank you so much we're on the match jolt gal's empires

[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.120]  there's about three months of it he's just taking it for like what i do is i take it for six days
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:22.640]  once a month and uh you'll lose well do lost 12 pounds in one week and he was already skinny or
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:27.600]  not fat he had tiny pot belly was it fat he had a six pack but it pooched out that was
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:33.360]  12 pounds of crap excuse my french but 12 pounds to try this and just it was unbelievable
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.280]  he went up to seven pills a day that was like three days it wasn't working he started taking more
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.440]  and it was just he might need two pills he might need seven eight pills a day there's nothing to
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:46.000]  do it like three times three months of it and it is in fact i need to remind me done it in about two
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:52.240]  months well i did it for a month so i guess it's been i get confused i did it like five months ago
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:58.240]  did like three months i guess i did a month ago and then i only did it for a few for a six day run
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:02.560]  and forgot to do it again but i've already lost so much weight that i took the photo last friday
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:07.280]  we're gonna put on an ad soon so even though i didn't even fully do it i didn't fully follow
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:11.680]  everything i said i would i still increase the amount of supplements because i'm always forgetting
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:15.600]  and i went for maybe doing my supplements religiously three days a week to about five days a week
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.960]  and lost even more weight so it's just amazing and and if you can just make yourself use it
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:28.400]  the iodine and the oxy powder and the secret 12 and the vitamin d3 winter sun and just
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:33.120]  all of it it's life changing all of it synergistically together but the biggest
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:38.960]  step to change your life is the iodine and the oxy powder those two things try those if they
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:45.040]  don't blow you away you've supported the broadcast you've heard the rape reviews and then i believe
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:49.760]  that will help you 99% it does and then you'll try the other products and it's a win win win
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:55.120]  we find this operation you put fuel into the tank for us to uh take off the ground and go over the
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:59.360]  enemy territory and bomb the living daylights out of them with info bombs uh let's go to this report
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:04.080]  by leon macadoo then back to your calls and then the news blitz straight ahead i'm alex shoves
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:24.000]  there are four things i want the public to know first when i got to work as secretary of state
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:30.800]  i opted for convenience to use my personal email account which was allowed by the state department
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:37.200]  because i thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:44.160]  emails instead of two nope turns out that first statement is a lie not only did just weeks earlier
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:54.960]  clinton admit to using two phones the big question okay iphone or android iphone
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:06.160]  okay in full disclosure blackberry and a blackberry the associated press obtained state department
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:13.040]  documents showing clinton emailed her staff on an ipad as well and obviously an ipad is a lot
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:18.720]  bigger than a second phone so hillary clinton's excuse that she needed this for convenience
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:25.680]  shouldn't trump national security now not only do we see clinton mixing personal and work chats
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:32.000]  here she responds to an email update on drone strikes with some interior decorating questions
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:38.080]  plus it seems like she can't seem to figure out how to use her ipad seems competent let's make her
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:45.760]  president second the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:51.200]  government addresses you'll recall that it was actually the hacker gucifer who revealed clinton's
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:56.640]  private email address and the fact that she seemed to be running her own secret spy network three men
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:01.920]  were involved in her private intelligence gathering efforts they were feeding her intel on among other
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:08.320]  things than gazi what difference at this point does it make now the state department pledged
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:14.640]  that they turned over all documents pertaining to the Benghazi investigation we went through a
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:21.600]  thorough process to identify all of my work related emails and deliver them to the state department
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:30.480]  at the end i chose not to keep my private personal emails not only did clinton set up her own private
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:35.440]  homebrew email server in order to control the flow of information but it turns out clinton
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:41.040]  actually wiped her server she admits that she destroyed the electronic copies of her state
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:48.480]  department emails on this private server after the state department subpoenaed those emails she
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:53.440]  basically told the congressional investigators what they could do with their letters and with
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:58.400]  their subpoenas she uttered she could have taught richard nixon a lesson so it's definitely not
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:03.440]  looking good for hillary that she wiped her server but then again we are talking about a woman who
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:09.920]  was fired from the watergate investigation for being unethical are you ready for hillary
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.240]  you know the old joke how do you know hillary clinton's lion she's breathing
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:24.240]  i mean the woman is just a complete lie it violates the open records act that's part of the
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:29.280]  national security act of 1947 but across the board the federal government is in a revolution
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:35.440]  against the law and not responding to four years you name it she used unrestricted
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:43.040]  unprotected it violates national security laws felony patreus just did a plea bargain people
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:48.800]  are going to jail for this okay there's so many crimes a she absconded use fake emails
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:55.280]  used pin names did official business secretly has been caught lying violated open records act
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:00.880]  we need to report hillary caught red-handed proof proof hillary clinton is a criminal for emails
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:05.120]  i mean just show it they had press conferences admitting a gun running program
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:08.480]  fast and furious before it ever even came out they said we're running this and they said they
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:15.280]  never heard about it and it was big sis and holder and all of them up their own tv and no media
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:21.680]  picked that up but us that i know i mean it's a joke but again her brainwashing is targeting people
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:28.080]  that live in the twilight zone now i want to go to your phone calls but let me hit some of these
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:34.640]  news items here senator robert menendez indicted on corruption charges for seven hundred thousand
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:40.800]  dollars in campaign donations and lavish vacations i mean this is something almost all of them do
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:47.200]  i he's a horrible globalist anti-guine slimy guy a lot of their dirt but you notice this is all
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:54.080]  this internal fight he's backing israel and then obama isn't i mean i thought this was all fake
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:44:01.280]  but starting to indict people over stuff i don't know menendez charges put iran legislation in doubt
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:08.480]  hillary clinton makes it hard to follow the money at the atlantic state department found four emails
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:14.880]  about drones sent by clinton yeah first he said it was official business then it wasn't as if as if
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:22.400]  the state department can quote authorize her and then it's okay well obama just authorizes opening

[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:58.240]  super caldera is due to erupt now in the scheme of time due to erupt the next thousand years
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:04.560]  but they they they some say can be imminent when you decrease the pressure on magma or lava
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:12.000]  increases or it changes its physical characteristics now it when you decrease the pressure it causes
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:19.360]  the lava to be more fluid so they may be trying to uh i'm not a hydrologist or a volcanologist

[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:48.480]  which is a typical run-of-the-mill social climbing democrat um actually in this case
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:52.240]  is the good guy and i can't even believe i'm saying that what we have up here if you'll
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:59.680]  remember is the jerry stent dusky child uh rape case which was connected to pennsy and um absolutely
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:05.600]  it's a giant pedophile command base yes yes okay well the attorney general it took over from
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:09.760]  from the attorney general that was in charge of that case broke her name is kathleen kane
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:14.880]  and we had up here back in the fall called what was called porn gate and it basically was at the
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:20.880]  time floated in the media as government official sharing porn on government computers but then
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:27.520]  what ended up happening was uh a man named uh supreme court justice nameless bachafri a 33
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:33.680]  degree freemason was brought down and had a resigning disgrace because of this and then
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:38.960]  the infighting between kathleen kane and sure i remember seeing this in the news but i'm not in
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:44.880]  pennsylvania like uh like you were pennsyl tuckie uh tell me exactly what you think's going on we

[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.360]  was child pornography in the emails between the government officials this and unfortunately
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:56:59.840]  those of us who are weak didn't pick it up this might fall i didn't pick it up because i okay it's
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:06.720]  okay what happened she she she is now being taken down by a district attorney in montgomery
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:11.520]  county pennsylvania whose husband we'll look into it you should put it all in again everybody needs
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:16.240]  to when you're in an area write an article or do youtube condensing it all together i want to

[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:49.120]  point that i wanted to uh ask joel was i was told by a a son of a former of a retired
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:55.600]  nuclear physicist that an emp is only temporary and it doesn't really knock out everything i mean
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:00.240]  it knocks it out temporarily but everything comes back well some stuff conks out some
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:06.720]  stuff gets fried but i do think emp gets overplayed some man made i don't think a kerrington event
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:12.240]  a mass coronal ejection that hits the earth will blow out large portions of the satellites
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:16.320]  and ground systems undoubtedly i think that's the real threat the stuff about iran and with
