[01:02.240 --> 01:09.720]  coming up in one hour and then we've got William Fain who was one of the last
[01:09.720 --> 01:20.280]  people to talk to the former Georgia senator who was exposing CPS white
[01:20.280 --> 01:25.080]  slavery rings who was killed over the weekend he'll be popping in in the last
[01:25.080 --> 01:29.880]  hour he believes she did not commit suicide nor did her husband commit
[01:29.880 --> 01:35.880]  suicide and he he talked to her about 48 hours before she was shot in the back
[01:35.880 --> 01:42.560]  and her husband was shot in the chest so that is coming up obviously I have a lot
[01:42.560 --> 01:48.360]  of really important news to cover and I want to open the phones up in the first
[01:48.360 --> 01:57.040]  hour but in the first hour I want to give first-time callers a chance to give
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.920]  us your take on the aftermath of the healthcare bills passage as we learn
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.200]  more and more about just how draconian this legislation is first-time callers
[02:06.200 --> 02:11.520]  calling in about the militia situation the raids that started Sunday there's
[02:11.520 --> 02:15.560]  been a new one another militia group indicted by feds a federal grand jury in
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.200]  New Haven Connecticut returned a seven count indictment charging five
[02:20.200 --> 02:23.480]  individuals cons with conspiracy and firearms offenses stemming from an
[02:23.480 --> 02:28.720]  alleged attempt to sell firearms and explosives grenades to a white
[02:28.720 --> 02:34.080]  supremacist group located outside of Connecticut and we've now seen the
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.920]  detention hearing we've got some details of the detention hearing of the
[02:37.920 --> 02:46.920]  hitari militia in a four-state raid centering in and around Michigan and I
[02:46.920 --> 02:53.240]  want to be clear about this I support the militia that's why we have Edwin
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.120]  Vieira on so we have read Beckman on one of the founders of the true modern
[02:59.120 --> 03:06.120]  militia but when I criticize federal provocateurs that go in and set up
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.920]  militias those federal agents and informants are not militia members
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.800]  they're not good they are bad and of course you have a lot of these militia
[03:15.800 --> 03:20.400]  leaders that are feds and I saw a few clips last night was sent a few emails
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.280]  of different people criticizing me and saying Alex Jones doesn't want you to
[03:25.280 --> 03:37.160]  buy firearms Alex Jones is throwing the hitari under the bus it's just the type
[03:37.160 --> 03:45.320]  of mindlessness that I'm used to seeing Texas voluntarily entered the union so
[03:45.320 --> 03:48.480]  did New Hampshire and other states we're not really the lone star state I love
[03:48.480 --> 03:51.720]  my state but other states have that power all the states have that power but
[03:51.720 --> 04:00.480]  Texas more clearly than any other state and I support people's right and the
[04:00.480 --> 04:08.920]  movement if they see fit at the people of Texas chose to secede but then I saw
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.360]  the Republic of Texas groups some serious some not serious I saw the media
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.200]  give attention to groups back in the late 1990s and sometimes you had five six
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.640]  seven eight or more different presidents and they would just all announce
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.600]  themselves presidents and have an entourage of four or five people who
[04:27.600 --> 04:33.840]  were commander general their wife would be the vice president and I would
[04:33.840 --> 04:36.880]  criticize those groups and say this is not legitimate the way you're going
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.920]  about this you're not my president they would say how dare you traitor I am the
[04:41.920 --> 04:47.880]  commander president of the earth might as well declare themselves emperor of

[08:56.320 --> 09:00.640]  to pedophile groups and they went to her house and shot her in the back and

[09:25.440 --> 09:32.080]  of the next hour I'm gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv we'll also play the
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.800]  audio here it's very revealing for radio listeners we have the video posted up
[09:37.800 --> 09:43.680]  on info wars.com an article that Kurt Nemo has written dealing with this
[09:43.680 --> 09:49.040]  supposed inward being yelled and black congressman being spit on the media had
[09:49.040 --> 09:52.080]  said it happened in the House chamber they said it happened outside the
[09:52.080 --> 09:56.360]  Capitol with people going in for the health care vote not this Sunday but
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.040]  the Sunday before last often on the last week and a half I've done a lot of
[10:01.040 --> 10:06.360]  investigating into this and I saw a video posted this morning by Paul Watson
[10:06.360 --> 10:11.160]  at prisonplanet.com that was the best produced yet from different camera
[10:11.160 --> 10:17.640]  angles of the supposed incidents you can clearly hear no one is yelling we're
[10:17.640 --> 10:24.760]  going to kill you no one is yelling the n-word no one is spitting on the black
[10:24.760 --> 10:30.000]  congressman now they have a tunnel that they can go in from their office
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.720]  building into the Congress the black congressman the black caucus chose to
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.520]  walk through the middle of the tea partyers that no other pro government
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.840]  health care takeover groups dare do it was a false flag it was a provocation
[10:46.840 --> 10:52.400]  and there is video from the time they walk out as they walk through there is
[10:52.400 --> 10:58.400]  the supposed spitting incident where the man is yelling kill the bill kill the
[10:58.400 --> 11:04.040]  bill the black congressman walks up and gets in his face the guy keeps yelling
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.440]  kill the bill the man claims he's been spit on you can clearly see no one
[11:08.440 --> 11:13.560]  spit on him no one said we're going to kill you no one called them the n-word
[11:13.560 --> 11:21.080]  the audio is clear the video is clear this is completely made up and there
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.600]  are hundreds of different videos from different angles and I've looked at
[11:25.600 --> 11:34.080]  scores of them there it is an absolute fact that this is staged and Keith
[11:34.080 --> 11:42.920]  Oberman and Chris Matthews but not just MSNBC CNN all of them are a pack of
[11:42.920 --> 11:50.360]  congenital liars who are invoking race who are invoking racism who were
[11:50.360 --> 11:56.840]  invoking race war who are calling down racial division people say oh I don't
[11:56.840 --> 12:00.640]  want big health care takeover I don't want socialism I don't want the IRS
[12:00.640 --> 12:05.120]  running my life I don't want the IRS controlling my paycheck oh you are a
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.760]  racist and they've been saying that for a year one time I caught bribery at the
[12:10.760 --> 12:15.240]  Capitol there's video of it it's up on our YouTube channel Mike Hansen dug the
[12:15.240 --> 12:21.360]  footage out that we aired on local TV in Austin showing a white man paying off
[12:21.360 --> 12:28.160]  three black men to go testify and talk about how much crime is involved with
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.960]  guns they're the ones playing the race card who put in the scary black guys up
[12:33.960 --> 12:37.920]  there to talk about how dangerous guns are and all the crime they've seen with
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.520]  them and how their former gang bangers and the news ran headlines asking if I
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.480]  was a racist because I showed black people getting a payoff from a white
[12:48.480 --> 12:55.360]  guy who was the one race pimping them and the news media the statesman called
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.600]  me and said would you have shown white guys being paid off and I said well
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.880]  absolutely of course I would have what type of question is that and they and
[13:05.880 --> 13:12.280]  they and they pose the question in the statesman am I a racist this is race
[13:12.280 --> 13:19.120]  politics ladies and gentlemen they obscure the real issues by injecting
[13:19.120 --> 13:25.280]  race and don't forget the Denver post had line oh eight race worker held in
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.560]  damage to Colorado HQ knocked out their own windows tore down the posters of
[13:30.560 --> 13:37.960]  Obama and went on the news saying that right wingers had done it how many
[13:37.960 --> 13:42.520]  cases have you seen of people spray-painting their own synagogues or
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.840]  their black dormitories with swastikas or the n-word this is done over and over
[13:46.840 --> 13:52.040]  again and of course in all fairness we dug this article out police woman with
[13:52.040 --> 13:59.960]  bees scratched in face faked political attack she did it in a mirror and did it
[13:59.960 --> 14:06.720]  backwards and later admitted to it and she said that black men had assaulted her
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.040]  in a parking lot and scratched the b-word in her face
[14:12.040 --> 14:24.840]  Barack Obama totally and completely staged so we'll be breaking that down
[14:24.840 --> 14:30.360]  coming up and we're gonna play the video and audio here and this is what not
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.640]  just Democrats are experts at this is what Republicans do this is what happens
[14:35.640 --> 14:40.080]  in dirty politics today this is what happens in dirty tricks I go out and
[14:40.080 --> 14:43.760]  start yelling at Michelle Malcolm while her people are yelling at me at the
[14:43.760 --> 14:53.440]  Denver Mint in 2008 and people that we later learned came with her with local
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.680]  conservative bloggers they arrived with her they left with her we don't know
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.160]  they were working with her but they came with local blogs from the college and
[15:02.160 --> 15:10.000]  they began screaming kill Michelle Malcolm kill Michelle Malcolm over and
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.680]  over and over again in the national news said that I had said it thank God we had
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.120]  all the camera angles put out a video showing that they were screaming and
[15:17.120 --> 15:27.800]  and forced retractions but this is how they operate this is the type of things
[15:27.800 --> 15:36.080]  they do they create distortions just like the wheelchair attack a man with his
[15:36.080 --> 15:41.120]  pair with his handicapped daughter in New York a few years ago comes out of a
[15:41.120 --> 15:47.040]  dark doorway starts ramming Gary Chalice of we are change with the wheelchair
[15:47.040 --> 15:52.760]  saying don't attack my daughter don't attack my daughter and it came out in
[15:52.760 --> 15:56.200]  court that that indeed had happened but not before the national media said how
[15:56.200 --> 16:06.600]  dare the 9-11 truthers they attacked this poor girl in a wheelchair for no
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.720]  reason they were waiting for we are changed they were there in a
[16:11.720 --> 16:16.800]  demonstration against Laura Bush calling for medical care for fireman police
[16:16.800 --> 16:23.520]  and other medical emergency personnel from 9-11 and that's the response they
[16:23.520 --> 16:33.560]  got and there's just so many other cases of this here is a article out of
[16:33.560 --> 16:42.600]  Detroit news today US attorney who tarry member shot cat to prepare for attack I
[16:42.600 --> 16:48.800]  will bet you a million dollars that's a lie they say their federal informant
[16:48.800 --> 16:53.560]  inside the group and their FBI agent inside the group they had multiple
[16:53.560 --> 17:00.640]  inside the group handling them they now admit another militia leader was one of
[17:00.640 --> 17:10.000]  the people that was supposedly inside her tarry and that's the type of thing
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.880]  they'll put out oh 9-11 truth attacks a girl in a wheelchair oh Alex says kill
[17:13.880 --> 17:20.240]  Michelle Malkin oh my gosh black guys put the word be on my face oh my gosh
[17:20.240 --> 17:26.760]  Republicans attacked the DNC headquarters in Denver this is not just
[17:26.760 --> 17:30.760]  something government does but intelligence agencies organizations and
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.800]  private individuals over and over again the last two years I have had prominent
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.760]  people just completely lie and say that I called them and threatened to kill them
[17:40.760 --> 17:47.400]  probably operatives but they may not be it's just it's like a woman if she's
[17:47.400 --> 17:51.360]  scorned it's been proven in major psychological studies that many women
[17:51.360 --> 17:56.680]  not a majority but a large percentage will just lie and say you raped them it's
[17:56.680 --> 18:04.640]  the frame-up culture it's the lie about your enemy's culture and I said Monday
[18:04.640 --> 18:09.840]  here on air Curt Nemo said Sunday in the articles he wrote when this was first
[18:09.840 --> 18:13.360]  happening that it would end up that a federal informant was inside one or
[18:13.360 --> 18:18.760]  more tricking the group into calling for violence or just flat out lying and
[18:18.760 --> 18:22.320]  saying that they did call for violence when they never did because I've had the
[18:22.320 --> 18:25.760]  national media do that to me I've had people at meetings try to set me up and
[18:25.760 --> 18:31.360]  lie and say that I'd said things so it I mean we had Dr. Frederick Whitehurst
[18:31.360 --> 18:36.000]  former head of the FBI crime lab on yesterday and he said yes the criminals
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.280]  rise at the top and run the FBI and almost every major police force and
[18:40.280 --> 18:45.560]  people are being framed in mass and that comes out every week major police
[18:45.560 --> 18:50.160]  departments are caught just framing people in mass so framing is what
[18:50.160 --> 18:58.200]  they're taught to do at commander level my guys went to Pittsburgh last year all

[24:09.880 --> 24:18.080]  that when I went on air Monday with Kurt Nemo's excellent articles pointing out
[24:18.080 --> 24:25.200]  that I had interviewed last year pale horse or sickles his real name and that
[24:25.200 --> 24:30.320]  they were dressed up in clownish fashion with voice changers and that it looked
[24:30.320 --> 24:35.160]  like something out of central casting from a setup of a militia out of 400
[24:35.160 --> 24:41.760]  plus public militias I singled that one out and I said that stinks like you find
[24:41.760 --> 24:48.800]  a dead animal in your attic that stinks it doesn't take a rocket scientist mind
[24:48.800 --> 24:54.520]  to know this and I said it's gonna come out that there were federal informants
[24:54.520 --> 25:00.240]  in there provocaturing them to shoot their mouths off well Tuesday the Wall
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.880]  Street Journal reported and now we have more of the indictment that indeed the
[25:04.880 --> 25:11.640]  thing was provocatured from start to finish and I guess I shouldn't have
[25:11.640 --> 25:15.200]  called him hillbillies but you know I call myself a hillbilly I say I come
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.840]  from some hillbilly hillbilly stock so you know that was not meant mean I was
[25:19.840 --> 25:24.600]  trying to protect whoever these operatives were trying to set up back in
[25:24.600 --> 25:29.640]  August of last year I was trying to point out that CNN and others were
[25:29.640 --> 25:34.840]  singling them out and when that starts happening you better look out just like
[25:34.840 --> 25:42.280]  we're being attacked by CNN and Fox and MSNBC right now they generally begin the
[25:42.280 --> 25:45.840]  attack beforehand and the way they dressed up and the things they said the
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.920]  things they did were leading right into that trap and then I got sent this audio
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.200]  last night of a supposed militia people saying yeah Alex says don't buy guns
[25:56.200 --> 26:03.360]  but that's not true Alex says don't do anything about the new world order more
[26:03.360 --> 26:11.320]  strong men more baloney why would I be attacked by a minority of militia leaders
[26:11.320 --> 26:17.360]  around the country for saying watch out militias are infiltrated watch what you
[26:17.360 --> 26:26.280]  say watch who you let in your group look out why I mean that's common sense
[26:27.040 --> 26:31.680]  because many of these groups are not just infiltrated they are led by the
[26:31.680 --> 26:38.840]  Southern Poverty Law Center they are led by the ADL they are led by the FBI we
[26:38.840 --> 26:46.640]  know the FBI was running the operation in Oklahoma City this isn't a game and so
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.280]  I think it's wonderful that people are training with firearms I think it's
[26:50.280 --> 26:54.880]  wonderful that people are preparing to defend themselves and their families
[26:54.880 --> 27:00.440]  that's why we have dr. Vieira on that's why we have read Beckman on that's why
[27:00.440 --> 27:07.920]  we have people on like officer Jack Mclam that's why we have Sheriff Mack on
[27:07.920 --> 27:15.560]  that's why we promote the book why the militia we are all in the militia and I
[27:15.560 --> 27:18.960]  got a call Monday going well why are you bashing the militia we're all in the
[27:18.960 --> 27:24.480]  militia I didn't bash the militia that's operatives inside these organizations
[27:24.480 --> 27:27.440]  attacking who their real enemy is why do you think all these big white
[27:27.440 --> 27:33.320]  supremacist organizations constantly attack Alex Jones like no one else and
[27:33.320 --> 27:38.200]  lie about me because they're fed run and I'm pointing out that Hal Turner and the
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.320]  rest of these people and it comes out constantly that the leaders not the
[27:42.320 --> 27:50.000]  members the leaders of these white supremacist organizations are feds and
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.960]  they're going around trying to infiltrate the militias so the militias can be
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.680]  demonized as racist and so they can set up the militias and the infiltrators in
[27:59.680 --> 28:04.240]  these groups they don't want me telling you this it's like ten years ago with the
[28:04.240 --> 28:08.960]  Gray family in a standoff the feds were about to roll in they had surveillance
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.360]  cameras trucks everything I went out there when no one else all these big
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.200]  tough militias they were nowhere to be seen I went out there I drew attention
[28:16.200 --> 28:20.400]  to it I got them support that media attention backed it off and then I
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.560]  showed up a week later and there were these guys in militia outfits going don't
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.320]  trust him he's a fad he's infiltrating you he's getting surveillance of you and
[28:28.320 --> 28:33.280]  then it came out a month later in the news that both those guys were cops and
[28:33.280 --> 28:41.200]  still that family said we don't care we believe the cops that's how they isolate
[28:41.200 --> 28:48.440]  you that's how that's I mean I've been through this over and over and over again
[28:48.440 --> 28:55.600]  I'm here saying watch out look out be careful and then the feds and their
[28:55.600 --> 29:02.120]  weak-minded minions a lot of meanwhile are like Alex you are against the
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.000]  militia well what is the militia we are the militia the American people and I
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.560]  always get criticized by different militia leaders for saying Alex doesn't
[29:11.560 --> 29:15.480]  call for violence he doesn't call for standing up physically he's a wimp
[29:15.480 --> 29:22.400]  that's provocaturing ladies and gentlemen it's so simple to anyone who has
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.840]  any discernment so I'm right again I told you money there be informants but
[29:26.840 --> 29:32.760]  they were set up and it turns out there were other militias ratting on them and
[29:32.760 --> 29:35.880]  they weren't ratting they're probably the one setting them up and that's what's
[29:35.880 --> 29:39.840]  got some of those groups up there scared is because I'm hot on their federal
[29:39.840 --> 29:46.280]  operation and their tail and I back in August what 10 months ago nine months
[29:46.280 --> 29:53.360]  ago I nailed it with precision as usual we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.360 --> 30:01.960]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know

[33:23.760 --> 33:27.560]  reporting there's informants inside and it's a setup saying watch there's going
[33:27.560 --> 33:32.360]  to be informants they pick this group they provocateur them I said that back in
[33:32.360 --> 33:38.880]  August I know what I'm seeing and then suddenly I get criticized oh Alex Jones
[33:38.880 --> 33:45.120]  he's a fed he's saying look out there's feds only feds or their moron followers
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.600]  who were being duped would say such a thing I've been telling you for over
[33:48.600 --> 33:52.640]  three months that moving into the month of April you're gonna have raids on
[33:52.640 --> 33:58.800]  militias and attempts to get firefights going on and a new Waco and some people
[33:58.800 --> 34:04.080]  who aren't feds want that to happen they want a war to start and they're always
[34:04.080 --> 34:09.960]  trying to push people to get this going and that's what's happening ladies and
[34:09.960 --> 34:14.600]  gentlemen they don't want legitimate aboveboard debate we have all the poll
[34:14.600 --> 34:19.520]  numbers we have the majority of Americans waking up the people are angry
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.000]  they're voting out incumbents both Republicans and Democrats Rand Paul in
[34:24.000 --> 34:32.480]  Kentucky shows that we're having massive success because whoever shoots first
[34:32.480 --> 34:40.640]  loses and I'm gonna do more shows on the militia and and break down the history
[34:40.640 --> 34:44.720]  of the real modern militia with red Beckman and others and Vieira promoting
[34:44.720 --> 34:49.800]  it versus the Patriot mythology and the best way to boil this down and give you
[34:49.800 --> 34:56.320]  a case point example is this it's the mid-1990s into 96 97 98 99 I have a
[34:56.320 --> 35:03.680]  radio show in Austin I have an access television show and there were over the
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.640]  years more than 20 different Republic of Texas groups but at one time there was
[35:08.640 --> 35:12.200]  many as eight different presidents and they would have a meeting at their
[35:12.200 --> 35:19.440]  farmhouse this was the average MO and the family would elect their father as
[35:19.440 --> 35:26.120]  the president of Texas and then other groups would have meetings at hotels and
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.600]  elect themselves president and then you'd have no military you'd have one
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.000]  guy who was a general in a full generals outfit looking like a complete clown and
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.280]  we would have events second amendment events land rights events and they would
[35:40.280 --> 35:44.440]  show up like clowns these different groups in front of the news media and we
[35:44.440 --> 35:49.160]  discovered most of them were Southern Poverty Law Center ADL meant to make a
[35:49.160 --> 35:56.640]  movement for Texas sovereignty and possible secession look ridiculous the
[35:56.640 --> 36:01.560]  globalist understand perception and I would say to these Republic of Texas
[36:01.560 --> 36:09.280]  people hey in 1776 they got a unanimous declaration from the leaders of the 13
[36:09.280 --> 36:16.000]  colonies from former governors legislators judges prominent leaders
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.720]  and that's what we have happening now in over 30 states we're taking our states
[36:19.720 --> 36:23.120]  back the states are saying no to the new world order they're passing anti-un
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.640]  resolutions they're saying they're gonna nullify the health care takeover that's
[36:27.640 --> 36:32.600]  how you do it that's serious people in suits and ties and and and then of the
[36:32.600 --> 36:40.040]  feds try to come in then you go to a 1776 situation but that's how it's done
[36:40.040 --> 36:44.440]  you don't have people in trailer houses and I'm not bashing trailer houses I've
[36:44.440 --> 36:47.840]  got family living trailer houses trailer houses are great the point is it just
[36:47.840 --> 36:51.560]  seems that most of them are in a trailer house declaring themselves the president
[36:51.560 --> 36:55.600]  of the state I live in I didn't vote for you you know they didn't get a
[36:55.600 --> 37:04.760]  president to the 13 colonies after they won the war seven eight years later we
[37:04.760 --> 37:10.440]  didn't get George Washington for a long time we had to have a bill of rights
[37:10.440 --> 37:16.080]  first all of that had to take place so you don't just say I live on a farmhouse
[37:16.080 --> 37:21.200]  or I live in an apartment in downtown Austin I am the president of Texas I
[37:21.200 --> 37:26.200]  am the president and I have two family members who wear military uniforms and
[37:26.200 --> 37:30.880]  that's my military and I have a bass boat out back that is what I'm
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.960]  criticizing that is what I'm saying is a joke and it's meant to make us look like
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.600]  a joke that's what the media is gonna go out and point their cameras at and say
[37:39.600 --> 37:47.200]  look at this look at these people this is who is opposing the government and
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.840]  then they went out to the few groups out in West Texas that were not fed run but
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.400]  had declared themselves the leaders of the provisional government and they
[37:55.400 --> 38:01.760]  murdered them and what you had was a whole bunch of Republic of Texas groups
[38:01.760 --> 38:05.200]  all fighting with each other going I'm the president no I'm the president I'm
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.560]  the president no I'm the president no you're he's the president no she's the
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.840]  president and I would meet these people they I would have them on the access TV
[38:13.840 --> 38:17.720]  show or I'd see them down there are other shows and I mean it would literally be some dirtball
[38:17.720 --> 38:22.880]  some swimy person who couldn't even talk with gold jewelry hanging around their
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.560]  neck and and and you know getting out of some van reeking of whiskey though and
[38:28.560 --> 38:34.280]  I'm the president I'm the president and they they put that on the news he's the
[38:34.280 --> 38:41.080]  president making us look like a joke they've had major polls in Texas showing
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.640]  the majority of Texans want to secede and that number is getting higher well if
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.840]  you want to do that you go to the state house and the clauses are in the Texas
[38:51.840 --> 38:56.440]  Constitution and you have a vote and if it if it doesn't pass you get more
[38:56.440 --> 38:59.920]  people to run for the state house and we get our people and if that's what you
[38:59.920 --> 39:02.480]  choose as voters I'm not even saying that's what should happen at this stage
[39:02.480 --> 39:06.640]  rather have the state nullify it take our federal government back but it's
[39:06.640 --> 39:10.360]  better to secede than to be run by offshore corporations through the federal
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.840]  government but no I'm not gonna bow down on my knees to the first person that
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.200]  walks up and gets out of a van reeking of Jack Daniels and kneel before them and
[39:21.200 --> 39:27.000]  say I swear fieldy to the oh great president oh great Sam Houston king of
[39:27.000 --> 39:34.120]  earth alright I said I'd go to your calls that is the issue I have a problem
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.040]  with and everyone should ask themselves in your militia group in your
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.280]  organization or militias you know who are the militias that support Alex Jones
[39:42.280 --> 39:46.040]  and are intelligent and know what they're doing and have a code of not
[39:46.040 --> 39:52.960]  allowing provocateurs in to send you all to prison and frame you for the terror
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.640]  attacks that the government is about to stage and has been staging to be blamed
[39:56.640 --> 40:00.160]  on the tea parties and conservatives and gun owners and returning veterans and
[40:00.160 --> 40:07.280]  libertarians who has common sense out there if you've got a militia that you're
[40:07.280 --> 40:11.800]  in or that you're around that on Monday was saying how dare Alex say feds
[40:11.800 --> 40:15.640]  provocateur this these were great patriots getting ready to kill police
[40:15.640 --> 40:20.920]  they they had what it took they had co-honies they were ready and Alex is
[40:20.920 --> 40:24.920]  calling them hillbillies that got set up by informants there are no informants
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.680]  Jones made that up that people I learned yesterday were saying this on Monday and
[40:28.680 --> 40:33.080]  Tuesday well it came out Tuesday and Wednesday that I was absolutely correct
[40:33.080 --> 40:39.680]  in spades and it's not hard I use the a parable or the analogy of if it's
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.000]  Super Bowl Sunday and the Super Bowl is coming on at five o'clock central and I
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.840]  get on the air on a Friday and say are you going to watch the Super Bowl Sunday
[40:47.840 --> 40:51.560]  and then on Monday morning rolls around and I get a hundred emails and phone
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.920]  calls saying how did you know the Super Bowl was going to come on how did you do
[40:56.920 --> 41:01.920]  it Alex I mean this is too incredible how did you know that the Super Bowl was
[41:01.920 --> 41:12.000]  going to come on at five p.m. central I read the TV guide I turned on the cable
[41:12.000 --> 41:21.360]  and and looked at the guide I've seen them do this over and over and over and
[41:21.360 --> 41:27.600]  over and over and over again and I think in this process we're learning who the
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.240]  feds are or who is controlled by feds and I think it's very very interesting and
[41:32.240 --> 41:39.200]  quite frankly scary because I'm here saying we shouldn't kneel down to
[41:39.200 --> 41:43.680]  somebody who says they're the president of Texas oh you're against Texas
[41:43.680 --> 41:47.800]  sovereignty you're against the Second Amendment you're that's a strong man
[41:47.800 --> 41:52.880]  attack I'm all for Texas sovereignty if that's what the voters choose the voters
[41:52.880 --> 42:00.480]  the voters not somebody on the back 40 drunk on Jack Daniels saying I'm the
[42:00.480 --> 42:09.640]  president not some group up in Michigan whether they were good batter and
[42:09.640 --> 42:13.760]  different I don't know I just know one of their members was dressing up like a
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.000]  clown right out of central casting with a guy standing behind him like a
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.880]  lieutenant with a world war one helmet on and a gas mask with a potbelly just
[42:23.880 --> 42:28.640]  designed to make militias look stupid designed to make us look like cooks
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.840]  designed with a voice changer to demonize and to set up a group and I
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.600]  called it in August and what happened I'm reading the TV guide here ladies and
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.560]  gentlemen if I'm driving down the road at 70 miles an hour at midnight in the
[42:43.560 --> 42:46.280]  Texas Hill Country and I see a bunch of deer by the side of the road about to
[42:46.280 --> 42:50.320]  jump out in front of my car I hit the brakes Alex how did you know how to hit
[42:50.320 --> 42:53.000]  the brakes well I saw a bunch of deer right there about to jump out in front
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.520]  of my car I mean this is this is 101 brain dead people should be able to
[42:58.520 --> 43:03.120]  understand this okay brain dead individuals should be able to understand
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.760]  what I'm talking about and anytime I've said look out militias for anybody that
[43:07.760 --> 43:11.720]  calls for violence in your group and the usual suspects come out and say how dare
[43:11.720 --> 43:16.760]  you fed say look out for people that talk and call for violence and call for
[43:16.760 --> 43:23.400]  targeting government installations you are a fed no that person putting on that
[43:23.400 --> 43:31.600]  accent is the fed we need to be cool here we need to be collected we need to
[43:31.600 --> 43:39.000]  watch our backs we need to not be provocateur shut up fed Monday morning I
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.600]  come on the air I say this is all provocateur there's gonna be informants
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.680]  inside it's gonna tie into pale horse you just watch how dare you pale horse is
[43:46.680 --> 43:51.800]  a great American there's no informant in there they were great patriots getting
[43:51.800 --> 43:56.800]  ready to bring down the new world order beast
[44:00.800 --> 44:06.120]  and listen here boy Alex you're not a man you're a boy because you're not
[44:06.120 --> 44:11.480]  calling for war like I've been doing for 15 years yeah because you've been
[44:11.480 --> 44:16.960]  calling for violence all these years and you're not in jail
[44:17.960 --> 44:25.200]  Hal Turner for 10 years I told you that guy was a fed now admitted in federal
[44:25.200 --> 44:33.480]  court highest level FBI agent national security level not any terrorism
[44:33.480 --> 44:43.200]  national security level working with Sean Hannity 15 years ago 10 years ago I
[44:46.280 --> 44:52.280]  can't believe what Alex did saying feds had infiltrated that's so bad that's
[44:52.280 --> 44:57.400]  like telling an old lady not to walk out in front of an 18-wheeler he I can't
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.400]  believe Alex did this I can't believe he said some of the militias are
[45:01.400 --> 45:06.200]  infiltrated why my federal handler that I don't knows a federal handler tells me
[45:06.200 --> 45:10.280]  that anybody that says look out no call for violence they're a fed meanwhile the
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.880]  feds sitting right next to him going let's go over some scenarios of planned
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.480]  attacks on government installations just in case the recorders going the
[45:18.480 --> 45:22.040]  recorders going they're planning to get a big collar they're planning to get
[45:22.040 --> 45:25.800]  move up the echelon by framing you and setting you up and they're there
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.120]  telling you don't listen to Alex I remember when I exposed what was going
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.800]  on with that pale horse guy now in jail but they say one of their informants is
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.920]  in jail just for their safety as a cover just like the Mumbai federal agent
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.360]  running the op has been arrested to protect his cover that's all admitted
[45:43.360 --> 45:49.000]  Alex don't you dare say a US government operation ran the Mumbai attacks boy
[45:49.000 --> 45:56.360]  that Alex he's a fed while he's saying 9-eleven's an inside job
[45:56.360 --> 46:04.320]  all right I said I'd go to your calls or go to him right now it's just I'm gonna
[46:04.320 --> 46:09.280]  cover this more later but this is the season they are getting ready to stage
[46:09.280 --> 46:13.760]  in Oklahoma City they're building up to it I told you a year ago I've been
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.400]  intensifying the last three months I've told you you've been listening I have
[46:17.400 --> 46:21.400]  told you exactly what's going to happen and now here we are and they are all
[46:21.400 --> 46:29.840]  over the country trying to set up militias right now and for that the
[46:29.840 --> 46:34.400]  feds that pepper the militia are saying this is terrible how he's throwing the
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.920]  militia under the bus here and and and then some people who are under their
[46:38.920 --> 46:43.560]  mind control who aren't feds are going yeah yeah yeah I can't believe what that
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.400]  boy is doing I can't believe it I can't believe it it's like sounds like foghorn
[46:48.400 --> 46:54.600]  leghorn or something let's talk to Paul in Florida you're on the air go ahead
[46:54.600 --> 47:01.040]  thank you Alex for all your good work you know they've been co-opping the Tea
[47:01.040 --> 47:06.960]  Party and highlighting and starting up these militias I've got two questions in
[47:06.960 --> 47:12.920]  one gift I'm asking you about this because you know the Libertarian Party
[47:12.920 --> 47:18.160]  isn't you said at the other day that it was our best hope but could it be possible
[47:18.160 --> 47:22.520]  that we don't know exactly how America's here to come in and put their hands in
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.360]  the huddle circle and join together we might not see that aspect of the
[47:27.360 --> 47:31.600]  movement manifested yet right now what is the greatest hope for the Jedi of
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.040]  today well Paul I appreciate your call I don't remember seeing the Libertarians
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.600]  of the greatest hope when they ran Bob Barr for president that those hopes were
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.240]  dashed I think the greatest hope is taking the states back one representative
[47:46.240 --> 47:52.720]  at a time at the legislative level in the states but people are together they
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.760]  are against Obamacare they are against the carbon taxes they are against all
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.760]  the different things that are happening I am for the real militia I'm trying to
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.600]  protect the militia the honorable men and women that are involved in it and
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.080]  doing a great job and understand we're under threat and who are preparing to
[48:10.080 --> 48:15.760]  defend the Republic I'm simply pointing out that they're trying to set up the
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.840]  militia and radicalize it and provocateur it right now so we can stop what
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.600]  they plan to do in the next few months I'm going up against their main
[48:25.600 --> 48:31.480]  operation which is to get a violent confrontation going whether real or
[48:31.480 --> 48:37.680]  manufactured and that's why the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL CNN Fox
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.520]  New York Times Newsweek London Guardian the list goes on and on are all lying
[48:42.520 --> 48:48.680]  about me saying I'm calling for violence notice what's happening they've got the
[48:48.680 --> 48:52.320]  Fed run white supremacist groups attacking me they've got the minority of
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.200]  the Fed run militias attacking me they've got all the major media attacking me
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.720]  because I know what they're doing I've seen them do it over and over and over
[49:01.720 --> 49:08.240]  again the biggest thing we can do is keep waking people up folks are ready to be
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.360]  awakened now and buy firearms and get self-sufficient and train with those
[49:14.360 --> 49:20.280]  firearms to protect ourselves that's a great bulwark but if we can just
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.720]  politically get active instead of letting them stage events to demonize
[49:23.720 --> 49:28.120]  our stage rights movement our notification movement if we can hold the
[49:28.120 --> 49:32.120]  line and keep moving forward and not let them trick us into a fight we're
[49:32.120 --> 49:36.520]  going to win this thing and that's why they're pulling out all the stops
[49:36.520 --> 49:40.640]  against us and it's only sending us more listeners and backfiring on the New
[49:40.640 --> 49:44.600]  World Order so I appreciate it all Greg in Kansas you're on the air
[49:44.600 --> 49:52.480]  hi Alex I'm first on caller welcome with all these community states and for
[49:52.480 --> 49:56.760]  government talking about how they don't have enough money how's that compare
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.320]  how's that square with the comprehensive annual financial reports all right let
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.120]  me explain what's happened it's an excellent point Greg since the 50s
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.600]  every county city state water district you name it has a double set of books
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.640]  they tell the public the budget is bankrupt we've got to have more taxes
[50:16.640 --> 50:22.040]  meanwhile the second set of books normally has triple or even more assets
[50:22.040 --> 50:29.400]  bonds holdings that are completely separate from even pension funds but
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.240]  what's happened with the derivative bubble is the banks got government to
[50:33.240 --> 50:36.600]  invest with them they've now stolen all of that money and they're telling the
[50:36.600 --> 50:39.840]  government now at every level you've got to go out and squeeze the people if
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.120]  you're even going to get your pension fund money so it's all about getting
[50:43.120 --> 50:46.480]  people under their control getting them deeper into debt getting the government
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.240]  deeper into debt and so now many communities are on the verge of actually
[50:51.240 --> 50:54.240]  going bankrupt because they've even stolen the money out of the
[50:54.240 --> 51:01.200]  comprehensive annual financial reports we'll be right back stay with us the

[52:04.720 --> 52:08.000]  order a new world order based upon collective
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.120]  invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through their own
[52:12.120 --> 52:16.720]  words and documents the new world order really is a tool for addressing a new
[52:16.720 --> 52:21.240]  world of possibilities it means all the world under their control the United
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.640]  Nations would take over America the trilateral Commission would control the
[52:25.640 --> 52:30.360]  world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in

[55:05.320 --> 55:11.240]  hello how are you doing good morning afternoon welcome Darren okay reason why
[55:11.240 --> 55:14.640]  I'm calling is that let me give you a little work there and are you on a speaker
[55:14.640 --> 55:17.880]  phone because every caller's had bad audio and I don't know what's going on we
[55:17.880 --> 55:23.680]  need to start checking are you on a speaker phone no I'm on Skype okay I
[55:23.680 --> 55:26.720]  swear phone lines are just getting worse and worse by the minute but I'll go
[55:26.720 --> 55:31.280]  ahead and make your point okay I've been in negotiations with this gentleman who
[55:31.280 --> 55:37.640]  owns Barry sitoro.com and since you have the t-shirt thing to try to promote
[55:37.640 --> 55:41.760]  I figured the two would go together so I just wanted to pass that along you know
[55:41.760 --> 55:45.200]  to you guys and see if you guys want to take it further up to you or whatever
[55:45.200 --> 55:52.240]  let's tell you well I mean sure we if somebody wants to give us a website I
[55:52.240 --> 55:55.920]  don't know how much traffic it would get we could throw some stuff on the side
[55:55.920 --> 55:59.680]  about always really Barry sitero and we're just here trying to get the word
[55:59.680 --> 56:02.520]  out about that that he's really an Indonesian citizen and not eligible to
[56:02.520 --> 56:09.520]  be president regardless of the regardless of the whole Kenya situation
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.040]  which I believe he was born in Kenya the evidence all points that way but this is
[56:13.040 --> 56:16.600]  a huge issue because we know for those that just joined us his real name is
[56:16.600 --> 56:22.520]  Barry sitero and he's not eligible to be president. It's a good way of chatting the
[56:22.520 --> 56:25.520]  president and it's not really what he could do about it because he's denying
[56:25.520 --> 56:30.040]  that his name I guess that publicly now so yeah I think it's a pretty good one
[56:30.040 --> 56:35.320]  but anyway I guess I could send you guys the info or something like that or
[56:35.320 --> 56:41.320]  whatever. What is the guy trying to sell the website? He's trying to sell the
[56:41.320 --> 56:48.280]  domain name. Well that's great Darren I appreciate your call you know people
[56:48.280 --> 56:52.720]  think domain names are where it's all at but I mean really it's a site that you
[56:52.720 --> 56:56.400]  post news and information on that you build over years that has massive
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.320]  traffic. I mean we put all the Barry sitero stuff up on infowars.com up on
[57:01.320 --> 57:06.000]  prisonplanet.com we have guests on that expose that and I'm not saying I don't
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.000]  want the domain but we'd have to build something and do something with it and
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.720]  promote it. I've got more than 20 websites but I appreciate the kind of
[57:13.720 --> 57:18.960]  thought Darren just whoever has it needs to build a website and we'd be happy
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.320]  to link to it. We work with everybody here. Let's talk to Daniel in North
[57:22.320 --> 57:28.080]  Carolina you're on the air Daniel. Alex how are you sir? I'm fine go ahead.
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.640]  First time caller a huge fan been listening for years had a couple
[57:32.640 --> 57:38.280]  comments about the health care bill. Extremely atrocious I was up watching in
[57:38.280 --> 57:42.400]  C-SPAN whenever it got passed and then the bunch of family members were up
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.040]  watching it out of all the craziness in the bill and all the bad stuff that's
[57:48.040 --> 57:51.320]  in it you know taking our rights away to governments forcing us to buy a
[57:51.320 --> 57:55.320]  commercial product. One thing I've noticed that this is for the people that I
[57:55.320 --> 57:58.760]  know and especially some of the older people I know this is really broken some
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.000]  of them up I've given you know at least 2,000 copies of your DVDs out to
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.280]  randomly into all my family and friends and several people have told me it's
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.320]  that man you know this this guy knew what he was talking about so I guess
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.800]  that's my point if one good thing comes from the crazy you know unconstitutional
[58:15.800 --> 58:20.800]  health care bill it's really woke in a bunch of people up that wow this is just
[58:20.800 --> 58:27.080]  crazy I guess your comments on that. My comments specifically on the fact that
[58:27.080 --> 58:33.240]  for every action there's an equal reaction folks are waking up because now
[58:33.240 --> 58:39.240]  there's no more room for denial this he is bonafide tyranny. Thanks for the call.

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:20.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:28.520]  Jones. We're in our number two, Wayne Madsen. The Wayne Madsen Report is our
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.600]  guest to work for the National Security Agency. We're always honored to have
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.880]  Lane Madsen on with us. He's written for some of the largest publications in the
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:45.480]  country. He of course has appeared on ABC News, NBC, CBS, PBS, CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera,
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:51.880]  MSNBC and as I said he also is a U.S. Naval Officer. Managed one of the
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.480]  first computer security programs for the U.S. Navy. He subsequently worked for the
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.920]  National Security Agency, the Naval Data Automation Command, Department of State,
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.160]  RCA Corporation and Computer Science Corporation. Madsen was a senior fellow
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.920]  for the Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC and a privacy public
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.320]  advocacy organization. We've got him on about WikiLeaks, his investigation into
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.760]  what WikiLeaks really is and are they under attack like we've been hearing.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.520]  We're also going to talk about the railway bombings. We're going to get into a
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:29.960]  host of issues. Also this healthcare looting that the healthcare lobbying
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:35.200]  arms actually got passed. The right wing won't tell people this is just a
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.000]  bailout like the banking bailout and the left is acting like this is a free
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.600]  handout. So it's even worse than what the critics of Obamacare are actually saying.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.640]  So we'll talk about that with Lane. He always has breaking news for us. Wayne
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.040]  Madsen, good to have you here with us. Good to be with you Alex. So much is
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.120]  happening. Let's get into WikiLeaks first. Well certainly it seems like this
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.880]  WikiLeaks is not what it appears to be. They're claiming they're under some
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.200]  surveillance and operation led by the U.S. government and the Icelandic
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.200]  authorities, the Icelandic government which has been battered severely by the
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:19.000]  likes of Soros and his hedge funds and Goldman Sachs and all these other
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.160]  criminal elements in the banking industry. Probably the last thing they
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.800]  need it was WikiLeaks showing up to push this bill to turn Iceland into this
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:35.920]  haven for journalists and whistleblowers and leakers of every stripe. There's
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.480]  an old saying, if it's too good to be true, it probably is and
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.960]  certainly this looks like this is a red herring. This whole operation in Iceland
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.600]  looks like it's intended to find a safe harbor for people to leak corporate
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.040]  information that can be damaging to competitors, especially competitors to
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.040]  Mr. Soros and Goldman Sachs. Well I've noticed that some of these leaks are
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.040]  selective but some of it has been extremely damaging to the system. I
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.880]  mean I think I've researched WikiLeaks. I think a lot of people involved in it are
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.800]  very good but certainly government could use this to leak things that it wants
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:18.800]  out. Well certainly in the case of an old Swiss banking group, an investment
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.480]  group called Julius Baer, which was founded in the 19th century, was one of
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.440]  the most secretive and most considered one of the most stable Swiss financial
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:36.560]  institutions. WikiLeaks started leaking customer data from them. However,
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:43.320]  WikiLeaks began in 06. The leaks from Julius Baer actually started in 2002. So
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.040]  there was this time frame where someone else was leaking that information and
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.880]  WikiLeaks seemed to have glommed onto it. Anyway, what was leaked was people who
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:56.600]  had accounts in the Cayman Islands. Now the US, all this information was turned
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.400]  over to Carl Levin and Robert Morgenthau, the DAF in Manhattan, and they
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.760]  started yelling and screaming about tax evaders. But many of these
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.440]  people were not even US citizens. They were residents of Hong Kong, Singapore,
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:16.720]  and other jurisdictions where offshore accounts are perfectly legal. So
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.520]  it looked like this was basically an attempt to weaken Julius Baer because
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.360]  right after the WikiLeaks publication, Baer's stock dropped 60%. They were then
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:33.320]  subject to a hospital takeover bit by Goldman Sachs. And their CEO was found
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:39.680]  dead. They set a suicide, but nobody seems to know why Alex Widmer, a widower
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.280]  with three kids 52 years of age, was found dead in Switzerland.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:51.760]  We'll get more into WikiLeaks straight ahead and get into a host of other
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:58.280]  absolutely key issues. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.480]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.800]  nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:32.040]  has established an all-powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the

[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  Is the attack on Iran back on the front burner with the CIA now saying they do
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.360]  have nukes or can make nukes? This is like 2003, groundhog day with Iraq all over
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.360]  again. We'll get into some interesting tidbits of knowledge he has on the
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:47.560]  train bombings over in Moscow and other bombing today in a separate area of the
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:53.840]  Russian Federation. But before we go back to Wayne Madsen, I have two new films
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.040]  coming out in the month of April. It's now April. You can pre-order them both.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.200]  Invisible Empire and New World Order Defined comes out April 15th. It will
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.320]  premiere at prismplanet.tv on the highest quality online. You can also order
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:12.440]  the DVD and super high quality and get all the extras at infowars.com for
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.320]  Invisible Empire and New World Order Defined. Go watch the trailers, read about
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.120]  the film. It just covers the whole New World Order, their roundtable groups, how
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.120]  the Anglo-American establishment operates, the admission in their own words of
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.480]  world government, what type of world government will be, government narcotics
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:33.520]  trafficking, white slavery trafficking, pervert guilds in the Congress, the
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.720]  occultic activities. It just covers everything A to Z with stunning
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:44.440]  graphics. It's got Mark Dice, Peter Del Scott, G. Edward Griffin and others,
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.960]  Jason Burma's film, and then Police State for the Rise of FEMA. Hadn't made a
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.600]  documentary on the police state in almost eight years. The FEMA camps are
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.520]  conclusively proven how the shadow government operates, the National
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.760]  Security Directives, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the Torture,
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.440]  the Black Sites. It's just all covered. The proof. People want to know about the
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.160]  shadow government, how the New World Order takeovers taking place, how they're
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.640]  federalizing police, the G-20 attacks on peaceful citizens, the snatching grabs.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:20.240]  The global is trying to set up my crew. It's an amazing documentary film, two
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.280]  hours and 20-plus minutes long, and that's not counting all the extras. It's
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.000]  over three hours with all the extras. Police State for the Rise of FEMA,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.120]  both films are 1995. You get both of them, get a big discount, infowars.com,

[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.240]  Madsen. Wayne, I really respect your analysis because I've been following you
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.280]  for more than a decade, a decade ago. I didn't know what to think. I mean, a lot
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.240]  of your stuff was turned out to be true. Other parts of it I couldn't confirm
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:11.280]  until years later when I really got even more respect for you and I've, I can't
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.960]  think of when I've seen you be wrong because knowledge takes decades to gain.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.080]  It isn't just having a decent brain or doing research. You've got to learn who
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.520]  to trust. You've got to learn who's accurate. You've got to learn who has a
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.320]  unique perspective on things that's revealing. And I didn't know today when
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.360]  I said what's new, what's important, what's big. We don't do pre-interviews. You
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.920]  bring up WikiLeaks. I mean, I've tried to support them when they've been under
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.600]  attack. I've seen them blocked in different nations. I don't think the
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.440]  people that I know from there that I've talked to over the years are bad, but I
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.360]  do agree that they can be fed things that the establishment wants to be out.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.080]  That can happen to any journalist or group. And I think the Army manuals
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.280]  they've put out about false flag terror, the CIA manuals about how they're going
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.200]  to lie to the public and that came out just last week and how they count on
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.720]  our apathy. I mean, I read that CIA document, which they admit is real. The
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.080]  CIA is angry. And I, that was over a year old. We saw those talking points used
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.840]  in our media. So when you say that, that you've seen some places where you
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.320]  think it's being used to go after globalist enemies, I tend to think
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.600]  that's going to be done with any journalistic endeavor. But well, I mean,
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.040]  go further specifically. Do you think it's totally run by Anglo-American
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.360]  interest? Or are you saying it's being used? Or I mean, because I see it do so
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.960]  much good. I think it's, I think it's used. I mean, it's also important to point
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.200]  out that some of the expo days that they've had, that information was
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:47.200]  already basically available in open source. So, but the thing with Iceland
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.920]  and their attempt to move into this information mecca has a lot to do with
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.600]  George Soros shorting the Icelandic Krono, which led, of course, to the
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.840]  banking collapse in that country. So you're saying they want to base to
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.880]  selectively get around privacy laws and leak info. Right. And also use it to
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  blackmail people and extort money and hurt competitors. And basically,
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.120]  Well, we know the New York Post page six. We know the New York Post page six has
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.640]  been caught doing that. Is there any evidence WikiLeaks is doing that?
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:26.880]  Well, certainly, what we're seeing is this sort of a confluence between
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.120]  WikiLeaks and the person who I think represents the major gatekeeper of the
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.200]  left is George Soros. I think his counterpart on the right is Rupert
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.120]  Murdoch. I think these guys, when they get together, must slap each other on the
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.360]  knee and just laugh about how they've got, you know, the population of the
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:48.200]  world corralled into these two camps and they're controlling all these
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.040]  media outlets. And, but that's certainly George Soros throws a lot of his
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.720]  billions around the control and message. There's links between his open society
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.480]  Institute and WikiLeaks. And, you know, this is where under the guise of do
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.080]  good or type operations were the freedom of information, freedom of the press.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.040]  But when you look, when you peel back that onion, you find something that
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.480]  stinks pretty much like an onion. Well, I respect your opinion and we'll
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.600]  certainly see more of that come out. In fact, you mentioned that the head of
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.920]  Cryptom.org that I respect, that he left WikiLeaks a few years ago and says it is
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.080]  an operation. Yeah, John Young, who actually has published first-time
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.080]  information on Cryptom.org, he, I know John and he says, you know, if he gets it,
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.440]  it gets published and he's been harassed. An awful lot, I mean, they, they
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.040]  canceled his internet service, his server, with his server and, and John Young
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:49.280]  left in 2007, the board of WikiLeaks and charged it with a CIA front.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.160]  Well, let's hope that's not the case and they're just being used at certain
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.120]  levels. But, but what do you do as a journalist? Because I think about that
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.400]  when state police send me the MyAC report and then someone's saying they
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.080]  were a federal marshal sent me the Homeland Security report. I mean, morally,
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.480]  I had a responsibility to put that out. I called the FBI, I called MyAC, I confirmed
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.240]  it was real. They got mad when they found out I had it. You know, because you can,
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.080]  you can catch these guys off guard and they'll, you know, tell the truth.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.840]  When you read the code number out, I mean, then, then you start getting paranoid
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.880]  thinking, was I fed that? Why would they want that out? Why would, you know, it,
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.960]  it just gets, I guess that's what Cloak and Dagger is, is it just turns into a labyrinth.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.200]  Right. And I, I basically do a triage. There's information I get, which I look at the
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.760]  stores to what it is. I, I said, well, this is good. This is a keeper. Then there's
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.840]  stuff that frankly, that the first, that first client is totally out there where
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.400]  the buses don't run. I immediately just count that. That's, that's, that, you know,
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.440]  that's basically a debt issue. And then there's, you know, in between, you're not really sure,
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.760]  you'll take a look at it. And that's kind of goes into the sort of, let's, let's,
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:04.800]  let's see where this one goes. Sort of the pending file. So it's a triage situation.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.480]  I've, you know, I've been, I've been snuckered in the past on some things, but
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.640]  I think it's, it's, it's, it's not based on your sources and if you trust them and,
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.000]  and you know who they're, you know, basically tied up with, so you can spot a red herring
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.800]  the minute you, you see one. Absolutely. Almost all the info I've been given turned out to be
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.640]  accurate. Uh, the clergy response teams, uh, government documents on the Pentagon,
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.040]  surveilling yours truly, I want to get into Russia with you and the situation over there,
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.640]  Wayne, we really appreciate your time, but separately you may not be aware of it,
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:44.080]  but Fox news and two articles in the last two days is basically implying I'm a terrorist and
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.080]  their terrorist section, the Southern poverty law center is saying I'm calling for violence,
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:54.480]  basically when I'm not, uh, they're really coming after me right now. Why do you think
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.960]  London guardian time magazine, you name it right now are specifically singling Alex Jones out
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.400]  and lying and, and, and saying that, that, that I'm promoting violence. What do you think that's
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:15.200]  about? Well, I think it's part of this whole thing we were talking about wiki lakes. We're, we're in a new phase of warfare. It's called information warfare, information
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:22.560]  operations, uh, using information against people. Uh, and, uh, in the case of Fox news, I mean, I,
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:28.000]  I used to go on Fox quite a bit and then I caught them, uh, and not only me, but some other people
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.880]  that appeared on Fox where they took the image, the still image, which they used on their website,
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.840]  they distorted the image. They, they made some people have yellow teeth when they didn't. They
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:44.320]  took my face and expanded it out to, uh, where it was totally distorted. And of course they ran,
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.280]  and they run, they run those photos and then people, you know, uh, you know, use it as a, uh,
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.920]  sort of like a, to make fun of you. And this is what Fox has been caught doing before.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.360]  Fox isn't a news organization. They're a propaganda outfit. And we put Murdoch knows full,
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.240]  well, what he's running over there. And so does Roger Ailes. It's, uh, it's, it's, I don't even
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.440]  say Fox is an annex to the Republican party because, uh, the moment the Republicans serve
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.960]  their interests, they're going to toss them aside. Fox serves, I think as the major, uh,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.800]  controller and corralor of people on the right, as I mentioned earlier, George Soros represents on
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.200]  the left. And of course there's lives in between. You know, you've got the New York Times and you've
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.480]  got the, uh, uh, you know, of course Murdoch has his, has his, uh, the newspapers in London,
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.560]  the Times of London and then he has the Wall Street Journal, but that's what I'm asking you.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.120]  Why do you think they're now branding Alex Jones as someone calling for violence?
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.520]  Are they angry that I'm telling all my listeners not to be violent? Because it looks like right
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.000]  now they're trying to create the perception that there's about to be this grassroots violence
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.880]  so they can clamp down on parts of the Tea Party they don't control.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.320]  They're trying to eliminate the competition, I think. Uh, the fact is there's, there's now
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:01.920]  news sources available over the web and through, through YouTube and whatnot that, uh, is, is
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:07.600]  hurting their bottom line and that they like nothing more than to eliminate that type of
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.520]  competition and, and they'll use any sort of, uh, on train to do that. You know, say somebody's
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.120]  a terrorist, uh, that then people might be, you know, be worried about.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.760]  Yeah, I forgot to add that they called Homeland Security on me. That's in the article.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:28.160]  Well, again, I think, I think there's, uh, a lot of, um, a lot of symbiosis between, uh,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:33.840]  Fox News and agencies of the government. Look how they've, uh, been leaked, uh, propaganda.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.880]  They've hyped things up that it was, you know, Fox, uh, that helped us get into the disaster
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.440]  in Iraq and now they're hyping up Afghanistan.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.120]  And now they're pushing White Al-Qaeda. Now they're pushing White Al-Qaeda.

[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.920]  that I'm going to shift gears into a host of other important news. Like federal judge finds
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.000]  NSA wiretaps were illegal. In fact, we'll ask Wayne about that coming up in the next segment
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.720]  briefly. But right now, Russia, Wayne, we know the Tsar stage terror attacks. We know the NKVD,
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:29.520]  the KGB has done it. A lot of evidence points towards Russian intelligence in the late 90s.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:37.360]  But you're saying that this points towards Georgia targeting the FSB in the bombings we've seen.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:43.680]  Break it down. Well, we've got this guy who's the head of what they call the Caucasus Mujahideen.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.440]  His name is Dukor Umarov. He's claimed responsibility. He also claimed responsibility for the bombing
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.600]  of the express train last November from Moscow to St. Petersburg, which killed, amongst others,
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.360]  some high-level officials of the Russian government. I would note that what was interesting is that
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.240]  the Nikolai Petrushev, who is the former head of the FSB, and now on the Russian National
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:13.840]  Security Council, along with President Medvedev, Prime Minister Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov,
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.400]  he pointed to the Georgian security services in an interview with the Russian newspaper Comrissant
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.840]  and stated that their information, their intelligence shows that Georgian special
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:33.280]  security officers that are dealing with members of the Northern Caucasus Mujahideen,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:42.560]  and it was also interesting that on March 21st, the government of Mikhail Stakashvili
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.720]  in Georgia, now he was put in by George Soros with his money. It was a themed revolution
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:56.720]  called the Rose Revolution. He hosted a conference that was organized by the Jamestown Foundation
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.760]  of Washington. That's a neocon operation here, founded in part by William Casey, back
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.920]  as the CIA director in the 80s, and something called the International School of Caucasus
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:12.160]  Studies at Ilya State University in Georgia. Again, they get their money from people like
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:19.520]  Soros. What this conference was titled was Hidden Nations Enduring Crimes, the Circassians,
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:25.280]  and the peoples of the North Caucasus between past and future. Georgia also has a Russian
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.560]  language TV program that beams propaganda to stir up people and the rest of Russian
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.960]  Northern Caucasus. What Petr Shev said, the former head of the FSB, looks like he's right
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:43.360]  on the money here. Who basically is controlling Georgia? Well, that would be a replay of the
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:50.400]  1980s when they founded Al-Qaeda and Mujahideen to menace the Russian underbelly a little bit
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.720]  further east, and we know that they launched a few weeks ago that hoax broadcast saying Russia
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.120]  had invaded again when Russia never invaded. That's how dumb they think we are in the West.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.760]  So what is the point of carrying this shout? I mean, how does that hurt Putin?
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.800]  It hurts Putin because he knows he still has a, you know, it hurts him with the people of Russia
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.360]  because if you can't guarantee someone security when they're going to work on the metro,
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.680]  then you're going to start to lose support. Now, that's exactly what Putin's enemies,
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:27.120]  these exiled Russian tycoons, want to do. He nabbed one of them. He nabbed Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:33.440]  who's a guest of the Russian government in Siberia, but escaping from Russia were people
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:41.360]  like Boris Berejovsky, the former media magnet, and he's traveled between Britain and Israel
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.720]  and Israeli and British passports. He's got Stave Haven, he and others, and these people
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.400]  work through people like Sakashvili and Georgia to undermine Putin. Now, they used to also use
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:58.080]  Yushenko, the president of Ukraine, but he's out of power now, and now there's a much friendlier
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.680]  president in Ukraine. So Putin is at least eliminated. Kiev is a base, but he still has,
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.360]  he still has Tbilisi and Georgia as a base that's used for all this type of propaganda.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:16.480]  Maybe what Petrochev said, terrorist activities directed against the heart of Russia and Moscow
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.240]  and some of the other rest of republics like the 12 policemen who were killed in a suicide
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:27.920]  bombing in Dagestan, which is part of this whole Northern Caucasus. But explain this to me.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.000]  How does it help the British to stage seven, seven bombing subways to have police state
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.760]  crackdown? Blair's numbers actually went up. It was meant to boost flagging support for the Iraq
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:44.000]  war in 2005. We know our government has been caught red handed. It's now been declassified and
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.240]  released in federal affidavits that the leader of the Mumbai attacks, as you said almost two years
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:55.200]  ago, was a U.S. agent. You talked about U.S. agents with the GPS. That now came out this week.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:04.560]  So explain how it doesn't help Putin. Well, what it does to Putin, it undermines his
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.680]  credibility. And if, you know, there's, this is what the neocon operation is.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.000]  They want, they're trying to drive a wedge between Prime Minister Putin and President
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.280]  Dmitry Medvedev. If they do that, they would like to see Medvedev continue as the President of
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.320]  Russia without Putin. And they think they can drive this wedge and they can get, they can get
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:32.000]  things done with Medvedev that they can't do with Putin. And that's, and by hurting Putin as the
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.320]  Prime Minister, they can. We're to come back. Did these bombings coincide with Russia announcing
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:46.080]  new cooperative alliances with China? And why is China's rhetoric rising now? What is the U.S.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:55.840]  doing to anger them? We'll be right back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:04.240]  and the GCN Radio Network. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.280]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:15.040]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:20.560]  is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?

[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.200]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.840]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:39.680]  you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:45.280]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:53.280]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web

[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:13.120]  Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents. The new
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.640]  world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:24.160]  under their control. The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.520]  control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:35.040]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.840]  now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:45.280]  with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else

[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:32.640]  All we're after here is the truth. Nothing more. And the private central banks to control our
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:38.160]  planet have fingers in every nation. Russia, China, Israel, England, Germany, the United States.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:45.680]  What is the state of the world right now? More and more talk, a replay of 2003 saying now Iran
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:53.200]  does have nukes. We've got to go in. Is there really a split between Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu?
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:58.960]  Where is all this going? Well, I do think there's a split between Obama and Netanyahu,
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.360]  but we do know now that there's information coming out of the administration. Questioning
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:09.360]  that the little piece of some people into the Obama administration, particularly Dennis Ross,
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.080]  who holds the sort of the Middle East portfolio for the National Security Council.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:20.000]  But I think he's emblematic of another problem, these people in the Obama administration like
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.840]  Ramamonuel and certainly Dennis Ross and others. What country are they actually loyal to? Who do
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:34.080]  they support? Do they support President Obama or do they support Netanyahu or one of his coalition
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:40.240]  partners like Labor, for example, which is very pro-war, by the way? There's nothing much left
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:48.800]  about the left in labor. But certainly what we're seeing now is now an attempt to put more
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:56.640]  sanctions on Iran through the United Nations. Now there's a report that China is coming around,
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:03.680]  but I would note that there's now a report that the US may declare China a currency manipulator
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.960]  and the next Treasury report due on April 15th. And if that's the case, we could be looking at
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:15.520]  a trade war with China, which holds a lot of our debt. And how's that going to help the situation?
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.400]  We've also had the thing with Google and China, but I think this is all part of a
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:29.520]  bigger picture about an impending national industrial policy that the Obama administration
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.560]  is creating and may be pushing very soon.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.480]  Flesh that out. What do you mean by that? Well, I think what we saw with the Toyota
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:48.960]  and Honda in Japan was part of this, to make GM or government motors, which the government basically
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:54.640]  owns, much more lucrative at the expense of the Japanese. Now then we had the thing with China,
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:02.000]  with Google. We have this idea that the Treasury Department may declare China a currency manipulator.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.200]  Now isn't that rich? One of the biggest influence peddlers in this Obama administration is George
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:12.640]  Soros, who has manipulated more currencies and crashed more economies from Iceland to Malaysia
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:18.160]  to Thailand. He tried to short the pound back in the early 90s. He's doing it right now. And
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:24.160]  he'll short the US dollar if he has to. And I also have a sneaking suspicion he could make a lot
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:31.760]  of money with this currency war between the US and China. This guy belongs in a
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:38.400]  prison somewhere. I don't know what country he owes allegiance to, but there's a lot of prisons
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.480]  in the world. And I think we could find room for Mr. Soros in one of them. Shifting gears,
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:50.640]  Wayne Madsen, is this good news? New York Times federal judge finds NSA wiretaps were illegal.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.240]  It is good. Judge Vaughan Walker, of course, basically he declared the terrorist surveillance
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:03.200]  program and what was known in NSA as the stellar wind. This is what I was told by people inside
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.400]  Justice and the NSA. They knew it was illegal. They knew that the NSA was breaking the law by
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.520]  conducting this. Now we have the federal judge ruling it, in fact, was illegal. The interesting
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:20.240]  thing is now, well, Eric Holder and Obama seek to appeal that decision of Judge Walker.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:28.000]  I have every belief that they will appeal that because the wiretapping continues to this day
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.640]  under the Obama administration as much as it did under Bush and Cheney.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.240]  Wayne, I know you've got to go catch a plane here. We've only got a few minutes left with you.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.920]  On another subject, we do see some of the so-called left finally waking up and speaking out against
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.880]  Obama. But is that because they want to try to keep some credibility with the grassroots? Obama
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:53.280]  hiring more lobbyists than anybody, expanding wars, continuing tortures, secret arrest, Patriot Act,
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.880]  signing statements. The list goes on and on with what he's done. The left finding out
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:04.800]  that Dennis Kucinich, before he flip-flopped, was telling the truth. This is a K Street lobbying
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.640]  takeover by the bank-owned insurance companies, cutting Medicare Medicaid while raising taxes,
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.040]  lowering the standard of care. They had to meet the press special where they admitted, yes,
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.320]  there are death panels. This will lower cost. I mean, just bizarre. And we have Naomi Wolfe,
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.960]  the Rhodes Scholar, coming out and saying, oh, Obama's bad. We're marching into fascism.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.080]  What do you see happening there? Well, I think people on the left are figuring out that they
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:37.680]  were sold a bill of goods with Mr. Hope and Mr. Change. We got no hope and nothing changed.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:45.200]  And basically, that's what people are waking up to. The better people look at the Obama administration
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.880]  as nothing more than the third term of George W. Bush. Look at the policies. There's not much
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.080]  change there. It's just a different connotch, a different atmosphere, a different smile,
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:02.080]  better diction, better speeches. But when you look at the policies, especially for the environmentalists
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:08.160]  right now, there grew up in arms over the drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which Obama's authorized.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:13.280]  So he's losing the support of people like the Sierra Club and others. I don't know where he's
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:19.920]  going to get his support when he decides to run for reelection. I'd be very surprised that people
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:26.720]  would trust him after exceeding him from what he ran on, the rhetoric that he ran on as candidate
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.880]  Obama and where he sits today and where he's... Well, in my opinion, I think that's one of the
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.040]  flip-flops he did that was actually good because the Russians and Chinese announced they're going
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:40.400]  to start drilling in those areas. And so now the oil companies are saying, well, we've got our
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.200]  oligopoly here, but if they're going to get it, we might as well get it. I mean,
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.640]  isn't that really what that's about?
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.960]  Right. But when you look at his base of people who supported him, these people aren't going
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:54.000]  to be around for him and come the next election because they felt they feel like they've been
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.080]  they've been snuckered by the guy. And I think that's going... And then I think the impact,
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:05.600]  political impact of that is he's going to have at least one, maybe two challengers from the
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.080]  left in the Democratic primary and 12.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.120]  All right. Last question, Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.040]  Who do you see? Because you're there in Washington every day. You're there at the press club every
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:23.520]  week. What's the word on who the Republicans are planning to run? The word I'm getting from
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:29.520]  inside Republican sources is it's a general Petraeus slash Mitt Romney ticket. It can be
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:35.440]  interchangeable versus a Palin, Rick Perry ticket. Those are some of the main Republican
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.960]  contenders. Give us what you're hearing there on the Hill about that. And who are some of the
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:43.600]  Democratic challengers to Obama?
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.760]  Well, certainly Mitt Romney was at the press club a few weeks ago. He's, according to everyone I
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:55.920]  talk to, Democrats and Republicans, he looks like he's got it. He's the favorite person for 12.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:03.440]  Now, the others, Palin and all, I think they're interesting. They get the clips on TV,
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:09.600]  but I think it's Romney. It's Romney's to lose unless we find out. He's been visiting some sort
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:17.360]  of a bondage lesbian club in West Hollywood. I think it's his to lose. On the Democratic side,
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.800]  I see some potential trouble for, hold on. I thought that was one of Steel's aides. You're
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.280]  saying Mitt Romney's going to that? No, no, I would say that would, there's something like that
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.760]  would sink him if we were to find out. Right now, I think Romney's the clear winner in this.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.840]  The only thing that could sink Mitt Romney would be, he was at one of those clubs, but I
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.560]  certainly know he's, he seems to be pretty squeaky. Why is that getting news that some
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.840]  Republican staffers going there? I mean, I mean, does that anger the Republican pedophile leadership
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.720]  that, that they found a Republican who likes women? Well, I think what it, what it does is
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.680]  it's angering their, the fundamentalist Christians who come money. And so I see that Tony Perkins
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:05.360]  now has washed his hands with a GOP over that. So I see them, I see the party itself kind of
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:11.280]  self-destructing, but I think Romney's got it. And on the left, I would look at the guy who's on
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.480]  the outside of the Obama administration. He was very critical over the healthcare thing.
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:20.640]  I think we may not have heard the last from Howard Dean. I think he could be
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:26.880]  potentially a challenger to Obama from the left. Okay. Well, Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.440]  spending time with us. You bet. Wayne Madsen. Again, if you just joined us,
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.680]  I've got a lot of news I want to go over here today. Like federal judge finds NSA wiretaps
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:46.160]  illegal FCC advisor advocates state run propaganda megaphone to counter alternative media. That's
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:52.560]  a quote. You heard me state run media here in the U S New York times columnist death panels
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.640]  will save a lot of money. Paul Krugman tells round table economists agree it's going to be major.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.800]  Oh yeah, the government decides what healthcare you're going to be getting. And I meant to get to
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:12.080]  this on Tuesday. So I'm going to I'm going to cover this coming up in the next hour after we
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:19.120]  take some more calls the K Street hustling of Obamacare. Great breakdown from revolt of the
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.240]  plebs. And I got some other articles here that dovetail with it. One from the Tea Party 365
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.360]  inside Washington lobbyist healthcare heavyweights visit White House early and often. You know,
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.160]  who's really behind this healthcare bill because we know who's behind it. We know it's a banker,
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:40.160]  robbery through the insurance companies and brings in eugenics care. We know that. But the
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.760]  control right wing is just saying, Oh, it's socialism. Let's not give poor people free
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:50.400]  health care. This raises taxes too much. And that is true to a certain extent.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.560]  But morally, it lets the Democrats pose as if they're good guys. You bet we gave poor people
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.600]  some care. No, it doesn't cover preexisting conditions. And we're going to have socialism
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.760]  at least deliver it. But see, it never gets delivered because powerful interests create
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:10.480]  socialism to steal the middle class wealth. So that is coming up and we're going to go to James,
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:17.520]  Philip, Alan, Paul, Mona and others. But I mentioned this in the first hour. I want to get to it now.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.440]  Oh, wait, race worker held in damage to Colorado Democratic HQ. You know, we've mentioned this
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:29.360]  in the last week, staging attacks before we've got other articles about the Democrats painting
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.440]  swastikas on their buildings. They've been caught doing this over and over again. It's a form of
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.880]  false flag staged event. And Curt Nemo has written an article about this. I think it's a great
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:47.360]  article. I would change the headline to Democrats caught in false flag race attack. But he wrote
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:55.680]  the headline video proves Tea Party activists did not spit on them. Well, it's more than that.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.080]  They lied and said that they came out with police who were going to arrest the guy, but they decided
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.720]  not to. That's all on video. That's made up. No one was yelling the n word. No one was saying
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.280]  we're going to kill you. No one was spitting on them. It's all on video for multiple angles.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:15.680]  And the Black Congressional Congress caucus decided to not use the tunnel from their office
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.680]  building over to the Capitol. They decided to walk through the group to then put out this
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:25.680]  false report. And they're still all over the news announcing this lie. And this is a great little
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.320]  piece that's posted in our article. It's also at the Ripple Effect Studios Capitol Hill Conspiracy
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:37.120]  Filmmaker Dissex Congressman spitting incident. And so both these articles are linked and posted
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.800]  up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com. But this is another false flag, false report.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:50.800]  Here it is.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:41.840]  Okay. Now that's a one minute raw video of the people screaming
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.760]  kill the bill, not kill members of the Black Congressional Caucus. They're yelling. They're
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.680]  not spitting and the Black Congressman comes over and says he's spitting in his face.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.120]  They're not yelling the n word. Now I just showed you a raw clip. We're going to
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:06.320]  play part of this clip and then come back from break and play the rest of it. Here is the
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:18.800]  piece Capitol Hill Conspiracy. Here it is. On Saturday, March 20, citizens gathered outside
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:26.480]  the United States Capitol to protest the impending health care bill. Until January 2009, protesters
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:32.960]  had been reminded time and again that dissent was patriotic. In the age of Obama, however,
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.000]  protest was no longer patriotic. It was now, well, racist.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.040]  To prove it, a group of Black Democrats chose to avoid the tunnel and walk right through the
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:56.640]  protesters to the Capitol. The equal opportunity in their protest, the citizens booed the Black
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:03.120]  Congressman as lustily as they had booed the White ones. But that was it. As the Congressman made
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:09.040]  their way to the Capitol, nothing happened. There was no violence, no threats of violence,
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.800]  not even any profanity. If there were any racial slurs, no one seems to have heard them.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.120]  I didn't hear the slurs, said House whip James Clyburn who walked with the group. How could
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:27.520]  he? Not one of the many videos shot that day recorded any. They did record, however,
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.720]  hundreds of people expressing their dissent against a bill that the majority of Americans
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:40.240]  deeply opposed. Many, like the man in black shirt and white cap on the left, shouted, kill the bill.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:50.880]  A distracted Congressman Emanuel Cleaver passed right in front of the man and apparently put some
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:49:00.960]  flying spray. Unhappy, Cleaver jabbed his finger in the man's face. That night all hell broke loose
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.840]  and the streets erupted in riot and flame. Oh, excuse us. This is recent footage from Berkeley
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:10.480]  where left-wing students and union members tried to burn down the house of the school's chancellor.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:20.400]  Didn't see that on CNN? Much less newsworthy was the protest in front of the Capitol,
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.920]  except that Congressman Cleaver was still mad about the flying spittle.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:32.080]  So we brought a policeman out to find the alleged spitter.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:38.960]  Cleaver's office immediately sent out a release saying that the man had been arrested,
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.200]  but that the saintly Cleaver declined to press charges. But it was not true.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.440]  Said the Capitol Police, there were no elements of a crime and the individual was not able to
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:55.680]  be positively identified. The video supports the police. All right, we're going to back up this
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.440]  great investigative piece and I want to, in the next few days, try to get this documentary news
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:11.440]  producer on. This is real journalism because it's on record that they had arrested someone spitting
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:19.200]  and yelling the n-word to a black Congressman and that is still reported by MSNBC and CNN every day.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:26.400]  They are invoking racism. They are invoking racial division. They are lying and saying there's no
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.480]  black people, even though you watch that footage of black people all over the place that don't want
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.680]  the IRS taking more of their paycheck and who don't want death panels. They've seen how big
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.760]  government helps them. 52% of blacks in this country are never born. They're murdered.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.760]  And the establishment wants to keep blacks under their control in their Democratic Party,
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:55.440]  Senator Byrd Ku Klux Klan plantation so they can kill them and use their death panels against them.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:01.120]  That's the truth. They're a bunch of eugenicists like Margaret Sanger. We'll be right back.

[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:10.000]  By the way, when I say the Democratic Party wants to kill black people, the leadership of it,
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:15.040]  you go back to the 20s, 30s, and 40s with Margaret Sanger and the Rockefellers.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:21.360]  We have their publications. They set all this up. They kill over half the black people that would
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.480]  have been born in America. And it's time for black people to realize the Republicans aren't
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:32.080]  going to save you and either of the Democrats. But these racist controllers aren't going to come at
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.240]  you as a Ku Klux Klan group. They're going to fund the white supremacists, the Klan groups,
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.760]  and then they're going to act like they're opposing them and they're fighting them.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:44.800]  They want you on the plantation, the reservation. They want white people, Hispanics, Asians.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.120]  It doesn't matter. They want to run our lives. And a lot of black folks are figuring this out.
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.280]  So the media runs this giant hoax saying, well, if the whole Tea Party isn't racist, their heart is.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.320]  And they run these hoaxes saying on the house floor and outside this happened.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:05.600]  And those black congressmen chose to go out in amongst those groups, to go and put press releases
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:11.920]  out and to lie and say that man was arrested and to lie and say they were screaming the inward,
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:18.640]  to lie, to make white people and black people beat each other's throats. That is so low down.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:26.320]  That is low down. And the constituents need to understand that, that they use race politics
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.680]  to control you while the black leaders build more abortuaries in your neighborhood. Let's
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:39.040]  complete the clip. So we brought a policeman out to find the alleged spitter. Cleaver's office
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.520]  immediately sent out a release saying that the man had been arrested, but that the saintly
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.960]  cleaver had declined to press charges. But it was not true. Said the Capitol Police,
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.920]  there were no elements of a crime and the individual was not able to be positively
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:02.320]  identified. The video supports the police. No matter. On the word of Cleaver alone,
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:09.280]  the McClatchy papers ran with this absurdly false and inflammatory headline that very afternoon.
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:19.520]  The McClatchy owned Kansas City Star. Cleaver's hometown paper would soon add quote,
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.200]  some Tea Party supporters spat on Cleaver Saturday on Capitol Hill because the U.S.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:34.800]  Congressman is black. The adjutant prop was working two nights later after a mindless media
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:41.280]  firestorm. MSNBC's inimitable Keith Oberman summed up the Democrats takeaway message.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.440]  Quote, if racism is not the whole of the Tea Party, it is in its heart.
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:55.440]  As Nicolai Lennon once coldly noted, a lie told often enough becomes the truth.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:03.920]  But that was before the Internet. Despite the offer of a $10,000 reward, no one has been able
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:12.560]  to produce evidence of a single racial slur. Please spread the word and put this lie to bed.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:24.720]  Absolutely well said, well done. For over a week, there's been a $10,000 reward
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.920]  from the tens of thousands of people out there, the hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands of
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.680]  cameras. Most people have cameras now. Their iPhones are cameras. Their cell phones are cameras.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:41.920]  No inward. Though we've caught people at San Antonio Tea Parties who we know are Democratic
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:46.880]  Party operatives with racist signs before, but then they've been caught so they're beginning to back off.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:56.640]  But it is more than outrageous to engage in this type of behavior. And the McClatchy headline,
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:02.480]  he didn't read it on air, he just showed it, said, Congressman called in word by Tea Partiers.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:12.160]  No retraction. No nothing. Running the inflammatory word. Spelling it out for everybody
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:19.440]  to incite racial tension so they can maintain control of the black voting block. And they've
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:25.040]  got the Hispanic voting block. They're trying to get into race politics. Oh, this group doesn't
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.920]  want your taxes raised because they don't like you. This group doesn't want illegals to get free
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.480]  healthcare. Not because they don't want the country to go bankrupt, but because they don't like you.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:39.280]  Not because they don't want to pay more taxes. They don't like you. These are limousine liberal
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:46.000]  race pimps. America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:53.440]  We are the GCN radio network. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:58.160]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:03.200]  in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.960]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:11.760]  happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:17.840]  non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:22.400]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:28.160]  genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:34.480]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:46.320]  877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:57.920]  barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN

[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:21.520]  so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.920]  We are back live, halfway point in the broadcast. We've been simulcasting at
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:47.440]  PrisonPlanet.tv since the beginning of the last hour. I want to go to your phone calls now until
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:53.520]  the bottom of the hour, and then I'm going to go over host of just incredibly important news
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:03.040]  on a plethora of key issues as we analyze the state of the world, as we attempt to get the
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.800]  population informed about what's going on on our planet. Right now, let's go to Philip in Kansas.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:16.560]  You're on the air. Yeah, how are you doing, Alex? I'm doing pretty good, Philip. Yeah, I haven't
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:21.120]  talked to you since I was a guest on your show last year of promoting begging for billionaires.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:27.840]  Ah, yes. Yeah, I'd like to come back on as a guest because I got a lot of news. But the thing
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:36.160]  about Cleaver, I have a lot of dope on Cleaver because of many years ago when they were doing
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:44.720]  the Intermodal Hub at Richard Gabbard Air Base, Cleaver had bought land right outside the airbase
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.960]  called 40 acres in a mule. It was Cleaver and Archie Welch, and they were, the track basically
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:57.120]  comes around, so they would take all the property to expand the track for the Intermodal Hub.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.400]  Well, we went to the feds with them. Of course, the feds didn't do anything.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:07.520]  And right now, you're an activist filmmaker. We've interviewed before in studio. You're
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.240]  talking about the congressman lying and saying people were screaming N-word and he was spit on.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:18.720]  Yeah, and you know, this is when he was mayor, you know, there was rumored there was a videotape,
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:22.960]  which had never been found. Hold on. I don't want to put rumors out.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:31.120]  But I mean, this is, Cleaver has been known as, you know, being corrupt and lying because when
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:37.520]  he was mayor, he lied. I've got videotape of him lying when he was mayor. Well, we have no doubt,
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.440]  we have no doubt that he lied and said he was called the N-word and spit on,
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.800]  and so he needs to be held accountable for that. I mean, he is race-baiting
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:52.400]  because the government is scared to death of black people and white people coming together
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:55.520]  against tyranny. The other question I have is, you know,
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:02.320]  Fox News and everybody coming against you. I'm not a lawyer or anything. Why don't you go after
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:08.560]  him for slander? I mean, you know, they called the cops on you illegally. Don't you have grounds
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:14.720]  for slander? And also, the state of Kansas, something you may want to look into. Kansas
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:21.600]  has a criminal slander statute, which my ex political partner was nabbed by the mayor of
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:27.200]  Wyandotte County. And what that is, is they prosecute you. You go to prison and you pay a huge
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:33.760]  fine. That's what we want to see. Philip, I appreciate your call. Look, I'm one of the few
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:39.840]  people who's actually had to sue folks before when they've slandered me or defamed me in a
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:46.480]  premeditated fashion. There has to be malice of forethought knowing you're lying, trying to hurt
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.080]  somebody. And there's certainly hundreds of people and groups I could sue. But if I spent all my
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.760]  time, money and energy suing people, I wouldn't be able to make films. I wouldn't be able to reach
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.720]  out to people. I wouldn't be able to run the websites. I wouldn't be able to do what we're
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:10.560]  doing, building the new studio. And most people on the internet and on radio know that everything
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:16.960]  that's said about me is a lie. I mean, it's just they're always making up new and more ridiculous
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:24.080]  things. And so many lies have been told, just none of it has any effect anymore.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:31.840]  But I have to publicly counter Fox because they say they called and we showed the article
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:38.560]  yesterday, several articles written about it at info wars.com and prison planet.com. And I put
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.120]  a YouTube video out about it last night and they said they called Homeland Security on us
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:48.480]  for comments and they implied that we were behind it on info wars.com and prison planet.com.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:54.400]  And then we pointed out that they're the ones really calling for violence on Fox television.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:59.920]  And in their comments, so they're hypocrites and they're trawling our site, trying to get us in
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:06.000]  trouble. What does that say? One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.880]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world. The push for every nation on the globe
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:16.480]  to identify and number all of its citizens. Friends, I hope that you will order shadow

[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:05.840]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:10.800]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:16.560]  I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:21.840]  How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:26.480]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:31.120]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:35.760]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:41.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:46.560]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live

[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.200]  Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.600]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:15.520]  gold? It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country,

[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:12.240]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go over this key article,
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.400]  the K Street Hustlin of Obamacare, how the insurance companies really wrote this scam.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:23.680]  You get that information out. We'll be able to repeal this. It's the truth. But you let the
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:29.520]  left and the Republicans lie about what this really is. It's going to stay in place. That is
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:39.600]  coming up. All right. I want to run through your calls quickly now. 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:46.160]  is the toll-free number to join us on air. Let's go ahead and talk to Alan in Texas.
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:53.680]  Alex, I found out about you about two weeks ago, and I kind of feel like you're a Morpheus,
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:58.960]  and I'm Neo, and you gave me the little red pill, and pretty heavy stuff here.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.040]  The question is, as a newbie in this, it's kind of heavy. Trying to figure out what
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:14.720]  is there any website or any direction for financially and things of that nature. I know
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:21.520]  I want to get my money out of my 401k, but I know you were talking about IRAs and pension funds,
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.640]  and then trying to take that over. How about gold IRAs and such? I mean, do those appear safe,
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:34.480]  or are we better just taking it out? Well, let's be clear. I don't give financial advice. I tell
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.920]  people what I'm thinking, and I have different financial experts from different perspectives on,
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.760]  so people can make up their own mind. Bloomberg, WorldNet Daily, they're all reporting on what
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:51.200]  the White House is saying, and they're now pressuring public and private pension funds.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:54.000]  And the federal regulators get what they want, and people are scared of them
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:01.280]  to invest in, quote, failed banks. And I know there are gold IRAs, and many of those that
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:10.000]  perform better than other type of IRAs and 401ks and things that are made up of different
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  investments in mutual funds or stocks and bonds or a mix of those. And I think diversification is
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:22.800]  always the answer. I mean, that's a tried and true tactic, and I think people should be in a lot
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:30.960]  of different things if you have enough money to be in a wide spectrum investment portfolio.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:37.120]  But I would rather physically hold gold and silver than have a gold IRA. I know Ted Anderson promotes
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:43.760]  some good gold IRAs, and if you think the system's safe and that they're not going to take it,
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:47.040]  the point is you'd want to invest in some of those because they have been performing,
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:53.600]  in many cases, much better than other IRAs. But again, that's up to you to make that decision,
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:59.600]  Alan. I actually don't understand, but you know, it's just finding directions to go,
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:05.200]  and I understand you're not a financial planner. But anyway, I appreciate it. It's pretty heavy
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:11.520]  stuff, and I appreciate your help and keep up the good work. Alan, good to have you on board.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:17.920]  And I should have asked Alan how he found the show. Please pay it forward. If you are listening
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:22.720]  on local AM and FM, tell your friends and family, neighbors, people at grocery stores, hey, tune in
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.000]  Alex Jones is on, or he's on in an hour, or he's on tomorrow, key information, send friends and
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.880]  family, the free link on info wars.com to download the iPhone app that has five stars.
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:40.720]  There's very few iPhone apps that have five stars upwards of a thousand ratings now, five stars.
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.200]  You may not have an iPhone, but your friends, your family, your neighbors do. Anybody can listen
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:51.280]  off the audio link streams in different formats at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com. But the
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:56.560]  iPhone app lets you take it on the road. We have the flycast free app that we have links to that
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:03.600]  as well for any type of cell phone out there. It's all there. And so it's good to hear that you've
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:09.360]  gone down the rabbit hole and are really starting to see the matrix. Let's go ahead and go to Paul
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:16.480]  in New York. Paul, you're on the air. Hi Alex, how are you? Good, go ahead. Good talking with you.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:21.520]  Well, I've been a fan for quite a while and thanks for everything that you're doing.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:28.080]  I wanted to know, I've been, you know, I have an aunt that I debate with things with a lot. She's a
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:36.720]  big Obama fan and things like that. And I just bring up 911. I mean, she acts like everything's
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:43.280]  Obama. Everybody's against Obama. And I'm more, I said, well, what about 911 before Obama? That
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:50.000]  happened. And, you know, I didn't know they had a 911 debunked on YouTube. And I'm wondering,
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  do you know about that? And are you guys doing anything to debunk that? Because I never saw
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:03.200]  that before. Is that something new? Okay. I take it you're a new listener, Paul. I mean,
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.560]  are you asking me if I've ever questioned the official story of 911? Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:13.520]  not questioning that. I know that you have. I'm an old listener. I've been listening for about
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.320]  a year now. But I'm wondering if you're aware of that debunked website because
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:24.960]  she sent me that. I was never aware of that. Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, I appreciate your call.
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:32.400]  There are hundreds of government funded, so-called independent groups. And this came out in in
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:42.880]  Cass Sunstein's Chicago Law School reports. He's now the White House regulations are. And he said,
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:50.480]  we must get groups that look independent to go out and attack 911 truth. I mean, NIST has given
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:56.560]  six different reasons that building 7 fell and has had to go back over each one. The way popular
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:03.040]  mechanics debunked 911 truth was by saying that only one aircraft had been intercepted by NORAD
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:11.280]  in the year before when it was 160 plus. They just lie. They say that the Tower 1 and 2 were hollow
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:17.840]  inside and had no supports. I mean, it's just ridiculous levels of disinformation.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:24.000]  I would just move on from your aunt.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:30.800]  People who want to be willfully ignorant, people who want to be raped by the government,
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.920]  people who say his name isn't Barry Sataro, they're not going to be woken up. And the media always
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.240]  makes it about how he's being attacked by Republicans. He's being attacked. He's bad. He's
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:45.520]  bad. He's bad. The leadership of both parties are all in it together. It's all staged. They just
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:51.120]  share power and occasionally fight with each other over the levers of power. And so I would
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:56.480]  reach out to people that are waking up and people that do care. I would move on from your aunt and
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.520]  don't waste your time. Let her be ignorant. Let her love Obama. If you want to wake her up to
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:07.040]  Obama, I would give her the Obama deception on DVD. You don't have to even buy the high quality
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:13.680]  DVD at info wars.com. You can just go to Google or any search engine and type in the Obama deception.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:22.400]  There's thousands of copies of it online for free. The top link. In fact, let's do this live on
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:28.240]  air. Go to Google live on screen and type in the Obama deception. And the top link is a link to
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:32.080]  a director's channel on YouTube where the whole two hour film
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:38.400]  is there for free and decent quality. It's an a lot better quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:42.560]  And you can be a member and support us and watch the live TV show and get better quality podcasts
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:49.200]  and all of that, but I don't care. I mean, it just took them five seconds and he lied about
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:53.920]  signing statements. He lied about lobbyist. He lied about everything and he's lying about what
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:00.960]  the healthcare bill really does. It doesn't cover preexisting conditions. It cuts Medicare and
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:07.680]  Medicaid. It's a robbery. Even from her liberal perspective, she needs to understand that's a lie.
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:18.080]  But you can't wake the dead. And you know what? But at least she's engaging you and trying to
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:23.760]  counter what you're saying. So don't let it get you down if you can't wake some people up. Okay.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:30.880]  All right. Mona in Texas. You're on the air. Good afternoon, Alex. How are you? I'm okay.
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:38.000]  I have a quick comment and a question. My family personally has suffered at the infiltration of
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.920]  CPS family courts and other paid henchmen in our lives. My 30 year old daughter committed suicide
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:50.480]  on 11 10 2005 after a five year war with a very corrupt CPS and family court system.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:56.320]  Now, as of late, the former janitor Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce were
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:02.160]  found dead last Friday, as you know already. As we all know, Nancy Schaefer was a true crusader
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:09.120]  against the wrath that CPS and the family court system causes innocent families. I've watched
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:15.520]  many of your videos. Was Nancy scheduled to be a future guest again on your show? And did Nancy
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:21.520]  also try to reach you with great urgency to no avail? I just would like to know what is your
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:31.360]  take on all this and why you didn't return her calls. Thank you. Well, I mean, I guess I'm bad.
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.920]  I mean, at the end of the day, everything's my fault. I'm evil. That's why. No, I mean, let's be
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:46.000]  serious. We get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of phone calls, thousands of emails a day. And
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:51.440]  I've been trying to get red Beckman on for the last week and he doesn't have an answering machine,
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:56.080]  so it just rings and rings. He may be out of town. So if something ever happened to red Beckman,
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.280]  it's not that I'm bad and did something to him. It's that we were unable to get him on the show.
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:08.400]  Oh, I'm saying hypothetically. Yes, Rob do came in and said, you know, in the last few months,
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:12.720]  she called a few times and said she had some, you know, new developments, interesting information.
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.120]  And I think I probably wandering around with two phones on my head and, you know,
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:20.560]  trying to get the air conditioning fixed or whatever's going on around here. I'm like,
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.800]  yeah, yeah, let's get her back on and it falls through the cracks. See, I'm not omnipresent.
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:35.360]  I'm not God. But we've had her on the show several times and but I guess I'm bad. I mean,
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:44.560]  I apologize. It's my fault. Maybe I killed her. Okay, we're going to go ahead and let that lady
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:55.440]  go. Thank you. I appreciate your call. But coming up in the next hour, we have William Fane
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:01.680]  who'd been working on a film and who had interviewed her and he talked to her 48 hours
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:10.560]  before she was killed. And so we'll be talking about that some coming up in the next hour.
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:18.880]  Her husband and her were killed. But to be serious here, it's not like you were reading an email,
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:25.280]  ma'am. And look, if there's a cloudy day, the internet blames me for it. That's going tell pro
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:33.520]  and jealousy. If somebody slips on a banana peel, I caused it. I mean, if somebody in New Zealand
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.240]  slips on a banana peel and they fall down, they go, Alex Jones, I'm going to write a blog about
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:46.640]  this. And so it's just a completely mentally ill distraction as usual from reality that's going
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:50.720]  on here. But I'll come back and continue with your phone calls and I'll get into healthcare and a
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:56.080]  bunch of other really important news straight ahead on the other side of this break info wars.com
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:20:05.440]  and present money.TV or the websites. Oh, my sinuses, they feel like they'll explode. Sinus

[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:18.000]  trillion and our unfunded liabilities tolling over $107 trillion, the value of the US dollar

[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:41.600]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the

[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.720]  Let's continue with your phone calls. Dave in New York. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:18.640]  Hi, Alex. Welcome. You said at one time that the students from the University of Arizona
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:26.160]  got 30,000 DVDs out of yours. Yes. I would consider them the Freedom College of the year 2009,
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:33.280]  and I wonder who's going to be the Freedom College of the year 2010. I think 30,000 could be done,
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:38.160]  outdone, and I think that we're coming up on Easter break by next Christmas break. You could
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:44.960]  be announcing who got the most DVDs out, and it could even go further. I kind of think the
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:50.480]  computer deep got an edge over the jocks, but hey, if they promote your stuff and get it out,
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:54.560]  and who has more to lose, they do at the moment. I've led a good three quarters of a life. You
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.600]  have a good half-life. They're just starting, and you have to have something to live for.
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.240]  All right, Dave, I appreciate your call. Interesting. Travis in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:12.560]  I just wanted to mention real quick, I noticed on the iPhone app post a lot of people were
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:19.440]  mentioning that they wanted something for the Motorola Droid. If they download Droid Live,
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.240]  it's a free app. They can listen to your show live or the rebroadcast.
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:33.680]  Tell us the name of that app again. It's Droid, D-O-R-D-R-O-I-D, Live,
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:40.480]  L-I-V-E, and then Light is the free version. And then what do they do? Just go click on links on
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:45.200]  my website that have the regular stream, or how does that work? No, they just go into the app,
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:49.600]  and then they can click on the search button and type in Alex Jones. The first link is your
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:56.320]  live feed or rebroadcast. Well, that's good news, Travis. I know that there's basically free apps
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:01.600]  for every phone out there to be able to stream our show. It's just that people then have to search it
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:07.280]  to find it. That's why making our own apps that specifically go to our page and give people links
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:12.880]  to the podcast and the live streams and the retransmitted streams makes it easy. But yes,
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:18.000]  there's flycast, there's a whole bunch of other systems out there where basically anybody with a
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.760]  cell phone can listen to the show. Thanks for the info. Anything else? That's it. Thank you. Thank you
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:29.200]  so much, Travis. People should send us links to all the apps that have worked well for them,
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:34.800]  and we'll start putting them in the listen live page. Let's talk to Brandon in Indiana. You're
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:39.440]  on the air, Brandon. Alex, good to hear from you. I just wanted to make this real short,
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:45.120]  but I just wanted to say that you've really lit a fire in me, and the spirit of 1776
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:51.200]  resonates in me, and I actually work for a video store that's closing. I won't say who it is, but
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.200]  if you watch it, you probably got a good idea, but I've been showing your films in here on a
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:02.320]  daily basis, and you wouldn't believe how many people stop and watch the films and how it really
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.240]  resonates in them, too. They're just scared to come out and say it. Well, Brandon, that's why
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:10.240]  we talk about the films being one of the key weapons and why the establishment always
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.880]  criticizes, and this is Alex with his videos. Hundreds of millions of people have watched him
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:21.760]  free online, no telling how many copies, how many showings, how many copies of my 25 films
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:26.480]  have gotten out there all because of people like you, and you could show somebody one film,
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:30.480]  and it will give them the big picture, a film like Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:38.080]  Endgame. Coming out this month, it's already April, the two new films, Police State for the
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:43.440]  Rise of FEMA and Invisible Empire. I mean, this is effective because you've only got to show
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:48.080]  somebody the truth if they're open to it once, because they already know what's going on at a
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:52.160]  subconscious level. They've got big pieces of the puzzle, and then it brings it all into focus,
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:56.800]  so I want to commend what you're doing. So I guess you work at Blockbuster, and it's going under.
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:02.640]  You got it, brother. And you know, I played Obama Deception, you know, Fall of the Public. You
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:07.280]  know, I own pretty much every film that you have, and you know, I'm always letting them out to people
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.440]  and making copies, and actually me and my boss, you know, woke him up to the fact, you know,
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:16.000]  he was a Glenn Beck fan, and you know, I had to strain away from that, and W.O. Shield, but
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:19.840]  you know, we're coming together, and you know, we're going to start a podcast, and you know,
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.840]  we're really going to hit this hard, because you know, it's not, it's going to take more people like
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:29.280]  us, more people like you, and you know, congressmen like Ron Paul to step up, and not be afraid of
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:34.320]  really what, you know, the truth is, and stand for firm belief, and you know. Absolutely. We've
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.360]  got the truth. They've got the lies. If all of us should start getting involved and waking others
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:44.240]  up in a peaceful fashion, and exposing the corruption in our government, it is going to come
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:50.480]  down. God bless you. Anything else? Say it, man. God bless you. Thank you. I like that can do, take
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:56.960]  action spirit. Let's jam in one more call. Cameron in Tennessee, go ahead. Hey, man, what's going on?
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:01.520]  Worldwide transmission. Good to have you here. Hey, good to be talking to you finally,
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:05.200]  you know. I've been with Steve Schill here for a little while, and I started out by
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:09.600]  answering the 9-11 stuff, and ended up running into everything else you talked about. The reason I
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:13.760]  was calling you was, we had really been bothered by too much of what's going on, because I wouldn't
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.720]  consider us to be in a very hot spot for any kind of federal activity, but here lately we've had some
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:25.600]  weird stuff going on. They put on a TV broadcast. We need to start registering our phone numbers in
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:32.160]  a county-wide and statewide registration, and they put in there for emergency purposes. I
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:36.480]  didn't think that's gonna buy it. I thought it was kind of knowing. Kind of a dumb idea. I didn't
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:41.200]  really want to know what my number was. Well, this is all part of the standard federalization
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:46.480]  of everything, and sure, it all has the dual use of emergency services, but in the government
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:52.720]  documents, it also has the dual use of tracking, tracing, and controlling it. We're on the march,
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:58.080]  the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:06.480]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:38.000]  depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:44.160]  dictatorship. Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every

[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:12.480]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:19.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:27.600]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:37.120]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:44.480]  Others don't. We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with
[02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:50.400]  unparalleled quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:57.840]  so you could ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:08.560]  Others don't.
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:24.000]  Okay, I want to go through a big news blitz and then back to your phone calls.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:34.240]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231. I love hearing the callers but I may institute call
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:43.520]  screening not for your content but for your phone quality with these headsets and these cell phones
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:46.800]  and these speaker phones. I mean, I'm sitting here listening to you with an earpiece
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:53.200]  because headphones were making me start to have hearing loss and I literally a third of the time
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:57.600]  can't understand what the callers are even saying or I'm making out bits and pieces
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:02.720]  and so I'm going to institute this right now from now until eternity
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:09.280]  that either has to be a landline or a clear cell phone where we can hear you. It doesn't have to
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:16.000]  be great quality but if we can't understand you you can still be on the show. You just got to get
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:22.400]  to a landline. You got to get to a phone where we can understand you because I mean it's unbelievable
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:33.040]  1-800-259-9231. We always go to the extreme though. It's like the message board for two years
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:38.560]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Hundreds of thousands of people have posted comments,
[02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:43.760]  probably even more. It's ridiculous. What is it? Tens of thousands a month or more
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:50.000]  and Cointel Pro went in and posted threats and we got Secret Service, FBI visits, Fox News
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:57.520]  reporting us to Homeland Security, AP articles, Wired Magazine stories implying we're doing it
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:03.600]  and that it's my fault. Now I see death threats and stuff all over YouTube, all over Fox Nation.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:10.560]  That's okay. They don't get government visits. They don't get demonized. We do. I can no longer do it
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:18.160]  and the problem is with this system where you've got to log in, it's actually weighing down the
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.880]  server. So I'm getting the point where we have to get rid of comments altogether and that's just
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:27.760]  because they're trying to set us up and destroy us with this. It's very easy. They're a Cointel
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:32.320]  Pro again, lying on infowars, lying on prisonplanet. They lie about everything saying you've got to
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:38.720]  give your real name. No, you don't. You got to create a username and your email that then,
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:44.640]  just like any other message board or comments on any other newspaper, it then sends you an email
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:51.600]  and in that way, when somebody's posting death threats or whatever, we can delete them and
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.600]  it's a little bit easier to keep the death threats and all the rest of it off of infowars.com
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:04.080]  and prisonplanet.com. Everybody else makes you register and there's a reason because it gets
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:11.360]  out of control. So that's going on from here on into eternity at infowars at Prison Planet.
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:16.640]  It's made the quality of the comments rise. The trolling has gone way down and it's made it more
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:22.480]  manageable for us to be able to provide people a platform to have discussions and debates and to
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:31.360]  discuss the articles. It was another point I wanted to make about that too. Then it just slipped my
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:39.600]  mind. Oh, I mean, we'd also had tens of thousands, no exaggeration of emails and comments saying,
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:47.440]  I can't let my children on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com because there's cussing everywhere.
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:55.040]  And so we put software in or a plugin in where if somebody tries to say FU, it cuts off the CK
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:01.520]  or if somebody tries to say, you know, the S word, you see S dash dash T
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:12.400]  and look, it's over. Any cussing, you're deleted. You come back and cuss with a new email, you're
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:20.800]  deleted. This is not a place like a bar room to sit around or a US Navy ship where you're
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:27.520]  in the canteen talking like sailors because we try to just say have a free for all and people
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:33.840]  just go crazy. Okay. It's my website. You can do what you want with your website. You can do and
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.320]  the spam is over too. People just don't make comments. They just plug their websites over and
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:44.640]  over. That's over. We're going to delete you for that. That's the same thing with the calls
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:48.640]  from now on, John. And also when we take phone calls on our system,
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.720]  if somebody's phone line doesn't sound clear, if you're having trouble, I mean, here's the
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:59.280]  benchmark. If you're having trouble hearing what a caller says, they don't go on there.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:11.760]  Dr. Pritchard. What do you think about that? Say that again. I said they're over here with a
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:28.160]  famous, and I guess this all falls on me. I don't know why I didn't institute this earlier with
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:36.400]  the phone calls, but I know why I've been on talk radio 14 years ago, 14 years ago, 90% of the calls
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:43.680]  you got were landlines and they were clear. And now it's just Skype and internet and cell phone,
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:57.680]  and I mean, it sounds like you're talking to someone and I just can't understand it. All right,
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:02.240]  enough on that. I've got all this news to cover. I'll admit this though. I need a vacation, man.
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:08.400]  I have been so tired lately. I've got a fighting spirit to fight tyranny,
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:16.480]  but I just constantly think about this stuff. I constantly research, and then I get up here on
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:22.400]  air with all these piles of clear evil, clear tyranny, and I'm glad we're waking people up.
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:26.320]  I'm glad we're having a big effect, but it should be a lot bigger. We shouldn't have to
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:35.280]  argue with people that tyranny is upon us. Of course tyranny is upon us. Of course society
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:39.680]  is out of control. Of course we have a big problem. All right, I just spent about six minutes babbling.
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.960]  I've got a bunch of news I want to get to here. Where's my news out of the CBC
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:57.680]  that I've barely mentioned at the end of the show about pills with antennas on them so the
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:07.200]  government can make sure you're taking your medication. I'll find it. Here it is. Pill with
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:13.760]  antenna ensures patients take meds. This makes me tired. I mean, I don't even want to get into
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:17.520]  all the ramifications of this, and then there's going to be all these idiots out there that say
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:23.280]  that's good. And then I know about how they're setting it up where main line apartments now
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:27.440]  are saying the refrigerators watch what you eat and what you do and track you for the government.
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:32.960]  I mean, it's like a bad dream and I just want to wake up from it.
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:41.280]  It is a bad dream.
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:50.160]  By the way, guys, there's a new video we just put out this morning
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:56.400]  where I exposed Fox News trying to frame me. I want to play that at the start of the next hour.
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:00.960]  We have it now. We do have it now.
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:07.360]  Yeah, cue it up. Cue it up. I want to play that right now.
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:13.440]  I want to play that right now. Then I'll go into all this news because
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:22.080]  I think a lot of what's tiring me out is the realization that we've been right about all of
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:29.440]  this and that it's so real and that I am I am right. I mean, every day I wish I'm wrong. Every
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:39.280]  day I wish this wasn't true. Every day I wish we could change things every single day. Do we have it?
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:45.760]  Well, I think I say it all here and this is important. This is news. And the reason I'm
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.440]  talking about it is we're being targeted. And just like they're going after the internet and
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:53.920]  wanting to shut down free speech, we are under attack. We are being targeted. And the weird thing
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:58.240]  is I'm not even really freaked out by it. It makes me tired. It makes me resigned. It just
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:02.640]  makes me feel sorry for my fellow man and how much scum there is out there. Let's go ahead and roll
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.600]  this. Things are starting to really get crazy. I mean, even I can't believe what's happening.
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:12.480]  We've had the London Guardian Time Magazine, Newsweek, The New York Times,
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:18.880]  hundreds of other establishment publications, TV networks, CNN, all calling me saying,
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:23.600]  are you causing the violence in America? No, I'm not causing the violence in America.
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:29.200]  What's causing the people of this country to get upset and angry is articles like this out of
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:35.520]  Businessweek. Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash. And it says federal
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:42.560]  regulators are basically pressuring private and public pension funds, the pension funds of police,
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:48.480]  the pension funds of unions, firefighters, teachers, to invest to prop up failed banks.
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:54.720]  That's the type of news that I cover on my syndicated radio show and at infowars.com and
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:43:00.320]  prisonplanet.com. Or when it comes out in mainstream news that the Mumbai attacks were
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:07.360]  run by a U.S. government agent and it's in a federal affidavit, I cover it. Or when the controlled
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:13.520]  media on the left and the right are not talking about how insurance companies actually wrote
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:18.720]  the healthcare bill and that it cuts Medicare and Medicaid and makes people buy insurance from
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:24.160]  the insurance companies and that it's true fascism, the left won't talk about that and
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:28.960]  the right won't talk about that. I will. I will point out that it's a bailout to the insurance
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:34.480]  companies, a robbery. And that's why the radio show and the websites are so popular because it's
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:39.040]  just common sense. We don't work for the left. We don't work for the right. We work for the
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:45.920]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights and Freedom. Now that said, I want to tell Fox News something.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:52.640]  I don't want to be your enemy. I know you've got a lot of federal operatives working for you.
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:57.680]  I know Glenn Beck is there to co-opt the Tea Parties with Sarah Palin and basically control
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:06.880]  populism and redirect it into the Republican Party. But I can't put up with this anymore, Fox
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:15.680]  News. Two stories yesterday from Fox News in the terrorism section. This is where the news about
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:23.440]  terrorism is, implying that my website is supporting and promoting threats against the IRS, threats
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:28.880]  against the government, you name it. And they craftily talk about articles on my website and
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:35.040]  then mention that people in the articles, but not in the articles, is actually in the comments,
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:40.000]  are talking about violence against the IRS, violence against the government, violence against Obama.
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:47.600]  And what's important here, the key here is in one of the Fox News articles in the terrorism
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:55.760]  section, Fox News says they were on infowars.com and that they saw threats to the government so
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:02.400]  that they called Homeland Security. In fact, that's in this article, Military Husband Probe
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:09.840]  for Allegedly Posting Threats on Radical Website. And then it says the action was taken after Fox
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:16.320]  News.com inquired about the online comment. There's another article here, Feds Investigate
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:22.160]  Death Threats to IRS Employees After Health Bill Approved. These were both on March 30th.
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:29.600]  Two separate articles. I spent five minutes this morning when I saw these stories going to
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:35.360]  Fox Nation and their other websites that have comments. And there was talk about killing people,
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:41.200]  about the Marines attacking the government, about killing Obama. Another Fox pundit was making jokes
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:47.920]  about killing Obama on Fox TV. We have that video posted in this article by Paul Joseph Watson
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:56.320]  at PrismPlanet.com. Fox News calls for Obama to be killed while framing Alex Jones for instigating
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:00.720]  violence. We have always spoken out against violence. And we have the Southern Property
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:07.520]  Law Center. We have the ADL. We have all these other organizations saying that I'm calling
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:14.320]  for killing police and that I'm causing police to be killed. We've seen this talking point
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:20.720]  the last year with no evidence. We've always called for nonviolence like Mahatma Gandhi and
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:27.280]  Martin Luther King talked about. So they're clearly trying to propagandize and manipulate police
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:32.960]  and the IRS and others to audit us, to arrest us. We've had the Secret Service here repeatedly.
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.880]  In the last few months, we've had the FBI here. We're getting subpoenas over this.
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.240]  All because Fox News and others, and we've now discovered Fox has been doing this for several
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:47.760]  months, are culling through hundreds of thousands of comments. We get several million visitors per
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:55.760]  website a week and calling the police on us. And then we go to Fox Nation and there is stuff
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:47:00.240]  many times more violent and actual threats against the president and that's all being
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:08.800]  ignored. So this is so hypocritical. Fox News sees InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com and what I do
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:13.600]  on the radio is a threat because they're posing as the opposition of the New World Order. They're
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:18.240]  posing as the alternative media. They have more viewers than all the major cable news channels
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:27.360]  combined. And I'm this separate radio talk show host and filmmaker who maybe has one-tenth maybe
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.600]  other viewers and listenership, but I am the greatest threat to what they're doing. And so
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:37.280]  they're coming after me. Fox News, I know a bunch of you work in there as psychopaths and sociopaths,
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:44.320]  but I'm a human being. I have a family. I'm not calling the FBI and Homeland Security on you.
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:49.760]  I'm not even asking my viewers right now and my listeners to go file criminal complaints
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:56.800]  and reports against you for what's on your websites. You're not guilty for commenters on Fox Nation
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:01.840]  calling for the death of the president or the death of illegal aliens. You are somewhat guilty
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:08.960]  for your pundits joking about killing Obama and tying it into a sum of bin Laden. I mean that is
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:16.560]  over the top. And so you are there inciting all this violence and then blaming me. That is wrong.
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:23.200]  You can't do this. It's wrong. And I'm just sick of Glenn Beck attacking Ron Paul over the years.
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:27.920]  I'm sick of you demonizing true patriots, true conservatives, true libertarians. We broke the
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:33.120]  Mayak report. We broke the Homeland Security report where the federal government's main target
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:37.680]  is conservatives and libertarians in this country. And I know you're upset about that. I know that
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:44.320]  you want to pose as a twisted form of Alex Jones and Ron Paul, but it's not going to work. And
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:49.920]  I'm here to tell you that the people are seeing through what you're doing. We're calling for
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.960]  none of this. We're decrying it. We're exposing the fact that this militia was infiltrated by feds
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:49:01.680]  and that they provocateur them. We're exposing that the moon by massacre was run by a U.S.
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:07.040]  federal agent. We're exposing the fact that mainstream media pushed the hoaxes of WMDs in
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:12.800]  Iraq and now Iran. We're trying to save our country. And what are you doing? You're trying to
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:21.600]  sick the IRS and the FBI and Homeland Security on us. You are more than hypocrites and you're
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:28.400]  trying to destroy InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and the work that I do and you're putting my family
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:34.320]  in danger. And everyone needs to understand that what you're doing is terroristic and criminal
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:41.680]  and stinks to high heaven as a Carl Rovian type trick. All right, folks. And you can watch the
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:49.200]  rest of the video up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. Fox Frames, Alex Jones as instigator of
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:50:00.480]  violent web comments. That video is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. And it's very, very
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:07.440]  serious. But these people are ruthless psychopaths. Not everyone that works there, but you see the
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:13.120]  Southern Property Law Center, all of them putting out the same thing, really trying to sick the IRS
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:17.120]  and Homeland Security on me, thinking the IRS and Homeland Security are complete idiots.
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:24.080]  And we better get that, Alex Jones. He's saying, kill us. Everything in this New World Order is
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:31.520]  about manipulation of people. Everything in this New World Order is about dumbing people down and
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:39.520]  playing them off against each other while this tiny one-tenth of 1% elite manipulates society.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:45.200]  And I'm here saying, wake up to the manipulation. Wake up to the control. You don't have to believe
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:50.560]  what I believe. You'll have your own perspective. But for heaven's sakes admit, there's an agenda
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:56.000]  there and start learning how this agenda operates. We're going to come back, start getting into more
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:25.840]  of this key news on healthcare and a lot more. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:31.760]  Olsters, crossbows, compound bows, muzzle loaders, tactical gear, target throwers, cases, bags,
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:38.080]  personal care and pet products. And we told you a long list. So long it won't begin to fit in

[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:12.640]  collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through their own
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:18.560]  words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:23.760]  It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:29.680]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:34.640]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:39.120]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:43.680]  financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an
[02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:49.680]  inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible

[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:08.480]  also known as RFID chips in millions of passports, credit cards and licenses? In the current state
[02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:12.960]  of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased. With current technology,
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:17.120]  thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:21.600]  other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse. Think of this identity theft device
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:25.760]  as a garage door opener. You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:30.160]  Thieves get near you. Push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.

[02:53:56.240 --> 02:54:15.920]  There's a golden ammunition just inside the doorway. Use it only in emergency.
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:39.120]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to start the next hour and get into this healthcare
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:43.760]  situation and go over the lobbyists that were involved and who actually funded it because
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:47.840]  that will take a while. Then your calls and in the last 20 minutes or so we have a guest
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:51.680]  who's one of the last people to talk to Nancy Schaefer before her and her husband died
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:57.440]  were killed a week and a half ago. I think it looks very suspicious. We talked to this fellow
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:01.360]  a few days ago and he said, yeah, it does look suspicious. Now he's saying, well, he's talked
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:08.400]  to investigators. He doesn't know. But regardless, it's the smoking gun info he has and the last
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:15.600]  work that Nancy Schaefer was working on exposing the CPS in her state. So that is coming up very
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:20.480]  important information. And he says it's smoking gun info. And when she was calling here, if she
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:24.960]  wasn't desperate, she was just like, I've got some new big developments, some important developments.
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:29.120]  And I just wish it wouldn't have fallen through the cracks. We had her on several times.
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:32.080]  We want all this info on. This is what we expose. This is what we do.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:37.680]  Here's some of the other news. And again, I've got, give me a document cam shot guys,
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:44.240]  a wide shot. This is only all of this is four days of news. And I read and scanned over all of this.
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:50.160]  And it's virgin when I'm reading it for the first time. And it's an effect mentally. I have. It's
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:57.680]  a problem that then once I've already covered it myself, the first time I'm interested in it,
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:04.240]  the second time it just makes me sick. And then you can think a lot faster than you can talk.
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:10.400]  There's so many elements to each one of these stories. It almost does a disservice to just
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:16.560]  mention each story and to not then go into the different facets of it
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:23.520]  to give people the full background and how it ties into the larger control grid.
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:32.800]  Here's one out of the CBC television, Canadian broadcasting system pill with antenna ensures
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:38.480]  patients take meds. They're always wanting to force people to take their meds or oh,
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:42.640]  you want to have welfare. You got to go to a government psychiatrist and oh, guess what?
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:48.240]  More than half the time they say you're mentally ill will give you government money,
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:53.040]  but we want you on drugs, which is then a kickback to the drug makers. Taxpayers got to pay for it.
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:58.240]  It gets you into the system. They can now list you as mentally ill, take your rights that way.
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:03.520]  They want to get you in the mental health system and the welfare system and the criminal justice
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:08.880]  system and the debt system. They want to reduce you to the level of a popper, but see that's only
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:16.480]  one facet. Then there's the whole facet of medical tyranny forcing you to have microchips with
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.960]  antennas in your body. And I've talked to high level government operatives who are too scared to
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.120]  come on air. One of them was getting ready to and then got threatened. His phone was tapped
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:29.840]  about how Singapore, uh, well, I'm not even supposed to get into it.
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:35.920]  And then you tell people you're not going to talk about something because it's off record. And then
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:43.360]  the point is, why do you think they want you to take the H1N1 so badly? They do have nanotech
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:48.880]  microchips. They do have microscopic microchips. They are injecting the population with microchips.
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:55.360]  They are putting poison in the water. They are taking baby's blood at birth. And for a Pentagon
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:58:01.200]  eugenics database, I told you that more than 12 years ago, now it's mainstream news. I told you
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:05.520]  four years ago, they're giving you free laptops at school to watch you at home. Now it's admitted.
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:11.200]  We just, it's so incredible. Why do we have to have this happen? What's wrong with the sheep
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:16.320]  that they don't get more upset and carry their weight? All right, I'm going to finish up with
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:26.240]  this when we get back. It's just disgusting. And then all these other articles on the police
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:31.440]  stage front and the medical tyranny front and everything else that's happening. We'll be right
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:38.160]  back and we'll get to Nathan Bob, Keith, Michael, John and many others. I'm Alex Jones. This is the GCN
[02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:56.080]  radio network. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[02:58:56.080 --> 02:59:01.280]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:06.960]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:12.240]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:16.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:21.440]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:26.800]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:32.560]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:38.240]  you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.240 --> 03:00:03.520]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:17.360]  It is already the fourth and final hour of this April 1st, 2010 edition.
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:25.120]  We're going to look at oddities in the Nancy Schaefer so-called suicide case. Former state
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:29.920]  senator, head of the Eagle Forum in Georgia, exposing government child kidnapping rings run
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:35.840]  by the CPS. Valne's on certain types of children. She was brutally gunned down in the back. Her
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:40.240]  husband shot the chest. People who not normally commit suicide that way. Her family has sent
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:44.560]  on record. They don't believe they committed suicide. This is getting very, very suspicious.
[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:51.760]  That's coming up in about 30 minutes. I want to get into some other facets of the healthcare
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:01:00.960]  bill. WorldNet Daily is reporting that Krugman admitted on one of the national TV programs
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:10.480]  that the death panels will save money. And that's what this does. It allows the federal government
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:14.720]  to lower the standard of care, cut Medicare and Medicaid, and the insurance companies wrote the
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:20.960]  legislation. That is coming up in the next segment. But getting back to this article,
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:27.600]  sort of mentioning at the end of the last hour, PIL with antenna ensures patients take meds.
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:32.800]  U.S. researchers have engineered a PIL that can alert patients and medical professionals
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:38.320]  that has been inserted with the help of a digestible microchip and tiny antenna.
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:41.680]  And I've seen studies where they've got genetically engineered corn,
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:48.080]  another food to sterilize people, where they've got other food that has tiny nanotech RFID chips in
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:56.080]  it developed to be put in vaccines. But here it is in CBC. If you've ever been plagued by
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:02:02.160]  temporary amnesia, oh, and forgot whether or not you took your medication, take heart. U.S.
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:08.400]  researchers have engineered a PIL that will jog your memory. Take heart. You know, you shouldn't
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:12.320]  write it down if you took it. You shouldn't keep that by the medication. You shouldn't know you
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:17.040]  need to digest a PIL that lodges in your intestines and tracks everything you do.
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:23.680]  The PIL designed by engineers at the University of Florida is embedded with a tiny non-toxic
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:29.360]  microchip and antenna that can be digested. When it is ingested, it emits a signal that is picked
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:34.400]  up by a small electronic device carried or worn by the patient. That device in turn signals a cell
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:38.880]  phone or laptop letting patient or medical professionals know the PIL has been taken.
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:41.840]  So you're a political dissident. They've grabbed you. They've thrown you in a loony band.
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:47.680]  You're cheeking the PILs and getting rid of them. I've seen famous cases even in the New York
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:51.840]  Times. They reported where they grabbed what Dr. Sell, that dentist that was exposing government
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:56.960]  corruption with Medicare and Medicaid. They've held him for 10 years drugging him before trial in a
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:03.280]  prison. Oh, you want to try to not take the drugs? We're going to put a PIL in you, a microchip in
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:10.320]  you that tracks everything you are doing. Look at England. Same things are happening here in the
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:14.720]  U.S. They're trying to create laws to make everybody a criminal so they can get you in the system.
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:22.400]  Pet shop owner faced 1,000 pound or $1,500 fine and told to wear an electronic tag for selling
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:30.160]  a goldfish to a boy aged 14 under a law to stop abusive animals. You've got to be 16 or older
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:34.640]  to be able to buy any type of animal from a pet shop. So not just alcohol and cigarettes, but
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:41.760]  now it's everything. Police accused of trespass after burglaring 50 homes to show owners how
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:47.040]  insecure they are. They have zoning laws here in the U.S. where they come in your house without
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:52.000]  asking, especially in Illinois. I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier. When it comes to fighting
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.240]  crime, a certain understanding of the criminal mind is essential. But the police have been
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.800]  criticized for their attempts to prevent a spat of house thefts by committing the burglaries
[03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:04.720]  themselves. See, training you that they come in your house without a warrant and they have
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:09.040]  Magna Carta in England, but they're setting the precedent. Officers have been entering
[03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:13.360]  private homes through open windows or unlocked doors supposedly as a warning to residents
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:17.840]  about a lack of security. Of course, the public's disarmed, so there's no danger to the police.
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:23.360]  Once inside, officers pick up any valuables and items they see such as iPods and purses
[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:27.520]  and leave them in a swag bag for the owner to find. How many cops have been caught all over
[03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:31.840]  the world stealing and robbing? The cops are just doing this to set the precedent to come in your
[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:38.880]  house, steal whatever goodies they want. Here's another one. School apologizes that their pupils
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:49.360]  were frog march to be fingerprinted so they could eat at the cafeteria. It is all coming up after
[03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:55.680]  this quick break and New York Times columnist debt panels will save a lot of money. Paul Krigman
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:05:04.000]  tells Roundtable Economist. What's your home worth? How can you compare local real estate

[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:26.320]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:31.760]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:36.640]  to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:40.960]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the
[03:06:40.960 --> 03:06:46.160]  establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.

[03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:05.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:09.360]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[03:07:09.360 --> 03:07:13.040]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[03:07:13.040 --> 03:07:16.720]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[03:07:16.720 --> 03:07:21.120]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:27.360]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:32.080]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds
[03:07:32.080 --> 03:07:36.880]  have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[03:07:36.880 --> 03:07:43.600]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:54.720]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[03:07:54.720 --> 03:07:59.840]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:13.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:22.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:31.280]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're building our TV studio next door. We have 7,000
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:37.360]  square feet here. We got 7,000 square feet next door. They are probably 70 yards away,
[03:08:38.080 --> 03:08:44.880]  but you may hear banging during this hour. We never had that as a sound effect in the background.
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:49.920]  I don't know if you can hear it right now, but they're driving metal studs into the ground in
[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:55.520]  the studio, and I'm trying to rush them. The city held us up for six months with permits,
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:09:01.440]  and so I've told them, just continue. If it gets too bad, we'll just, I guess, take off a few days
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:08.080]  or something, because nothing can stop us putting this studio in. So an added level of radio theater.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:11.440]  Oh, I hear it starting up again.
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:21.920]  Talk about trying to not be distracted while you're doing something.
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:28.800]  Can you guys hear that on air? You can't hear it? Well, that's fine then. It's
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:34.240]  louder than, or that you lie for me, but this must be a good microphone setup we have.
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:36.640]  Okay, well, then I'll try to focus with the banging in the background.
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:43.200]  All right. Look, here's the problem with covering healthcare. It's like any other issue.
[03:09:43.200 --> 03:09:48.240]  It's so bad, I can't even find the proper words to cover how evil it is.
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:55.200]  And now that we've had a week and a half to go over the full final version, it's amazing,
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:10:01.200]  even me, and I expect a lot out of these tyrants. I mean, it takes a lot to surprise me.
[03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:06.800]  Tom Daschle three years ago wrote a book. We've read the passages saying, we need to get more
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:13.120]  like Europeans who just understand that for 60, you have a duty to die. And they have this
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:21.920]  comparative care. They have these bioethicists that sit over the hospitals under federal control
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:27.760]  and they decide if you get healthcare. And as you get older, they begin rationing the care.
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:33.040]  And that is in the bill. And AP reported, of course, that, oh, it was an oversight, but it's
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:38.400]  law now. Children and others with preexisting conditions, you don't get coverage. The insurance
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:43.200]  companies don't have to give it to you. And then you go on Medicare, Medicaid, and the taxpayer
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:48.000]  pays for it. But then you get a lower standard of care. That's how they cut Medicare, cut Medicaid,
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:52.640]  lower the standard of care, but raise taxes. It's nothing but a tax increase for government
[03:10:52.640 --> 03:10:57.760]  and a boondoggle payoff to the insurance companies. I'm going to get into that coming up next.
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:03.840]  But we've got the YouTube video itself posted up at infowars.com and prisonpun.com, but
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:08.000]  World Bank Daily has an article about it as well. That's excellent. New York Times columnist
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:13.440]  death panels will save a lot of money. That's a quote. Paul Krugman tells roundtable economists
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:18.880]  agree it's going to be major. And their argument is, hey, these panels are going to cut what tests
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:23.040]  you get, what surgeries you get, just like in Europe or just like the VA, the one case we have
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:27.200]  of government run healthcare. It's a nightmare. I was talking to a lady this morning from England
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:32.000]  and she was telling me just how the health service is absolutely horrible.
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:37.280]  But she talked to Americans who've been told the lie, those that support socialist healthcare,
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:42.960]  like, oh, it's great. Everything's free in England. Yeah, waiting a month on a gurney.
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:49.680]  That was in the news last week and dying a month, a month, not being given any healthcare, 18 months
[03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:55.280]  for cancer surgeries that are almost 100% operable. If you get it within a few months, oh no, you
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:12:03.040]  wait over a year and a half. You die. So I wanted to go ahead and play the New York Times economic
[03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:06.880]  columnist Paul Krugman says the so-called death panels established by President Obama,
[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:11.360]  trillion dollar nationalized healthcare plan will end up saving a lot of money for the government.
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:16.880]  But he's operating under the false left-right paradigm saying, well, wait a minute, Republicans,
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:22.640]  you're saying this is going to cost too much money. But if these death panels cut the amount
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:28.160]  that's spent, which they will, then that cuts spending. No, that's not how this works. The
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:32.880]  insurance companies get to lower standard of care for everybody. They get to force 30 million plus
[03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:38.160]  people to get insurance. And the government gets to raise all these new taxes on people and save
[03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:43.200]  money. So more money goes to the banks and insurance companies and interest on the debt,
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:48.880]  you get less care, you get less service. So he knows people are watching at home and he tries
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:55.120]  to manipulate them by saying, well, wait a minute, if this cuts, if this cuts cost, how is this
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:13:00.640]  driving up the deficit? But they admit it costs more money. They admit it raises all these taxes.
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:07.040]  They admit it brings in more money, but does lower cost because you're being robbed. And I'm going to
[03:13:07.040 --> 03:13:11.680]  go over the insurance companies that were behind this in a moment. But right now, let's go ahead
[03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:16.720]  and play Paul Krugman on ABC News Program this week. Here it is.
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:19.920]  Amazing, actually. You think about people on the right, they're simultaneously screaming,
[03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:23.920]  they're going to send all the old people to death panels, and it's not going to save any money.
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:26.880]  That's a contradictory point of view. The death panels would save money.
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:34.960]  The advisory panel, which has the ability to make more or less binding judgments on
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:38.800]  saying this particular expensive treatment actually doesn't do any good medically.
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:42.160]  And so we're not going to pay for it. That is actually going to save quite a lot of money.
[03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:47.120]  We don't know how much yet. The CBO gives it very little credit, but most of the healthcare
[03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:51.280]  economists I talked to think that's going to be a really major cost saving.
[03:13:53.280 --> 03:13:58.960]  There you go. A cost savings, and they admit over $40 billion a year cuts in Medicare and Medicaid,
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:04.160]  and they're not just all the new federal taxes and taxes on healthcare savings accounts and
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:12.960]  everything else, but they make the states come up with money for Medicare and Medicaid.
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:19.280]  They make them contribute to it completely unconstitutional. Now, I told you how three months
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:22.880]  ago I was in an airport. I already knew this and already read it at other places, but there was the
[03:14:22.880 --> 03:14:29.360]  head of the healthcare insurance lobby saying, hey, we wrote this bill, and if you put a public
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:32.720]  option in it, which I'm not for, by the way, because it'll always get stolen, it's wrong to
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:36.320]  take people's money for somebody else. It's wrong for the government to make you buy something,
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:41.120]  but it's even worse than stealing money to help people because they're not even doing it for that.
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:46.640]  Of course they're not. Did the Soviets steal people's money in labor? Did Hitler, the National
[03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:54.800]  Socialists do it? Did Mao say tongue? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's the point. You're always
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:59.840]  going to get cheated, but there they were saying, if you do try to actually cover people with
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:05.040]  preexisting conditions, we're pulling out. We're for this if it makes people come buy our goods,
[03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:10.560]  if it makes them buy our service and lets us lower quality. And that's why in the last week
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:15.040]  and a half, all the major insurance, health insurance company stocks are up and it's been
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:18.800]  leading the stock market up in the last week and a half. And that was all over AP, Bloomberg,
[03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:24.240]  you name it. There's your evidence for all you stupid liberals who really believe the nanny
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:30.240]  state cares about you and the government loves you. And boy, you got the rich guys. You got the
[03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:34.800]  middle class. You know, you're going to get your free giveaway now because you want to be a lazy
[03:15:34.800 --> 03:15:40.800]  parasite or because you're so taxed and so regulated, you can't make ends meet because
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:45.600]  of big government destroying our economy and ruining the best healthcare in the world.
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:51.600]  Some people aren't lazy. They are being cheated and the illegals are bankrupting and it goes on
[03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:56.400]  and on. A great article by Revolt of the Plebes, we've got it up on infowars.com, the K Street
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:16:06.320]  hustling of Obamacare. And it says ooh snap, looks like we've been right all along.
[03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:10.560]  All the K Street money pumped into the House and Senate has been overwhelmingly one-sided
[03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:15.200]  in favor of Obama's horrendous new healthcare legislation. Go figure. According to a new study
[03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:19.120]  released over the weekend by the Center for Public Policy and nonpartisan public interest
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:24.720]  think tank in D.C., it is estimated that a record 120 million was spent lobbying for the health
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:29.600]  reform. In addition to direct lobbying, some of the top firms also rewarded members of Congress
[03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:33.680]  with campaign contributions through political action committees and individual lobbying donations.
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:40.000]  The largest of these firms, Patton Boggs LLP contributed more than 55,000 almost exclusively
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:45.440]  to Democrats. Patton Boggs represents Bristol Myers Squibb, one of the largest pharmaceutical
[03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:49.520]  companies in the nation and the eighth largest corporation in the United States. On January
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:55.360]  21, 2010, Patton Boggs was one of several big name health insurance pharmacological and hospital
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:17:02.000]  lobbying organizations who all, whose top executives got together to throw a fundraiser
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:07.600]  for Massachusetts senatorial candidate Martha Coakley in hopes of landing her the Democratic
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:14.160]  seat at the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the healthcare takeover bill. The other top firms that
[03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:19.840]  participated along with a list of companies they represent are as follows and it goes on for page

[03:24:25.200 --> 03:24:30.560]  they're allowed to make money uh how dare these communists not want them to make money it's the
[03:24:30.560 --> 03:24:36.560]  american way the big insurance companies by and large lobby the government to make you pay for
[03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:41.520]  more and more overpriced health care to give other people supposedly free health care so they get
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:49.680]  your tax money they lobbied for the stinking bill and it is a hoax that all over the news they keep
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:56.160]  saying insurance companies were against this if the stinking moron collectivist grassroots
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:25:04.160]  could have been shown the facts of how the insurance companies wrote this it would have
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:08.400]  never gone through so on the left they lie to people saying oh don't worry you're getting free
[03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:13.840]  health care you're not and this doesn't kill our economy nothing will along with the carbon taxes
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:20.080]  and all the rest of it and then the right wingers get up there and act like the insurance companies
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:27.600]  are against this when they know full well they were and they're subsidiaries of the very same
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:34.480]  usual suspects private central banks that are doing all of this so i challenge everyone to get

[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:51.520]  from the hard numbers what money was donated who lobbied 94 percent of the insurance and health
[03:25:51.520 --> 03:26:00.320]  insurance and biotech and big pharma money went directly to congress to support and push this
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:07.360]  through and they campaigned and had fundraisers and did everything they could to ensure its passage
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:12.720]  and they got it passed and i talked to the average person on the street or i get emails going how

[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:23.920]  facts that you've been trained that all corporations are good all banks are good and there should be
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:29.440]  no regulation no one should investigate the banks or insurance companies and they're perfect and
[03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:35.040]  everything's wonderful but then meanwhile you don't like big government and corporate welfare
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:40.720]  when bush tripled the size of government expanded government welfare sure obama's gone even further
[03:27:40.720 --> 03:27:46.080]  but there's no lesser of two evils here the republicans are out of power the democrats have
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.720]  the votes to pass it so they made the political calculation at the leadership level some of
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:56.800]  the rank and file are good and our moral and our constitutionalist like ron paul and a few others

[03:33:20.880 --> 03:33:25.680]  well a few months ago head of the eagle forum in georgia former state senator
[03:33:25.680 --> 03:33:30.640]  nancy schaefer called my one of my producers a few times and he mentioned he said nancy
[03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:35.120]  schaefer wants to talk to you and i get piles of these and then didn't get her on
[03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:42.320]  and now she's dead but i'm just looking for the truth of what happened it sounds suspicious
[03:33:42.320 --> 03:33:46.000]  to be shot in your back and then the husband shoots himself in the chest most people commit
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  suicide by shooting themselves um in the head but regardless of that we'll talk some about that
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:57.680]  uh with william feign who uh some of nancy schaefer's friends told us about he's making a
[03:33:57.680 --> 03:34:05.440]  documentary about this he had talked to miss schaefer 48 hours before she died he had talked
[03:34:05.440 --> 03:34:11.040]  to her husband and very soon um in the next few weeks he's going to be releasing this video
[03:34:11.760 --> 03:34:17.920]  and uh i know cps hunts children i know they get bounties for say a blonde hair blue eyed child
[03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:22.480]  that they have operatives in daycares in public schools everywhere to take her children i know
[03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:26.560]  they lie on reports i know the federal government gives them bounties for the number of kids they're
[03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:33.600]  supposed to get i know a lot of them gone to prison for this but schaefer up in georgia had
[03:34:33.600 --> 03:34:39.200]  been on last year and said she was really tracking down and had the evidence of them having bounties
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:45.600]  to grab completely you know innocent family's children away from them and under the family
[03:34:45.600 --> 03:34:50.960]  court set up over a hundred years ago in england the last 90 years in the us it's a eugenics court
[03:34:50.960 --> 03:34:55.760]  a racial hygiene court they would take your kids and sterilize them if you were poor no judge no
[03:34:55.760 --> 03:34:59.920]  jury they just did it they well not a real judge on a real jury they had just a judge
[03:35:01.280 --> 03:35:07.360]  and so i want to stick to what we can prove here the investigation the last things that she was
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:13.680]  working on and so i can find out uh what all this incredible information was she wanted to
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:20.720]  discuss on the air and so joining us is william fein uh from georgia uh william specifically
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:25.520]  though because you said you wanted to clear some things up rob do talk to you monday and you said
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:31.920]  yeah i i do have some suspicions but then since then it's three days later you now we're seeing
[03:35:31.920 --> 03:35:39.520]  some of those are elade so you've got the floor on that issue first about her death dual suicide
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:46.480]  whatever it is murder uh because well go over that for folks and then let's get into what you and her
[03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:51.040]  we're working on okay first of all i'm from tennessee and you can just call me wilkie uh
[03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:55.520]  okay but okay but you're working on this in georgia i'm sorry go ahead in georgia uh basically
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:35:59.840]  when it when i first got reported to me i got it the report within minutes before the investigator
[03:35:59.840 --> 03:36:06.320]  even had gotten there because of my contacts and the first report did make me feel very suspicious
[03:36:06.320 --> 03:36:10.160]  i had a lot of the same feelings that i see post the internet that it was an assassination
[03:36:10.880 --> 03:36:16.000]  uh because first of all what i got was nancy's been shot and she's dead wilkie and i said well
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:22.320]  you're gonna find bear which is bruce close by or that or something or he's something wrong and at
[03:36:22.320 --> 03:36:27.440]  that point they had not no one had told me that bruce had been shot so yes i was very suspicious
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:34.240]  and then we were of course all night long the then they call and say bruce is also dead and the
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:39.760]  information i was given it's kind of fun making me feel uh that it was not a assassination
[03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:45.040]  and throughout the weekend the information pulled in and then by monday morning when rob called me
[03:36:45.040 --> 03:36:50.320]  i said yes i was suspicious at the beginning now i'm not and then after having a face-to-face
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:58.080]  meeting with several people uh and seeing what the information is i have 100 no doubt that it
[03:36:58.080 --> 03:37:03.120]  was murder suicide and it was not a suicide pact nancy did not know what was going to happen
[03:37:03.120 --> 03:37:08.560]  i'm convinced of that oh my god i'm convinced it was it had been planned for some time a couple
[03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:15.040]  weeks in advance and uh uh i believe anybody with uh any neutrality in this that would look at it
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:20.000]  would see come to same conclusions so i wouldn't say well how did you get into battling the cps
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:25.280]  how did you meet nancy shaver nancy had heard about me through a mutual friend i traveled
[03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:30.800]  country helping families out that had their children taken uh between making movies and
[03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:35.280]  i did it i said i'm gonna dedicate two years to it i'm gonna stop making movies well my friend
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:40.320]  called me up says this lady named nancy shaver this has been a year ago wants to meet with you so i
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:45.280]  went to meet with nancy and she gave me all this information and she said i've got the smoking gun
[03:37:45.280 --> 03:37:49.840]  and and she just gave me a ton of stuff and i said we got to be friends and when i checked it all out
[03:37:49.840 --> 03:37:54.480]  i said nancy you're telling me that pigs could fly and i'm telling you pigs don't have wings some
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:38:01.680]  this can't be true about 70% of it proved to be absolutely 100% true uh some of the rest of it
[03:38:01.680 --> 03:38:06.960]  was people who just kind of going their their way with their their message so let me just add
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:11.440]  though from your bio you're a you're a credible and well-known person we're not just talking to a
[03:38:11.440 --> 03:38:17.760]  random yahoo here and you came highly recommended from uh nancy shavers friends you've owned three
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:23.120]  race teams with nascar started a sports magazine also radio talk show host about nascar related
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:28.320]  efforts and so you're a successful guy who's really set aside a lot of his time to fight the
[03:38:28.320 --> 03:38:33.280]  abuses of cps go ahead well you know the subject first i asked when you said family court my first
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:38.560]  baby was a father's right since 17 countries it's about family court that's what happened to me in
[03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:42.960]  fact we should have you up separately just about that exactly you you have really stood up for
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:47.360]  families rights you i mean you've got a long track record this is what i fight for nationwide i've
[03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:53.040]  got cases that i helped out across the country and nancy gave me the leads she would call me up and say
[03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:56.560]  there's this family that in florida that these facts took their kids while they're here will
[03:38:56.560 --> 03:39:01.440]  get very scared to come back into georgia what can we do or uh i can now release the some of the
[03:39:01.440 --> 03:39:06.320]  information that she didn't want released up until this past week but on the 30th of this
[03:39:06.320 --> 03:39:12.080]  past month that day before the funeral i traveled down to blursville georgia and myself
[03:39:12.080 --> 03:39:16.960]  for an attorney in tennessee filed a lawsuit against the facts and a gentleman by the name of lee
[03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:21.840]  coffrin lee coffrin uh some of the people that's listening to your shows going to recognize his
[03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:28.560]  name nancy had been tracking him down for several years and could not find him he was accused of
[03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:36.320]  molesting uh 13 15-year-old girls that were in foster care he was a de facto caseworker
[03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:41.280]  suddenly he disappeared nobody could find him so when nancy said rookie can you find him
[03:39:41.280 --> 03:39:46.400]  i found him four weeks later south uh just south of dallas and catches he's now about to be served
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:50.960]  he's going to he's going to have to answer for what he did so nancy was about to announce that we had
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:55.920]  to keep it under wraps because we had hidden cameras and we had me down there and kind of in
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:01.840]  harm's way looking for this guy so we now are going to expose that system and de facto just got
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:08.240]  sued for this this little girl who's now 23 is going to make a great witness uh we actually we
[03:40:08.240 --> 03:40:13.760]  actually waited till her birthday to to file it so uh nancy wanted that was her number one case
[03:40:14.400 --> 03:40:20.720]  um but isn't that suspicious that you're finally honing in on these people and suddenly the
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:27.760]  they both get killed well it's not uh i continued from experience that the case is that
[03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:32.480]  nancy with the party would call me in and nancy would call me in and the the turmoil and the
[03:40:32.480 --> 03:40:37.120]  horror that we see every day it's just you can you go to bed not you think demons we know we
[03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:43.120]  hardly ever get any good news and nancy had really been weighing on her and uh last saturday
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:48.720]  before all this happened the saturday prior to her death we were filming in atlanta and she had
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:53.200]  since i sat inside a day i said bring all your families in and some of the families found out i
[03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:58.480]  was going to be there and they clearly protected us in montana uh to spend 30 minutes with me and
[03:40:58.480 --> 03:41:02.880]  nancy sat right there beside me we listened to every one of them filmed them and i took a break
[03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:08.480]  and i walked outside and bruce pulled me off the side like he always does and we'd recommend a bottle
[03:41:08.480 --> 03:41:11.920]  of water and he said you know how important this is to her that you that you've done this
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:17.040]  yeah i did he said and he said these words and i didn't catch on at that point he said
[03:41:17.920 --> 03:41:23.120]  no matter what wilkie you get this out there don't you that anybody or anything stopped you
[03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:28.480]  i said i'm not going to bear and he said that's what nancy wants so i went back inside not even
[03:41:28.480 --> 03:41:36.400]  thinking anything uh better often encourages to finish uh we wrapped up that day at about
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:41.600]  seven o'clock that night uh i talked with nancy and then uh and actually had dinner with him
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:47.520]  and then everybody that knew him said he was a great guy are you saying he is over you're saying
[03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:52.000]  well why would he use but i mean to be clear you're saying nancy from talking to investigators
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:55.120]  didn't know he was going to shoot her in the back i mean that doesn't sound like she had no clue
[03:41:55.120 --> 03:41:59.840]  and it's not just from talking to investigators uh but if he's a nice guy why why does he kill his
[03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:06.080]  wife well he fast forward to we's prior to this we got a big court hearing and it went bad for the
[03:42:06.080 --> 03:42:11.520]  family and so i called everybody to go to the room and this person that's investigating it was there
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:15.600]  sitting right beside nancy we had a plan on how to help this little girl out nancy asked me to
[03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:20.720]  walk her to the car so i did and bruce come down and we talked for a moment he said do you need us
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:25.280]  anymore do you need any more film or pictures i got everything i need better is it get this after i said
[03:42:25.280 --> 03:42:30.960]  okay now was not being told in the papers and i'm gonna be very careful how i say this out because
[03:42:30.960 --> 03:42:36.240]  you gotta be the family we gotta respect the family but in those letters to the children i'm sure it
[03:42:36.240 --> 03:42:41.680]  explained to them why he did this i don't agree with this motive but their finances uh without
[03:42:41.680 --> 03:42:47.840]  me getting into it was the the main reason uh there's a story about cancer bruce had cancer
[03:42:47.840 --> 03:42:53.040]  several years ago uh his health had been a little bit failing but nancy had never said again that
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:58.160]  was cancer again just that his health was failing but i in my opinion and this is my opinion from
[03:42:58.160 --> 03:43:02.400]  what i've seen is they lost money in bank stocks or whatever they had invested their money invest in
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:08.000]  and i don't think she knew to the degree of how bad it was i think it was being this one was being
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:12.800]  kept from her that's my opinion from what i've seen and he just kind of took matters his own hand
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:17.520]  because of the stuff that she goes through on a databases uh he made a decision that he should
[03:43:17.520 --> 03:43:22.080]  have discussed with her and i can promise you that nancy schaffer nancy saying he was watching
[03:43:22.080 --> 03:43:26.560]  her so tore up watching these pedophiles having their way with the kids and the government not
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:30.480]  being able to be stopped that she was so depressed and they were broke that he just said i'm gonna
[03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:34.160]  get her out of this right now well i'm not gonna use the word depressed or broke i'm just i'm gonna
[03:43:34.160 --> 03:43:38.960]  say that this this job is hard on you and it's a 24 hours day there's nights you don't sleep
[03:43:38.960 --> 03:43:43.600]  to be a nancy when you talk about it this was her life if you were real nancy this is what she
[03:43:43.600 --> 03:43:47.760]  talked about how do we have this baby how do we have well because it was her life let's leave
[03:43:47.760 --> 03:43:51.280]  that now and i still think it should be investigated but i know you're a credible guy i've seen all
[03:43:51.280 --> 03:43:56.080]  the great work you've done shifting gears in the last minutes we've got left here we got about 15
[03:43:56.080 --> 03:44:01.680]  minutes left the break coming up she had called us the last few months we're busy i'm busy i hadn't
[03:44:01.680 --> 03:44:06.240]  called her back because i'm constantly covering cps from other angles we'd had her on a few times
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:13.120]  powerful info she had said she was getting into pure evidence of bounties with cps taking certain
[03:44:13.120 --> 03:44:17.840]  kids that these groups wanted and you're saying you've got smoking gun evidence without getting
[03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:21.920]  into names because the film's going to be released soon and you say you've got high powered lawyers
[03:44:21.920 --> 03:44:27.920]  trying to stop you and everything else but what was what had you guys discovered what was all
[03:44:27.920 --> 03:44:33.360]  this smoking gun info without getting into names i'll give you just a few details the way we have
[03:44:33.360 --> 03:44:38.080]  to defeat cps is their standards and well i've got is i've got an insider number one behind a
[03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:44.240]  sheet who explains how they beat these kids and you're right i don't call it a bounty you call
[03:44:44.240 --> 03:44:47.760]  it what you want the federal government does give money to these people as they adopt them out
[03:44:48.320 --> 03:44:54.400]  uh state of georgia does get money for that we all know that uh this defects worker case worker
[03:44:54.400 --> 03:44:59.120]  explains exactly how they do it she's own camera you're going to hear it out of her own mouth and
[03:44:59.120 --> 03:45:05.040]  then we switch to a case that is going to be so horrific where defects took a child from one family
[03:45:05.040 --> 03:45:09.200]  and then gave it back to them it had to be money involved there's no other way around it somebody
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:14.560]  had to pay somebody off and when you see it no one they tend to go to watch this it's horrific
[03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:19.440]  footage tell us tell us what we're gonna see you're gonna see a two and a half year old child
[03:45:20.080 --> 03:45:25.680]  and i don't know the political correct term for the word uh uh like a mongoloid person i don't
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:31.440]  know the correct term excuse me uh the mother down syndrome down syndrome i'm sorry about
[03:45:31.440 --> 03:45:36.400]  it is i don't know the elites are obsessed with those but go ahead the down syndrome mother it
[03:45:36.400 --> 03:45:39.840]  was retired the child has been returned to the grandmother and they live in a shack that the
[03:45:39.840 --> 03:45:44.720]  clappets wouldn't live in and the grandmother's orders from the court with cps was this don't
[03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:50.080]  let your twenty six year old son who's a registered sexual predator decided georgia around this child
[03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:54.240]  he cannot spend the night there don't let your husband the grandfather around him because he's
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:58.720]  been arrested for incest don't let the down syndrome mother ran him because she doesn't even know
[03:45:58.720 --> 03:46:04.080]  what she's doing and in court she says she has sex with her father we're gonna cut from that document
[03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:07.920]  and you're gonna see this mother pulling this two and a half year old kid away from a cattle barn
[03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:12.480]  sale whatever clock at night and in front of everybody she drops her pants urinates pulls
[03:46:12.480 --> 03:46:17.920]  him up it's all over she picks the child up as she's eating him he's she's actually eating him
[03:46:17.920 --> 03:46:23.280]  fits him on the lap of the twenty six year old sexual predator he turns the child's face toward
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:28.400]  him and pull on the mouth kisses him then takes him outside the building for a good 10 or 15 minutes
[03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:32.720]  as the mother is picking bugs from her hair and eating them it's all a film
[03:46:33.600 --> 03:46:40.240]  defects knows this for a fact they've seen it and will not go back and get that kid and yet right
[03:46:40.240 --> 03:46:46.320]  down across down the road one county over they just this past few months ago sees a six month old
[03:46:46.320 --> 03:46:52.480]  white blue-eyed baby girl to also find the document by saying there's no blood relatives
[03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:56.800]  there's no grandparents you get the grandparents with the one taking care of the child in the hospital
[03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:01.360]  every day beautiful home and they always do that you can have great grant you can have grandparents
[03:47:01.360 --> 03:47:05.920]  that are doctors lawyers living in million-dollar houses and they take them and give them to
[03:47:05.920 --> 03:47:11.760]  pedophiles so the point here is hardcore child raping families are protected good families
[03:47:11.760 --> 03:47:16.160]  are broke up because the cps are a bunch of pedophiles they had to be money involved in that
[03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:19.840]  first case because we can't figure it out we've got all the documents and what you have to understand
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:25.120]  is what they do is they come in and they make a mistake they see your child fill out the paperwork
[03:47:25.120 --> 03:47:29.680]  then they go an offensive if they see your child and they fill out the paperwork the wrong way
[03:47:29.680 --> 03:47:34.320]  they didn't give you a hoop to jump through and they find one thing wrong they go see we were right
[03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:39.280]  it's like finding dope in your house and then go and get a search warrant so the system is going
[03:47:39.280 --> 03:47:44.400]  to be totally exposed we have a mother that was arrested Monday morning I got a phone call
[03:47:44.400 --> 03:47:50.160]  from an attorney with Atlanta with Georgia that asked me about this film I wouldn't answer any questions
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:55.200]  they said what do I need to tell the the well the main person I said I got three words for you
[03:47:55.200 --> 03:47:59.840]  kiss my and I told them they didn't left there 15 minutes later I got a phone call from the
[03:47:59.840 --> 03:48:04.640]  father the dance was trying to help the mother was arrested for mental cruelty of her children
[03:48:04.640 --> 03:48:09.120]  who she's not been able to see since November yeah let's be clear they're now taking people's
[03:48:09.120 --> 03:48:13.760]  children for yelling at them when they run out in the street Dr. Phil saying that's worse than
[03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:20.240]  physical abuse so they can take everybody's kids for yelling them or even spanking them and meanwhile
[03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:24.640]  the pedophiles can do whatever they want they took three children from this family downtown
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:31.280]  Portland County she said in jail since nine o'clock Monday morning it says no bond she's there until
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:36.480]  they decide to set a bond and she said and it's like this it's no they're launching a whole new
[03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:40.880]  nationwide deal where if you yell at your kids they take them and give them to the rape rooms
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:45.760]  and then meanwhile if you're a certified abuser or a pedophile they let you go and in this case
[03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:50.800]  but I have to look at water outside neighborhoods they call the police she said the white man
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:58.320]  chased me her days about six foot one black gray guy and they arrest him because it's supposedly
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:02.880]  never saying after the fact the heat mental cruelty was he kicked her out the house and you can't
[03:49:02.880 --> 03:49:08.560]  live with us no more he loves his kids she loves her kids so the grand jury would indict but yet
[03:49:08.560 --> 03:49:17.360]  she's in jail on a no bond in your years of fighting this because I've seen things and I couldn't do
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:21.760]  it I mean I'm a strong person and I would go down to families having their kids taken at birth
[03:49:22.560 --> 03:49:26.720]  and and they would even put the wrong names on the sheets to take the kids they'd use a
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:31.680]  two-year-old sheet on another family with a wrong name to go to the judge to have the kid taken
[03:49:31.680 --> 03:49:36.720]  and open the hospital door Mike Hanson was there and I started crying and these cops were choking
[03:49:36.720 --> 03:49:43.600]  the woman making her sign the paper and it just completely blew me away and they have special
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:48.160]  police units that take the kids most the cops don't know it's like special pedophile units
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:52.960]  that are involved and I and I had to stop getting involved with the cps stuff except for radio
[03:49:52.960 --> 03:49:57.840]  interviews because it's so horrible when you love children to know these people are doing this and
[03:49:57.840 --> 03:50:01.440]  they are they're doing exactly as you say addict I've got the evidence that you're gonna see that
[03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:07.040]  name and I've seen it I'd almost vomited I mean I this big fat pedophile I just can't handle it
[03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:11.600]  anymore well it's even thinking about it it's very very disgusting stuff and it's gonna blow
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:16.640]  the lid off of defects I have a tape recording of a defect supervisor explaining the cases
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:21.280]  and how to hide the file how to how the file worked if they've got a case on you and so
[03:50:21.280 --> 03:50:25.920]  spelling your last name correctly they may use a you for mail and they confuse the filing and
[03:50:25.920 --> 03:50:30.880]  they have the system so somebody are you kidding in case after case in Austin they would use another
[03:50:30.880 --> 03:50:35.520]  name yeah that's what they serve a subpoena on something they go well we can't find it
[03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:39.840]  they get some time to fix these records so if you're gonna hear this out of their mouth not mine
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:44.400]  and you're gonna hear it from a tape recording a hidden tape where supervisors telling an employee
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:48.720]  to help us fix this file we're going to do that. Well that's the key we need good cps workers and
[03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:53.760]  there's not many of them to record these demons and to expose them stay there I've got to have

[03:54:16.320 --> 03:54:24.640]  evil florida's the worst from our research but georgia may be even worse when is this video
[03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:29.120]  going to be released and where is it going to be released youtube now we're not going to go youtube

[03:54:32.560 --> 03:54:37.040]  just kind of sitting on it right now as far as the offers it's in the editing and post production
[03:54:37.040 --> 03:54:41.920]  right now i'm predicting that it'll take us three to four weeks to finish it put the music to it
[03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:47.600]  um got the documents that we need to back it up uh we've got well you better hope they didn't kill
[03:54:47.600 --> 03:54:51.920]  her because this goes right to the top they may come after you well i mean they know they know who
[03:54:51.920 --> 03:54:57.040]  i am uh the governor knows who i am they all know me and uh you know i can i will support some of
[03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:01.280]  the stuff you're saying so many people think it's georgia i'm tenuous nationwide and if they come
[03:55:01.280 --> 03:55:06.400]  after your children you need to have a quarters and cameras running because they change their stories
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:09.760]  from what happens when they come get your kids when they get in the courtroom you're going to see
[03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:14.400]  a seven-year-old listen i got the paperwork that they gave this was one family when they took their
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:21.040]  newborn baby down at the city hospital and it was a wrong name and two years old it's all fake
[03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:26.560]  paperwork and i kept wondering why is it other names and now you're explaining it that's to confuse
[03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:30.880]  everything yeah and you're gonna see a testimony from a seven-year-old little girl who testified
[03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:35.760]  in an open court and well it was closed we were there and she says it was she points right to
[03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:39.360]  the facts workers said you lied you told me if i said my baby screaming to me you'd get me a
[03:55:39.360 --> 03:55:45.200]  bicycle and let me go home and then the courtroom was just went silent you know so they could they
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:49.600]  try to shut it down immediately after that all well she's just dreaming this and no seven-year-old
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:53.600]  screaming and stuff but these people are taking our children and there are times we need good
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:58.640]  deep deep dcs workers children services they're not all demons but the power when you question
[03:55:58.640 --> 03:56:03.200]  their motives that's when they come after you if you start saying you can't do this they're going
[03:56:03.200 --> 03:56:08.320]  to prove to you they can't so we've got to put a stop this and i believe that this film and
[03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:13.840]  documentary is going to expose the horrors of this and i plan on going nationwide with it
[03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:19.760]  uh william fein dot com what's the name of the film have a name yeah i think what we're going to
[03:56:19.760 --> 03:56:25.840]  name it is me and nancy talked about it was uh uh expose it i see in the best interest
[03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:32.400]  exposing the uh horrors of defact in georgia and again defact stands for department family
[03:56:32.400 --> 03:56:37.360]  and children services we've only got three minutes left in your research of this give us some of the
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:42.080]  other horror stories well we've got one side that was raped i think one of the worst rapes
[03:56:42.080 --> 03:56:46.240]  i've ever seen two years eight months old but defact didn't see this child because they're
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:50.160]  not from the door it was of a rich doctor so they believe the lady danced towards the top
[03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:55.760]  he's not here and yet her son was raping the child in a background we have the evidence the child's
[03:56:55.760 --> 03:57:02.080]  dead we have all the paperwork one of the worst stories i've ever seen in my life we have a mother
[03:57:02.080 --> 03:57:06.400]  who they seized the child at two years old she fought for 14 years that she finally had to give
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:10.800]  up you're going to hear her testimony it's heart wrenching the stuff they did to her every time
[03:57:10.800 --> 03:57:15.200]  they tried to reunify her they would find a way to call her boss and say she's being investigated
[03:57:15.200 --> 03:57:19.600]  she lost job after job that came to her and they kicked the door in in front of her children
[03:57:20.240 --> 03:57:24.000]  and took them from her literally beat the door down and took her children from her
[03:57:25.440 --> 03:57:32.000]  he her son is 16 and that sneaks around to offices where he's where they have him at georgia
[03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:37.680]  and calls her so soon he'll hopefully he'll come home you're going to hear a story about that
[03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:41.680]  you're going to hear a story about a father who was really not in the band of child but
[03:57:41.680 --> 03:57:46.960]  signed the birth certificate the mother just caught on drugs they came and seized the child
[03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:51.840]  from a father who had a good job who offered to take care of it put it in foster care and by
[03:57:51.840 --> 03:57:58.800]  the time the child was four was raped three times by foster care parents so they're taking our
[03:57:58.800 --> 03:58:03.280]  children out of a good situation sometimes they put them with these foster care we had two returns
[03:58:03.280 --> 03:58:07.520]  of the day and seen the mother in 30 days when they left they were like in big waves of school cleaning
[03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:15.120]  healthy they returned with the likes worms and had been 18 days listen for a summer i worked for a
[03:58:15.120 --> 03:58:21.440]  carpet cleaning place and i'd go in these houses that were foster care and the kids were like animals
[03:58:21.440 --> 03:58:28.320]  yes and and and that that was my big wake-up call i was like who is this who are these people
[03:58:28.320 --> 03:58:33.200]  well william fein we appreciate you coming on we'll talk to you again soon god bless you
