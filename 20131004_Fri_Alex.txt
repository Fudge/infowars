[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:38.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.160 --> 01:05.760]  we were just here 20 something hours ago and now we are back live on air broadcasting
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.720]  worldwide and what a tragedy happened during the last hour of the broadcast yesterday and
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.800]  you would think the United States had just been hit by a nuclear bomb or something the
[01:17.800 --> 01:29.280]  hysteria the hyperventilating that is still ongoing right now on controlled corporate
[01:29.280 --> 01:37.040]  state run press you would think the end of the world happened yesterday because Miriam
[01:37.040 --> 01:46.960]  Kerry a woman they're saying was on prescription drugs got scared by a drill and a quote makeshift
[01:46.960 --> 01:55.800]  a temporary checkpoints in the area and got scared and ran off and then the media said
[01:55.800 --> 02:00.920]  that she'd been firing like a 70 Sam with two guns out the windows and have been smashing
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.720]  down barriers and it turns out it was the police driving around like total maniacs smashing
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.720]  into everything in sight and then of course they blamed her for the cops running into
[02:11.720 --> 02:17.800]  barriers when she wasn't even anywhere around and then chasing the panicked woman around
[02:17.800 --> 02:24.960]  about until killing her in front of her baby and you can make excuses and say oh she was
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.960]  dangerously driving we didn't shoot out her tires we just killed her because we love her
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.920]  we care about her we're heroes as the Senate and the House have been saying and as the
[02:33.920 --> 02:41.120]  bizarre Kathy Lainer police chief of the district of Mordor the district of criminals the district
[02:41.120 --> 02:46.960]  of con artist was saying you can make excuses about all that but you cannot make excuses
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.440]  about sweating senators and House members going incredible job defending us from the
[02:52.440 --> 02:58.680]  terrorist you are heroes we're all battling through this and going on TV and they're

[03:03.960 --> 03:08.840]  before I went on air I was watching the communist news network and they had the ATF FBI all
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.400]  up there thanking each other talking about how they face down the most devastating threat
[03:13.400 --> 03:18.080]  in world history meanwhile there are people dying by the hundreds of thousands with flesh
[03:18.080 --> 03:22.520]  eating bacteria children having convulsions and dying right now from their first vaccines
[03:22.520 --> 03:27.160]  and hospitals everywhere hospitals are killing people for their organs openly they're forcibly

[03:45.640 --> 03:52.480]  sucking out forty seven trillion dollars and the government is shut down at least for
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.040]  the public the government golf courses aren't they're now putting up expensive iron wired

[04:14.680 --> 04:22.840]  an orgy of bug-eyed control freaks running around doing stuff so absurd that I don't
[04:22.840 --> 04:29.920]  even have words at this point to describe the mega level bizarreness by the way last
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.840]  night we're up here and a Don Salazar stayed late to write an article we had tips and went

[04:41.840 --> 04:46.520]  the White House in its surrounding areas with checkpoints they call it a drill it's martial

[08:19.260 --> 08:29.060]  the central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance it's Alex Jones well economist
[08:29.060 --> 08:36.440]  and fund manager Peter Schiff has proven extremely accurate in the last few years of his predictions
[08:36.440 --> 08:40.620]  we'll be joining us coming up at the bottom of the next hour to talk about this story
[08:40.620 --> 08:48.980]  in the financial times of London global economy is in epic scale change as IMF's La Grande
[08:48.980 --> 08:56.180]  and of course they mean by an epic challenge a challenge for them to use the global crisis
[08:56.180 --> 09:02.100]  they've engineered to consolidate control over the planet and bring in total corporate
[09:02.100 --> 09:08.580]  anti-free market crony capitalist tyranny so Peter Schiff will be joining us for about
[09:08.580 --> 09:14.140]  20 minutes at the bottom of the next hour Mark Dice is going to be coming on the show
[09:14.140 --> 09:19.660]  as well to discuss his new video it's funny I was already setting him up for the show
[09:19.660 --> 09:25.820]  today when I saw the video this morning and now drudgereport.com has linked to it Democrats
[09:25.820 --> 09:32.540]  do not even know what party Obama is in and by the way we've talked to Mark this is everyone
[09:32.540 --> 09:38.380]  he talked to there's one woman who knows he's a Democrat and she's a Democrat there's one
[09:38.380 --> 09:44.060]  woman out of 10 people he goes out and shoots these in 1015 minutes it's almost as bad
[09:44.060 --> 09:48.700]  in Austin in the trendy areas and we do these videos as well but nobody does them like like
[09:48.700 --> 09:54.780]  Mark I've told my crew mimic what he's doing just just come up with your own questions
[09:54.780 --> 10:00.140]  because he really knows how to show how ignorant they are and they are Democratic supporters
[10:00.140 --> 10:04.940]  many of them say they like Obama but don't know don't know what party he's in he's just
[10:04.940 --> 10:14.780]  really cool and Paul Watson points out how are they going to know what Obamacare really
[10:14.780 --> 10:17.900]  is how are they going to know what a government shutdown is how are they going to know the
[10:17.900 --> 10:23.420]  Federal Reserve isn't federal see all this propaganda is designed for low grade morons
[10:23.420 --> 10:29.100]  we sit here and the public moves in slow motion they literally behave like people I've known
[10:29.100 --> 10:33.860]  that have lobotomies and I'm not a predator so I don't take advantage I try to wake them
[10:33.860 --> 10:40.220]  up and they look at you with this feeble giggling bug-eyed look and laugh at you they know how
[10:40.220 --> 10:45.460]  to do that in fact they laugh at Mark they're proud of their ignorance and folks they want
[10:45.460 --> 10:51.180]  our guns they want our kids we are their slaves because you could say well they can't tie
[10:51.180 --> 10:56.260]  their shoelaces oh you know what there's more of them than there are of us that's why we're
[10:56.260 --> 11:03.500]  not a democracy in a democracy a pure democracy that some of the city-states in ancient Greece
[11:03.500 --> 11:09.020]  had we're all taught that Greece was this perfect democracy and it was heavenly there
[11:09.020 --> 11:16.100]  were 10 20 25 depending on what period in greece in history over thousands of years
[11:16.100 --> 11:21.940]  different city-states different groups some did human sacrifice and worshiped basically
[11:21.940 --> 11:29.540]  the devil some worship nature some worship science some were Spartans others were known
[11:29.540 --> 11:40.980]  for being more philosophers but the original democracy they would have two wire buckets
[11:40.980 --> 11:47.340]  baskets up on a hill and that particular group I think that was an Athens I'm going
[11:47.340 --> 11:53.460]  from memory they would go up on the hill and for a period and they would put black rocks
[11:53.460 --> 12:03.900]  for a yes for a nay vote and white rocks for a yes vote black for no white for yes and
[12:03.900 --> 12:09.460]  they would get together it was the upper-class men they were the only ones allowed to vote
[12:09.460 --> 12:15.500]  they've been voted into the society so it was a democracy of the oligarchy basically
[12:15.500 --> 12:21.020]  they would decide if they didn't like you they would go have a vote to kill you and routinely
[12:21.020 --> 12:26.620]  philosophers and others that criticize them would be taken up to the hill they would vote
[12:26.620 --> 12:31.260]  and then make you drink poison or throw you off a cliff and and they had similar voting
[12:31.260 --> 12:35.860]  in other areas in and around the greecean islands and up into Macedonia where alexander
[12:35.860 --> 12:41.380]  the great came from landlocked area what is not even part of greece today but was part
[12:41.380 --> 12:46.320]  of northern Greece I mean that's just all history it's a labyrinth similar to the minotaurs
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.260]  labyrinth but much bigger to study any sector of history especially greecean history cretin
[12:53.260 --> 12:59.860]  history cretin history this we'll get the word cretin or cretin which is the derivative
[12:59.860 --> 13:07.300]  cretin I guess got turned into cretin that guy's a cretin which is an ancient multi-thousand
[13:07.300 --> 13:15.060]  year old slang by one group in Greece against the other saying you're a degenerate idiot
[13:15.060 --> 13:19.460]  but I'm I'm now digressing and I apologize for doing that here on the air today we have
[13:19.460 --> 13:24.260]  a lot of important news to cover but Mark Dice will be joining us and then Dr. Steve
[13:24.260 --> 13:31.180]  Puchinik in the last 45 minutes of the third hour will get into the navel yard shooting
[13:31.180 --> 13:35.740]  a former head of psiops especially for the federal government heading up the state department
[13:35.740 --> 13:41.860]  operations and of course first confirming that bin Laden had died 12 years ago and that
[13:41.860 --> 13:46.620]  they would roll him out in the future as a pretext is a political diversion and now
[13:46.620 --> 13:51.340]  we have Sy Hirsch saying the same thing well I didn't know he was friends with or knows
[13:51.340 --> 13:56.620]  well and we also learned the amazing thing that Tom Clancy never even tried to get Tom
[13:56.620 --> 14:02.140]  Clancy on but he didn't do a lot of interviews was a regular viewer of my films and of the
[14:02.140 --> 14:09.700]  radio show was a off and on listener that they would discuss the show for 12 years since
[14:09.700 --> 14:15.500]  he and Steve Puchinik who co-wrote books together and produced TV shows and movies together
[14:15.500 --> 14:19.780]  he was one of Tom Clancy's main sources I'm not bragging that Tom Clancy was a listener
[14:19.780 --> 14:27.740]  it's just I just marvel on a daily basis now almost multiple times weekly I get contacted
[14:27.740 --> 14:33.460]  by incredibly famous people who it turns out are listeners and who say that I've expanded
[14:33.460 --> 14:38.180]  their perspective and it's just it's very daunting to know that these incredible minds
[14:38.180 --> 14:44.280]  literary minds scientific minds are looking up to my broadcast which a lot of the time
[14:44.280 --> 14:51.300]  I hear the rebroadcast I think is unlistable but it's an incredible responsibility and
[14:51.300 --> 14:56.460]  I am honored to be here and have so many amazing amazing people listening most of whom don't
[14:56.460 --> 15:01.620]  give me authorization to say that they're even listeners by the way I've gotten so busy
[15:01.620 --> 15:07.460]  with all the serious global news I haven't even aired the interview we shot last Thursday
[15:07.460 --> 15:11.580]  with Russell Brand a video interview I haven't aired that yet and Friday's not the day to
[15:11.580 --> 15:18.260]  air something like that if we have time we'll premiere it on the radio TV show it's a good
[15:18.260 --> 15:24.140]  interview is powerful this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. sometime in there we'll play that on Sunday
[15:24.140 --> 15:28.780]  Sunday's actually a good day to launch news I found Friday is the worst everybody knows
[15:28.780 --> 15:34.020]  that if you want to bury something put their release out on a Friday afternoon if you want
[15:34.020 --> 15:39.220]  to really get something out big they say put it out on a Monday or a Wednesday in my experience
[15:39.220 --> 15:44.260]  to get a jump on the news because the news is so dead and most reporters are at home
[15:44.260 --> 15:49.300]  deep into a bottle of Jack Daniels or Jen and Tonic whatever the case is or what is
[15:49.300 --> 15:53.100]  about reporters but man everyone I've ever known is a complete drunk so I'm not a reporter
[15:53.100 --> 15:59.060]  I'm a broadcaster I'm joking the point is ladies and gentlemen is that we're going to
[15:59.060 --> 16:03.180]  air that Russell Brand interview Sunday or Monday because it is some newsworthy stuff
[16:03.180 --> 16:09.300]  he said he has a lot of gravitas in person a lot of energy I got to put him up there
[16:09.300 --> 16:18.660]  with some of the most energy I've ever felt being right up close to that guy I mean it
[16:18.660 --> 16:24.020]  was a lot of energy he just gone off stage we did the interview but very interesting
[16:24.020 --> 16:29.100]  that guy is definitely electrified whether you agree with him or not he certainly is
[16:29.100 --> 16:32.940]  on a journey himself towards what I believe is awakening and becoming completely anti
[16:32.940 --> 16:37.420]  on New World Order he's pretty much already there and so it's good to have people like
[16:37.420 --> 16:43.420]  that that are rising icons in the media landscape in the cultural landscape who are assaulting
[16:43.420 --> 16:50.780]  the narcissism of the Pavlovian mind control system that we're all under to some extent
[16:50.780 --> 16:57.580]  we're all victims of it to one level or another but particularly those that really buy in to
[16:57.580 --> 17:05.380]  the culture of television dominant establishment television the old media is dying and on its
[17:05.380 --> 17:13.020]  last legs and falling apart imploding an accelerated rate but but but mainstream culture Lady
[17:13.020 --> 17:21.180]  Gaga the sitcoms the dramas the that's the real propaganda it has waned some but it's
[17:21.180 --> 17:30.060]  still the towering center of the culture it is the son of our political solar system
[17:30.060 --> 17:39.460]  and worldwide Hollywood is the center of the cultural spiritual morass of them the the
[17:39.460 --> 17:49.100]  bygone swamp of a cultural decay the huge festering cesspit and it itself is imploding
[17:49.100 --> 17:58.580]  financially but but but still even in its flailing gesticulations it is dominant not
[17:58.580 --> 18:04.300]  hyper dominant it was hyper dominant worldwide now it's a dominant but sinking quickly and
[18:04.300 --> 18:07.980]  they know they're sinking the mayor of Los Angeles has panicked and said everyone's
[18:07.980 --> 18:14.700]  fleeing well of course everyone's fleeing it's a giant con artist operation and then
[18:14.700 --> 18:20.260]  it will fully implode in the next decade or so but by then we may be into world war three
[18:20.260 --> 18:24.460]  so it really won't really won't matter in the final equation if we don't turn things
[18:24.460 --> 18:30.300]  around and kind of stop the collective insanity that is gripping the world obviously you tuned
[18:30.300 --> 18:37.980]  in to hear what I have to say about what happened yesterday with the poor woman who the Senate
[18:37.980 --> 18:42.740]  and House have implied as a terrorist and said the police acted heroically and they
[18:42.740 --> 18:50.300]  were given a standing ovation we're going to be talking about Miriam Kerry who was executed
[18:50.300 --> 18:53.660]  and they said that she was firing guns at him and running into barricades it turned
[18:53.660 --> 18:57.260]  out she didn't have guns she wasn't firing guns it looks like it's the police that ran
[18:57.260 --> 19:02.820]  the barricades they were having a drill with army checkpoints and she got scared as best
[19:02.820 --> 19:10.700]  we can tell and then fled away and was with her small child who wouldn't be scared I'm
[19:10.700 --> 19:16.300]  I don't want to go to North Korea it's scary to come up to troops and Marines we have photos
[19:16.300 --> 19:23.900]  of them by the way and police dogs and checkpoints on main roads not even in front of the White
[19:23.900 --> 19:30.740]  House and then she ran and they got her and then they had a huge celebration it's ongoing
[19:30.740 --> 19:38.700]  with bizarre ATF agents and people in rock ready stances with a dremelin in their eyes
[19:38.700 --> 19:44.620]  patting each other on the back with the FBI acting like they just fought you know 500,000
[19:44.620 --> 19:48.740]  Chinese pouring into North Korea or something in the Korean War I mean you would think they

[24:32.220 --> 24:56.100]  I can see you know what more and more people can see for miles and miles and miles and
[24:56.100 --> 25:05.100]  miles know what's happening people are learning your tricks at least people are learning your
[25:05.100 --> 25:10.980]  tricks and getting smarter and more informed or they're succumbing to total zombie osis
[25:10.980 --> 25:16.780]  but the problem for the establishment is having a bunch of drooling fearful sheep like zombies
[25:16.780 --> 25:22.180]  to even draw from for your own ranks because you want dumb people working for you so they
[25:22.180 --> 25:26.580]  won't notice the criminal activities you're involved in that's not tenable even short
[25:26.580 --> 25:34.340]  term for the new world order the spectacle of DC on lockdown panicking people running
[25:34.340 --> 25:39.940]  congress people running in fear being ordered around by police in these ridiculous police
[25:39.940 --> 25:48.740]  uniforms everyone lying down on the ground you know hiding behind rocks miles away in
[25:48.740 --> 25:54.700]  some cases and then the media going for five hours and saying she was seen shooting at the
[25:54.700 --> 26:00.700]  police shots fired the capitals under attack the White House is under attack on and on
[26:00.700 --> 26:07.180]  and on and on and then we find out it's a woman during a drill who drove up to a checkpoint
[26:07.180 --> 26:12.780]  not barricades and then ran from a checkpoint and may have bumped up against a checkpoint
[26:12.780 --> 26:19.940]  but the original report said that she was firing and shot to police at a checkpoint
[26:19.940 --> 26:26.400]  I said hope it isn't a false flag with a government shutdown but it's probably a backfire or
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.700]  something it's probably because they but they're always evacuating the capital for backfires
[26:30.700 --> 26:34.740]  or it might be somebody going post alert might be drug dealers well media matters White House
[26:34.740 --> 26:38.340]  run came out and said that I said it was a false flag yesterday and I went to the clip
[26:38.340 --> 26:43.980]  they had and I did not say that I said here we go again it could be staged of course it
[26:43.980 --> 26:48.620]  could be staged the government's been caught staging everything from the gulf of Tonkin
[26:48.620 --> 26:54.420]  to north woods to you name it operation Ajax now it's come out mainstream news we're going
[26:54.420 --> 27:00.180]  to get to it that indeed it was Saudi intelligence launched the chemical attacks gave the jihadis
[27:00.180 --> 27:05.780]  the weapons the jihadis want to be rock stars so they shot video of themselves doing it
[27:05.780 --> 27:10.140]  but now that's mainstream news we're going to be getting into all of that the truth is
[27:10.140 --> 27:15.100]  the systems mad that people listen to us and they listen to the alternative real media
[27:15.100 --> 27:21.060]  the reassurgent media Sy Hirsch two time Pulitzer prize winner says your bin Laden raid was
[27:21.060 --> 27:28.580]  a hundred percent fake and didn't happen Obama what are you going to do New World Order
[27:28.580 --> 27:34.020]  bad boys bad boys what are you going to do what are you going to do when reality comes
[27:34.020 --> 27:38.700]  for you what are you going to do when you implode the economy your economic takeover
[27:38.700 --> 27:47.380]  of society by design and then instead of everyone being in the dark about what the globalists
[27:47.380 --> 27:54.700]  have done everybody knows you're the authors of it do you really think armies of drooling
[27:54.700 --> 27:59.380]  supporters that literally don't know what planet they're on we're going to play some
[27:59.380 --> 28:03.580]  video of this democratic supporters don't even know what party Obama's in they just
[28:03.580 --> 28:11.420]  think he's cool I like him I think he's great black white Hispanic Asian old young don't
[28:11.420 --> 28:18.980]  know what planet they're on every one of them in Los Angeles doesn't know what planet they're
[28:18.980 --> 28:25.260]  on but you know what it's got to be a hundred million of us have just armed to the teeth
[28:25.260 --> 28:29.500]  we know all about the new world order we know all about your tactics battle tactics propaganda
[28:29.500 --> 28:35.580]  tactics we're just studying you watching you gearing up passing the word getting ready
[28:35.580 --> 28:41.180]  so go ahead blow up Chicago with a nuker Dallas or maybe whatever city you're going to hit
[28:41.180 --> 28:45.980]  blame it on the patriot movement by the way you know they raided this woman's house shut
[28:45.980 --> 28:51.620]  down the whole neighborhood had helicopters and SWAT team saying she might have been anti-government
[28:51.620 --> 28:58.620]  that way they put anti-government in there subconsciously and they go oh it's terrible
[28:58.620 --> 29:03.260]  no anti-government stuff you know they went through a computer if she would have ever
[29:03.260 --> 29:08.860]  visited my website because they've done this over and over again with police shootings
[29:08.860 --> 29:13.740]  the boss and bombings they go and get in the person's computer my site's one of the biggest
[29:13.740 --> 29:20.180]  new sites in the world it's in the top 20 undoubtedly on record if you visit it and
[29:20.180 --> 29:24.980]  you commit a crime they blame it on me but I'm surprised they didn't just lie about it
[29:24.980 --> 29:28.660]  they already lied that she shot two cops they already lied that she ran over the barriers
[29:28.660 --> 29:33.260]  we have the video of who ran into the barriers oh and we have the photos from the pentagon's
[29:33.260 --> 29:39.340]  own website they had marines and army and police out there with checkpoints searching
[29:39.340 --> 29:44.380]  people and this woman who looked like she may have been a paranoid schizophrenic or borderline
[29:44.380 --> 29:49.740]  fled on prescription drugs that's admitted as usual and they killed her they killed her

[34:37.060 --> 34:43.940]  freedom i am your host alex jones let me get into the news here because it's very important
[34:43.940 --> 34:49.420]  let me just measure what we have we have the poor myriam carry executed in front of her
[34:49.420 --> 34:55.420]  small child old enough to see her shot at least 12 times at basically point blank range
[34:55.420 --> 35:01.420]  directly through the window they should have just seen she was panicking letter fled followed
[35:01.420 --> 35:08.380]  her stopped her away from the capital should have shot her tires i would have just let
[35:08.380 --> 35:14.220]  her flee and not pursued followed her by camera they had her license number get her later
[35:14.220 --> 35:18.060]  a lot of cities are actually doing that because these police chases kill so many people with
[35:18.060 --> 35:22.740]  all the adrenaline including police no it doesn't matter when the average animals the average
[35:22.740 --> 35:31.540]  slaves die according to perspective of many in the establishment but secondarily could
[35:31.540 --> 35:35.900]  have shot other tires no that wasn't done she was shot right through the window right in
[35:35.900 --> 35:43.260]  front of her small child and then because obama is seen as dc now i noticed on the youtube
[35:43.260 --> 35:47.780]  video news i uploaded last night about it and in our articles at info wars dot com being
[35:47.780 --> 35:52.980]  critical of the police i saw a lot of black folks commenting and you could follow back
[35:52.980 --> 35:57.540]  their links on youtube and on my site to their youtubes and facebook they were black folks
[35:57.540 --> 36:04.380]  mainly saying we were racist and that we wouldn't be upset if this woman was black of course
[36:04.380 --> 36:10.060]  she was black that wasn't known yet but we were only upset because it was a white woman
[36:10.060 --> 36:17.460]  and she was driving a nice car so people watching this some black folks immediately thought
[36:17.460 --> 36:23.900]  that it was a nice car it must be a white lady and we're glad she was dead is basically
[36:23.900 --> 36:27.820]  what i was you can go to my site and read the comments in the article paul watson posted
[36:27.820 --> 36:34.300]  about the country that faced down nuclear war in the sixties now panics and fear and
[36:34.300 --> 36:39.740]  freaks out of a woman in car and in those comments i saw him there and then i saw him on the
[36:39.740 --> 36:44.300]  youtube video i shot right around the same time immediately you're just mad it's a white
[36:44.300 --> 36:49.180]  woman i wasn't thinking white woman black woman i didn't think oh they've killed a white
[36:49.180 --> 36:54.580]  woman i wasn't even thinking she's Hispanic she's black she's white it didn't even enter
[36:54.580 --> 36:59.700]  my mind it was they killed some woman and john bound ran in here well almost like he
[36:59.700 --> 37:04.180]  was psychic and he goes i bet they were running drills part of that east coast drill and i
[37:04.180 --> 37:07.500]  bet she came up to a checkpoint and i and it's part of the government shutdown with
[37:07.500 --> 37:11.780]  other barricades and i bet she ran so they killed her and i bet it was cops that ran
[37:11.780 --> 37:16.780]  into the barricades and i'm like well you're the news director when rob do's work on obama
[37:16.780 --> 37:21.300]  deception settle down maybe you're hunched is right you got to prove that settle down
[37:21.300 --> 37:25.740]  this is like at two thirty right out there in the studio you guys saw this happen turn
[37:25.740 --> 37:32.620]  on your mic cj i mean is that not what john bound said exactly verbatim verbatim verbatim
[37:32.620 --> 37:38.260]  verbatim and i went whoa dude whoa i mean because you know i get to jump bounds a lot
[37:38.260 --> 37:42.100]  like me it's really excited i was like how do you know this he goes i just know i just
[37:42.100 --> 37:47.340]  know then it all comes in running a drill she didn't shoot at him didn't shoot two cops
[37:47.340 --> 37:53.300]  the cops are running into barricades she was on anti-anxiety medication reportedly bipolar
[37:53.300 --> 37:57.820]  that's the new name for schizophrenic john's supposed to go schizophrenic after thirty that's
[37:57.820 --> 38:01.860]  happening to people people are going nuts in this modern society all the gmo all the
[38:01.860 --> 38:06.820]  toxins all the electromagnetic smart meter radiation on record that makes animals go
[38:06.820 --> 38:12.700]  crazy and so she's flipping out she's got problems she goes to dc what gets freaked
[38:12.700 --> 38:18.540]  out by checkpoints runs she's dead and it turns out bound was basically a hundred percent
[38:18.540 --> 38:27.220]  right i guess just knowing the pity parties they have and the way they all behave and
[38:27.220 --> 38:34.980]  the type of stuff that goes on in this country all right before i get into all this news
[38:34.980 --> 38:38.100]  on this subject and then in the government shut down on the huge new developments there
[38:38.100 --> 38:43.060]  and then exclusive border patrol reps claim agents being ordered to stand down that's
[38:43.060 --> 38:46.500]  from right bart that was said three years ago and turned out to be true it was said
[38:46.500 --> 38:51.100]  a year ago turned out to be true of course it's true when the border patrol reps come
[38:51.100 --> 38:56.100]  out and say we're ordered to stand down i've talked to border patrol i have extended family
[38:56.100 --> 39:01.980]  that are border patrol i live in texas they're they're not allowed to stop anybody basically
[39:01.980 --> 39:05.220]  they're there to harass citizens and by the way they don't like that they're told to give
[39:05.220 --> 39:10.540]  people tickets in the national park if they catch you with beer in your picnic basket
[39:10.540 --> 39:15.060]  i've actually witnessed it so there's that story and meanwhile their drones are being
[39:15.060 --> 39:21.780]  used to watch us citizens the new american reports not the illegals of course the hundred
[39:21.780 --> 39:26.260]  mile deep checkpoints on the northern southern border are there to harass citizens i've been
[39:26.260 --> 39:32.620]  through them in the north and the south i've watched illegal aliens with no id fly tsa
[39:32.620 --> 39:37.340]  as orders to let them through illegal aliens you know wearing the wrangler jeans cowboy
[39:37.340 --> 39:41.660]  hats whole nine yards you know hard-working legal aliens i might knock on those folks
[39:41.660 --> 39:46.100]  member from mexico uh they're nice people overall but my point is is that they're above the
[39:46.100 --> 39:51.180]  law and it's wrong i mean if they can drink and drive and if they can not have insurance
[39:51.180 --> 39:55.060]  and if they can get on the plane without id if they can have bank accounts without id's
[39:55.060 --> 40:02.540]  then i'm going to change my name to pablo gunzillas okay because i want the rights they've got
[40:02.540 --> 40:08.420]  but the reason they've got all those extra rights is because the establishment wants
[40:08.420 --> 40:12.540]  them here to drive down wages and wants to incentivize everything they can to get them
[40:12.540 --> 40:15.740]  here because they're kids that are going to be citizens they're going to be forced to
[40:15.740 --> 40:19.420]  take shots they're going to be sucked off of they're going to be dumbed down they're
[40:19.420 --> 40:23.500]  going to join the imperial military to fight for the new world order and emperor palpatine
[40:23.500 --> 40:28.020]  and that's why they're here they're here because i don't care whether you're hispanic black
[40:28.020 --> 40:33.020]  white what you are even asians kids uh you know getting out of the stereotype of them
[40:33.020 --> 40:38.180]  generationally staying hard working the numbers are there turn into degenerate slobs in many
[40:38.180 --> 40:43.260]  cases i mean just look at the numbers why not you can go on welfare so they've got to
[40:43.260 --> 40:48.380]  bring in all these third world populations because the average american doesn't want
[40:48.380 --> 40:52.860]  to go out and start a business or work hard now there's a lot of americans that do and
[40:52.860 --> 40:56.140]  who are the backbone of this country i don't care what color you are but we're the main
[40:56.140 --> 41:03.020]  enemy and being taxed to the hill and we're shutting down as well and indigenous americans
[41:03.020 --> 41:06.760]  don't have kids they have like one point three kids on average so you got to bring any legals
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.660]  to replace them for social security but the point is the illegals are above the law and
[41:12.660 --> 41:17.500]  are godlike so just remember that it's total discrimination but the bankers run things that's
[41:17.500 --> 41:24.820]  why it is but let's show you just one of the videos of police driving at 90 miles an hour
[41:24.820 --> 41:29.620]  and smashing into barricades and there's several videos of this they were just crash
[41:29.620 --> 41:35.100]  up derby driving 80 90 miles an hour slamming into each other slamming just shooting guns
[41:35.100 --> 41:39.500]  wildly just like new york last year where they shot nine people and for two days blamed
[41:39.500 --> 41:43.260]  it on the guy they killed they shot people this year and blamed it on the guy they shot
[41:43.260 --> 41:48.140]  so the new thing is they shoot you wall wall west to start shooting everything up in the
[41:48.140 --> 41:53.460]  shooting gallery with instinctive training instinctive shooting training going haywire
[41:53.460 --> 41:58.020]  and then they claim it's a terror attack of hyperventilating freakouts sergeant of arms
[41:58.020 --> 42:03.660]  from the congress people crying shaking were battle hard we made it up the ewo jima we
[42:03.660 --> 42:07.940]  made it up the hill we hoisted the flag i mean you would think that they just won the
[42:07.940 --> 42:13.220]  congressional medal of honor i mean the congress people are still on tv hyperventilating shaking
[42:13.220 --> 42:16.780]  talking about how they just went through the most harrowing combat mission of their entire
[42:16.780 --> 42:20.740]  life like what hillary made it up since he flew into serbia and her plane was shot up
[42:20.740 --> 42:30.340]  total lie i mean it is just the wicked flea when none pursue and it is insanity absolutely
[42:30.340 --> 42:35.940]  insane because this was a police riot let's go to the clip of course when there's a real
[42:35.940 --> 42:40.820]  shooter though the swat team's order to stand down but when it's a woman well then send
[42:40.820 --> 42:45.180]  them all in and oh they were so restrained oh they were so restrained oh they were so
[42:45.180 --> 42:51.060]  incredibly restrained oh they're so wonderful oh they're so incredible on and on and on
[42:51.060 --> 42:57.860]  the sycophantic worship and the maps on cnn and diagramming every factor of it and will
[42:57.860 --> 43:02.580]  she be an anti-government extremist they shut down the neighborhood helicopters armored
[43:02.580 --> 43:08.940]  vehicles anti-bomb robots oh my gosh was the was the mentally ill woman with a small child

[44:01.780 --> 44:05.860]  and all over the country they have federal grants now for warrantless checkpoints including
[44:05.860 --> 44:14.340]  army and marines with side arms and they had california drills in central california
[44:14.340 --> 44:18.660]  was covered in the news there where they actually have heavy machine guns in the back of humbies
[44:18.660 --> 44:23.580]  aiming them at people like it's feluja and in the future if one person gets out of their
[44:23.580 --> 44:28.300]  car runs they're just going to open up on a whole column like it's bagdad or feluja
[44:28.300 --> 44:33.500]  and just kill everybody because we're the enemy and then drop an ak-47 on you like
[44:33.500 --> 44:38.700]  they do in iraq as they were publicly trained to do so this is it and then there already
[44:38.700 --> 44:43.140]  are police officers and the veterans that don't want to do it they're having their guns taken
[44:43.140 --> 44:48.220]  so if you're ptsd and want to be a cop that's fine but any other thing you know you're the
[44:48.220 --> 44:54.220]  enemy you're going to have your guns taken so let's go to the police car video it's
[44:54.220 --> 44:58.500]  up on info wars dot com of your radio list of them smashing into the into the barricade
[44:58.500 --> 45:11.860]  here's one of the videos folks this is not a police car if you're a radio listener that
[45:11.860 --> 45:19.460]  came around a corner or something and hit the barricade this this is a cop car driving
[45:19.460 --> 45:30.580]  it like 80 90 miles an hour straight into a barricade straight into it and it's been
[45:30.580 --> 45:34.900]  confirmed they were doing this everywhere just ramming police cars by the way they weren't
[45:34.900 --> 45:38.540]  even trying to block her in or something in these videos she's no word even around they're
[45:38.540 --> 45:42.980]  just driving around just driving into things and they did an excellent job and I think
[45:42.980 --> 45:47.500]  they're heroes I think it's great I mean you look at these DC cops most of them they look
[45:47.500 --> 45:52.660]  like they're the people mark dice interview the stories up on info wars dot com and drugs

[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:14.160]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he he's alex
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:27.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.600]  Joe Biden backs park rangers who are stopping World War II vets, and they've got extra security
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.180]  and forces building big wire barricades to keep the enemy out, even when the park doesn't
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:45.040]  own or control an area, they're shutting them down to teach the slaves, and what are we,
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.040]  three, four days now into the government shutdown, I'll be here this Sunday, four to
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:54.960]  six p.m. live, covering all this. Mark Dice is going to be joining us, a media activist
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.080]  and just a big booster of the show over the years. He's going to be joining, I'm being
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:05.120]  sarcastic, Mark's been critical of us, I don't even care, that's so liberating. The point
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:13.440]  is, he does a lot of great work out there on the streets, showing the zombies, and so
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:19.120]  we're going to have him joining us coming up in the next segment. By the way, I do have
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.560]  an announcement. My main focus is getting infowars.com and prisonplot.com updated and
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:31.560]  redesigned. I have not suspended, but I have slow trained the Obama deception too, because
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:38.000]  I've been up here until 9 or 10 at night, 11, 12 midnight sometimes, and it's burning
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.200]  me out, and I could put the film out and have it ready December 1st and make more money.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.880]  Obviously people buy it as a present, but that's not my main goal. I can put it out
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:55.320]  in say February or March and really hype it up more, and when I put it out on prisonplot.tv
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.000]  and then it'll go on YouTube for free, more people will see it if I can build it up and
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.200]  hype it. My goal is for it to be seen and fight tyranny. That's what I'm looking for.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.720]  The money is just fuel literally like in a rocket system that I'm launching at the enemy.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.400]  So in my hierarchy of needs, waking people up and fighting tyrannies right at the top,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:19.840]  and money is down at the foundational, but I spit on it. I don't worship it's my point,
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.760]  because all it is is a symbol of energy, that the globalists then control their fiat and
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.640]  get the whole world through it, and they worship it because it's the fraud that gives them
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.680]  the planet. And the love of it is the root of all evil. That's what gives them all this
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.320]  control. What I love is freedom and beauty and honor and strength and all the things
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.960]  that I aspire to support. That's what it comes down to.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.040]  So, and I've also just really hammered the crew. I mean, they've been dedicated. Rob
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.920]  Jacobson, Darren McBrain, Rob Dube, mainly working on the film with me and we could put
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.600]  it out. We could have it done in two weeks and sweeten it and do the mix and all the
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.760]  stuff on it, but I mean, again, it's a good film, probably the best I've ever made, but
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.360]  I want it to be really spectacular. So I don't know what I'm going to do with it. I'm going
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.080]  to just kind of work on it the next month and then look at it, then fiddle with it and
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.800]  then see what happens too, because there's a bunch of big stuff's about to happen with
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.960]  economics, IMF and World Bank are getting, saying get ready for total implosion basically.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.560]  And so I want to be able to, I mean, already lay all this out in the film. So, I mean,
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.200]  I mean, the film's like 90% done right now. My point is, is that we will sell no wine
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.960]  until it's time. And my great frustration is always if we do the radio show, manage
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:44.720]  the crew, news division, writers, finances, while I try to make films, and I've made some
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.600]  pretty good films, in games, powerful, terror storms, powerful Obama deceptions, powerful
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.720]  fall, the republic's powerful, truth rising, a cinema verite. I like it personally, because
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.240]  it's not my, you know, classic type that I always, you kind of put out there like film
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.240]  books or something, where I over document everything. It's more of a cinema verite,
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:11.360]  but Obama deception too will come out in February or March. Obama deception in 2009 came out
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.920]  on March 15th. Well, the FBI showed up asking about it. They were here for another reason,
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.880]  the federal subpoena with a court case of somebody that threatened a cop on my website,
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.960]  and they did subpoena that, and they did arrest the guys in prison right now. But while they
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.680]  were here, and while they were calling me, and they calling my crew, they want to know
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.880]  about Obama deception too, when that was coming out. So, I dropped it three days early on
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.160]  people, just immediately uploaded it right to YouTube to premiere it so they couldn't
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.880]  stop me. And I think that ended in it being seen by more people. But this film will be
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:52.400]  light years ahead of Obama deception number one. You'll be able to give this film to somebody
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.480]  and expose the entire New World Order master plan, who they are, and more importantly,
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.640]  how to stop them.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.880]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.480]  you and your family's health. Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.080]  in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.320]  No active contamination is now in most of the food supply. There's only two ways to
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.080]  avoid this. Move south of the equator, or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.400]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research. Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest,
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.080]  absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family. It's made right here in the

[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.640]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:10.800]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:17.120]  autism, and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:23.560]  eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:29.320]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:34.200]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:40.480]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit infowarslife.com. The site is literally packed with audio

[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.000]  My Patriot Supply. As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.560]  and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food. It has always been
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:23.000]  my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.800]  patriots. My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with

[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:31.280]  Well, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who is an above-the-law swindler whose
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.440]  tax exempt, but lobbies to make Europeans work seven days a week and pay her more, make
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.720]  her bailout money, she says there's about to be an epic scale change, basically an implosion
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.200]  in the economy. So we're going to be talking to economist and fund manager Peter Schiff
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.640]  at the bottom of the hour. He's been very accurate in his predictions. Dr. Steve Pachinick
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.400]  on the naval yard being a false flag from his intel, former head of Black Ops, basically
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.520]  in the Carter administration. He's going to be joining us. Of course, he's the guy that
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.400]  told you that bin Laden raid was fake. Now Syhurst says it's fake. That's big news, by
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.280]  the way. That's why I keep talking about that. We're going to get into the public execution
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.240]  of a woman. They lied. She didn't shoot at him. Didn't have a gun. They ran to her house
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.000]  saying they wanted to find anti-government material. Couldn't find that. And it was police
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.400]  reportedly now the witnesses and video shows smashing into barricades, running over things,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.760]  driving on the road straight and just running into barricades for no reason. Like lemmings
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:40.120]  off the edge of a cliff, just societal insanity, standing ovations in the house and Senate,
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  just worshiping the police killinger. They should have just shot her tires out or let
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.960]  her go and let her settle down. It's a woman. They look in the window and see a woman with
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.600]  like a three-year-old child. And then she drives off, so they shoot her. And then they
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:59.280]  call themselves heroes. The police chief now coming out in DC, the woman that wears
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:05.800]  like a third world dictator uniform, she is calling them a hero. She said no one can doubt
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:11.120]  that their actions were heroic. Well, they're so desperate looking for terrorists, looking
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.240]  for resistance. And they had a drill with Army and Marine Corps checkpoints. And Don
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.800]  Salazar from a tip found that last night, it turned out in that area. And that's what
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.840]  we started saying. We believe it's a checkpoint. And it turned out it was a checkpoint with
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.640]  Army and Marines there to acclimate everyone. And the woman pulls up and sees this, runs
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.200]  off, may have bumped a checkpoint. Now it's a checkpoint she might have run into. And so
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:40.240]  they killed her. They killed her. In North Korea, I mean, District of Criminals, the
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:44.960]  corridor on the Potomac, they killed the lady. Now, on a side issue, Mark Dice was supposed
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:51.960]  to be on the Tonight Show last night with Jay Leno. You always hear this stuff. You
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:57.080]  know, he was actually there last night, but the segment didn't air. And I've been contacted
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.600]  by some of their folks, and they want me on, and I haven't been on. But it doesn't matter.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.040]  They're the old media. We're the new media. But it shows how controlled it is. I'm told
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.040]  Jay Leno is a listener by his people, and I can tell he's criticized Obama. So I'm
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.960]  not attacking Jay Leno. The point is, is that these things really are canned even when you're
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.920]  told it's taped to air. But that's a side issue. The reason we wanted to get Mark on
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:25.080]  is last night I saw his video Watson did a story on it today. It's up on info wars.com.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:31.280]  Video Obama supporters don't know what party Obama is affiliated with. We're going to go
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.760]  to this video and then get some comments from Mark Dice. What political party is President
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:45.680]  Obama affiliated with? He's a Democrat, a Republican. I don't know. I really don't care.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:52.120]  It's not important, man. We got weed to smoke. Exactly. How'd you know? What political party
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:12:00.840]  is Barack Obama affiliated with? God, I don't know. Come on, seriously? I don't know, man.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:07.840]  We're talking about the Lord Barack Obama. What political party is he affiliated with,
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.040]  the Messiah? I would think the Democrat Party, I guess. Is that a guess or do you do you
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:21.360]  guess? Yeah, I don't got time. Appreciate it. Okay. Don't have time. Are you serious?
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:30.480]  Yes. What political party? Yes. Democrat. Oh, we're just checking it through. I don't
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.160]  know. I think he's the best. The best ideas, good ideas. He's a part of the best ideas
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:48.880]  political party. Okay. I'd say Barack Obama is affiliated with the, affiliated with the
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:55.880]  Republican Party. Oh, we're just checking. We're just doing some surveys on the pulse
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:02.160]  of America to find out how brain dead everybody is. See what's happening? People are brain
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.880]  dead. That's what's happening. Not people, but President Obama. He's brain dead, too.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.120]  Well, yeah. Well, actually, he's smart. He's an intelligent con man. But the average American
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.960]  is a zombie and doesn't know what anything, you know, the average American's a zombie
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.320]  and doesn't really know what political party he stands for. Right. Well, that's true. Yeah,
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.220]  I would agree. I would agree. Yeah, I agree from experience. From experience. Yeah. Talking
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:32.840]  about the Lord Obama, President Obama, by the way, a lot of these people are well dressed.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:38.360]  Political party is he affiliated with? I don't really know. You don't even know. I'm sorry.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.200]  Are you an American citizen? Yes, I know. Okay. Are you sure you got some kind of. It's not
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.160]  like he's outside of mental institution or something. I mean, this is over. You don't
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.640]  know or downtown Austin political party in South Congress. They're this guy. We've done
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.800]  the video. You're very. Thank you for being informed. Okay. Thanks, zombie. What party
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:04.360]  is the president a part of? Oh, I don't know. Is any like a Democrat or something? You're
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:11.280]  just guessing. Yeah, you just say you don't know. I don't. We're just checking. Thanks.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:17.000]  What party's Barack Obama affiliated with? It's one of those. Huh? It's one of those.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.120]  One of those. This isn't really on the air. Is it? I have nothing good to say. I'm sorry.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:33.440]  You don't know what political party I'm affiliated with. I'm not sure what he's affiliated with.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.080]  Look at the sewage coming out right behind her. Who he's affiliated with Satan. He's
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.360]  affiliated. They dump raw sewage out there and everybody swims in it. It's a mouthpiece
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.960]  of Satan. Right there. I've been at that beach. Is that right? They dumps lightly treated
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.640]  sewage out. Tell me more about that. Look right over her shoulder is sewage pouring
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:59.160]  out. He's paving the path for the Antichrist to come. So there you go. You can check it
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:04.720]  out at m4wars.com. We have links to a bunch of his videos and Mark, you said that you
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:11.560]  show everybody and this is really what happened out there as they swim in the sewage as well.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.800]  Mark Dice joining us via AudioSkype. Thank you. The videos are cut short. I mean I fill
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.600]  up a signature panel of maybe 16, 14 signatures and to make the video so it's not so redundant
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.800]  and repetitive, I cut them to about three or four or five minutes, but they could be
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.480]  10, eight, 10 minutes long. Most of the people, the petition signers, the videos that you've
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.160]  seen about me getting people to sign these just Orwellian, Huxley and Idiocracy petitions
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.960]  that nobody in their right mind should even consider even looking at and these people
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:49.120]  just sign them. What I'm demonstrating is that the politicians, how they abuse people
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  through the power of suggestion, through repetition, through portraying the aura of authority.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.240]  It's obviously I just approach these people and just use the keywords and we use support
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.480]  Obama and their brain literally shuts off. We're living, as you know, we're living in
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:09.960]  the Idiocracy, Orwellian, Huxley and Circus, this just kind of a combination. I mean Orwell
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:16.840]  himself wrote that every citizen, the beliefs, the habits, the tastes, the emotional attitudes,
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.920]  the characteristics of our time are designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.600]  the true nature of present-day society from being perceived and I mean that's what we
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.760]  have. The only people who don't sign the petition videos or the people who just know what we're
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.840]  doing or just don't want to be bothered by a petition signer but you can see the disdain
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.560]  in my face for the people. People ask how I don't crack up and start laughing.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:46.320]  It's very sad actually. We got 90% of Austinites, including a guy that said he was a chemical
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:53.520]  engineer to sign a form to ban dihydrogen monoxide which of course is water and we've
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.400]  also got the majority of them. It was again about 9 out of 10 who called to put gun owners
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.040]  in FEMA camps. I mean this is what they do. As long as you say for Obama, we're going
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.720]  to put gun owners in slave camps. They go, yes, I want slave camps and they'll sign
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.880]  their name, birth date and signature to it. I could probably get their social security
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.440]  numbers if I really wanted to. What these are is flaming authoritarian smart.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.720]  They want to help. They're so lazy. These are probably people that were too lazy to
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.440]  get off of their couch and go and actually vote. So if you just stick a petition in front
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.720]  of their face, they feel like they're helping. They want to support the power structure.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.080]  The reason that we're in this idiocracy as you know, as much as the audience knows is
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.560]  because this is the Illuminati plan to dumb everybody down so that the small, middle class
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.280]  of hardworking, educated, old-fashioned Americans are the ones that are going to get all of
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:51.000]  their wealth sucked away by this socialist system that they're setting up so that it's
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.760]  like an ineptocracy. The people who don't work and refuse to work are rewarded with
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.440]  the fruits of the labor of those who do work hard.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.840]  And you notice they always have that arrogant attitude. They don't know what party it's
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:08.320]  in, but they can dismiss you. They get, as long as they act arrogant, they're still winners.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.440]  That's the main spirit they have is the arrogance and the love of their ignorance. It is their
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:16.080]  weapon. It is their power.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.120]  The cell phones, laughter is the best medicine, so I'm trying through these videos to shake
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.880]  people, and to have people share the videos with their friends and family to sort of wake
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.280]  up because we fall asleep at the wheel. The Americans have become hypnotized and mesmerized
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.280]  by their smartphones.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.800]  I agree. Listen, we're out of time, Mark. We're gonna get you back on for a full hour
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.080]  soon to really go through your videos and talk about the world. But in one minute, tell
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.600]  us what happened with Jay Leno last night. This is an example of how behind the scenes
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.600]  behind the curtain.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.640]  I was up there with some friends, and I just randomly happened to be chosen in the audience
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.080]  to ask Jay a question for the Ask Jay Anything segment. So they have their pre-approved scripted
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.520]  questions. So I read the question. I said, yeah, I'll ask that. It'll be fun. And they
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.000]  said, okay, look, if you got asked the question, we're gonna edit and re-tape. So it was nice.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.120]  They didn't know who I was, but after the fact, they asked for my name and what I do.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.640]  And it was just a funny question, and he had a canned response. And last night when the
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.600]  show aired, my quick 30-second little segment just mysteriously was edited out of the show.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.840]  I think because the producers probably after the fact went and looked me up and realized
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.840]  like, oh man, we can't have Mark on the show.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.000]  My point is it shows the dinosaur nature of the old media because I've been behind the
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.960]  scenes a lot as well. It really is all scripted. They wanted me on the view to script what
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.560]  I was gonna say, and I basically played along with it. Same thing with singing in. And then
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.640]  of course, I just go on there and do whatever I want. But Mark, great to have you on. Thank
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.400]  you so much. And your stories up on DrudgeReport.com. If folks want to see that, it's video. Obama
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.800]  supporters don't know what party Obama is affiliated with. We'll continue to watch to
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.560]  see what the zombies do next. Great job, Mark. Appreciate it, Alex. Give up the great work.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:20:00.160]  He is the zombie slayer. He exposes them and shows how happy they are in their ignorance.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:07.840]  And now, an important sponsored message for men only from GetEDSolutions.com. Men who were
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.200]  formerly taking ED medication are now reporting that a secret underground video has restored
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.920]  their male performance better than pills. These men say this secret underground video
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.000]  is bringing back the male performance and sensation they've been missing for years
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.440]  and it's working better than pills. Things are so much better now. Everything kind of came back
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:34.160]  overnight. My girlfriend is very happy. I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.

[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:16.720]  FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food. It has always been my belief
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.800]  that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots.

[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:28.080]  Peter Schiff, economist, successful brokerage company owner,
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.880]  fund manager is going to be joining us to talk about the state of the world economy for about
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:38.400]  15 minutes in the next segment and it ties into global economy is an epic change as the head of
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:44.720]  the IMF they're experiencing transitions on an epic scale international monetary fund manager
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.800]  director said today warning that turbulence and emerging markets could knock out up to one percentage
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:57.920]  point of their growth and they're talking about taper talk with the US Federal Reserve but Schiff
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.360]  has accurately predicted that well he's predicted a lot of things and here's a couple minutes from
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.640]  a video a Peter Schiff is right part two here it is Ben Bernanke is out there trying to lay the
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:14.800]  foundation now for more QE because he knows that he can never taper he's he's just this is August
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:21.360]  first tell the market the truth we do expect that there's going to be a taper tomorrow correct oh we
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.360]  do and he said they wouldn't taper by QE dies by QE and you know people are starting to factor in
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.320]  tapering and if the Fed tapers this market's going a lot lower I don't think they're going to taper
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.640]  I think they're just bluffing I think it's all talk I think the Fed knows that they've built
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.480]  this phony economy and they're going to keep inflating it so they're going to keep talking
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.400]  about tapering and they're going to talk about why they're going to do it in the future but why
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.400]  they're not going to do it right now but they're going to keep making up excuses why they can't
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.360]  do it and if they actually do taper they're going to be untapering very quickly and that's going
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.640]  to be very problematic for their credibility oh my god I think the music thing I've heard
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.840]  today is that the Fed is doing a fake out on all this and they all laugh out and see expected to
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.760]  by some at least to taper it's 85 billion dollar monthly bond purchases by 10 billion dollars
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.880]  economists expect the Fed to begin cutting the 85 billion that it buys and bonds and mortgages every
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:22.080]  month by about 10 billion I say I say they'll cut these the money printing by about 10 billion
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:27.360]  dollars moving down a 75 billion a month markets expect to taper from the Federal Reserve and
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.040]  actually a little bit bigger than I would have thought but their average is 15 by the way Dr
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.160]  Roberts said they weren't going to taper too all of our guests are right they're all wrong billion
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.440]  dollars to be taken off the table now JP Morgan analysts have been the most hawkish out there
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.560]  they're predicting the central bank could tape and bond purchases by as much as 20 billion by the way
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.720]  JP Morgan runs to Bernanke this was all a big sucker 10 from treasury purchases and five from
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:57.280]  Morgan's about suckering the public is Goldman Sachs though is staying in the middle of the road
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.160]  predicting 10 to 15 billion dollars worth of tapering I think you know when the Fed gets a good
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.320]  look at what's happening with oil prices what's happening with stock prices going down now real
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.760]  state prices now turning south corporate earnings going down there is I think the employment picture
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  is going to darken I think this is another reason for the Fed not to taper that's august 27 weeks
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.560]  before they are from announced the time is going to be all the the new going to taper the fact that
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:27.840]  the tapering talk is put back to some time next year and then again they'll come up with another
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.040]  excuse why they can't pay for already seeing the anticipation of the Fed taking the training wheels
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.600]  off the economy even though I believe the Fed is going to do more QE and even if they make the
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.400]  mistake you know in their mind of tapering in in September which I don't think they're going to do
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.280]  but even if they do that they're going to have to undo it probably about the first quarter of 2014
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.840]  and really open up the monetary spigots even further but I don't think it's what they should do
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.800]  what they should do is stop all QE and they should start shrinking their balance sheet but what they
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.880]  should do and what I think they're going to do are two entirely different things right because the
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.000]  Fed is going to act for political reasons short-term expediency they will never do what's right for
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.400]  the long-term health of the US well whatever you know the Fed has worked pretty hard to get to this
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:17.040]  position that is they set themselves up to begin the taper they wouldn't begin if they didn't expect
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.120]  they were going to be able to continue but you know there may be something in the statement that
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.200]  surprises people or maybe the magnitude of the tapering will surprise people
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:33.760]  Federal Reserve Decision no taper the Federal Reserve did not taper $40 billion per month
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.800]  in mortgage backed securities September 18th no taper will continue to be purchased the Fed says
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.840]  taking into account fiscal restraint he said back in August weeks before they would not taper but
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:49.440]  it decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the purchases
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:55.120]  is wow no taper just to reiterate here the Federal Reserve surprising most
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:03.280]  and for folks that don't know not tapering means an acceleration of printing money putting us more
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.120]  in debt and devaluing with value of currencies all over the world not just the dollar and this
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.840]  gives the big banks to get the zero percent interest in all the rest of it a big leg up on the rest
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:20.160]  of the economy then they loaned out to governments individuals for five 10 15 20 30 interest or more
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:28.160]  and so it's free money to the insiders is counterfeiting and they suckered the public on purpose
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.880]  and said that they were going to taper and Dr. Roberts and many other guests but especially
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:40.800]  Schiff actually predicted that they would indeed not taper and actually accelerate it next year
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.520]  because they're going to destroy us either way but this way they get the benefit
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:50.560]  while destroying us so they're going to continue to print like the Weimar Republic we're on the

[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:48.880]  head of euro pacific capital economist uh von mesi and i guess you could call him uh brain
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.840]  peter schiff who we just played that video of them making fun of him laughing at him weeks before a
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:01.600]  month before on all these shows cnbc you name it saying that saying that they were going to
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.520]  have tapering and he said no they're not and i of course agreed with him and many others did
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.440]  but the mainstream media totally disagreed with him we're going to get him to talk about that
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.080]  prediction that came through like most of his predictions do unfortunately i wish he was wrong
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:20.160]  about stuff because it's scary and then what he sees in the future the government shut down all of
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:26.480]  it with peter schiff here in just a moment first off some of the headlines up on info wars dot com
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.640]  uncontrollable laughing or crying you might need an ssri the drug companies write the psychological

[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.480]  can't blame libertarians we have video of obama supporters who don't know what party he's in
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:03.600]  every one of them but one lady this this is the mind of total ignorance and slaves that is just
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.360]  some of what we're going to be breaking down also getting into the government shutdown
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.120]  they've now wired shut and barricaded the world war two memorial that's been privately paid for
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:19.280]  and administered just like mount vernon military keeps camp david open halts nfl baseball coverage

[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:44.480]  uh so that's the news we'll be breaking down after peter schiff leaves us at 50 after and
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.320]  then we've got dr. steepe chenna coming on to talk about geo politics on this friday edition
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.280]  peter thanks for coming on i know you're a busy guy uh so much happening let's get into your
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.640]  prediction where you set on record they're not going to taper and they laughed at you and attacked
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:06.480]  you how were you so sure well remember alex i first started saying there would be no taper
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:12.960]  the day that ben bernacki first discussed it so i knew he was bluffing from the beginning
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:19.600]  and in fact ben bernacki never actually came out and said we're going to taper he always said
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.920]  depending on the data so he left himself and out and even though he knew the market was expecting
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:31.840]  a taper and all these fed officials kept coming out talking about taper they did nothing to diffuse
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.600]  that expectations because their real plan is to try to pretend that there's a way out of this that
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:43.200]  they have an exit strategy that they can taper when they know it's impossible because the entire
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.120]  phony recovery that they're basing the ability to taper on will go away the minute they taper
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.840]  to hold you know so he they can't taper without destroying the economy but unfortunately if they
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:00.960]  don't taper eventually they destroy the economy anyway even worse that's right break down for the
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:07.760]  layperson out there what tapering is what cuey unlimited is and give us your your forecast on
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.000]  where you see the world economy going well right now the federal reserve has got interest rates at
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  zero because we have so much debt that's the highest we can afford to pay and the federal reserve
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:24.240]  is buying 85 billion dollars worth of us treasuries and mortgage debt every month in fact it's actually
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.840]  over 90 billion because the fed is reinvesting the interest it earns on the bonds and mortgages
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.040]  that it already owns and because the fed is buying all this debt that makes it possible for the
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.840]  government to sell the debt without interest rates going up that's the only thing keeping this house
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:46.960]  of cards economy going but if ben Bernanke takes away even some of that support interest rates will
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.280]  rise beyond our ability to afford it in fact in his press conference when he didn't taper he told
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.920]  everybody that the reason he wasn't doing that was because rates had gone up and he didn't want
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.640]  rates to go up anymore but the reason rates went up is because he threatened the taper
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.760]  but now because he threatened the taper he can't actually carry out the threat because tapering
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.920]  means higher interest rates now of course eventually interest rates are going to skyrocket
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.960]  when the dollar crashes and then you know then this party's over you have accurately in the decade
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.960]  plus i've been listening and watching your work and having you on the show and also tune in when
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:29.920]  i can to shift radio that you do almost every day breaking down where we're going and then over and
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:36.560]  over again you've turned out to be accurate give us an idea on where the economy is now in specifics
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.760]  and what you expect to happen by the middle of next year well where it is now it's a it's a
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:47.440]  disaster in the making it's a gigantic bubble we're in worse shape economically than we were
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.440]  were just before the 08 financial crisis i mean we're in worse shape than we were in at the peak
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.160]  of the nasdaq bubble in 2000 we're in worse shape than we were going into the great depression in
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:05.200]  the 1930s so it is a complete disaster that is why the powers in washington at the fed are doing
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.920]  everything they can to postpone the day of reckoning because we've got a lot to reckon with but the
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:16.080]  problem is the longer they postpone it the worse the problems are going to be because we make them
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.200]  bigger when we postpone them so now it's going to be even worse now whether the chickens come home
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.800]  the roost by the middle of next year or not it's hard to say you know we've got this manufactured
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.880]  debt ceiling crisis coming up if they don't raise the debt ceiling then we're going to have a crisis
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.840]  sooner because the minute we can't go deeper into debt then we've got to admit that we're broke and
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:42.160]  then we're going to have a big problem but what they're probably going to do is increase the
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:47.120]  debt ceiling and postpone the problem but you know when when president obama comes out and says
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:53.040]  we have to raise the debt ceiling because america always pays his bills he's lying the reason we
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:57.600]  have to raise the debt ceiling is because we never pay our bills that's why we've got 17 trillion
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:02.800]  in debt we need to raise the debt ceiling so we can borrow more money instead of paying our bills
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.840]  in fact the president lied more he gave a speech yesterday and he actually said that raising the
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.960]  debt ceiling doesn't increase the debt that it doesn't lead to more debt when that's exactly
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.160]  what it does we can only borrow more money if we raise the debt ceiling and that's exactly what
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:23.920]  we're going to do because paying our bills is impossible so we have to borrow money and hope
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.120]  nobody figures out how broke we are but of course we keep telling everybody how broke we are they
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.480]  got to figure it out eventually and then it's not about our willingness to borrow it's about the
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.960]  world's willingness to lend and when the world doesn't want to lend anymore then that's it
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.720]  now now understanding this for again the common person out there
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.480]  i almost don't want to ask you what you would do as a solution because we know they're not
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.080]  going to do that they're going to keep driving the ship in the same direction but briefly
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.120]  what would you do to try to reverse this or mitigate it can it be mitigated a but b more
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.560]  important because we know they're not going to listen to you or other sound economists or minds
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.880]  that are following real free market economics they're following this crony system where this
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.840]  mafia just won't give it up and admit they're wrong because it enriches them where is it really
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.920]  going what will it look like how bad will it be with 101 million people in the u.s on some form
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.920]  of food assistance yeah well look it can be mitigated but only if we deal with it sooner rather than
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:32.240]  later and if we apply market oriented solutions to the problem not government solutions but it's
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.400]  still going to hurt look i want to rip the band-aid off quickly the god they right now they're
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.760]  peeling it off slowly i mean obviously it's going to hurt for a second if we rip the band-aid off
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.320]  but we've got to do it you know so what we've got to do is go cold turkey on all this debt
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.400]  it means the fed has to stop quantitative easing and start selling the bonds it holds it has to
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.440]  allow interest rates to rise to a market level and when that happens we're going to have to deal
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.240]  with the fact that we're broke that means we can't pay back all the money that we've promised people
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:07.120]  are going to take losses government promised a lot of things to a lot of people it can't keep
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.440]  these promises so a lot of people are going to be disappointed some banks are going to fail
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.600]  we can't bail them out companies some companies are going to fail some people are going to lose
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:20.960]  their jobs unfortunately this has to happen but people have to lose the wrong jobs so they can
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.400]  get the right jobs our economy is so screwed up right now based on years and years of artificially
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:31.440]  low interest rates we consume too much we borrowed too much we don't save enough we don't produce
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:37.040]  enough we have true huge trade deficits these are unsustainable they need to be corrected the
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.880]  correction involves some short-term pain but if we can couple that with significant tax relief
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.400]  and spending reductions and sound money then we can make the bitter tasting medicine go down a
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:54.320]  little smoother but more importantly it'll work we'll be able to create a real lasting recovery
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:59.600]  that will benefit everybody if we keep numbing the pain with government stimulus the disease get
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.600]  worse and ultimately it's going to be fatal an analogy of this is people like organic food high
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.480]  quality food they start buying it and then over time everybody starts buying it so it actually
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:15.840]  brings more competition in and then organic food prices go way down from what they were just 15
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  years ago that's how a free market voting with dollars changes things but by select insiders
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:27.120]  having unlimited trillions to put into areas they want it destroys competition enriches groups
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.400]  that aren't competitive and really screws up the society and creates i think the type of mass
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.360]  degeneration we see happening but peter let me ask you this question if we've got 50 million
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  people on food stamps roughly 100 plus million on food assistance half the public on government
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.800]  dependency one way or the other what is going to happen this is the biggest most wrecked government
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:53.360]  in history according to my research correct me if i'm wrong from your perspective and i'm really
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.160]  worried because the collectivists with cloward and piven say they just want to collectivize things
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.360]  it's their plan to wreck things and then have the answer be total government we may be looking at a
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:09.280]  Soviet Union style event here where they absolutely put you and i you know to work on some type of
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.920]  forced labor or something well that is the slippery slope that we're on those are the
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:19.520]  dangers of democracy that our founding fathers warned us about when they gave us a republic
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.320]  and challenged us to keep it unfortunately we didn't meet that challenge and yes there are
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.440]  a significant number of voters who are bought and paid for by the government they're voting
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:35.200]  for benefits they're voting for theft and anybody who threatens to take away what's being stolen and
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:41.120]  redistributed to them is going to lose but i don't know if we've hit the critical mass yet
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.840]  we still have a significant number of Americans who are working for a living and paying all the
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.880]  taxes i know our numbers are diminishing every day as the government makes it more lucrative
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.400]  to jump into the cart and stop and stop pulling it but we have to do something quickly before
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.720]  we're totally outnumbered and of course you know everybody has been educated or indoctrinated in
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.600]  government schools uh the electorate is not that bright unfortunately in the united states and
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:13.520]  they're easily taken in by these left-wing promises of prosperity flowing from government when the
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.880]  only thing that has ever worked at creating prosperity particularly for the poor and the middle
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:24.560]  class is freedom is capitalism it's not a government program or a handout that makes people
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.320]  with rich it's the freedom of entrepreneurs to come up with ideas and then implement those ideas
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:35.760]  by creating businesses that produce the goods and services that we all enjoy and provide the
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:41.120]  employment opportunities that we need to be able to afford them we have the head of europe
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:45.600]  pacific capital peter schiff with us he's also a syndicated talk show host here on the network
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.880]  with us today peter i want to look at the big picture here because you just alluded to it
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:56.720]  they are delivering 7 000 plus armored vehicles to local police uh they are buying millions of
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.600]  rounds of ammo the army manuals that came out a month ago from judicial watch actually say
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.400]  the founding fathers were bad uh the park service has been ordered to be mean to people during the
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:12.960]  shutdown uh jerry browns announced uh driver's license for illegal aliens and says they're
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.760]  going to flood the country and bring in cloward and piven they are consciously trying to bankrupt
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:23.920]  things what do we do when we're facing organized criminal government well this whole shutdown
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:29.040]  is being orchestrated to try to convince americans that the worst thing that can happen is that the
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.360]  government shuts down i mean in fact it would be great if the government actually was shut down
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.480]  unfortunately so much of the government is still operating that is our problem and the problem is
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.520]  this shutdown is temporary they're going to start it all back up again and they're also trying to
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:48.320]  create this false sense of fear that if we don't raise the debt ceiling that the economy is going
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:54.400]  to collapse as if our prosperity depends on ever increasing debt when it's the opposite what we
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:58.880]  really need is to shut down the government to stop borrowing money so that we can free up
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:04.000]  the country but yeah you're right i mean they you know this is going to be very difficult i do fear
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:10.160]  that the situation that they are going to produce could lead to civil unrest it could lead uh to
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:16.560]  martial law it could lead to price controls uh with runaway inflation and shortages of basic
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.120]  necessities like food and energy and yeah i know what is the government going to be doing with all
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:28.720]  that ammunition peter uh in closing here i wanted to bring up what the imf's head just said the
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.880]  financial times of london this morning that they're facing an epic scale challenge and worldwide
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.920]  decline in growth her answer of course is more government more taxes more regulations than she's
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:46.800]  exempt from those taxes famously under EU rules what is she getting at there well this is what
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:51.440]  this is what governments do this is what the status do they they they inject themselves
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:57.760]  into the free market they screw things up and now you have problems and now they say you see
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.960]  capitalism doesn't work we need more government because capitalism has failed because we have
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.160]  all these problems and they don't accept responsibility for having caused those problems
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.520]  the real solution is to unwind government's involvement in the free market so the free
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.560]  market can fix the problems that the government created that's what the free market does it improves
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:24.480]  the standard of living for everybody it increases the abundance of of resources and consumer goods
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.360]  it you know it it raises our standard and that's a historical fact but i've had communist and
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.480]  socialist and government people tell me point blank they know that privately but they want
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.440]  control winter people can understand these aren't bleeding heart well meaning liberals and neocons
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:44.080]  that work with them these are people that see their empire growing through government they're
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:51.520]  gangsters they're not producers that's the problem is freedom and capitalism appeals to your intellect
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:59.040]  what the snake oil salesmen are peddling from the left socialism appeals to greed and envy
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:04.720]  emotion they tug at your heart strings that's what it's all about but anybody that stops and
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:11.840]  think anybody that can rationally analyze what's going on understands where wealth is coming from
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:17.840]  and and what destroys wealth what where the roadblocks to prosperity come from but unfortunately
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  yes you are there are people that want power and the easy path to power is to promise something
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.280]  for nothing and blame the greedy capitalist for everybody's problems because they know
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.960]  that's the easiest way to get at that voters emotions get it as greed get it as envy tug at
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:39.760]  his heart strings and get elected and it's it's a difficult message because the the conservatives
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:45.120]  the libertarians they have to win the minds of the voters and that's a lot more difficult uh
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.560]  than than their emotion you're right uh shift radio dot com uh peter schiff uh economist
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.640]  joins us very accurate with his predictions being laughed at but he noticed he was smiling
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:58.400]  there in those interviews because he knew the fix was down we got about 45 seconds left let me
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:04.000]  ask you this are we in a deep global recession or or is it really a depression and is it getting
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.840]  worse well i think the us has been in depression or recession the entirety of the obama presidency
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.080]  i think it's going to be a depression but it's not going to be global i think when the dollar
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.520]  collapses and the rest of the world stops wasting all their resources propping up our economy buying
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:25.040]  our debt selling us products that we can't pay for i think you're gonna have a global economic boom
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.840]  outside the united states i just hope one day we're smart enough to join in on it by adopting
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:35.600]  i agree market principles i agree is this the end of the american empire then well i think
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:42.240]  temporarily yes is it the end forever i hope not i hope we can reclaim our former glory but to do
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:46.640]  that we're gonna have to reclaim the values that we abandon and those are the ones that the founding
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:51.440]  fathers wrote into our constitution not the ones that we're following now an empire of liberty
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.360]  and ideas not a force god bless you thank you peter sheff will be right back with breaking news

[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:57.440]  of organic food 20 years ago tiny little shops incredibly expensive because there wasn't a big
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:05.920]  supply chain now it has in all the studies supplanted gmo food unless it's school lunches or
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:11.760]  fast food but even in the grocery stores organic food or slightly organic that kind of got it
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:19.280]  watered down is supplanting inorganic and gmo because people started buying the organic it
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:26.240]  built up a system it allowed more competition it brought more money in for infrastructure and now

[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:40.880]  i know i marveled in the first hour about the sad death of a woman who even if you
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.600]  believe their story was mentally ill put on psychotropic drugs they're saying
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.760]  which in the insert makes you act more erratic more crazy more out of control
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:58.000]  merriam carry nice good-looking it's like a sweet lady to me dental hi jenice uh and she's dead
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:05.280]  she's dead with her as three-year-old child watching and um we we broke the news last night
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:12.240]  it's scrolled off the page at m4wars.com by don salazar we probably reposted on the front page
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.800]  there were army and marine corps checkpoints in the area right where this happened in a drill
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.560]  and they've now changed their story and said she didn't ram the white house she she rammed a checkpoint
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:29.440]  didn't shoot cops didn't run over cops cops ran over the barricades cops did all that and you
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:36.480]  watch these videos the cops are just driving like they're robots and just ram into stuff like like
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:42.720]  they're kamikazes or something they just they just run right into barricades because they've set up
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.840]  little martial law bear they've always like it's a third world country barricaded around the imperial
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.720]  palace and the capital but now they're expanding them out and got troops everywhere and this woman's
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:02:00.320]  like uh and and bump something to get scared and those drugs will make you have panic attacks and
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:06.800]  she runs off and then they kill her people like well she was dangerous well why didn't you they
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.160]  came up when she was doing the roundabout and aimed guns at her people panic especially women
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:19.120]  i mean most most men uh you've got cops wanted guns at them men would freeze because men have
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:23.520]  less connections between and studies show this when the left and right hemisphere is the brain
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.040]  that's why you put men in combat men still panic by the way in combat and it's called shell shock
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.960]  there's a lot of different terms for it and they get those guys out of the military boot camps
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:38.800]  meant to stress people to find those folks that can't handle stress most combat reporters the
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:42.960]  first time they actually really get shot at or see somebody shot start throwing up crying
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:48.320]  keep urinating on themselves begging to be taken back to mommy uh things like that
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:53.680]  and most women just from what i've seen in life and and crime footage i've seen
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:57.520]  if somebody starts pointing a gun at them or whatever and they're in a car and feel secure
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:02.320]  like they can get away they're gonna run or a woman will just start groveling on the ground if they
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:08.160]  think they can't get away and so she was just totally panicking totally scared she'd already run
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.760]  into a checkpoint and had already been through a lot with crazy cops chasing her at 90 miles an hour
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:18.560]  pointing guns right at her in the window and she had a panic attack it's very clear she was on
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.960]  medications they're telling everybody to take that on record do that to you and it is just so
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:31.760]  incredibly sad that she's dead now and then instead of saying it's tragic but she obviously was
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:37.200]  disturbed and could have endangered someone that that i would have said well in the heat of the
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:43.040]  moment the adrenaline she's driving around i could see why she got shot it's too bad um
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:50.160]  but no it's their heroes and this woman's evil and let's go try to find her links to her in
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.560]  anti-government they even admit we went and looked for anti-government well they would have loved it
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.920]  she's probably the small percentage of the population that doesn't visit mfallwars.com
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:06.160]  if she would have visited worldnetdaily.com or drudgerport.com or a libertarian magazine
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.360]  had been found at their house like one of the czarnev brothers you would have never heard the end
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:18.160]  of it but unfortunately the current there in hardford kinetic had had to report no weapons or
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.840]  anti-government items in stamford condo of woman killed in washington chase well if there would
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.800]  have been it would have been okay then because you know if you're anti-government you're a terrorist
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:36.160]  that's why the founding fathers wouldn't be welcome in today's military according to the pentagon
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:41.520]  because it's not our military it's goldman sacks jp morgan bank of england boondest bank new world

[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:16.320]  repulsive news uh being reported by bright martin others is that jerry brown has come out publicly
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:21.120]  and said he that that giving illegals driver's license is so they can vote and is so they can
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:27.520]  just legalize them all 700 plus million latin americans who if they get government funding will
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.560]  vote to take my guns and i've got to pay for it this is just slavery the democratic party just
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.520]  brings people in to vote to make me their slave it'll be like france soon with a hundred percent
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:44.480]  taxes if you work and then you just live in your business and sleep on a cot or you go be homeless
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:48.560]  or you go on it'll finally collapse i mean i just don't even know what to say
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:54.480]  and now they're reporting a border patrol rep claims agents being ordered to stand down well
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:58.080]  that's come out for years that that's going on meanwhile the border patrols aren't allowed to
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:03.520]  stop illegals they're only allowed to have predator drones uh to from the military base are now

[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:16.080]  going on dealing with that new american magazine uh reports uh so that's some of the news on that
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:21.840]  front shifting years over to the middle east libya in chaos two years after nato's humanitarian
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:28.560]  liberation putting al-qaeda uh in charge also diplomats have now gone public rt reports
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:34.240]  shoddy backed black op team uh behind demascus kim weapons attack yeah that came out on record
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:40.080]  bandar bush brags about it he's quite proud of it uh continuing syrian chemical weapons dismantlement
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.000]  to start next week uh but the russians are saying okay they'll they'll turn over their
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.560]  legal chemical weapons to us but will you please stop funding al-qaeda uh to attack the country
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:59.840]  so that is some of the news uh on the international front again the video is up on info wars dot
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:05.440]  com and it's also the middle column of drudge report dot com obama supporters don't know
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:10.800]  what party obama is affiliated with we played this clip earlier i want to ask dr pacinic
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:17.360]  about this as a psychiatrist undoubtedly the the iqs are lowering the public is is physically
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:22.720]  getting stupider not just not just their upbringing not just their their nurture but their nature
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:29.280]  what is happening and and and what will these hordes of miscreants do to those of us that produce
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:37.680]  continuing uh here with uh some of the other news that we need to get to obama's economic
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:43.600]  advisor there's a video of this up on our website prison planet dot com obama economic advisor says
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:51.840]  astronomical debt is constitutional and of course obama says raising the debt is not raising the
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:58.800]  debt i mean we've actually entered through the looking glass into an alice in wonderland type
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:04.640]  scenario ladies and gentlemen it is it is really really getting bizarre we're about to go to dr
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:12.800]  steve pacinic as soon as we get him on the line uh and and then we'll break all of this through
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.320]  the looking glass down with him because i didn't get him on as he's a psychiatrist today i got him
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:21.120]  on because of his government background and his knowledge of geopolitics but man i tell you
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:25.920]  just look at it this the public's acting squarely all over and i've talked to a lot of executives a
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:30.960]  lot of medical doctors a lot of people that deal with the public they say it's not just me seeing
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:37.360]  this through the media watching the news and studying it but it's it's it's happening we're
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:43.760]  seeing a madness in society because things are so unnatural the government's above the law now
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.840]  and that really screws people up we'll get dr pacinics expert take on that in a moment

[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.640]  with us for the next 45 minutes and we'll get into the Navy yard shooting and from his sources what
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.040]  he's saying is really behind that and the evidence it's a false flag we'll do that in the next segment
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:18.800]  we'll also get into other geopolitical things that are happening get his unique perspective
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:26.320]  again he's a top Harvard psychiatrist and also was an officer in the Navy before that
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:32.000]  and he also has a medical degree as well he's the former head of psychological warfare
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.640]  for the State Department and ran the Camp David Accords and is credited with getting the only
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:41.440]  successful peace deal really in history there at Camp David's he's a really smart guy a top
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:49.520]  psychiatrist not a faux psychiatrist or psychologist and he joins us his website Steve Pacinic.com
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:53.920]  of course he co-authored a lot of books and wrote some of his own bestsellers with Tom Clancy and
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:59.760]  his produce TV shows and movies with Tom Clancy and others so he's a heavy hitter it really doesn't
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:03.360]  need any introduction but we have a lot of new listeners every millisecond doc I don't know
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:10.480]  if you were on hold earlier because they just dialed you up but I was breaking down the hysteria
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:17.040]  I saw with one woman who ran up to a military checkpoint we now learned a temporary checkpoints
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:22.960]  in the Capitol got scared bumped up against it didn't shoot at police didn't kill two police
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:28.080]  as they first said or wound police later we have video that we've shown a police driving
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:34.720]  straight down the road into barricades concrete barricades just mass mental illness she got so
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:39.600]  terrified of them chasing her down the road trying to run her off the road that she ran
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:44.000]  they see the little three-year-old in the car they kill her and then they have everybody running
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:52.320]  in fear for 30 minutes after the wicked flea would none pursue they go into the Capitol and
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.640]  have a standing ovation and say the police are heroes they should have said it's unfortunate her
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:01.680]  car was dangerous she was probably mentally ill disturbed you know we're sad she's dead but thank
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:08.800]  god no one else was hurt instead they said we're heroes in some weird sweating hysterical mental
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:14.400]  illness and the congress the senate looked mentally ill and i'm no doctor but i mean i know crazy
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:21.200]  people when i see them there's like a mass insanity a megalomania a a drama queening
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:26.320]  and i'm seeing it in the general public uh we're seeing crack ups increase we're seeing
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:33.440]  all sorts of nuttiness dr pacinic a do you agree with me or b i mean if you do agree
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:40.800]  where is all this going what's happening is this a collective madness like the aztecs well let me
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:48.000]  put the incident yesterday about the woman going to the white house unlike uh the navy or the new
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:56.720]  camp in my opinion having been involved with uh in the incarceration of the mentally ill who have
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:04.160]  approached the white house and the secret service has justifiably tried to calm them down or try to
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:09.840]  bring them in for mental illness i would say that yesterday's experience is a little bit different
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:17.440]  from what you portrayed it or most others i've had extensive experience uh many decades ago
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:24.080]  hospitalizing and having to hospitalize on behalf of the secret service appropriately mentally ill
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:30.400]  people who go up to the white house approach the secret service who had acted very professionally
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:36.880]  they usually approach a car or a person who uh like that woman and i don't know that specific
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:42.160]  woman but other cases where people would come up in the car they would approach the white house and
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:47.840]  before you knew it the secret service would appropriately talk to the individual and then
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:53.520]  you'd find out that they had guns in the back of a car and the secret service band would whisk them
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:19:00.640]  away to my unit maximum security at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington DC i think that occasion
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:06.640]  yesterday was very similar to the cases that i have had and had to treat in conjunction with the
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:14.160]  secret service way before we had obama or any other president going back 30 or 40 years it's a very
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:20.960]  difficult situation when you see a person whether a woman or a man whoever it be comes up to the
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:28.640]  white house drives up there with a car intends to uh break through the barricade and i know the secret
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:34.320]  service to be very professional in those cases and they try to talk the person down they don't
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:39.920]  immediately shoot at them they don't immediately target the individual that individual for whatever
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:46.320]  reason ran and she was let's assume mentally ill i would assume that given the nature of her escape
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:53.760]  went to the Capitol Hill and then ram various elements of the Capitol Hill police so that case
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:59.200]  was normally if they apprehended her and she was not shot and somebody was not hurt she would have
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:05.840]  been taken immediately St. Elizabeth's Hospital a federal institution in those days when i was there
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:11.520]  under a military control of public health service control and would have been put in maximum security
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:18.800]  so alex i've had uh prisoners who've been or a mentally ill patient who have been to the white
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:25.600]  house and wanted to see the president's way before uh bush or or or no no we have them we have them
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:30.160]  come to the office to see the president and we're fully armed and the secret service handled them
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:36.480]  very well and would very sensitively bring them over to St. Elizabeth's Hospital where we would
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:42.320]  keep them in for 15 years because they were always a potential danger so that's very different
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:48.560]  from a false flag like the Navy Yard which i think is a false flag or new town and the reason i say
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:53.760]  that is because the chief of police lanyard who's very uh professional the head of the
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:59.280]  metropolitan police said the first thing in a case like that yesterday she said there's a gag order
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:05.680]  in effect she said we can't talk about who was involved what happened and the investigation
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:11.520]  that did not occur in the Navy Yard or Newtown when you have an immediate gag order that's a
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:18.320]  federal prosecutorial involvement the law comes in very quickly and that means that you cannot
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:22.240]  even discuss that exactly that's another tell-tale when they do whatever they want that it's a
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:27.360]  staged event i agree with you and i know that the police not shooting her at first did show restraint
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:34.960]  i'm talking about a nation that faced down the soviet union and nuclear war and you know a
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:42.080]  nation that fought off 500 000 or a million chinese and in in korea groveling in fear and congress
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:48.800]  people shaking and and and literally freaking out over the image of a woman driving in circles
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:53.680]  and bumping a few police i'm talking about land of the free home of the brave
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:59.280]  what is the state of the mental psychology okay let me let me let me you know you always bring me
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:03.360]  on the show and i'm always grateful to be on it but you know you bring me on to bring another
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:09.520]  perspective first of all we are the land of the free and the brave but we did not do very well in
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:16.000]  korea uh one of the things that you have to remember we went into korea on a panic and truman
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:22.320]  did that very much as obama went into afghanistan without the permission or really the agreement
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:30.080]  of congress we went in as a quote uh a protective detail under the u and austria it was a disaster
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:35.920]  and if there were no no under general mccarcer sure sure alex if they weren't for president
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:43.040]  eisenhower who had been general and edith facture and a major major military commander and the best
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:50.960]  of american politics he stopped the war in korea now let me get back to obama the nature of obama
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:57.040]  and the nature of what you're talking about is a very different issue we have an ongoing fear
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:03.920]  situation and part of it i will attribute to the nature and personality of the president himself
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:12.720]  obama came up with actually no resume no legitimacy that would accord him the right to be anything
[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:18.720]  either a senator or professor university chicago or anything other than the fact that he had a
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:25.040]  background history of his parents and grandparents being in the cia and he had worked for those who
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:32.560]  had been in the cia that's all i can tell you secondly he has created a scenario of fear and
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:37.920]  intimidation which quite frankly alex is what you're trying to get to and i was trying to get to and
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:45.440]  that was saying i have to go back into the history of all the president i had served bush reagan
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:54.480]  carter for even nixon i have never seen such fear and intimidation created by one president and one
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:24:00.640]  administration as i have by obama and i had to resort to another person and you may be a little
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:06.320]  bit surprised and your audience may not remember who i'm talking about and i went back to a junior
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:12.640]  senator which obama was from illinois but this just senator was in the 1950s and you may not
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:17.280]  have been born then because you were too young but i remember him very well and his name was
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:23.440]  eugene mccarthy oh yes and one of the things that i think your audience has to remember look up eugene
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:32.160]  mccarthy was he was a junior senator from wyoming i believe or or uh wisconsin i'm sorry it was
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:39.040]  wisconsin who intimidated everybody in the military the intelligence community the state department
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:45.920]  the domestic our library of congress our teachers and accused them all of being communist when in
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:51.440]  fact they weren't communists when in fact there was no evidence and unfortunately generalizing
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:58.560]  how it didn't do anything until some of our generals who were major generals uh who had been
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:04.960]  major heroes in our war like world war two general robert wicker who was a major hero and was wounded
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:11.680]  and was abused by mccarthy in front of a whole nation and then finally a man by the name of
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:18.880]  walsh from uh boston a prosecutor and a famous lawyer said have you no shame and finally mccarthy
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:26.000]  was thrown out and isaac now had to act no one has stood up to this president and has said to him
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:32.560]  have you no shame have you no shame that you created a full scenario in newtown in order
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:38.480]  to get gun control have you no shame that you created an unemployment scenario the likes of
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:45.440]  which we've never seen before have you no shame that you created a nonsensical osama ben laden
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:53.280]  assault and then allowed the cia to create zero doc 30 by captain bigelow a false and nonsensical
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:59.360]  film and have you no shame that there was nobody killed in newtown it has never happened and as
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:06.320]  a result of all of these false flags and intimidation i now accuse the president of the united states
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:15.040]  obama of being the new democratic mccarthy and along with his henchmen harry reid and diane
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:21.440]  feinstein and nancy polosi and also the republicans you have the extreme elements like ted bruise
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:28.640]  who's born in calgary and assumes that he could be can then assume the mantle of american presidency
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:36.160]  no this cuban born or a canadian born son of a cuban exile who worked for fidel castro
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:43.760]  can never be president united states nor can marco rubio nor coran paul so the answer is in a time
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:49.840]  of fear and intimidation where are these young leaders where are the people who have some integrity
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:56.160]  some commitment to having served our government in the military not in the political arena and
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:02.480]  given them themselves to our country and built their own company i don't see that honestly and
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:09.760]  that's what you're talking about obama will continue to create that fear and intimidation
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:15.280]  until the debt ceiling and i will tell you one thing more than anything else in the world more
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.800]  than any issue of national security either domestically or any false flag that he's pulled
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:27.200]  and he's pulled a few of them the biggest issue will be if we foreclose or we do not
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:35.120]  uh basically pay our debt and we do not increase the debt ceiling the reason is horrendous what
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:42.480]  will happen is america will default on a debt and it will drive our currency down to zero every
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:48.400]  billionaire will be a pauper and every pauper will be exactly what they were a pauper in our
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.320]  economy and the full faith and credit of the american government is gone so this fear is
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:28:00.000]  getting played out in a tricky game between the republicans on the extreme side who have
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.640]  really no legitimacy of doing anything other than expand some rhetoric and bombast it while
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:12.240]  the democrats have done nothing but we have a president who doesn't know how to deal with
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:18.480]  the opposite side i give credit to bill clinton on many things i disagree with sure sure dr
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:25.440]  bachanic the talk to the opposite side has been quite formidable as was lbj as was the republican
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:33.120]  reagan who worked with you with uh you know uh o'neill so we don't have a president who really
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:40.000]  functions as a world leader or as a national leader or as a healer we have a demagogue who's
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:47.840]  really in the picture of a McCarthy using fear intimidation of false flags someone will have
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:54.720]  to stand up besides myself to say have you no shame as the president stop cease and decide
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:01.440]  and that's why you have the unique opportunity alice to say to your audience this is what's
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:08.000]  happening today and we're coming into an economic crisis that really will determine the outcome
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.960]  of where america sure sure dr bachanic we got to go to break your already skipped one and it's
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:16.480]  it's just killing the network uh because this information is so important and i agree with you
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:22.560]  but i've studied joseph mccarthy from wisconsin he really believed what he was doing was good
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.360]  but he that they did use it to persecute people and bring in another form of kind of right wing
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:32.560]  tyranny so i agree with you it was bad in the final equation but obama is far worse saying the
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:38.560]  founding fathers aren't welcome in our military and saying veterans are the main enemy and you
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:44.640]  didn't build your business and increasing the debt doesn't increase the debt and they have msnbc
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:51.680]  say i'm behind the boston bombing i mean they are real hardcore authoritarians we're on the march
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:56.960]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:07.120]  alex jones here and i want to tell you about a long time friend of the show my patreon supply
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:13.440]  as you might remember this is the company that stood up to the dhs and exposed fema secret plan
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:19.600]  to begin hoarding emergency survival food it has always been my belief that it's key to stand
[02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:25.440]  behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots my patriot supply
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:31.680]  brings us their exclusive patriot pantry brand along with many other fine preparedness products

[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:50.560]  mind okay so what dr. botanic was getting to earlier a psychiatrist and government insider best-selling
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:57.040]  author is the fear the state of fear i mean i sent reporters for the nsa to their front gate
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:03.920]  yesterday we had live feeds of it here video feeds and the police and military literally could
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:09.120]  were like catching their breath and couldn't talk that someone would dare come to the gate
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:13.680]  and asked to talk to their public information officer about the illegal spying going on inside
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:20.320]  against obama's political enemies and all of it it was just so unthinkable that in land of the free
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:27.360]  home of the brave the police and military were going to you're not following my orders because
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:34.000]  we knew the law and it's this fear they're so afraid and police they have the studies out think
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.440]  they're all about to be killed even though their number one cause of death is automobile accident
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:42.960]  or training exercises training incidents and so he was getting into the state of fear and i agree
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:50.000]  with what he said they have so hyped the fear that now you can't wear an nra shirt to school just
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.440]  that says nra or they kick you out uh or if you write an essay about hunting with your dad they
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:01.680]  arrest you there's no law but they still do it it's authoritarianism under political correctness
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:07.520]  and they know what they're doing and i heard obama wanted to come in and be a dictator and all
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:11.360]  this stuff i didn't buy it six years ago i said i know he's really bad they're gonna try to sell
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:17.040]  tyranny as trendy but he really is i mean they really a month ago was judicial watch as you know
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:22.080]  we've got dr poshennick's take on this got the documents where they teach everybody in the army
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:28.720]  now in the new manuals that the founders are bad it actually says they wouldn't be welcome in today's
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:36.000]  army i mean that's so absurdist george washington founded the u.s army it just shows we're really
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:42.160]  occupied by a bunch of corporate special interest that that want to extinct american liberty and
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:48.480]  american exceptionalism and who are turning us into a domesticated nanny state so as a smart
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:55.920]  guy dr poshennick how do we reverse this i mean why are they so bold let me ask you the question
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:02.640]  why is msnbc i don't know if you saw it another saying quote alex jones is deeply racist close
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:09.760]  quote alex jones is behind the boston bombing i my lawyer said i could sue and win but i i think
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:15.520]  it discredits them i mean what's happening with these people go ahead what's happening alex alex
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:24.640]  you and i know that you have been very effective in counter punching uh the mainstream media that's
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:31.840]  been buying up most of the stories from the any administration but the point here alex is and
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:36.720]  it would all be respect to you as you and i know we go back 10 12 years and to your audience
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:42.560]  what you don't want to do is play the fear game i mean alex jones is not behind any uh
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:50.000]  covert operations alex jones is not behind any nefarious deed you are practicing your first
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  amendment right the issue though with the nsa and let me give your audience a little break here
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.720]  you know i have been concerned about the surveillance program but i do know some of the
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:08.640]  issues and personnel involved so let me give you a more a little fresh air here and a breath
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:14.880]  so the audience doesn't get fearful you may have sent people to the nsa front door but the truth of
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:20.080]  the matter is that most of your audience the americans had watched only three days ago which i'm
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:27.040]  sure most americans did not watch the tenet hearings that were run by lehi and and senator
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:33.120]  grassley and senator whitehouse all of them were really quite uh sophisticated and asked the same
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:39.840]  question as you did in a very professional sophisticated manner they asked that james
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:45.200]  clapper the director of national intelligence who's been criticized and general keith alex
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.480]  xander who's the head of the national security agency in hydro cyber command what are the issues
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:57.360]  involved in why are you tracking specific phone numbers the united states and i will say that because
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:03.840]  of your show and because of the people who listen to your show these representatives have been very
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:10.480]  effective in asking those very questions that you said to both james clapper and keith alexander
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:16.640]  and in turn both of those gentlemen answered the questions and admitted they made mistakes
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:23.840]  they admitted that they had an inadvertently picked up nine to twelve uh illegal uh calls
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:30.000]  general keith alexander whom i know is a very conscientious very professional intelligent
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:38.560]  uh head and james clapper was you know reprimanded before but he was very articulate the person who
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:45.360]  was not articulate and came back with fear and totally inappropriate was an 80 year old wicked
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:50.720]  witch from the west named diane feinstein who shocked everybody in the room and even me when
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:56.080]  she said oh well you know i remember when george can had 10 years ago told me about
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:05.840]  an impending uh uh attack in july of 2001 and and it happened three months later who in god's
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.960]  name needed diane feinstein she should have been thrown out she should have been voted out
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:16.720]  that's the job of the american people but the american people thanks to you and others have
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:24.720]  voted in people like lehi grasley whitehouse and have put controls on the shift of power
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:31.200]  towards the executive branch and have forced these people to answer questions general keith alexander
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:38.640]  answered everything he had to answer and went back to feiza in turn uh chief justice robbrooks
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:45.680]  was uh criticized by me and others for appointing 10 11 judges all of whom were republicans and male
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:51.920]  and all of whom had the similar opinion well when they were reprimanded by the american people
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.520]  and the legislators guess what chief justice roberts changed and he put in people who at
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:03.520]  countervailing news so i want to offer to your audience and to you and thanks to you alex oh
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:08.720]  please stop saying me for them for the audience to say you know we're going to write to our congressman
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:14.640]  and senators and if you don't like them then i like diane feinstein or nancy bolosi or marco
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:21.840]  rubio or dead crews who are totally not appropriate get people in there who are functional who are
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:29.360]  evaluated who are serious who can create legislation and implement it that's the job of the american
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:34.800]  people i don't believe it totally dumbed down i believe that there's too much fear and all you
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:40.880]  have to say is what you said alex it's enough and guys like me and you have to say you know what the
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:47.360]  american public has a job to continuously press on their legislators to press on the executive
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:52.880]  branch to say we don't need this we don't need nine thousand people in the state department we don't
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:59.920]  need uh 90 billion dollars of communications to booze out and i don't need amazon dot com to get
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:06.880]  600 million for for uh security internet security but that's the job the american people yeah well
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.400]  these private interests are making themselves government getting the contracts but let's let's
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:15.520]  shift yours on why you're here and i appreciate you getting off into the nsa let's but i gotta ask
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:20.000]  why are you mad at ted cruz i really like what he's doing but but i don't want to digress i'll tell
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:27.600]  you why i'm cuban i'm born in cuba i fought castro ted cruz did not fight castro he's born in
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:34.320]  calgary canada he's a demagogue his father's a demagogue if you listen to his father's ranting
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:42.720]  and raising this is a father who not only fought but also worked with he dealt castro and then
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:48.720]  claimed he was disappointed and came back in 1979 and was disillusioned what are you talking to me
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:55.280]  about bombastic cuban exiles who come back and then go to calgary canada no i know your family
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:01.600]  had to play cuba i understand all that to the oil business and tell me a cuban who had to fight
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:08.400]  castro who never said a word about it and telling me in the american public that he's an american
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:14.240]  who's going to be a president first of all he's canadian secondly he has never served our country
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:21.920]  thirdly his bombastic rhetoric has not served the purpose of the nation state the fact that cruz
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:27.840]  and others can shoot their mouths off and may have had a cuban or hispanic heritage is not
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:33.760]  constitute the grounds for election it's the same way we say we picked obama because he's black
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:38.720]  but we're going to pick hillary because she's a woman that is not sufficient and necessary
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.800]  to be president of the united states well i like a filibuster but let's get into the navy yard
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:48.480]  because that's where you've got bomb shell info it is a false flag it's very simple because when
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:54.080]  you have a diagnosis and you don't have a gag order and you have the name of a person beforehand
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:59.360]  whose name is you know beginning with two a i mean you already know this thing doesn't make
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:05.280]  any sense in contrast to yesterday where there was a gag order very immediately you saw the chase
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:11.360]  you saw the consequence but under the navy order what you have here again is fear and what happened
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:16.400]  here let's look at the overall picture why do they create a stand and a false flag in the navy
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:22.080]  yard because you have a cno chief of naval operations thanks jennon jonathan greener
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:26.560]  who's nothing more than a protégé of another chief of naval operations who did nothing but
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:33.040]  false flags and false stories admiral mullen who wanted to make the field team six look great
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:39.520]  well he failed he failed because the navy has a real problem they don't belong within our force
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.560]  structure we really don't know where the navy belongs when the army is on the ground that's
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:49.680]  boots on the ground and we have an air force that basically can do everything the navy does
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:55.520]  with missiles and with drones and we don't need aircraft carriers we don't need destroyers we
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:00.560]  don't need littoral ships and by the way the only thing we might need is the submarine and he's a
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:08.560]  submarine commander furthermore general admiral greener was reprimanded again by a us senator
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:15.440]  call levin for having spores spent billions of dollars of wasted money on construction that we
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:22.320]  don't need i go back to our legislators you have to go back to hit them and and they're the one
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:26.800]  sure sure but go over it because they ordered the stand down of the swat team the atf's not
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:31.520]  allowed in is the whole thing looks very fake to me i agree with you and the timing was the
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:37.200]  sequestration but explain how that false flag works to a layperson out there the flag is the
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.800]  following you create an incident that didn't exist and you immediately create a narrative
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:48.320]  that's where alex and i agree the narrative begins with oh we know who the person is well
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:52.480]  that's amazing and you know the person not only do we know everything about the person
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:58.880]  but we know his diagnosis he's psychotic he's delusional he was hearing uh he had uh he was
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:04.720]  listening to microwave and at the same time he won two awards while he was the reservist
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:11.680]  in the navy uh one for terrorism and one for combat all of which is inconsistent in a narrative
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:16.960]  it doesn't even work in fiction so when he's too old to start going crazy like this and at the same
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:21.920]  time as you know uh you know claiming he's schizophrenic or whatever at the same time they
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:27.200]  doesn't work correct but i mean plus the order the swat team to stand down but also the police
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:32.480]  reportedly came out multiple times with him saying they're after him in a hotel but then
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:37.520]  they let him keep his top secret security clearance that's well wasn't top secret it was secret but
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:41.760]  he would never have received the secret clearance he never would have received medals he never would
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:47.440]  have gotten the contract and the contract was with uh one of the companies that's really in
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:53.920]  trouble has been an outsourcing company and uh if you know if everybody works together it's
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:46:00.240]  the military industrial complex which has to be uh taken down and that's why we need a president
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:06.400]  who understands all of these issues and I go back to Eisenhower not because I think he's the greatest
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:11.280]  but he was one of the future presidents who understood the danger of the military industrial
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:17.120]  complex in this case this could be Aaron though the so-called attacker worked for Hewlett Packard
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:22.640]  or his subcontracted to Hewlett Packard so Hewlett Packard's in trouble he would pack it as contracts
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:28.800]  from our military and our intelligence community so does Booz Allen so does Carlisle Group these
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:34.480]  contracts have to be stopped but they have to be stopped by legislators sure sure let's talk
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:40.400]  about Syria you know uh you you knew the older Assad I think you were even arrested once there
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.440]  weren't you and then you knew the younger Assad I'm not a fan of Assad but uh I was arrested
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:50.640]  there that's correct I was held in interrogation in Bashar al-Assad but but I mean my issue is
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:55.440]  I'm not a fan of Assad but they are leaving the Christians and the Jews alone and are great compared
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:01.120]  to al-Qaeda how will the West with its narrative get away with openly arming al-Qaeda as the main
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:08.720]  force they can't uh thanks to you and others Alex the West has ceased and desist they were
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:15.600]  warned by myself and others who understood the Syrian situation that this is really a CIA intervention
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:19.920]  that didn't work and I must admit I was very disappointed with General Petraeus who thought
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:25.280]  that he could arm the so-called moderate there are no moderates in this kind of chaos and the same
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:30.720]  time Hillary Clinton who knew nothing also wanted to arm the so-called moderate and this kind of
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:36.400]  situation where we the United States created al-Qaeda al-Qaeda is fighting another group that we
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:41.360]  created the northern Syria liberation but it doesn't matter there are all kinds of acronyms and all
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:45.600]  kinds of names with different kinds of the worst you're always going to take over in a situation
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:51.840]  so the plans divide and conquer but that's not even going well no no basically what I my concern
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.640]  was from day one and I've said it on your show previously is that there are millions of Christians
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:02.880]  and there are millions of Alawis who are basically Shiites who have been uh dispossessed who have
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:09.440]  been killed the men at the Sunnis come out of homes which is funded by Saudi Arabia I can't
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:17.120]  emphasize enough our biggest nemesis in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia United Abra Abra
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:22.080]  United oh yeah by the way they've had Saudi intelligence let me ask you the biggest problems
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:27.840]  because we needed them in the past for oil as of yesterday the wall street journal correctly
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:34.560]  announced that America is a net exporter of oil and gas we don't need anybody anymore so we should
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:40.800]  let Saudi Arabia go unfortunately Israel has a relationship with Saudi Arabia Israel has
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:47.120]  a relationship with the UAE and Qatar we must stay out of the Middle East we have to shift to the
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:52.400]  east but we're still in the Middle East whereas none of those countries are really of a strategic
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:57.840]  alliance but again we have people in this administration who are not really confident
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.000]  John Kerry is not well they've sold out look at how they're letting the Chinese have Australia
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:08.720]  well Chinese are uh have spread all over the world it's not even an issue that they have
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:14.320]  Australia they have Africa they have East Africa they have West Africa they have the Middle East
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:21.680]  when I was even in Syria and in Iran a few years ago and in in Islam and Shiras in Iran
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:26.880]  they were selling products that the Iranians thought were Iranian that was cheap I said no
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:33.600]  they're Chinese Chinese came into Turkey in Burgos and basically undercut a thousand different
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:39.200]  factories and textiles the Chinese financially have been able to cut everybody but the good news
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:46.080]  is that China is really an internal problem and they have to depend on the United States contrary
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:51.840]  to what everybody believes the United States has really funded the Chinese in terms of water and
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:59.680]  food and China has a very serious internal civil unrest because in a normal year the Chinese have
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:05.920]  over 75,000 riots I think it's more like a month now they're having that but why did our I think
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:11.840]  it's evil that our system put help put Mao in power I think that was a bad mistake well
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:19.200]  well it's an interesting point Alex it's a historical mistake but it's the same way our system
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:24.880]  made mistakes John Forster-Dulles didn't understand what general still well and those of us who
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:30.640]  fought with Mao during World War II against the Japanese and Chiang Kai-check unfortunately who
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:38.080]  was as crooked and as corrupt as anybody was able to convince the American forces at that time
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:44.080]  despite the military our general saying that this was he was not a major force in defeating the
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:51.280]  Japanese but Mao was we went along and we went and supported Chiang Kai-check who then was
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:56.320]  fled and went into Taiwan in 1940 sure sure stay there come back we gotta go to break

[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:52.000]  as well so please tell your friends and family to tune in defeating this tyranny is about informing

[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:05.200]  instead of a culture of collectivism and corruption and domestic militarism as they try to convert us
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:13.840]  to some type of weird hermit state in closing dr steve picinic steve picinic dot com um thank you
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:18.160]  for coming on with us we got about four or five minutes other points you'd like to add about the
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:24.400]  state of the world the state of our republic the state of obama i think obama has he is really
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:29.680]  rotting like a dead fish politically now but i'm worried about what he may pull i just sense the
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:35.840]  only thing they've got left is big false flags but all those narratives degenerate now cyhur says
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:42.720]  obama staging false flags what are they gonna do well the key element for all of this and this is
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:48.480]  why your audience is so important why you're important is the fact they cannot default on the
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:55.120]  debt ceiling that is the most crucial element the most important thing we add right now in terms of
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:02.160]  national security and the viability of the republic the fate of fall that means the good faith and
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:08.240]  credit of the united states government that's irrespective of obama has gone down the dollar
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:15.440]  would be worth nothing we will literally be the last of a nation of a great nation and that could
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:21.200]  not happen but unfortunately we're playing this tricky game between republicans and democrats
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  and we really have to open up the political culture system as you said the more parties
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.040]  we have to create different parties i thought the tea party would become more independent
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:40.160]  less radical more instructive more uh the comprehensive and then we need more pragmatic
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:46.080]  parties it's enough these two parties republican democrats are really not in all that different
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:52.480]  it's just a game that goes on in the media but we do really need the beginnings of a discussion
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:58.640]  starting with social media at the ground level which you have instigated and others to talk about
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:05.040]  you know grassroots politics building it up have a pragmatic independent party that's not affiliated
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:11.120]  with these nonsensical ideological concepts resorting back to historical perspectives that
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:16.800]  no one really understands if we go back to our founding fathers first of all our founding fathers
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:23.920]  were not christians in the screws sense of the word they were deists they did not believe in the
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:29.360]  notion of putting god in our country this is going to be very shocking to most of them most of them
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:35.680]  were members of the masonic lodge even george washington if you go back to his history what
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:44.160]  dad of the prayers in in in a fiscal uh churches uh ben franklin james madison thomas jefferson
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:50.400]  all were very clear they would be if but the point of fact was their influences were montes
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.640]  you they were french revolutionary they had an idea that our country would come with a give and
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:04.960]  take of discussion and ideological differences but it had to be diverse it had to be a constructive
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:10.640]  and it had to move our country forward in many ways we are not different from what we started
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:16.720]  with many feared that within 30 years of the revolution we didn't even have a country and
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:22.640]  andrew jackson was fearful of it we had many men well sure for our country but feared that it would
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:29.680]  not exist for example when lincoln created a war civil war there was no reason for the civil war
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:33.760]  that was a reason well doc we're out of time we're out of time we'll have to get you back on soon
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:38.480]  steve pacinic dot com george washington was definitely a christian some of them were deists
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:48.960]  though you you are correct about that
