[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.480 --> 00:31.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.880 --> 00:35.920]  we're live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide it is already
[00:35.920 --> 00:43.120]  Thursday the 22nd day of January 2015 can you believe it soon the first month of
[00:43.120 --> 00:52.320]  2015 will be dead and gone dead and gone we have Lionel former prosecutor and
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.480]  media analyst joining us for 30 minutes during the second hour today to give us
[00:57.480 --> 01:02.040]  his take on Hollywood propaganda films like American Sniper and Selma and
[01:02.040 --> 01:08.160]  what's really behind these pieces of propaganda I've seen American Sniper I
[01:08.160 --> 01:14.360]  gotta say the actor that played Chris Kyle deserves an Academy Award he acts
[01:14.360 --> 01:21.400]  and looks and behaves and tells East Texas style jokes exactly like the real
[01:21.400 --> 01:27.800]  Chris Kyle does because I'm from East Texas I mean it was frightening how
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.880]  accurate that they got it and expanding on that another film that really got it
[01:34.880 --> 01:44.920]  right describing East Texas was Joe that came out last year if you've actually
[01:44.920 --> 01:50.240]  lived in those areas and been around people they got it right they really
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.840]  got it right in that film that was shot in Bastrop you know that's not East
[01:55.840 --> 02:02.160]  Texas but it's the lost pines that when a glacier was over Texas for some reason
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.680]  it didn't knock down that little group of trees that's in central Texas that
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.840]  genetically match the trees in East Texas so they I'm kind of just going off
[02:10.840 --> 02:14.800]  on a rabbit trail you know the reason that's such an avant-garde film is that
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.960]  most the people in it were not actors they were real people hired out of the
[02:19.960 --> 02:25.680]  local area including the drunk that plays the father he's a real whinoe who
[02:25.680 --> 02:30.000]  died shortly after the film and that's why it's so powerful because it's not an
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.600]  actor that's like the film under the skin with Scarlett Johansson when I went
[02:35.600 --> 02:39.240]  and saw it it was showing at a theater an art house theater I didn't look at a
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.000]  review I just said I want to see that science fiction movie I didn't want it
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.520]  to be spoiled for me so I didn't read a review I just went and saw it and I
[02:47.520 --> 02:50.720]  thought something's weird about this movie it's very powerful very
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.520]  disquieting and then I went and looked it up and discovered almost everyone in
[02:55.520 --> 03:01.080]  it is not an actor but they want to step further they didn't know they were in
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.920]  the movie they didn't know they were being abducted in Scotland by Scarlett
[03:06.920 --> 03:14.120]  Johansson she's simulating serial killings of men I'm spoiling it all right
[03:14.120 --> 03:17.840]  now she's a space alien it's been out for a couple years I can talk about it
[03:17.840 --> 03:22.960]  she's a space alien you don't find out to the end she's abducting men and killing
[03:22.960 --> 03:31.880]  them and the and it's real until they bring them in to kill them and they get
[03:31.880 --> 03:34.480]  them to sign waivers and stuff hey you're gonna be you know these men think
[03:34.480 --> 03:37.120]  they're being picked up to go have sex with Scarlett Johansson that's a
[03:37.120 --> 03:44.760]  Scarlett Johansson pulls up and she's picking you up it's unbelievable the
[03:44.760 --> 03:51.040]  levels that film and cinema since Hollywood lost its power it's lost a lot
[03:51.040 --> 03:54.280]  of its power and still put out big blockbusters big propaganda films and
[03:54.280 --> 03:57.880]  still have successes but not every time in fact less and less and their
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.920]  profits are down because the power of cinema is being diversified incredible
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.760]  directors out of Mexico incredible directors out of France and Spain and
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.280]  Russia and Japan I just keep seeing the best stuff out of Mexico for whatever
[04:12.280 --> 04:19.560]  reason and it's it's the films out of Scotland like under the skin with hidden
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.840]  high-deaf cameras that's the kind of movie I'd like to make about the New
[04:25.840 --> 04:29.040]  World Order and in and do outrageous things that the New World Order is
[04:29.040 --> 04:35.200]  actually doing simulate stuff like that like testing pesticides on on foster
[04:35.200 --> 04:40.000]  kids and things but make it a movie but then make it partially real without
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  hurting the kids to illustrate how horrible it is because folks would get
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.280]  upset about simulating it in a movie they don't get upset about the real
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.160]  thing there's just so many ideas out there all right I'm gonna reset here I
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.000]  kind of went off the rails I'm gonna come back with all the huge important

[08:14.000 --> 08:24.600]  GCN radio network
[08:33.440 --> 08:39.080]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live another global transmission on this
[08:39.080 --> 08:47.760]  Thursday 22nd day of January 2015 broadcast I want to open the phones up
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.760]  throughout transmission they only have one guest joining us today to look at
[08:53.760 --> 09:00.640]  Hollywood propaganda and to break that down from a prosecutor's point of view
[09:00.640 --> 09:06.720]  and in the meantime there is a ton of off-the-chart incredibly important news
[09:06.720 --> 09:10.440]  and I was sitting here before we went live trying to figure out what I think
[09:10.440 --> 09:17.220]  is the most important story out of all of these is it Monsanto earnings fall
[09:17.220 --> 09:24.360]  34% after year of global protest is it House Republicans drop controversial
[09:24.360 --> 09:29.800]  abortion bill ahead of Roe v Wade anniversary we thought that was going
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.520]  to pass yesterday in half calls Obama climate agenda a wealth redistribution
[09:35.520 --> 09:41.240]  scheme but then votes to say that climate change is real Senate votes 98 to
[09:41.240 --> 09:46.640]  one that climate change is not a hoax but Inhofe said the way they wrote it
[09:46.640 --> 09:50.640]  they just said is climate change real or not well of course climate change is
[09:50.640 --> 09:57.040]  real they didn't say man-made so they forced Republicans to vote for it to
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.800]  try to get the Keystone legislation passed that it was attached to so they
[10:01.800 --> 10:06.760]  can then run around and say Republicans agree climate change is real playing
[10:06.760 --> 10:13.020]  lawyer mind games with the public that's not paying attention because the
[10:13.020 --> 10:16.080]  public in every poll doesn't trust the government and knows we're in deep
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.120]  trouble but they still don't know the details so we're gonna talk about that
[10:21.120 --> 10:26.240]  freedom of speech Boston mayor bans bad-mouthing of Olympics at Facebook
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.720]  and Facebook says it will filter out fake news city employees are told don't
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.400]  criticize it even in your off-time British judge suspended for
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.480]  recommending straight couple to adopt a child in a battle with a gay couple
[10:42.480 --> 10:47.320]  that's like saying statistically you want parents or grandparents to get a
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.920]  child not the state they turn out better seven times on average seven times
[10:53.920 --> 11:01.960]  better they have seven times less problems drugs crime prison those numbers
[11:01.960 --> 11:05.560]  are the same as Europe same as here well you say that you're you're being you
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.400]  know anti-social worker I mean they deserve to take the kids and if you
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.760]  say hey the heterosexual statistically you know need to raise this child no
[11:14.760 --> 11:19.760]  there's a line of gay people that can't have kids and they want your kids I'm
[11:19.760 --> 11:26.240]  not saying all gay people are like this but there is a mill going on and
[11:26.240 --> 11:30.000]  there's jurisdictions around the country like Travis County in Texas it's known
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.600]  to be the place to go and they have homosexual couples moving here so that
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.960]  they can get in line to take CPS kids because other counties won't give them
[11:39.960 --> 11:47.320]  the kids and so there's an incentive to grab kids and then give them to gays
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.680]  because they can't have kids listen go get a surrogate you don't need to take
[11:53.680 --> 11:56.120]  my kids and I'm sorry this is what's going on
[11:56.120 --> 12:03.120]  heterosexuals are being preyed on this is how gangs work it's how they operate
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.600]  and everybody knows I'm not a gay basher up here you know it's not my
[12:07.600 --> 12:13.840]  cup of tea to tell people what to do in their bedrooms quite frankly it wouldn't
[12:13.840 --> 12:20.800]  be discussed here if there wasn't such totalitarianism out of the left that
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.960]  basically runs the homosexual agenda worldwide that is very anti-family and
[12:25.960 --> 12:37.880]  very very very aggressive I have a gay cousin far removed but you know nice
[12:37.880 --> 12:43.640]  person and I got invited to his birthday party once and that of at a bar
[12:43.640 --> 12:49.280]  restaurant and the gay men were in there to me and my wife talking about how
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.200]  horrible it was that we had two children we have three now and I just said
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.680]  let's leave these were aggressive mean unhappy people that were offended that
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.760]  there were I guess a few straight couples there see I wasn't wanted and
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.760]  that's fine just just just listen you hate me you hate me that I got kids you
[13:09.760 --> 13:15.160]  bought the agenda not having kids then fine don't come after my kids pretty
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.640]  simple and I'm not stereotyping here I'm talking about a large hardcore leftist
[13:20.640 --> 13:24.760]  contingent of homosexuals that everybody knows are operating like this
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.680]  worldwide and are filling up the social worker positions and the governmental
[13:28.680 --> 13:34.720]  judge positions to basically wage war on a heterosexual world that they think
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.040]  is oppressed them when you go watch movies they're based on true stories
[13:39.040 --> 13:45.120]  like the imitation game that's a true story about the gay genius that invented
[13:45.120 --> 13:50.960]  a computer to decipher the German enigma code with the ultra system he was
[13:50.960 --> 13:56.360]  persecuted he was drugged with hormone treatment and committed suicide because
[13:56.360 --> 14:02.880]  and he was arrested for being gay that's wrong I didn't do that I wasn't alive
[14:02.880 --> 14:08.120]  then so see what happens is there's this persecution complex and then the
[14:08.120 --> 14:13.560]  persecuted become the persecutors fighting a battle that isn't even going
[14:13.560 --> 14:22.320]  on in most areas of the world and but you never hear of the homosexual agenda
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.720]  the anti-family agenda the eugenics anti-population gen is really why it's
[14:26.720 --> 14:31.400]  being pushed by the establishment you never hear it criticizing I'm sure you've
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.160]  noticed what happens in Muslim countries where they behead you or chop your
[14:36.160 --> 14:41.840]  arms and legs off or burn you oh no because that would be politically
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.480]  incorrect to criticize the precious radical Islamists just like the feminist
[14:46.480 --> 14:54.920]  won't discuss any of that so that's how it works true liberalism in the Thomas
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.440]  Jeffersonian system is you can have any political view or live any way you want
[15:00.440 --> 15:03.680]  as long as you don't affect somebody else or take somebody else's rights and
[15:03.680 --> 15:10.720]  I see a lot of the talitarianism out of the so-called gay agenda and an
[15:10.720 --> 15:15.360]  anti-free speech agenda where reporters are arrested in England when they use
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.560]  the word homosexual so that's why I use that term heterosexual homosexual it's
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.760]  words themselves are not hateful like the average dumb-down person why are
[15:24.760 --> 15:30.400]  black out there thinks the word Negro is an inward it just means black in Latin
[15:30.400 --> 15:37.000]  Caucasian just means they believe whites originally developed in the Caucasus
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.720]  Caucasoid features it's not anti-white to say Caucasoid
[15:41.720 --> 15:48.720]  Caucasoid but this is the ignorance it's just like the black lady that runs the
[15:48.720 --> 15:53.240]  casino restaurant read in a book about Martin Luther King's favorite food
[15:53.240 --> 15:56.720]  collared greens and fried chicken I think that may be my favorite food as
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.120]  well it's just southern cooking folks and what it is is racist Yankees when
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.480]  blacks moved up there after the Civil War I'm not saying Yankees are bad but
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.120]  that's where it comes from they made jokes about blacks eating chicken fried
[16:10.120 --> 16:15.600]  steaks and collared greens and fried okra but then now Hollywood says it's
[16:15.600 --> 16:20.800]  the south that makes fun of black people eating watermelon and fried chicken
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.280]  that's what people eat in the south that's what I eat on the 4th of July and
[16:24.280 --> 16:27.920]  it ain't cuz I'm black it's cuz it tastes good but see this is the mental
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.720]  illness I'm talking about don't use the word homosexual don't use the word
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.560]  Negro don't use the word heterosexual that's hurtful no these are scientific
[16:37.560 --> 16:46.320]  words and a casino with a black woman managing it a black woman runs it she
[16:46.320 --> 16:51.640]  wanted to put some southern soul food out on the table and they had to
[16:51.640 --> 17:00.360]  apologize for it this is the mind control meanwhile 52% of blacks are
[17:00.360 --> 17:03.240]  never born in this country and aborted everybody knows I talk about that at
[17:03.240 --> 17:11.520]  nauseam but it's over 55 million abortions now 55
[17:12.280 --> 17:18.280]  55 million abortions we know about since Roe v Wade that's the big issue here
[17:18.280 --> 17:21.400]  and if you want to talk about black people being exterminated we've got an
[17:21.400 --> 17:27.120]  example of it coming up video of unarmed black men with hands up killed shot
[17:27.120 --> 17:33.880]  six times by New Jersey cops and they follow the police orders the cops say
[17:33.880 --> 17:39.840]  I'm gonna kill you and they shoot them and it's pretty scary I think a lot of
[17:39.840 --> 17:43.800]  this is contributing the fact that the media has hyped up a black versus cop
[17:43.800 --> 17:48.120]  agenda and innocent black people are gonna pay when scared cops shoot them but
[17:48.120 --> 17:51.360]  regardless you got to punish these officers this is this is this is very
[17:51.360 --> 17:54.960]  clear-cutting my view and we can't have an attitude where the police are just a
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.080]  hundred percent right all the time and you got a backup no matter what that will
[17:58.080 --> 18:01.840]  create the climate that's caused so much dislike of the police that people like
[18:01.840 --> 18:05.280]  George Soros are trying to capitalize on and if you want to talk about bad
[18:05.280 --> 18:08.720]  behavior of the police we're gonna play this video as well sleeping Illinois cop
[18:08.720 --> 18:14.040]  claims quote it's now illegal to record a police officer in public they've tried
[18:14.040 --> 18:18.640]  to put people in Illinois in jail for life we've interviewed the folks it's
[18:18.640 --> 18:24.600]  been on CBS news for life for filming the police on their own property they're
[18:24.600 --> 18:27.760]  claiming it's wiretapping to film someone in public and they've passed an
[18:27.760 --> 18:30.760]  Illinois law pretty much stating that now because the cops were doing it
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.720]  without a law before misappropriating another law misapplying well this law
[18:35.720 --> 18:42.080]  is unconstitutional but that's tyranny you've got cameras everywhere the police
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.080]  have got cameras with microphones how do they film you in public because there's
[18:46.080 --> 18:52.520]  no perception of privacy now you go to somebody's business and you tell them you
[18:52.520 --> 18:56.320]  want to have a closed-door meeting with them and you go behind closed doors in a
[18:56.320 --> 19:02.560]  conference room and you record somebody in most states that is not illegal 15
[19:02.560 --> 19:05.960]  states it is you got to have two-party consent it's one party consent in most
[19:05.960 --> 19:12.400]  states I think it's I think it's disreputable I think it's it's wrong
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.200]  it's usually not admissible in court but it is the first amendment right but I
[19:18.200 --> 19:22.320]  think it's a gray area when you're in somebody's house or business it's up to
[19:22.320 --> 19:26.600]  the people letting somebody in to make sure they trust them a lot of times
[19:26.600 --> 19:30.920]  people take something record this legitimate and then they try to project
[19:30.920 --> 19:36.440]  onto that something bad has gone on but to have the police all over the country
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.640]  beating people up arresting them for filming them in public is a serious crime
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.080]  and police officers that do it need to be arrested and indicted for false
[19:45.080 --> 19:49.440]  charges and official oppression that'll stop real fast this is what you see in
[19:49.440 --> 19:54.560]  North Korea not in the United States we're gonna come back and get to a bunch

[22:09.360 --> 22:12.360]  scary part is that now police officers feel like they have to form committees

[24:22.520 --> 24:26.040]  kept becoming there was there is one version where they say we walked the

[25:25.800 --> 25:29.560]  just the rise of the robots we'll get to all that in the next segment open the
[25:29.560 --> 25:33.040]  phones up but first off look at this article and I've got stacks like this
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.720]  every few days and it's not our intent to sit here and just demonize the police
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.040]  because that will then play into the role of an us against them mentality but
[25:41.040 --> 25:48.440]  the Stockton police out in California fired more than 600 rounds at SUV court
[25:48.440 --> 25:55.040]  documents now show the bank robbery suspect who supposedly had hostages they
[25:55.040 --> 26:01.840]  shot the hostage 10 times killing her I mean that's this overkill business where
[26:01.840 --> 26:06.520]  now they're all like special ops soldiers out there to fight an enemy and so a
[26:06.520 --> 26:12.640]  guy gets out of his car with his cell phone and the cops shoot him that happened
[26:12.640 --> 26:17.080]  in Austin and the cop actually got in trouble because okay you're scared you
[26:17.080 --> 26:22.920]  got a bunch of adrenaline I get it but it's this it's this it's this shoot them
[26:22.920 --> 26:27.840]  up training it's this instinctive shooting training that a lot of police
[26:27.840 --> 26:31.240]  trainers are criticizing because yeah it gets cops to where they're ready to
[26:31.240 --> 26:37.240]  shoot and and not hesitate but at the same time they'll just pull their gun
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.800]  out and shoot a gun handcuffs in the back because they're so brainwashed you
[26:40.800 --> 26:45.960]  just pull their gun instantly and shoot it's scary and you're not gunfighters at
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.800]  the okay corral is the point and we the citizens lives matter just as much as
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.360]  yours and this new video of unarmed black man with hands up killed shot six
[26:56.360 --> 27:01.040]  times by New Jersey cops we're gonna play that video on that audio right now
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.760]  unedited only bleeping the cuss words from the police New Jersey police have
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.680]  released a video of two police officers shooting and killing black man as he
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.120]  tried to get out of the car with his hands up now let's be clear we showed a
[27:14.120 --> 27:18.640]  national study just two weeks ago showing that whites and Hispanics are
[27:18.640 --> 27:25.280]  almost twice as likely to be shot by police per capita than blacks so whites
[27:25.280 --> 27:30.080]  are getting shot like this too by itchy trigger finger cops these are kind of
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.400]  like guys that go deer hunting for the first time that shoot the neighbors
[27:33.400 --> 27:39.160]  cowl because they think it's a deer and then argue they saw antlers they get
[27:39.160 --> 27:43.200]  buck fever and they get scared to death well the people you're aiming guns that
[27:43.200 --> 27:49.880]  get scared the guy put his hands up gets out of the car and they shooting and
[27:49.880 --> 27:53.040]  it's all because there was a gun when the cops got in the glove compartment
[27:53.040 --> 27:56.400]  well having a gun is not a reason to get killed and I told the story of an
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.720]  Austin cop when I was still in high school I was a senior pulled me over
[28:00.720 --> 28:05.280]  saw a weight belt the front seat pulled a gun out instantly shoved it to my head
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.880]  and said get your effing hands up get your hands up I did he goes don't move
[28:10.880 --> 28:13.560]  don't move don't move what is that what is that that's my weight belt he looks
[28:13.560 --> 28:16.160]  that looks at it all right all right well you can go you can go I'll just be
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.880]  at least he didn't shoot me or take me to jail or beat me up once his adrenaline
[28:20.880 --> 28:27.720]  got up so we're gonna play that video right now let's go ahead and go to it
[28:28.880 --> 28:37.640]  they pull over the Jaguar hey how y'all doing good hey also days brist and police
[28:37.640 --> 28:41.800]  reason I'm pulling over you went right through that stop sign back there
[28:41.800 --> 28:48.440]  right on South mine street hey you got driver's license
[28:48.440 --> 28:52.960]  can you go on and grab it for me
[28:52.960 --> 29:00.320]  no no show me your hands show me your hands show me your hands don't move don't
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.240]  move don't move get him out the car garage we got a gun in his glove
[29:05.240 --> 29:20.320]  get parking no show me your hands show me your hands don't move don't I'm gonna
[29:20.320 --> 29:26.080]  shoot you're gonna be dead I want to come back and play this unedited
[29:26.080 --> 29:29.560]  because we're going up to break but you notice it's a black police officer so
[29:29.560 --> 29:32.960]  see Al Sharpton won't be able to make a big deal out of this which I think is
[29:32.960 --> 29:38.000]  questionable I don't like the cop wanted to kill him on purpose he was scared but
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.080]  having a gun in your glove compartment should not be a death sentence but
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.960]  unfortunately Al Sharpton and towards sorrows can't cause a race riot over
[29:45.960 --> 29:53.600]  this because it's a black cop we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[34:34.400 --> 34:39.480]  sputnik calls it on December 30th of last year but the video the shooting was

[35:03.520 --> 35:10.240]  compartment and so the cop obviously gets agitated says don't move the guy
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.640]  puts his hands up and then the cop just starts yelling and screaming and he
[35:14.640 --> 35:18.640]  appears to follow his orders and then he just shoots him the other passenger the
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.360]  driver climbs out on the ground on his belly on the ground and doesn't get
[35:23.360 --> 35:28.200]  killed but I mean we don't live in Fallujah ladies and gentlemen and this is
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.040]  the problem with having militarized police I don't want to be pulled over and
[35:32.040 --> 35:35.040]  they open my glove compartment there's a gun and then the cop starts screaming and
[35:35.040 --> 35:39.040]  then just shoots me I've almost been shot in the head by an Austin police
[35:39.040 --> 35:48.280]  officer 22 years ago 23 years ago almost 24 years ago I'm about to be 41 and I
[35:48.280 --> 35:51.720]  don't hate that officer I understand he was scared of my weight belt but I
[35:51.720 --> 35:58.680]  wasn't doing anything but speeding seven miles over the speed limit and so it's
[35:58.680 --> 36:04.120]  something we got to talk about because these type of instances are up because
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.640]  of the training and I want to illustrate again this is a black cop doing
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.440]  this I'm not saying he's a bad guy I'm not saying he wanted to shoot this
[36:11.440 --> 36:16.760]  person but it just doesn't sit right that this guy's dead and okay one of the
[36:16.760 --> 36:25.040]  guys had a record okay whatever that's not a death sentence and I understand
[36:25.040 --> 36:28.520]  that it's a tough job I don't want a police officer's job especially in a
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.960]  bad area it would be terrible but if you are so scared that you're about to get
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.160]  killed that you're gonna pull the trigger and shoot an unarmed person who
[36:37.160 --> 36:40.040]  isn't going for a gun that I don't think you need to be a police officer it's
[36:40.040 --> 36:45.200]  really that simple let's go ahead and play the entire unedited video here it
[36:45.200 --> 36:59.440]  is and walk up on the car he checks the license plate hey officer days brist and police reason I'm pulling you over you went right through that stop sign back
[36:59.440 --> 37:06.080]  there right right on a south pine street hey you got driver's license
[37:06.080 --> 37:22.080]  right you want to grab for me no no show me your hands show me your hands show me your hands don't move don't move don't move
[37:22.080 --> 37:28.160]  again he opens the love compartment to get the license and registration but
[37:28.160 --> 37:38.160]  there's a gun in there
[37:38.160 --> 37:43.640]  I'm gonna shoot you and you're gonna be dead I'm telling you reach for something
[37:43.640 --> 37:49.200]  you're gonna be dead I'm telling I'm telling keep your hands right there you
[37:49.200 --> 38:07.560]  age of home you reach for something you're gonna be dead he's reaching he's reaching
[38:07.560 --> 38:12.040]  the other guys got his hands up the other guy had his hands up how would you
[38:12.040 --> 38:18.000]  not panic having the cop put a gun to your head and say that so he puts his
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.080]  hands up and comes out of the car and the cop steps back and shoots him
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.840]  panicking I mean I don't want to be pulled over by that hothead I tell you
[38:27.840 --> 38:33.960]  man what a night total liberal guaranteed I was in the gym yesterday and
[38:33.960 --> 38:36.720]  there was this woman going I'm a conservative but we've got too many
[38:36.720 --> 38:40.520]  guns and they're so dangerous and they're so scary they need to be taken and I
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.840]  just put my headphones on and because she was on the elliptical next to me
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.920]  babbling and 10 minutes later I took the headphones off to get off the
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.200]  elliptical to lift weights and she was still babbling and I've seen people that
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.680]  see a gun in the hands of a citizen they freak out the hands of a cop they
[38:56.680 --> 39:02.400]  think oh it's fine this is the fear that's why open carry and things like
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.960]  that are so important because then it desensitizes in a good way the public
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.560]  and everybody else to guns in the hands of good people but I've watched the video
[39:11.560 --> 39:18.400]  it's very clear the guy had his hands up and was you know saying come on man come
[39:18.400 --> 39:23.680]  on and they just executed him so the headline should be executed for running
[39:23.680 --> 39:28.000]  a stop sign in New Jersey you now get the death penalty you know I don't know
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.120]  my cruise view on this because I watched this video this morning on info wars
[39:31.120 --> 39:36.000]  calm I came in didn't ask him let's go to the control room here this is
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.160]  unscripted unannounced they don't know I'm going to let's go to whoever wants
[39:41.160 --> 39:47.320]  to pop in it could be Nico it could be a Joe it could be John Bowne any of the
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.080]  folks in there get a microphone give me your take on this let's go to John Bowne
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.000]  John you want to talk yeah let's turn on John Bowne's Mike we're gonna get in the
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.800]  habit here of you guys coming on air a few times a day Bowne what's your take
[40:00.800 --> 40:06.040]  on this well as you said it's blatantly like Fallujah in the streets of New
[40:06.040 --> 40:11.840]  Jersey the streets of New Jersey are very tough place to be but the guy is
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.680]  clearly getting out of the car one cop shoots him in the back the other cop
[40:16.680 --> 40:23.720]  shoots him in the front and as you said it's a buck fever yeah these guys would
[40:23.720 --> 40:27.160]  would go deer hunting with you and would end up shooting the neighbor's cow yeah
[40:27.160 --> 40:31.640]  or the barn something like that yeah for the folks that don't hunt I mean you
[40:31.640 --> 40:34.880]  take some new hunters with you this is what they do or they just get a gun in
[40:34.880 --> 40:38.240]  their hands and they start freaking out especially they've never been around
[40:38.240 --> 40:43.080]  guns I mean I was shooting Folger's cans at age four with a 410 teach me the
[40:43.080 --> 40:46.640]  power then watermelons then I was taught not to touch guns unless I was
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.520]  authorized and by I'm not bragging by age seven I could shoot the top off of a
[40:51.520 --> 40:59.440]  Tabasco bottle at 200 yards with a three-power scope with a 243 now of course
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.760]  I can't shoot like that I don't want to digress but I could shoot bulls out a
[41:03.760 --> 41:10.640]  thousand yards with a 308 Remington 700 by the time I was 14 but it's just for
[41:10.640 --> 41:16.800]  somebody immersed in gun culture it's really hard to get my mind around
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.920]  northern policing especially where they've killed the gun culture that's
[41:20.920 --> 41:24.880]  where you see much of this going on John you were raised in Kentucky now were
[41:24.880 --> 41:29.240]  you immersed in the gun culture oh yeah yeah you don't have a choice in Kentucky
[41:29.240 --> 41:36.160]  and you're you learn how to use a gun you actually a gun is no different than a
[41:36.160 --> 41:43.600]  shovel it's just a tool it scares the animals away it brings you food people
[41:43.600 --> 41:49.280]  in Kentucky are generally not afraid of guns but now we have this culture there's
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.320]  a woman on Fox News the other day saying that we need to get rid of all
[41:52.320 --> 42:00.080]  semi-automatic weapons again we we need these guns because we have the police
[42:00.080 --> 42:05.200]  acting the way they are out there if things escalate then we'll be okay
[42:05.200 --> 42:11.320]  Smith and Wesson's stock just shot up yesterday so people are are arming
[42:11.320 --> 42:16.560]  themselves out there the general public which is completely unrelated to the
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.640]  people that are in control because we are run by millionaires who are in a VIP
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.720]  club who are disconnected from the reality I would say hundred millionaires
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.640]  and billionaires if you look at the top Democrats I mean that's just a fact the
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.680]  Democrats are the top pretty much 15 people in Congress worth billions or
[42:33.680 --> 42:38.320]  hundreds of millions individually it's truly outrageous but I think a lot of
[42:38.320 --> 42:41.640]  people are getting guns not so much for the police but for the breakdown of
[42:41.640 --> 42:47.000]  society and the media is using bad actions of the police like this to
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.800]  demonize police as a whole that's the larger compendium of the manipulation I
[42:51.800 --> 42:55.760]  noticed that jacari came into the control room I'm glad he's got something he
[42:55.760 --> 43:00.840]  wants to say jacari what's your view on this well with this shooting it's pretty
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.440]  ridiculous to me because he's pulls them over he said I want your license in
[43:04.440 --> 43:09.280]  your registration so many people they put their registration in their glove
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.080]  box so guy opens his glove box trying to retrieve the registration and he happens
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.280]  to have a firearm in there and the cop completely freaks out about it you know
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.440]  so what he's supposed to do officer do you want me to get my registration to do
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.520]  you not and then the officers actions you know he completely freaks out he's not
[43:24.520 --> 43:28.800]  able to keep a calm hair you know put your hands up and there's a point in the
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.080]  video we can't really see so much but the suspect is doing but the officer like
[43:33.080 --> 43:36.240]  keep your hands up keep your hands up the guy exits the car in his shot
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.880]  multiple times for his efforts just trying to be a peaceful person that's
[43:40.880 --> 43:44.200]  right and I've had the case where I have a firearm in the glove compartment and I
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.320]  tell the police officer okay I'm gonna get you my insurance and stuff but
[43:48.320 --> 43:53.440]  there's a gun in there would you rather come around and do it and the cop just
[43:53.440 --> 43:57.440]  said no just do it slowly but that's because I was so calm and relaxed right
[43:57.440 --> 44:01.000]  that it wasn't an issue I mean I get the fact it's nighttime they're out there
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.640]  one of the guys has a criminal record on it came out on the plate they ran but
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.160]  they've got their hands up and the guy just starts freaking out the cop starts
[44:10.160 --> 44:13.960]  freaking out and I've seen plenty of white cops do this on video and shoot a
[44:13.960 --> 44:19.080]  black guy or a white guy and my sarcastic point was unfortunately they
[44:19.080 --> 44:22.120]  can't make a racial issue out of it because you know the cop initiating
[44:22.120 --> 44:27.640]  it's black but the point is it's not racial in my view in most cases it is
[44:27.640 --> 44:34.760]  hysteria it's not a racial issue it's just these guys it's the training that
[44:34.760 --> 44:38.440]  they receive it's this federalized training is these no hesitation targets
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.640]  and all the whole thing that goes along with that they're just completely
[44:41.640 --> 44:45.920]  freaked out that anybody who has a gun anybody who has a constitution anybody
[44:45.920 --> 44:49.760]  who actually knows the law better than the officers do they're just convinced
[44:49.760 --> 44:54.280]  that these people are wicked devil criminals absolutely all right jacari
[44:54.280 --> 45:00.720]  thank you anybody else in the control room I want to add some points to this
[45:02.440 --> 45:06.040]  whatever we're waiting for folks to give a comment we can play jeopardy music in
[45:06.040 --> 45:12.560]  the background that means answer the question okay also coming up senator
[45:12.560 --> 45:17.200]  Schumer sleeper cells might make bombs with household items so now if you mix
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.400]  bleach with soap to clean something why the ATF is going to be raiding you
[45:22.400 --> 45:27.000]  there's a whole new way to get in your house and everyone's a suspected
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.560]  terrorist oh my gosh I've seen corrupt police do this where they'll pull
[45:31.560 --> 45:35.320]  somebody over in taser room or kill them and then hold up jumper cables and
[45:35.320 --> 45:41.200]  say look pipe bombs we've seen that on the news repeatedly where there's this
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.720]  attempt to act like they're just terrorists everywhere making bombs that
[45:45.720 --> 45:48.720]  are going to be used on the police they told police departments for six years
[45:48.720 --> 45:55.160]  you will be hit by IEDs from veterans and gun owners in the future so when you
[45:55.160 --> 46:00.800]  start getting bombed out of the blue who's the main suspect the people that
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.880]  told you it was coming out of the blue sky who are trying to demonize the
[46:04.880 --> 46:12.320]  liberty movement the same people like George Soros trying to take unfortunate
[46:12.320 --> 46:16.480]  cases some of which I think are legitimate shootings like the brown case he
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.640]  did charge him he did attack him he did go to the hospital the witnesses came
[46:20.640 --> 46:26.720]  forward it was all made up the Zimmerman case a little bit more questionable in
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.720]  my view because you know he is falling around the neighborhood the guys got a
[46:30.720 --> 46:34.280]  right to walk around the neighborhood and buy Skittles and tear whatever but
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.200]  then the news shows him when he's 12 not when he's you know 17 and looks like
[46:38.200 --> 46:43.920]  LeBron James on steroids and then the black witnesses finally come out and
[46:43.920 --> 46:47.280]  say yeah he was on top of him banging his head in the ground and then finally
[46:47.280 --> 46:50.880]  all that comes out the Justice Department's trying to hide black against
[46:50.880 --> 46:56.320]  white in this country and they want to turn that also on the police so they
[46:56.320 --> 46:59.320]  take the brunt of anti-government sentiment instead of the people at the
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.480]  top that are running the show the same Republicans that we thought were gonna
[47:03.480 --> 47:10.440]  vote to ban partial birth abortion they didn't do it they passed the same bill
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.400]  that was killed in the Senate last year but see they could pass it in the house
[47:13.400 --> 47:19.800]  knowing it would be killed in the Senate now it would probably pass the Senate or
[47:19.800 --> 47:23.640]  force the Senate to vote for abortion they didn't want to be exposed so now
[47:23.640 --> 47:28.440]  they had a chance to ban abortion of babies that are viable outside the womb
[47:28.440 --> 47:34.880]  unequivocally human unequivocally developed viable outside the womb they
[47:34.880 --> 47:42.320]  didn't vote to do it just like they voted that climate change is real and
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.440]  said well climate change is always happening but the Democrats did this as
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.280]  a writer so they can now say why every Republican but one voted and agreed that
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.440]  climate change is real we need carbon taxes so that's all coming up I said I
[47:57.440 --> 48:01.520]  go to calls this hour but is lying along at 12 30 or is he on it the start of the
[48:01.520 --> 48:05.360]  next okay so we will open the phones up in the next hour you've heard a whole
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.320]  you've heard a whole spectrum of news so far here covered today any of these
[48:11.320 --> 48:17.120]  issues I mentioned I'd like to get your take on them I'd love to get your

[48:36.040 --> 48:40.680]  now after the break long-term use of birth control pills linked to higher
[48:40.680 --> 48:45.400]  risk of brain tumors Fox News will also get to this video of the cop in Illinois
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.360]  saying it's illegal to film me in public I mean that is a shameful and at that
[48:50.360 --> 48:55.280]  point that police officer becomes a totalitarian agent of evil and is no
[48:55.280 --> 48:58.920]  longer a police officer under the Constitution and is an enemy of the
[48:58.920 --> 49:05.480]  Republic now I don't wish any physical harm upon them but the politicians
[49:05.480 --> 49:10.960]  that passed this are the kingpins he is the enforcer in the street in my view
[49:10.960 --> 49:16.000]  carrying out a mafia edict I mean we do not live in North Korea and police are
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.920]  not God and the minute they try to make them God you know they're getting ready
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.320]  to go after your pension funds as Obama announced they're getting ready to seize

[56:04.160 --> 56:08.680]  taking certain forms of birth control over five years or more doubles the risk
[56:08.680 --> 56:12.440]  of developing a rare brain tumor a study led by Danish neurologist has found
[56:12.440 --> 56:15.680]  that's just one tumor they study the study to be published today in the
[56:15.680 --> 56:19.040]  British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology says that women who take
[56:19.040 --> 56:23.800]  hormonal contraceptives show higher rates of glaucoma a tumor that affects
[56:23.800 --> 56:30.480]  around five people in every hundred thousand let's expand out of that every
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.840]  major water supply has these birth control compounds in them and they found
[56:35.840 --> 56:41.400]  prozac derivatives in all the water in an AP investigation a decade ago they
[56:41.400 --> 56:45.560]  found in every major city they studied it was higher than what runoff could show
[56:45.560 --> 56:49.400]  and they said we don't know why and it's basically a mix of different
[56:49.400 --> 56:53.720]  certain real take inhibitors in the prozac class but there's also a base
[56:53.720 --> 56:59.640]  chlorine fluoride molecule and we don't know why it's showing up they're
[56:59.640 --> 57:06.200]  dumping it in the water I mean they put fluoride in the water that's the basis
[57:06.200 --> 57:10.600]  of prozac yes we're living in a science fiction movie boys and girls yes
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.160]  they've trojan horse all the stuff coming up women on top his most dangerous

[57:55.280 --> 58:00.160]  story here of the Washington Free Bacon NIH project studied arousal of gay men
[58:00.160 --> 58:07.760]  when using grinder I think is the name of that the National Institutes of Health
[58:07.760 --> 58:14.680]  has spent nearly half a million dollar studying gay hookup sites they awarded

[58:19.280 --> 58:24.040]  guarantee just like they used this is declassified hepatitis shots in the gay
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.760]  population to spread HIV in the 70s when they started it they use a gay
[58:27.760 --> 58:32.400]  population as a vector because of high levels of unprotected sex I bet money
[58:32.400 --> 58:35.920]  this data is being gathered to figure out how to deploy weapons to the gay

[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:28.040]  doing Alex I have a quick I have a quick comment because I heard you guys
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:31.880]  talking about this or I frantically tried to call you guys no one is really
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:35.520]  talking about all right if you want to carry a firearm and you want to drive
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:40.840]  around you have to you can't leave it a surprise where when a cop says oh can I
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:44.640]  get your registration from your glove box you go okay let me reach for my glove
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:49.400]  box where there's a gun inside you know what I mean you can't leave yet you have
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:53.320]  to tell the officer officer listen if you're carrying it you know legally you
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:57.840]  have to at least address to the officer first okay I'm gonna reach for my for my
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:02.320]  registration I do have a firearm in my glove box would you like me to show
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:07.400]  identification for it and and so on if you leave it a complete surprise yes
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:12.640]  understand these how I totally agree with you that they didn't know the quote
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:19.080]  procedure to not get shot when you have a gun by the police I mean really when
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:24.000]  you get the concealed carry you get a red carpet treatment because they know
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.600]  you've been vetted background checked gone to the training and they know that
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:31.920]  statistically the lowest crime rate out there is concealed weapons carriers
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:36.840]  nationwide in fact it's just unbelievable because your your law abiding
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:40.200]  so you're wanting to go out there and jump through the hoops even though it's
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:47.360]  unconstitutional to do it it shows the group that is in fact concealed carry in
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:53.160]  articles I've seen have a lower crime rates than off-duty police officers so
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:57.360]  that's a very very low crime rate right there the problem is is once they have
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:00.560]  get everybody to get concealed carries they can then change the concealed carry
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:04.320]  laws and turn a right into a privilege I used to be a big critic of concealed
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:08.840]  carry but now it's moving towards open carry and just the second amendment so I
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:13.000]  was somewhat wrong about concealed carry all these years I now intend to get it
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:19.080]  because it's actually evolved into more of a second amendment in most states so
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:23.520]  we're winning the fight overall it's very very exciting the problem is they're
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.160]  going to pull some big false flags to try to demonize the second amendment go
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:32.040]  ahead oh yes and I'm prepared for that because I also do have my concealed and
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:35.920]  carry and to be honest there was a story where I was driving from Florida to
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:39.760]  Georgia and me and my brother we were picking up a brand new pickup truck and
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:43.720]  we're driving in a Volkswagen that really only cost about three thousand right
[1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:50.880]  and here we are driving with $15,000 cash we have I look like I look like I'm
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:55.280]  Mexican because I'm dark so here you have people with New York accents driving
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:59.600]  from Florida with Florida police with New York accents they look dark they have
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:04.520]  $15,000 cash on them I got pulled over for tense because my tense words you
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:10.520]  dark and what happened was I was I was packing at the time and what happened
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:15.360]  was what kept me from getting shot because I saw this copy once he saw the
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:19.480]  money he he he took a step back and he was like okay what the heck is going on
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.680]  in the store and I let him know I said officer we're buying a pickup truck we
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:27.760]  have I me and and my brother and I we both have firearms on us we both have
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:32.600]  permits to carry these firearms you know well point is that you have to comply
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:35.840]  with these officers if you leave it a surprise and you leave it up to an
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:40.760]  element of surprise to these types it's gonna it's well the key is being calm
[1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:46.440]  and communicating that then deescalates and makes them not so nervous I think
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:49.440]  it's a balance though the public needs to think about how to engage the police
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:53.320]  and the police need to you know not drink too much coffee and then go out and
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:57.000]  kill people we'll be right back stay with us

[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:38.480]  down at the bottom of the hour doomsday clock set to move one minute closer to
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:42.240]  midnight we're gonna be going over that already covered this and played the clip
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:48.600]  last hour sleeping Illinois police officer says it's illegal to record a
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:53.400]  police officer in public senator Schumer says sleeper cells might make
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:59.400]  bombs with household items so now stuff under your sink maybe terrorist that is
[1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:04.920]  just some of the news up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com freedom of
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:12.680]  speech Boston mayor bans bad-mouthing of Olympics and Facebook says they will
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:18.120]  filter out what they deem to be fake news anyone I guess criticizing Zuckerberg
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:22.920]  who met with the communist Chinese last month to decide how to censor the US
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:27.240]  internet I mean that was in the news he met with them to learn how they censored
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:33.160]  and now oh that's what China says they censor what they call fake news and then
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:38.240]  they go further they arrest who they call fake news so cops are saying you
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:42.520]  can't videotape them in public and Zuckerberg wants to censor the internet
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:49.200]  does this sound like a free country so we need the good police to speak out
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:53.880]  against this and say no you do have a right to film in public and to not go
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:58.680]  along with this but it's not just the police they're at the bottom of the
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:06.200]  political room or rung we need to target politically the tyrants above them the
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:10.720]  corrupt judges the corrupt congressmen and women the
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:15.920]  legislatures the city councils the mayors we need to target them and call them
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:21.640]  out for the thugs they are they need to be sued for civil rights violation this
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:26.440]  mayor telling people you'd better not criticize telling city employees even
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  in your off time you don't criticize by voice or on your Facebook or Twitter the
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:37.720]  Olympics coming here or we'll fire you you have no free speech when you work
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.480]  for the government man that's crazy that's not a free society that's a system
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:46.440]  that wants to tell us to shut up and tell us what to do but right now let's go
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:51.360]  to your phone calls let's talk to Debbie in New Jersey Debbie you're on the
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:58.980]  air thanks for calling hey Alex thank you I am retired New York police I did
[1:10:58.980 --> 1:11:05.600]  20 years I retired in 2012 but I watched that video when I have to say I do
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:10.280]  agree with you the cops definitely overreacted but I have to say that in
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:17.320]  his defense that we are trained to you know pull the plate into headquarters
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:24.640]  and get a run back on the driver and now what not before you exit the cruise or
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:29.880]  even so they may have been given information through headquarters that
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:34.760]  the suspect what's a criminal or maybe had a warrant well that's exactly what
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:38.760]  what happened I mean they knew that one of the people had a the driver
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:43.080]  reportedly had a criminal record so they were already paranoid and I don't know
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:47.320]  why they open the glove compartment with a gun in it to get the registration out
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:51.640]  I mean obviously the cops are gonna flip out when you do that but then at that
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:55.640]  point the guy put his hands up the cop flipped out and killed him so I don't
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:58.960]  think it's premeditated murder but I mean you just can't execute people because
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:04.920]  you get scared in my view when their hands are up I agree I agree totally it
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:09.440]  was really a bad judgment call well here's the good news out of the whole
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:12.840]  sad event Al Sharpton's not gonna be able to create race riots out of this
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:17.960]  because the officer basically initiating it is black I think it's a
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:23.600]  great illustration though it's sad that this is about people being scared not
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:28.800]  about racial issues because black cops shoot white people all the time it
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:33.760]  doesn't become a big issue because there isn't a George Soros movement to hype
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.240]  it up let me ask you this question as a retired police officer what do you think
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:41.640]  about the fact that George Soros bragged last week and they released the
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:49.480]  documents that his his open society group that helped fund the overthrow of
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:55.960]  Ukraine is now openly trying to finance anti-police demonstrations I mean
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.240]  clearly he's doing that for some end game rule is he testing to see if they
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:06.840]  can start civil unrest then Obama can come in and act like a savior or what
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:11.120]  do you think the plan is because George Soros more than anybody calls the shots
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:18.880]  in the White House well I would agree that they're definitely trying to make
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:23.560]  Obama look like the Savior's Saint isn't that what every crisis has become that
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:30.760]  he runs in as the Savior let me tell you this is why I was I resigned in 2012 my
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:36.600]  uncle and a friend of mine who was a Fed both told me what was gonna happen down
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:41.840]  the line and advised me if you got your 20 in to get out before it becomes worse
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:48.520]  and that's exactly why I did it but we were told from federal sources in 2012
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:54.600]  and 13 we're on record with the Northeast intelligence group Hagman on the
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:59.360]  show also had similar sources saying that that was coming this is very
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.520]  interesting tell me specifically what your family members that were feds or
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:10.120]  our feds told you was coming three years ago I was told that Obama was gonna
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:15.960]  get reelected now when I was retiring it was around April and I said huh I don't
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:22.200]  know about that but I listened and he told me he says the militarization
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:28.000]  militarization is gonna get worse and you know you should get out now and get
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.640]  your pension before you could possibly lose it I really wasn't completely
[1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:37.800]  convinced but it scared me enough and then of course then I started listening
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:44.560]  to you and that woke my you know woke me right up did your family members that
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:49.400]  are feds did they retire or are they trying to retire now oh no some of them
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:55.280]  are still on yeah yeah some of them are still on but what did you think when
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:01.800]  family members that are feds started telling you this I was scared I got to
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:08.320]  be honest I was scared you really don't know how to handle it at first because
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:13.520]  on the job everything's quiet you're not informed as well as you think you are
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:19.200]  so when you hear it you kind of take it with a grain of salt you know I mean so
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.960]  you were compartmentalized but but now it's all unfolding they militarized the
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:28.200]  police big banks help shipping the drugs launder the money society starts to
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:32.680]  break down they have the MTV crowd promote race war and attacking police
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:37.480]  and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy then the feds at the top
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:42.480]  criticize the very police that have been militarized by them and the answer is
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:47.560]  more federalization more globalization did your family members that are feds
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:53.840]  tell you anything else they gave me a lot more information they informed me
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:58.840]  about the light bulbs the appliances all the stuff that you also talk about and
[1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:05.600]  back then this was probably around when I started hearing it around 2010 and I
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.960]  found it hard to believe but I'm I'm really glad that I did listen believe
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:14.920]  me I thought it hard to believe ten years ago in MIT publications and they
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:18.280]  said that you know the new no light bulbs are gonna interface with computers
[1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:22.240]  are gonna have data over power line and then six years ago I saw them start
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.600]  putting them in police departments and not telling the cops that that it was
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:30.560]  data over power line now they admit that they're doing it and now it's rolling
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:34.480]  out with the new TVs where they control the appliances in your house to make it
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:40.240]  a more fun you know viewing experience they're rolling it all out like it's
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:44.600]  cutesy you can just see how they're doing it and it's so Arwellian did I tell
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:53.880]  you anything else um God there was just so much that I was told about I'm sorry
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:57.720]  that my mind is a little bit of a blank but I do want to tell you about the
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:04.520]  smart meters they put one on my home down in Maryland and I had a complete fit
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:10.520]  I called them to get it taken off and they they said that the state of Maryland
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:18.400]  I have to pay a $75 fee to opt out and then $17 a month fee to not be part of
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:23.920]  the smart meter plan so they're gonna penalize you to do that as if it costs
[1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:28.880]  $17 to have a human come read it and again if it was just a wireless system
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:32.680]  just giving that data it wouldn't be an issue they admit the four companies that
[1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:36.360]  put these out of standardized a system that scans and grabs all your other
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:40.480]  wireless data it is a spy hub now we've had the victory nationwide that most
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:45.080]  states and cities have put in the opt out Austin Texas has done it as well but
[1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:49.560]  you shouldn't be penalized for the fact that they're trying to put a spy hub on
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:55.120]  your house when I said that to them they told me oh no there's nothing wrong with
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:18:00.080]  the meter it's a safe meter they even had I guess a repair guy come out and
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:04.640]  tell me how safe the meter was I said I don't care I want it off my house I mean
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:08.880]  we can argue of the high-powered Wi-Fi is bad for you but you can't argue they've
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:13.640]  been catching them all over the country using them to game how you're charged and
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:18.720]  to in some cases double charge you you always pay more they always screw you
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:23.280]  over with them but you sometimes double and then also California promised they
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:25.000]  wouldn't do it now three states are doing it
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:30.840]  clearly California they will control your thermostats during peak times and not
[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:36.280]  let you have the energy you need what do you make of that that's why I was
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:41.560]  totally against it I was floored I know exactly what you're talking about I
[1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:46.120]  don't want them controlling anything in my house if I want to keep my heat at
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:50.840]  70 that's my business absolutely well it's all part of this argument there's
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:55.160]  not enough energy we got to conserve no the model is false scarcity artificial
[1:18:55.160 --> 1:18:58.720]  scarcity they're going to cut what you get and then charge you more you're
[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:02.280]  gonna get a 200 square foot apartment and pay what a thousand foot would have
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:07.440]  been this is their own admissions screw job on top of screw job on top of screw
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:12.720]  job where we accept less telling Africans you don't get a car air conditioning
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:16.800]  not we're gonna get you a clean car and clean air conditioning no you don't get

[1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:16.000]  calls Rick and then Howard and then Riley David Josh and many others Rick from
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:20.840]  Texas you're on the air thanks for calling I'm here thanks for taking my
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:26.200]  call Alex I want to make a brief statement I felt like the the initial
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:34.320]  officer in the New Jersey case elevated or escalated the situation here in
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:39.760]  Texas and I live in the Big Bend my experience even watching police videos
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:46.560]  is you know a calm officer who takes control of the situation can I guess
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:51.680]  catch more bees with honey than you do with vinegar and I think the screaming
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:55.080]  and the yelling and the gunpointing I really kind of just I think it threw a
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:59.720]  frenzy into the passengers the vehicle and it probably wouldn't have resulted
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:04.960]  in a death that's for sure well yeah cops pointing guns at you and screaming at
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:10.560]  you and getting hysterical you know okay one guy at a criminal record okay it
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:15.160]  was a gun and love compartment okay the hands are up you know you just killed
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:20.000]  somebody and I'm telling you I don't hate the police officers individually but
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.080]  this will come back on them it'll buy living in this society the reality is
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:30.400]  this is why people fear the police and why they're upset with them is they see
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:35.640]  stuff like this and the defense of stuff like this only creates more hatred
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:40.080]  for police which the system is then going to capitalize on to cause a civil
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:44.320]  war in this country and that's the plan confirm now George Soros involved in it
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:49.480]  and the average cop does not act like this the problem is is he will probably
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:58.400]  get off he will not get in trouble for this until he does it again and people
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:01.560]  say well don't second guess you haven't been out there I can see what's going on
[1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:07.000]  in this video and all I'm saying is the public sees this as well so what do you
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:11.800]  think should be done to this officer well you know it'll go through internal
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:16.040]  review and it'll show that he protected himself and he was doing his job and I
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:21.040]  don't see anything you know and I'm not a pessimist in this particular scenario
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:25.840]  I kind of compare it to similar situations where you know the guy got out
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:31.000]  of the car even though he had his hands up you know the officer easily could have
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:38.560]  thought it was a threat so you know it's an it's a system it's a systemic
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:44.160]  problem because the officers behaving and re acting the same way the
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:50.000]  establishment is training us to react who are you know not used to being around
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:55.080]  firearms seeing a firearm hearing about firearms so just like in before when
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:59.440]  you've discussed us someone who was in your office or in your in an interview
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:04.040]  saw your firearm on your desk they freaked out maybe it was like a ABC news
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:08.040]  reporter or whatever it was they freak out because they've been indoctrinated
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:12.520]  they've been brainwashed into flipping out whenever they even see a gun much
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:20.720]  less so the officer is been brainwashed the exact same way it was BBC and in
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.320]  one case and there was a drawer it's an instant access pistol safe but it was
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:30.440]  open and there was a 357 there and she just saw the butt of it and and
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:40.400]  literally what oh excuse me oh and God up was a gun oh and I was like yeah it is
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:45.160]  we're not sitting ducks here in this office and you're not scared you see
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:50.920]  cops with guns are in she's like but you she was just so scared and I had a
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:55.360]  similar case on a newspaper editor major newspaper editor it was college
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:58.440]  friends with my dad he and his wife were visiting one time when I was in
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:02.280]  college and I left my guns at my parents house so I was getting to my dad's
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:06.000]  gun safe to go to the shooting range and I was gonna go hog hunting after that
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:10.480]  and I was walking through their living room from their bedroom from the closet
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:16.320]  from the gun safe with a deer rifle and a case with a gun a handgun in it and he
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.680]  saw it and went oh and it was David David he's got a gun and I was walking
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:23.280]  through the houses yeah I'm going shooting well why do you have a gun it's
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:27.920]  scary and I said here's the gun he's like no get it out of here no no and it's
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:33.880]  just an irrational fear so great points I appreciate your call Rick
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:41.480]  imagine if those police officers would have both been white you would have the
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:47.640]  usual suspects on television on MSNBC and CNN saying they executed him because he
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:53.640]  was black no the truth is they killed him because they had a panic attack they
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:59.160]  were hysterical the black cop was hysterical and and the other shootings I
[1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:03.120]  see were white cops shoot black folks they're hysterical they're scared this
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:08.640]  guy had his hands up and got killed brown was charging him and already
[1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:14.480]  attacked him and somebody's charging and attacking me I'm 41 years old I can
[1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:17.880]  still fight good but you know I got injuries and things I don't feel young
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:22.800]  as I used to let me tell you somebody's charging me has already attacked me I'm
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:26.440]  gonna pull a gun and shoot him I don't care they're black or white you're not
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:30.080]  gonna ram my head in the concrete I'm just gonna kill you because I got kids
[1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:33.320]  I got to come home to I got a responsibility to try to stay alive
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:39.200]  so I get that but at the same time you can't have just Yosemite Sam shoot

[1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:37.880]  meet the new boss folks james your boss republicans are voted unanimously except
[1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:43.880]  one person almost unanimously that climate change is real to get their
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:49.560]  keystone pipeline vote to move forward in the Senate the House Republicans drop
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:53.880]  controversial abortion bill ahead of Roe v Wade anniversary they passed the same
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:58.200]  bill Fox News reports last year knowing the Senate would kill it but now the
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:03.200]  Senate would be exposed as Republican controlled and would have to vote it
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:08.680]  down so the House protected them and didn't pass it Walter Jones had just
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.840]  voted on it when he was on with us yesterday and thought it would pass it
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:16.600]  didn't he voted ran in called us and he thought it would pass and it didn't how
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:23.120]  incredibly shameful so they're gonna keep killing babies that are eight nine
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:28.960]  months old and could live they haven't told women that their charities it'll
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:35.480]  pay a hundreds of thousands of dollars to carry that baby to term and the
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:39.040]  answer is nobody wants minority babies that's the racist response to the left
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:43.640]  who started abortion in this country to get rid of minorities that's not true
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:47.160]  no people want the minority babies then they have leftist groups that battle so
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:52.520]  whites can't adopt black or Hispanic babies they'd rather have them all dead
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:58.160]  they've got a movie coming out about you know a black family not wanting a white
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:08.240]  guy to adopt the granddaughter Kevin Costner I saw the trailer for it online
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:12.440]  I forget the name of it I mean okay fine just kill the black babies in don't
[1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:16.760]  let those devil white people raise them my god they might not be raised to hate
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:23.960]  white people sure just kill them kill a black baby kill a black baby to quote
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:28.640]  Khalid Muhammad before it is with those white devils and we kill the white
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:31.960]  women and why do we kill the white women because the white woman is the
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:38.360]  military manufacturing center and every nine months she lays down her back and
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:44.840]  military reinforcements rule out you know I'm doing black preachers so good
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:49.200]  cuz you listen to cadence how I talk it's just southern that's what a white
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:52.600]  preacher sounds like to southern Baptist that that's really what I sound like
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:58.440]  want to get right down to it fire and brimstone if we don't abort every black
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:06.040]  baby the racist whites are gonna get them and then what are we gonna do and I
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:08.720]  enjoy talk I'm gonna go to a black church I want to hear some good preaching
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:14.600]  hey I do Marvin the Martian imitations I do it all people probably call that
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:18.280]  racist it's not even though I don't like what Khalid Muhammad used to say he's
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:21.800]  dead now I did enjoy listening to his speeches it's really hard to not listen
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:29.200]  to it it just very very nice the way it sounds much better than Martin Luther
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:35.120]  King who had a great voice as well I have a dream we ought to get the Martin
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:38.480]  Luther King speech and have me read it out I'll start from a project upset by

[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:16.080]  3139 and we are self-funded unlike MSNBC they got billions in stimulus money or
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:20.840]  NPR that gets 400 plus million a year your money dispute anti-gun anti-family
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:26.480]  pro-abortion garbage and to deceive people like I heard it I was an NPR this
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:29.040]  morning I knew it was gonna happen they were on there going well even
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:32.720]  Republicans all but one voted saying climate change is a real threat and
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:37.600]  causing a problem and that we need to have carbon taxes basically they did to
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:43.560]  say that they they had a writer to get the the the the pipeline bill moved
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:48.600]  forward to get it out of committee they had to vote we got Mark Moreno joining
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:53.680]  us the bottom of the next hour as we take more calls the climate depot they'll
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:40:00.320]  be popping in to break this down and so in off said look the it's a fraud it's a
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:02.880]  hoax amendment it says his climate change real of course it's always
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:07.640]  changing so we voted to get the bill going forward because it's true they
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:11.640]  wrote it as a scam of course climate change happens it's just not man-made
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:16.800]  or it's not a big deal so but sure enough they're spending it well
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:22.400]  Republicans admit it's all real deceiving their idiot audiences who love to be
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.640]  deceived this radio broadcasts this TV transmission the simulcast is not about
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:33.920]  staying on our one little reservation liberal or conservative and then only
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:37.440]  looking at information that validates what we're saying that's what control
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:41.120]  left and control right do we're full spectrum analysis going after the real
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:47.040]  agenda and carbon taxes is a wealth redistribution system to the elite and to
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:53.320]  shut down their competition let's go to Lionel now of Lionel media he joins us
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:59.080]  Lionel there's so much to get to today the limited time we have with you Lionel
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:04.120]  media dot-com but I wanted to get your take as a media analyst on all these
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:08.480]  propaganda films like Selma and propaganda films like American Sniper and
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:12.960]  now I knew Chris call I talked to him on and off air I debated him I don't think
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:17.160]  he was a bad guy I think he got sucked into something really scary I told to go
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:20.560]  along with propaganda and then got killed to cover it up I don't know your
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:23.480]  take on it but I know that you were happy to come on and talk about it then
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:26.040]  we'll hit a few other issues you want to stay with us a little bit the next hour
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:29.760]  or two we'll go to these calls with Howard and others that are holding but
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:33.920]  where do you want to go first Lionel well a couple of things to you know Alex
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:40.440]  the notion of propaganda the term has a pejorative slant to it it's been around
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:44.960]  since the 17th century it was Pope Gregory from the Vatican propaganda from
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:49.400]  the verb or the gerund propagation to propagate a particular idea put something
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:54.480]  out as propaganda right exactly now in our country from the days of Frank
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:59.360]  Capra and why we fight to Lenny Riefenstahl which is of course during the
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:06.000]  Hitler times this is triumph of the will Bernays and others our efforts in
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.160]  battle in geopolitics have always been punctuated with the media through the
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:17.800]  signal core through Frank Capra probably the greatest proponent so propaganda I
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:23.640]  want to demystify that that's number one number two Alex anybody who wears the
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:30.160]  uniform for this country we should owe nothing but respect and admiration for
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:36.480]  that being said there is a meme that is being said constantly that Chris Kyle
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:42.880]  protects my freedom of speech that somebody in Fallujah or Kandahar or
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:48.320]  somebody in the Hellman province some insurgent is going to march into Cleveland
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:53.480]  and shut down radio stations that every effort that the United States government
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:59.000]  involves itself in involves protecting my constitutional freedoms now while I
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:05.560]  respect the military that meme that connection is so dangerous in ensuring
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:10.320]  that the American public rubber stamp every future military activity because
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:15.480]  the propaganda that's being propounded is that they are there to protect us and
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:19.600]  when you start thinking that when you rubber stamp every single military
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:24.360]  adventure every adventure or example of colonialism or imperialism whatever it
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:28.800]  is you're actually ensuring that more Americans will ultimately be killed now
[1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:37.920]  what this was was one of the greatest examples of propaganda ever American
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:42.000]  sniper and by the way if you're as fascinated as I am have you ever heard
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:48.760]  Alex the history of Carlos Hathcock the great Marine sniper they're talking
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:54.120]  about World War two in Korea well this is also Vietnam Carlos Hathcock gave the
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:57.880]  notion of the sniper you know Michael Moore and by the way look I don't want
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:03.440]  to play conspiracy God forbid but if Michael Moore is not a government
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:09.960]  agent or as we say in professional wrestling they heal to come in to stir
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:18.040]  up this pro military argument because Michael Moore is is is the heel he's
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:24.680]  that he's the dupe that you always turn to to if the argument is not going your
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:29.520]  way bring in Michael Moore and he will galvanize people he will give he will
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:35.040]  give left cover to it he will be a foil to say something stupid to legitimize
[1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:39.480]  the other side that's getting torn up really bad precisely precisely now look
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:45.120]  at what happened look at the the last time we had a football game the football
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:50.160]  and this this wonderful transmutation of propaganda and the military and the flag
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:55.560]  in patriotism and the star-spangled banner and flyovers and uniforms and
[1:44:55.560 --> 1:45:01.280]  color guards for a sporting event I don't know if any other international
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.600]  sporting team doesn't I'm not that familiar with with a soccer and football
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:09.760]  around the world but it's perfect and one of the things we have the only place
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:15.120]  you see it was in Soviet or Nazi regimes it's clearly totalitarian and
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.320]  again this is the globalist put the military on death panels letting an IBM
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:24.360]  robot called Thomas decide who doesn't get treatment the government's
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:27.960]  preparing for war with the vets but while saying we love them we love them
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:33.680]  they mean the the glory of the archetypal warrior is projected on the state so the
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:40.040]  corrupt occupational state is projecting the glory of the male soldier which is
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:45.440]  under attack everywhere the image of the male is under attack Clint Eastwood or
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:51.960]  people like John Wayne God guts and guns is under attack but you're allowed to
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:56.600]  have it when it's the military only promoting some globalist agenda so
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:46:01.800]  exactly we care about the military but we realize it's a propaganda situation
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:05.480]  when every time they score in basketball or football they cut to the
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:11.240]  military pavlovian Lee like oh you know you just felt good because of the
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:16.160]  military this is like training a chicken to tap the lever to get a little
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:20.080]  grain of wheat or something this is classical brainwashing and that's what
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:24.000]  the film American sniper was because Chris Kyle had to admit a bunch of his
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:28.880]  book was bull and they I saw the movie it's like he's Jesus or something and
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:34.960]  it's just not true and Alex in order for you again because I have I of course
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:38.360]  tweet you know at Lionel media people say you don't understand something you
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:43.960]  can't say anything to desecrate this man's legacy nobody is let me explain
[1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:48.360]  something also Alex this goes to show you and we talk about this all the time
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:53.600]  I've got friends you've got friends and when you bring something up what you
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:58.800]  just said the classic pairing the Freudian this this pateller connection
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:03.520]  of memes and and archetypal visions and imagery they're gonna say oh god there
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:07.720]  goes Alex Jones again with his conspiracy theories but look at what my
[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:13.240]  friends in sports are as I discuss this I say hey did you hear about deflate
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:19.720]  geek about what about did you hear about Bella check soft balls I didn't know
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:24.280]  what he was talking about said what about it yeah you see there's this thing
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:29.080]  Alex where they believe that he deliberately deflated the balls of the
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:34.080]  game I said and it's an inside job I said wait I thought there was only one
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:39.760]  way to deflate the balls I thought it was another medical condition we got to
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:44.640]  worry about so anyway I'm looking at these people that I know and there is no
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:50.500]  aspect to the intricacy of this conspiracy theory the temperature the
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:55.480]  weather they don't mind conspiracy theories this is bread and circuses well
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.520]  exactly and if anybody that goes and takes a phd-level marketing class or if
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:02.080]  anybody was ever in these big corporate meetings and I've been in some of them
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:06.880]  all they talk about is archetypes and manipulation and subliminals that's been
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:11.520]  going on since the 40s in radio the public just doesn't know the sciences
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:16.880]  are being used Alex you may not be old enough to recall this but I was just a
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:21.760]  just a young and but I remember my parents took me to see Green Berets with
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:26.360]  John Wayne that was one of the greatest propaganda filmed ever oh I know I've
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:29.720]  watched it now and it's just sickeningly obvious and it doesn't mean
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:33.160]  you're against the Green Berets or John Wayne I love John Wayne and the Green
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:37.120]  Berets but I know I know Green Berets people this is just wonderful man
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:42.320]  patriots always that I've known right the issue is is that it is sickening
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:48.720]  propaganda when you again create this you talk about the these archetypal
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:53.120]  connectivity and this the notion of these memes whenever you say that you
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:58.520]  must whenever an American soldier a Marine or whatever is involved you must
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:02.120]  snap to attention and rubber-stamp their activity you know let me explain
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:07.000]  something Alex Chris Kyle again we anybody who and I can't believe I have
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:11.280]  to even stop with these prefatory statements about I'm sorry he died he
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:14.440]  didn't deserve in fact he died here not even in the battlefield but that's another
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:20.240]  story the people Alex that are after my freedom of speech the people that are
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:25.080]  after my ability to exercise my constitutional rights has never been an
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:29.120]  insurgent in Fallujah or the Hellman province but my government people who
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:33.680]  want to pass SISPA and SOPA people who want to pass cyber security laws people
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.240]  who put me in a panopticon real one legislatures like Illinois saying don't
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:42.240]  film the police in public absolutely and here's the deal they're just taking the
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.400]  troops getting us to love them which is easy to do archetypally that's what
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:49.800]  we're meant to do you know at a genetic level support the men going out to
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:53.840]  defend you God if you won't do that you're dead but but our government's been
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:58.560]  seized they're using them it's our military saying no to arming al-Qaeda and
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:03.120]  ISIS so the military themselves are the right thing but the brass above them
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:07.320]  work for these globalists that are still doing it so then they say oh be
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:11.160]  patriotic don't say our governments behind ISIS don't blame our military
[1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:16.080]  whenever I would question 9-11 Lionel they would say why do you think the
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:19.600]  firemen blew it up I go I didn't say the firemen blew it up there was a
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:23.480]  countdown they blew up building seven I don't know who did it certainly not the
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:26.920]  fire department to see they play that game like you're criticizing government
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:30.400]  you don't like firefighters well you know Alex what they also do is they'll say
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:33.920]  well what about this and what about that or if you question some music where did
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:37.840]  all those people go I tell people it's your story tell me but here's the thing
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:41.240]  is very interesting throughout our history again because remember you know
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:45.800]  Tolstoy said history would be a wonderful thing if only it were true what we call
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:50.280]  history today if I told somebody I said who was a person who was responsible for
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:54.080]  alerting the the Patriots that the British were coming I guarantee you a
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:57.400]  thousand people would say Paul Revere and it wasn't tell us who it was when
[1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:00.680]  come back he just relayed the message and stay there we'll be right this hour

[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:10.560]  the other sultans swing back live ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:14.760]  lionel.linelmedia.com is our guest with us a little bit in the next hour we're
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:21.560]  going right to Howard Riley Josh David Larry and others right away Larry
[1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:29.800]  listening on WNFZ 94.3 in Tennessee and many others stay right there and we've
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:37.400]  got this is so frustrating because to get into history is a complex issue but
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:42.960]  it's also simple at the same time read a wide spectrum of history and then you'll
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:47.280]  get both sides or all the different sides but what I found is when you read
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:53.520]  300 400 500 page mainline history books like rise and fall the third Reich or
[1:54:53.520 --> 1:55:00.080]  order of the deathshed or the declassified British report on Hitler it's
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.800]  actually in there that the British funded Hitler it's actually in there that
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:11.000]  all this stuff went on it's just not in pop history pop history that you see
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:16.280]  being pushed by the system is what's really twisted so often historians are
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:20.320]  so arrogant they don't even want to be censored they want to actually put in
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.520]  there both sides of what happened but that never gets picked up by the public
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:29.360]  because they don't read Lionel get into your story about Paul Revere very
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:34.000]  quickly if you ask people what they think or who was a person who's responsible
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.920]  for alerting into the Patriots it would say Paul Revere nobody would ever say
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:43.240]  Israel Bissell because Paul Revere was the creation of Longfellow now even then
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:46.560]  that when you go back to the myth and the memes of the military I've got two
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:51.080]  examples of two names Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman about him it was doing
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:55.560]  absolutely great it was a billion dollars worth of advertising for the
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:55:58.600]  military here's a guy who was making millions of dollars in the NFL who
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:02.880]  leaves to join his brother to fight for the noble cause Alex you can't beat that
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:06.080]  we had in a world war two with Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable and others but
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:09.760]  this was a real McCoy he gets to Afghanistan he gets wherever he becomes a
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:14.680]  ranger again he becomes a top-notch soldier and he writes back and he says
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:19.560]  the war is a lie lo and behold accidentally he's dispatched then you
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:24.120]  have Jessica Lynch another one you could with Jerry Brookheimer actually
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:28.000]  writing out the script for this and what's amazing also was that even then
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.400]  Alex you and I and a lot of people said wait a minute this story doesn't ring
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:38.080]  true it doesn't matter because like they say from the from the great that the
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:42.120]  man who shot Liberty Valance when the legend becomes fact print the legend
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:47.360]  we're not going to go back and destroy this meme this idea Jessica Lynch was a
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:53.040]  fraud she even said so and the people around her who happened to say well
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.120]  that may not have happened they're dispatched as well so what I don't
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:00.920]  understand is simply this you know Alex there are people who have a worldview
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:05.320]  and they don't want to have that worldview affected the other night during
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:09.480]  the State of the Union when Obama was out there speaking I went and I took
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:14.720]  actual excerpts from George W. Bush's past State of the Union addresses and on
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:20.880]  Facebook I would quote them and Obama folks said that's brilliant that's why
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:26.320]  we love this band I said go ahead and Google that and they said oh this is a
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:31.200]  skins and shirts world this is Mets and Yankees this is nothing to do about
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:35.240]  facts and realities there is a meme right now there was the idea of the
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:41.480]  military and it is almost talismanic and if you want to believe in the United
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:45.120]  States which I think all of us do at least the fundamentals of it you must
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:50.840]  never question anybody who is presented to you as a hero because if you
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:54.800]  question either the veracity of the claim or what happened or the cause
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:58:00.520]  somehow you're denigrating a man's history and what I also say again as
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:05.640]  long as we rubber stamp every single military action support them
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:11.960]  absolutely but when we say that all wars are valid all centurions are
[1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:17.160]  we've now turned into a total third world cesspit once we do that and and just
[1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:21.280]  putting a cherry on top of this what was private lynch about it was about
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:24.440]  getting women in the military and saying they fought better than men was also a
[1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:28.240]  giant fraud and social engineering Pat Tillman was exposing government drug
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:32.320]  dealing they killed him it came out and it's the same thing with Kyle I'm sure
[1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:38.520]  of it the story was unraveling Ventura was suing him they killed Kyle folks they
[1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:42.760]  murdered him the very people that are now using him as a dead hero is even
[1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:48.360]  better they killed it to make him a hero at the end of the movie
[1:58:49.160 --> 1:58:54.400]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put
[1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:58.800]  together a formula that focuses directly on brain health nerve growth factors and

[2:00:28.040 --> 2:00:33.200]  take on Selma I've not seen it yet I think Martin Luther King did a lot of
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:40.400]  great things that said I've read the cheat sheet on it and it's being brought
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:44.840]  out at this point this time to further exacerbate racial tensions all part of
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:50.400]  the George Soros backdrop that's my view I don't know Lionel's view on it I know
[2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:55.000]  he wants to review it so we'll get his take on that the next segment right now
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:01.120]  Howard in Illinois thank you for holding you're on the air worldwide hey Alex and
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:08.160]  Lionel welcome thank you brother I just wanted to talk to you a minute about the
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:15.760]  info wars freedoms of America pamphlet do you know about that no I mean I know
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:19.120]  that we put a free citizen rulebook in all orders it's got the Declaration of
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:22.760]  Independence Constitution famous quotes stuff like that what are you talking
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:27.400]  about well I'm talking about this pamphlet you should come out with that
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:31.840]  would have the top 10 things that the government's lying to us about like
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:38.000]  Obamacare gun control you know that's a great idea like a simple 20 30 page
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:43.200]  pamphlet is inexpensive that folks can buy at cost that just has the big lies
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:49.480]  and and then solutions and then some websites that have educational videos
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:54.840]  on them that would be great to hand out to people well if you print them up I'll
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:59.640]  I'll order a hundred and I'll hand them out to a hundred of my friends and
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:05.880]  strangers both yeah I would fashion them almost after chick tracks maybe even have
[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:13.520]  some cartoons or illustrations in it as well I want to do it it's it's it's on
[2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:17.920]  the back burner I meant to do it for years but yes or we should do that also
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:23.280]  maybe some pamphlets for the police for us to hand to the police and say hey
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:29.200]  we're not in a war with you that's a great idea to boil down the globalist
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:33.040]  plan and the cops really click to it because they're already in it they're
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:36.760]  somewhat decompartmentalized because they already have inside scoops on a lot
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:41.320]  of stuff then they want the next level of decompartmentalization then when they
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:45.400]  get our intel go check for themselves and find out it's true our credibility
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:49.920]  just goes up up up up up that's a problem the establishment has because we
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:54.200]  have penetrated the compartmentalization of the military and police that they
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:59.320]  are the easiest to wake up a natural ally to freedom if we'll just stop hating
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:02.240]  them and reach out to them that doesn't mean they're all gonna want to be
[2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:06.320]  woken up like a general public but statistically I've seen it and I've
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:09.880]  experienced it I get chills talking about it we can really beat the
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:13.280]  globalist we just got to believe we can do it Lionel any comments on what
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:17.720]  Howard saying well my comment would be to have the top ten things that the
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:22.120]  government is lying about you need the top thousand because the idea of that
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:25.520]  would be a rather daunting cause you know Alex you mentioned something before
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:30.720]  about global warming global warming and global and climate change is a religion
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:36.440]  nobody has any idea of the second part about that because what I tell people and
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:40.720]  just going back to what you said I will concede I will stipulate to global
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:43.240]  change global warming I don't really care about that what about the carbon
[2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:46.400]  trading board what about the carbon taxing part what about the Marie
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:50.520]  Strong Al Gore contingent and you get the look of what are you talking about
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:55.480]  because the issue is critical thinking says I'm not arguing about this just
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:03:59.160]  like I'm not arguing about whether we should honor the military I'm not
[2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:03.720]  arguing whether we respect the police when I talk about a particular aspect of
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.120]  a huge subject matter they're doing the same thing they're saying do not
[2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:12.600]  question or we're gonna arrest you in Europe this is a religion everyone
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:17.000]  agrees man may global warming pay Al Gore money well no not everyone agrees it
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:21.560]  and it's been proven to be a fraud that man is a huge contributor it's the sun
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:28.280]  and also if you look at how ice caps are melting on Mars and others Alex I have
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:33.880]  friends of mine who have taken it upon for you to do for you to even challenge
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:39.560]  the proposition that maybe this might be a tad exaggerated it's like me
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:45.480]  challenging their mother's a chastity or their religion or their faith in
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:49.440]  something and what they'll do is Alex they'll always say this how can you tell
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:56.480]  me that all of these scientists all of these and I'm saying what scientists and
[2:04:56.480 --> 2:04:59.440]  they have a kind of an idea about that exactly stay there we're gonna come back

[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:38.160]  destabilization same thing they've been saying for 20 years man-made global
[2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:40.720]  warming is real it's going to kill everybody unless we have a global
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:45.040]  government and regulate and surveil all human activity and tax humans for the
[2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:50.600]  carbon dioxide that they excelled that's a new york times headline attacks on
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:56.000]  breathing it's now here the taxes are going in in california the taxes have
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.360]  devastated australia now they're trying to implement outside of congress passing
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:04.200]  along we've got mark morano of climate depot popping in at the bottom of the
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:10.840]  hour to talk about the shock vote on the surface in the senate were 98 to 1
[2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:17.200]  there was one abstention one person wasn't there 98 to 1 out of 100 senators
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:23.800]  voted that climate change is real but notice senator inhoff said well I had to
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:29.680]  vote because was up for a vote I have his quotes here they played a trick where
[2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:34.560]  of course we agree that there's climate change the climate's always changing so
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:38.600]  we had a vote had to vote but it's a scam because it didn't say man-made
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:43.040]  climate change mark morano was his former chief of staff and advisors so
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:46.640]  we've got mark morano joining us formerly worked for senator inhoff and
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:50.040]  advised the senate the climate depot calm he's going to be joining us talk
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:54.200]  about this but sure enough this morning I knew it driving in I said let me just
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:57.520]  see it I dolled around on AM they weren't talking about it went over to NPR
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:03.240]  and they must be saying every 10 minutes well the senate voted 98 to 1 and the
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:06.480]  Republicans admit climate change is real we need to do something about it that
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:10.360]  was the lie and they're gonna just sit there and tell their idiot listeners see
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:15.480]  all scientists agree and even all the senators but one cook from Louisiana you
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:19.680]  know those dummies in the south yeah that's just the way it is I want to go
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:23.040]  to Riley and others you got to go to calls quick here but you were getting
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:30.280]  into that Lionel media analyst I'm moving to quick here then I also want to
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:35.920]  get into your review of Selma but go ahead we made a couple of thinking you
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:39.800]  know Alex that you you and I realize the importance of language and I don't want
[2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:44.000]  to overplay this but when president Obama was running he said hope and change
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:48.560]  I want change I want change I want change and I at the time was with a group of
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:52.040]  friends and I said do you mean change or improvement and they thought it was
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:59.000]  being a bit callous about this if I said mr. Mr. Jones your your tumor has
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:03.040]  changed you wouldn't say all right thank you doc you would say whoa whoa whoa
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:07.560]  what do you mean change is it improved has it gotten better climate change now
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:13.280]  I'm I'm not in any way trying to blame at the point here but even the term leaves
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:17.640]  itself for wiggle room and I gotta say this one thing Alex just because memes
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:23.760]  build up a momentum myths in the light let's take Hollywood people were saying
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:29.000]  about Selma Hollywood is racist and so-and-so in this particular leaders
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:33.520]  gonna go to Hollywood and sit down and talk to these people by the way the same
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:38.200]  people who hated conspiracy theories thought absolutely that the Sony hack
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:43.120]  was an inside job it's funny how the concept of conspiracies are not a problem
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:47.840]  so we're gonna go to Hollywood we're gonna say hey how come Selma how come
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:52.200]  you are racist how come you did this and Hollywood turns around I said last year
[2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:57.480]  12 years a slave it won every award there was oh well that's different well
[2:11:57.480 --> 2:12:02.760]  Hollywood's liberal wait a minute this year American sniper supposedly Hollywood
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:08.440]  hate Clint Eastwood hate shoot them ups hates war propaganda Hollywood loved this
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:16.320]  you see Alex people will just make up whatever they want to say so that their
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:21.480]  worldview fits exactly and we don't do that we get accused of being conspiracy
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:25.880]  theorists where I really try to look at each case study it and come up with what
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:29.760]  is the most common sense accurate analysis but when you look at Hollywood
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:34.160]  it's just whatever agenda they want and it's clearly propaganda let's get back
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:39.520]  yes and then when Selma doesn't get enough nominations it's racist as well
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:45.080]  I mean it's ridiculous let's go to Riley in Iowa thank you for holding go ahead
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:50.720]  hey good to be on with you guys good to have you just a quick comment and then
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:54.640]  let's talk about the driving force of propaganda it was sort of revealed to me
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.920]  watching that Mike Dice video I'm okay but a quick comment climate and weather
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:04.480]  is defined as long-term patterns are changed so the topic of climate change
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:09.120]  seems pretty redundant to me because it's built into the weather changes yeah
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:12.560]  first it's global freezing then global warming man made anthropogenic then when
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.240]  that's just proven they just go change change I mean single teach that there
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:23.520]  were never cycles or never seasons yeah so let's move on there cuz that's kind
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:26.560]  of redundant so I don't want to spend time there but I posted on my blog it's
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:30.080]  upright Riley you can find it on Facebook yada yada but it's based on Mark
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:34.360]  Dice's video that you posted the blog is focused on the driving force of
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:38.960]  propaganda which is suggestibility the people in the video were only suggested
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.240]  the MLK was gonna be put on Mount Rushmore and they were just sucked into
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:46.120]  the lie only cuz it was suggested and here's the right they just want to
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:50.640]  comply so Martin Luther King died today and he was the first black man to walk
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:54.760]  on the moon and he was a confederate general and and the people are there
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:58.520]  agreeing going oh yes that's wonderful I'm glad he's a confederate general it
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:02.680]  just shows their zombies they're in a trance state highly suggestible being
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:06.660]  raised on television that's the paradigm you just hit it well you know
[2:14:06.660 --> 2:14:11.760]  that's something I'm sorry what next Lionel you don't believe he was the
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:15.120]  first black man to walk on the moon what's wrong with that let's let's honor
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:18.400]  black people and build them up what you don't think we have black doctors and
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:22.080]  black astronauts why are you now being racist against Martin Luther King he was
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:26.160]  the first man to walk on the moon see how that works don't you dare say Chris
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:29.600]  Kyle wasn't who they said he was you know one of the best things Alex I
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:33.680]  thought go going back about how people how a meme you know remember if ever
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:37.440]  you're killed or shot by the police you better say something pithy as something
[2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:41.280]  you put in a hashtag on their hand or else you're not gonna get a movement if
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:46.360]  you say oh blank when you're shot guess what you're out of luck when Charlie
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:50.240]  Hebdo came up and the people that I know were holding up pencils holding up
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:56.040]  pencils and I asked the question have you seen the quote cartoons in Charlie
[2:14:56.040 --> 2:15:00.160]  Hebdo have you seen them no I said well I'll tell you what why don't you take
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:06.840]  that pencil and you sign this contract swear to me that you will put any
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:11.600]  cartoon that I picked from Charlie Hebdo in your school newspaper or your
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:17.320]  local newspaper this thing so it goes to show you that they had no idea all they
[2:15:17.320 --> 2:15:23.160]  know is the meme started the actual quanta of information the data I mean it
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:26.960]  does show Mohammed get I don't want to be vulgar with children listening but it
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.640]  shows Mohammed performing oral sex on men and stuff like that and we are the
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:35.240]  United States of politically correct the people that I know who are the
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:41.040]  prototypical professional left those individual who will parse words about the
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:47.800]  way a particular ethnicity is depicted in the cartoon on TV would not post the
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:53.680]  same cartoon that they are protesting in support of and they cannot also
[2:15:53.680 --> 2:15:59.560]  understand that you can support the military support the soldiers will be
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:03.360]  against the war you could support freedom of speech but not like a
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:07.120]  particular expression of that you can support a particular idea they say free
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:10.320]  speeches agreeing with whatever they say when you counter it they go out there
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:13.680]  you hate speech me no no I don't have to agree with you we've got to go to other
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:18.360]  callers but thank you Riley great points very smart audience out there really
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:26.440]  impressive let's go to Larry in Tennessee listening on 94.3 FM WNFZ go
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:30.400]  ahead Larry you're on the air hello Alex how you doing today good brother go
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:35.160]  ahead hey first of all I just want to thank you my family and I want to thank
[2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:38.800]  you for all the hard work that you do day in and day out we do support your
[2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:45.760]  radio show by person your products but anyway I have some pretty interesting
[2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:52.600]  information that well I was going away last week but we just relocated from
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:57.400]  Florida after basically listening to your radio show here a few years ago at
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:02.720]  first I thought you were absolutely nuts now I'm the one that's not according to
[2:17:02.720 --> 2:17:06.080]  my in-laws but who cares I don't care but that's what I feel when people listen
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:09.320]  for a few years and actually check into what I'm saying they tend to get more
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:14.400]  radical than even I am generally and then I get criticized for not being hard
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:21.680]  core enough I don't know you're right on brother thank you my friend but but but
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:27.080]  anyway it's time for me to switch my driver's license over from Florida to
[2:17:27.080 --> 2:17:33.040]  Tennessee so I call up the local license branch and I asked them you know what
[2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:37.720]  information do I need to bring in to transfer my driver's license well when
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:41.560]  they answered the phone I looked the number up and it said the local DMV well
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:46.600]  when I called the phone the phone number they answered as homeland security I
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:50.380]  thought I dialed the wrong number no that's right the feds have taken
[2:17:50.380 --> 2:17:55.160]  everything over basically a national ID card everything it's all centralized
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:59.640]  now yeah you know that you know I just thought it was kind of kind of weird I
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:04.320]  mean watch my film America destroyed by design 1997 we show all the executive
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:08.640]  orders all of it excuse me it just took them 10 years or so to get it in place
[2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:13.440]  and then now it's all covertly being done and he legals get to get drivers
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:18.760]  license in most states with no ID or a fake Mexican ID but you've got to show
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:22.080]  a bunch of forms of identification I'm gonna skip this network break and keep
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:26.360]  wine or weather so we get to all these calls and get his analysis of this but
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:30.560]  finish up what happened when you called the local number for the DMV and got
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:35.320]  homeland security yeah I mean yeah it was just very and they went on they gave
[2:18:35.320 --> 2:18:38.720]  me a long list like you were saying you know we we got to provide all this
[2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:42.960]  documentation that we are actually American citizen driver's license
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:48.680]  Social Security number bank statements and marriage certificates all this stuff
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:54.480]  and you know we'll just tell them you're an illegal alien but then they'll
[2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:58.800]  arrest you saying you engage in fraud so don't tell them that well you know I'm
[2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:02.200]  waiting now to get pulled over by the local police because I have info wars
[2:19:02.200 --> 2:19:06.160]  dot com stickers all over my bumper well you'll probably get pulled over and
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:10.120]  they'll tell you how wonderful you are I mean most police most police like the
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:13.680]  show yeah but anyway I won't keep you along Alex I gotta go to work here
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:17.040]  pretty soon anyway but there's there's another thing a friend of mine came to
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:21.760]  work here a couple weeks ago and I was explained to him actually about what my
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:26.240]  experience with the license branch but he brought he he goes to a local Baptist
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:31.440]  church small Baptist church here in Tennessee small town he brought picture
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:37.920]  they took video of three SUVs with cameras on the dash across the parking
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:43.040]  lot of the church and they were Homeland Security videotaping the church yep so he
[2:19:43.040 --> 2:19:47.360]  says he had pictures of it no that's what Homeland Security does is go spies on
[2:19:47.360 --> 2:19:51.480]  mainline churches you name it and they're creating databases this is the
[2:19:51.480 --> 2:19:55.800]  secret police that's why the Homeland Security people are freaking out because
[2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:00.040]  they now understand they're becoming a totalitarian group so just as Homeland
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:04.960]  Security is a big problem it's also a big pool of people that are awake because
[2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:10.280]  they know what's going on oh exactly and you imagine being Homeland Security and
[2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:14.760]  spying on Baptist churches because Holder is targeting thousands of Christian
[2:20:14.760 --> 2:20:20.000]  churches to create a chilling effect so they won't stand up for what for a lot
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:24.440]  of us remember but mosques are out of the question and I'm not advocating that
[2:20:24.440 --> 2:20:28.760]  either but understand the sensitivity that has been exhibited by this
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:35.480]  government to never ever infiltrate a mosque and I thought okay fine but if it's
[2:20:35.480 --> 2:20:40.040]  a Baptist church if it's another form of religion well that's okay is that
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:44.920]  consistent I don't think so there is an open Homeland Security through the IRS
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:50.160]  war on Christians mainline Christians I mean two years ago when army intelligence
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:53.560]  sent me some intel that wasn't classified they don't send me classified
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:56.960]  stuff and it was army psyops at Fort Hood they said now go ahead and tell
[2:20:56.960 --> 2:21:00.760]  people we don't care I was are you kidding and they said no we're sick of it
[2:21:00.760 --> 2:21:03.680]  then I ran to a whole another group of psyops course Fort Hood's so big there's
[2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:08.400]  a lot of different psyops where they were told you are not allowed to be an
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:12.320]  evangelical or give money and you're not allowed to be in the Tea Party or you
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:17.400]  may be court-martialed Fox News picked it up and said is this okay so that's the
[2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:21.080]  supposed conservative standing up well is it good they're saying Christians are
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:26.600]  terrorists mainline evangelicals that is a test to see what the military would
[2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:30.320]  do and of course the military freaked out they have a First Amendment but but
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:35.320]  this is going on I couldn't believe it when we first got the documents and we
[2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:40.680]  called the commanding general about it and they did not deny it so imagine
[2:21:40.680 --> 2:21:44.800]  Homeland Security did that wasn't even secret imagine you're at Fort Hood you're
[2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:49.480]  told you will not go to evangelical church what I mean this is beyond the
[2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:53.600]  Soviet Union what do you say to that Lionel you know Alex I don't think there
[2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:57.440]  was anything that the American people could ever hear in terms of a new show
[2:21:57.440 --> 2:22:02.600]  that was validated on any program or any network that would so much as cause a
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:10.760]  flutter of concern or worry I believe that through systematic habituation to
[2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:15.800]  one example of excess after another that the American people have been
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:21.680]  basically numbed by this have been habituated have been conditioned so that
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:25.680]  if you were to tell them anything that's why the government said go ahead see
[2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:33.160]  what happens nothing but if you suggest that footballs were under inflated that
[2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:39.000]  is going to cause a hashtag deflate gate Alex I'm not kidding what this country
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:45.560]  is concerned about what gets our attention what becomes viral what becomes
[2:22:45.560 --> 2:22:50.920]  fattish what becomes part of our culture and what is excluded and by the way
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:56.080]  let me just say one more thing the word homeland was not picked out of the blue
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:03.400]  that word homeland has a very serious historical currency and I ask everybody
[2:23:03.400 --> 2:23:07.040]  to Google that well there's multiple ones but give me the one you want to focus
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:12.120]  on it's always an imperial term for the center of the authoritarian Empire
[2:23:12.120 --> 2:23:18.880]  going back to Rome the Nazis called it Reichland or the land of the people and
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:23.120]  the Soviets call it the motherland you cannot get more totalitarian they're
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:27.440]  just going with the open open totalitarian creeds because they've
[2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:31.800]  worked and taking over before what's your angle on it and well I need to say
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:37.960]  one thing what what America says today whenever and not not all America but
[2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:42.120]  but a significant portion of it whenever it does not like what you're saying
[2:23:42.120 --> 2:23:49.640]  you're crazy that's that Alex Jones guy he's crazy in a similar notion it was
[2:23:49.640 --> 2:23:54.440]  just revealed that there may be hundreds of thousands of documents that have been
[2:23:54.440 --> 2:24:00.760]  released regarding extraterrestrial contact now that might very well be the
[2:24:00.760 --> 2:24:07.120]  Watergate of the Millennium do you know what that would do to American and
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:12.520]  world interest in little national jurisdictional issues compared to the
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:18.840]  universe and the first thing that is ever said in conjunction with any subject
[2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:24.160]  about extraterrestrials or interplanetary is crazy as if you're not
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:27.640]  supposed to question that we're not alone in the universe I mean obviously
[2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:31.400]  they've photographed hundreds of billions of galaxies every culture says
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:34.680]  stuff was going on call it demons whatever you want the point is it's not
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:38.920]  crazy to question are we alone it's in a lot of government documents I don't go
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:43.040]  there because there's a look I can get people to admit FEMA camps when they're
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:47.800]  declassified under the emergency centers establishment act and under civilian
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:52.480]  M8 labor camp program Rex 84 garden plot cable splicer I just gave all the public
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:56.640]  names you can go to army dot mill and right now people won't believe that so
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:24:59.720]  they're not gonna believe you know there's little guys coming from Mars but
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:04.760]  you're absolutely right and Alex remember this if you tomorrow said ladies and
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:10.280]  gentlemen I have something that you're not gonna believe I have an actual tape
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:16.520]  a videotape or a film of the actual shooter of President Kennedy on November
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:23.040]  the 22nd and let's assume everybody said yes it's Lucien startee or whoever it
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:31.440]  was nobody would care nobody because something has happened to our what we
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:36.800]  accept and what we reject there's a pocket of us a group of us who loves to
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:40.400]  they're called skeptics by the way and they love to just reject whole cloth
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:45.320]  let me take some of the other day driving to Albany New York I looked up in
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:51.560]  the sky and Alex it looked like I don't know what some people might call geo
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:57.200]  engineering or chemtrails or whatever so I turned to my friend who was driving I
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:02.480]  said you see that I said what do you think that is he says that's jet exhaust I
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:08.600]  said maybe I said it might be something called a con trail or geo engineering
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:14.760]  let's see how long these last in the sky if they're there for two three four
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:20.440]  hours that's another story as we were looking at this and my friend who has
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:25.240]  never heard of it never read anything about it forget nano particulates and
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:30.240]  geo did nothing he said well what are you getting at us and I'm not getting
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:37.840]  anything look and even that which he looked at and could see Alex there were
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:44.120]  jets like hashtags like tic-tac-toe flying where are they go what's what he
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:50.760]  was saying oh what are you getting at I said like you're saying look I'm not this
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:55.360]  isn't an article I'm giving you know meanwhile it's declassified those
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:59.940]  compartmentalized and being added by three major companies to the jet fuel so
[2:26:59.940 --> 2:27:03.600]  the pilots and folks don't even know that it's aerosolized out of the engines
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:07.680]  Bill Gates runs the program and they spent five billion dollars a year at the
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:12.280]  Department of Energy alone the earth is 30% darker now according to NASA they
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:17.040]  say from contrails persistent contrails no they're not persistent and we know
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:21.520]  there's real contrails ice crystals my dad's a pilot the point is these programs
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:24.880]  are real but they go where's a document on chemtrails what well it's like where's
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:28.000]  a document on FEMA camps they're not called chemtrails they're not called
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  FEMA camps it's called geo engineering programs and China and Dubai and Russia
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:42.040]  admit they do it okay yeah I understand though as we're looking at this this is
[2:27:42.040 --> 2:27:47.240]  other people so if you we remember the government can tell you Jones release
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:52.440]  whatever you want here go take your cruise of FEMA get whatever it is nobody
[2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:59.720]  cares but talk about underinflated football or talk about a hacked movie or
[2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:06.600]  talk about some duck playing the piano or a neck it doesn't it doesn't that will
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:11.200]  get our attention that'll be viral something has happened to the way we
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:16.400]  process things that matter something has happened to our alarm mechanism which
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:20.240]  has been flipped the people are lazy and they've been subliminally triggered on
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.960]  record to not respond to real issues and respond to to phony ones and they're
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:28.280]  not humans that they're not they're not conscious anymore they've given over
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:30.960]  their conscious I got to go to another call here we had a caller holding for
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:34.360]  an hour from Illinois he hung up I apologize but we've got a limited call

[2:33:17.720 --> 2:33:24.640]  I've got just a standard doctor checkup I haven't got one in a while I got one
[2:33:24.640 --> 2:33:30.280]  last year my blood pressure has gone down to really below normal very healthy
[2:33:30.280 --> 2:33:33.720]  I had some high blood pressure before that from obviously all the stress and
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:37.240]  not exercising enough but I'm going back to get another checkup they said six
[2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:40.520]  months later today and it's at two o'clock it's down the street so I'm
[2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:43.920]  gonna leave here in the last segment and David Knight's gonna be here into
[2:33:43.920 --> 2:33:49.600]  overdrive some to also take calls from Josh and Nelson and Bob and Lucas and
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:54.720]  Robert and others we're getting Mark Moreno on the line do we have him he is
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:33:58.840]  on the line fantastic we're gonna play David Knight's piece that he did as I
[2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:02.440]  saw in the news today he did this piece last week the nightly news we never
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:07.880]  aired it here on the radio pointing out that a gallon of water is now more than
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:14.720]  a gallon of gasoline to show you how they have artificially deflated the prices
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:19.960]  absolutely massively so we're gonna be getting to that report in then into the
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:23.680]  final segment in overdrive David Knight will be here getting to your phone
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:30.720]  calls but now Mark Moreno joins us Mark Moreno of course formerly worked in
[2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:34.800]  Senator Inhofe's office he heads up climate depot he's advised Congress on
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:39.080]  supposed man-made climate change first it was global freezing and global
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:43.600]  warming now it's just any change and the NPR and others are saying hey the
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:47.400]  Republicans now admit man-made climate change is real well not really they said
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:51.040]  climate change well they had to vote because there is climate change and that
[2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:56.560]  was attached to the Keystone bill Mark Moreno of climate depot com joins us for
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:02.520]  10 minutes we appreciate him coming on on short notice to decipher exactly what
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:06.600]  happened I mean to me this looks like a classic manipulation where okay you want
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:13.000]  us to try to pass this bill fine just add on to it that you agree that man-made
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:17.040]  climate change is real but the bill will say climate change is real which of
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:20.360]  course we know it's changing just not man-made it's always changing and then
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:24.040]  they can run around and lie and act like every scientist agrees and even every
[2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:28.280]  Republican agrees you know 98 to 1 is that a correct analysis Mark Moreno
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:33.480]  yeah that is if senator inhofe I thought it brilliant tactical maneuver the
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:37.240]  whole vote was nonsense it was just a diversion Bernie Sanders came up with
[2:35:37.240 --> 2:35:41.200]  it originally senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island was involved they're all
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:44.400]  they were just trying to get they're trying to him in their mind embarrassed
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:50.840]  Republicans into being called deniers of global warming but as you pointed out
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:54.280]  you it's perfectly acceptable to say climate change is real that's all the
[2:35:54.280 --> 2:35:58.840]  earth's ever done and its entire history is changed climate and it's a it's a
[2:35:58.840 --> 2:36:04.520]  it's a meaningless thing and the other that she had a vote that was 50 to 49 and
[2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:10.080]  I think five Republicans people like Susan Collins and Lamar Alexander and
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:15.680]  Lindsey Graham voted on this and that was that man-made causes are causing
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:20.520]  climate change so we have at least five week Republicans all the Democrats
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:26.320]  voted for that and this is a this is gonna be a political football especially
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:31.200]  after President Obama's State of the Union it certainly is we were having a
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:34.600]  lot of successes exposing the fraud but it seems they're doubling down and I
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:40.680]  noticed a record number of private jets flying into Davos with them running
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:43.480]  around chirping that we that none of us should have a carbon footprint and
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:50.160]  Africans can't have heating this is really hypocritical isn't it yeah in
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:55.800]  effect I just went to the Peru Peru UN climate summit back in December and it's
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:59.880]  literally 10,000 people they're calling it they call it a traveling village of
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:06.960]  UN delegates bureaucrats world leaders celebrities and just about anyone else
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:12.640]  billionaire green investments trying to suck more money off government nipples
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:16.600]  that's what these that's what they do they come in and private jets Leonardo
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:21.400]  to Capri it typically shows up Al Gore shows up and it's rotates around the
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:25.920]  world the frightening thing we're facing now Alex is the sciences on them
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:29.800]  they're reduced to claiming things like hottest year which was just total and
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:33.400]  absurd nonsense and we had scientists saying this was misleading this was
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:39.280]  lying NASA was caught lying this was deception and President Obama is going
[2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:43.400]  full steam ahead and the Republican leadership is now entertaining the idea
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:47.680]  that they're only going to talk about regulations and economics and not deal
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:51.640]  with the science of global warming not challenge the science led by Lindsey
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:54.880]  Graham they're going to talk about just you know essentially saying Republicans
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:58.560]  need to come up with a solution to global warming and leading the charge on
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:02.560]  all this is Mitt Romney who came out yesterday once again sounding like Al
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:06.880]  Gore saying the global warming is a very serious problem so and we have Chris
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:11.080]  Christie who's probably one of the front runners and his own EPA is praising
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:17.040]  President Obama's EPA climate regulations or Christie it's it's we are
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:20.360]  we have literally won every battle a global warming skeptics in this battle
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:25.120]  but because of President Obama's share audacity in doing these executive
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:29.560]  orders and now doing a UN treaty without consent of the Senate they're
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:32.520]  talking about a ratification process that will not involve a Senate vote
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:37.200]  because they're going to ratify it under a 1992 disastrous UN treaty that was
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:41.760]  done under George H. W. Bush and by the way anyone who thinks we need a third
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:45.200]  Bush in office need need to look at nothing less than the global warming
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:49.000]  record of the previous two Bushes and and you know you would you know this
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:52.720]  too well about their whole globalist agenda especially when it comes to
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:57.000]  United Nations that George W. Bush spent a delegation every year to the UN
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.720]  conferences George W. Bush rubber stamped the UN climate reports he rubber
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:06.200]  stamped the UN negotiating process George H. W. Bush went further and actually
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:10.720]  signed the Rio Earth Summit Treaty and actually submitted and got ratified a
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:15.760]  UN treaty which has caused us so much grief led to the Kyoto Protocol and it's
[2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:18.960]  going to lead to successive global warming treaties so I don't think we're
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:24.280]  ready for a third Bush to take on this issue and a lot of other issues
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:30.080]  Wow Mark Moreno just veritas coming out of your mouth when you actually know the
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:33.120]  facts and read the news every day like I do it's all hidden in plain view that
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:37.720]  most scientists say man make global warming is a fraud most scientists say
[2:39:37.720 --> 2:39:43.120]  it's a power grab it's a wealth transfer to select billionaires who then get to
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:47.280]  exempt their companies like General Electric was exempted by Obama with a
[2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:51.520]  waiver from their own carbon taxes to shut down their competition this is a
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:56.640]  conscious larcenist criminal takeover the same special interests that are
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:00.840]  greasing the Democrats are greasing the Republicans we can't get a partial birth
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:05.040]  abortion victory out of these groups now if the Republicans have both sides
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:09.480]  they're letting Obama run completely wild with executive power grabs setting
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:12.920]  the precedent I mean what do you we've already seen a political realignment
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:17.400]  with all these incumbents getting thrown out I'm what are the Republican
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:21.320]  leaders thinking or they blackmailed why are they going along with an agenda
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:26.960]  why won't they repeal Obamacare I mean what the hell is their problem Mark I
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:31.600]  I don't know but I think our biggest challenge isn't fighting Obama it's
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:35.120]  going to be fighting Republican leadership that's that's always been
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:39.040]  that way and it's in essence but I think President Obama will go down I think he's
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:44.040]  surpassed LBJ I think we're talking at level of FDR he may surpass FDR and the
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:49.360]  ability he has to trans to truly transform America be it on immigration be it
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:53.480]  on health care be it on climate and remember climate as MIT scientist
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:57.320]  Richard Linton said he who controls carbon dioxide controls life it's a
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:01.440]  bureaucrat's dream to control carbon dioxide it affects every aspect of our
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:04.480]  life Japanese government telling citizens to go to bed an hour early the
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:09.880]  German government doing PSA is telling people not to have sex in the dark to
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:13.000]  save the planet from global warming not to turn the lights off when you make
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.480]  love it's about teaching you to have less so the ruling class of collectivists
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:22.600]  can have everything and giant palaces and mistresses and huge jet aircraft and
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:27.280]  then we have nothing an austerity is so sexy and cool it's the total totalitarian
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:34.200]  wet dream it is and they're talking about they're talking about a CO2 budget
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:37.320]  for every man woman and child on the planet they're talking about CO2 budget
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:40.720]  issued by your employer which you'll have to be surveilled that'll mainline in
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:44.160]  SS spine yeah and they've already got they've already had in California
[2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:48.400]  proposals to regulate your home thermostat just like that with the TV show
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:52.600]  the outer limits you are not a you know you are not in control they're they've
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:56.480]  talked about that they're cut they're respected our dishwashers our washing
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:42:01.480]  machines are light this is their excuse to roll out the smart grid spy system in
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:05.440]  closing mark merano of climate depot.com you are the global expert on
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:09.880]  fighting Lord Moncton is the global expert on you know developing all the
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:14.960]  scientific reports with scientists as probably the leader or co-leader of the
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:20.760]  resistance to this evil what do we do you've got three minutes well well right
[2:42:20.760 --> 2:42:25.040]  now we've got to keep the Republican Party from committing even further
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:29.760]  climate suicide what we historically have Republican Party has picked the
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:33.320]  environment that most liberal members of any Republican administration are
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:36.720]  typically the EPA directors or anyone that has to deal with environment that
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:41.520]  goes back to Richard Nixon in fact it's so bad that all former Republican EPA
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:45.160]  directors testified on Capitol Hill that they support supported Obama's
[2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:49.080]  global warming regulations and that's the problem even in the Senate and the
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:53.680]  House Republicans are always willing to throw out environmental regulation the
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:58.840]  left knows this they are now putting as as Vakalov clause actually said now that
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:01.880]  the fall of the eastern block in the Soviet Union the greatest threat we
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:05.800]  face is what he termed ambitious environmentalism masquerading in the
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:11.160]  global warming issue Republicans have to wise up this is the issue that's
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:14.720]  going to define freedom in the 21st I agree it's a bigger threat than radical
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:19.480]  Islam it is the global takeover threat absolutely is because they're going to
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:22.660]  justify what I said when you control CO2 you can control
[2:43:22.660 --> 2:43:29.680]  transportation waterways the air regulation airlines your home energy
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:34.520]  use every appliance you can imagine they have already statutorily killed the
[2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:37.960]  American SUV Americans just don't realize it yet we're already talking about
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:42.920]  massive influxes of aluminum SUVs coming in the body on frame disappearing an
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:46.880]  aluminum Jeep might be coming in a year or two all because of global warming
[2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:50.840]  regulations everyone seen those global warming stickers on new cars well the
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:54.360]  new fuel economy standards are going to be kicking in are the Republicans going
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:58.440]  to do anything about that or are they going to statutorily kill the American
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:02.240]  SUV that's coming Alex people aren't even aware of it yet so we've won the
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:07.620]  info war but the tyrants are in control the central systems any good news in
[2:44:07.620 --> 2:44:12.560]  30 seconds well the good news is the science continues to collapse on them
[2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:16.520]  and there has been talk of them moving over to other eco-scares environmental
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:20.920]  scare they're talking about sustainable development species extinction because
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:23.720]  they're losing some of their own left-wing scientists and in my
[2:44:23.720 --> 2:44:27.880]  documentary climate hustle which will be out later this year I profile
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:32.520]  politically left-of-center scientists who people who loved Al Gore people who
[2:44:32.520 --> 2:44:36.040]  even more radical than you know your average Democrat from on the left this
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:39.440]  point of view who actually review the evidence and can no longer be part of
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:42.120]  the global warming movement so they're losing some of their own members on the
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:48.880]  science right but the only hope we have here is the next president has to
[2:44:48.880 --> 2:44:52.680]  rescind all these executive orders I don't see it coming from a president
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:57.680]  Christie a president Jeff Bush a president Mitt Romney again Rand Paul or
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:02.120]  everyone issue or Ted Cruz though I think we'll shoot it down climate depot
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:05.440]  com Mark Moreno thank you so much you're a real hero thank you Alex
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:09.080]  appreciate it wow when we come back from the break after the special report
[2:45:09.080 --> 2:45:11.960]  David Knight is going to be sitting in he'll go to your calls exclusively
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:15.720]  Josh Bob Lucas Robert Nelson I'm going to that doctor's appointment for more

[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:28.880]  percent it's selling out quickly info wars life comm here is the report on
[2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:45.120]  water and gasoline to show how rigged it is gas prices have fallen far and fallen
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:50.000]  quickly but don't celebrate yet it's a manipulated price and behind it are some
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:53.600]  horrific trends before we talk about those trends I want to give you a quick
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:59.120]  comparison and some historical perspective I just bought gas for $1.79 a gallon
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:05.000]  and a 20 ounce bottle of water for $1.29 that's $8.25 per gallon for
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:09.360]  refrigerated water of course I can get a gallon of unrefrigerated water at a
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:14.360]  retail grocer for around a dollar but there are also huge taxes on the gas in
[2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:19.480]  Texas that's 38 cents per gallon federal and state much cheaper than the high gas
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:23.480]  tax states of say California New York or Pennsylvania where you'll pay up to
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:29.000]  65 cents a gallon so taking out the taxes I paid $1.40 per gallon think
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:33.320]  about that for a moment a dollar a gallon for just taking some water pouring
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:37.680]  it into a jug and shipping it to retail versus a dollar 40 per gallon for
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:41.720]  exploring for the oil developing a well if that doesn't work out they start all
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:45.600]  over again once it does work out they have to ship it to refinery refine it
[2:46:45.600 --> 2:46:49.120]  then ship it again to retail of course Saudi Arabia doesn't have any
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:52.960]  expiration or startup costs they're just looking at production costs and their
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:58.480]  production costs are very low estimated to be about $20 per barrel they have
[2:46:58.480 --> 2:47:04.160]  said they believe us shale cost is about $50 per barrel they can easily live
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:08.680]  with $40 per barrel still a hundred percent profit they've been getting
[2:47:08.680 --> 2:47:14.080]  500 to 600% profit 0% interest rates haven't helped the global economy
[2:47:14.080 --> 2:47:18.920]  neither has printing money and not even drastically lower oil prices are
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:23.120]  expected to help here's the most important thing that nobody is talking about
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:27.680]  the global economy has weakened it so much so quickly that in just the last
[2:47:27.680 --> 2:47:31.760]  few months the Saudis were able to cut the price of oil in half by just
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:37.360]  maintaining production levels that's how weak the global economy is so enjoy
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:42.760]  that gas that's about the price of water right now it's a sugar fix it's a
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:47.560]  Trojan horse by the Saudis so that they can regain and keep control of the
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:51.840]  world's oil supply and then they will charge you accordingly most economists
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:55.960]  say oh it's good for the consumer well of course it is we save maybe $2 a day
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:00.640]  and lower oil prices but it's going to burst one of the biggest bubbles we've
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:04.560]  had recently the fracking bubble we were told we're going to be energy
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:08.960]  independent we got this great fracking revolution it's just a bubble industry
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:15.360]  without 5% junk bond rates the lowest we've ever seen in history normally 8
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:19.920]  to 10 percent for those type of high-risk lending and without a hundred
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:24.840]  dollar plus oil prices fracking doesn't work so fracking is dead that's a million
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:30.720]  jobs that's 980 billion dollars in investment is going to go bad and a
[2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:35.240]  half a trillion dollars in debt and it's not just oil this declining other
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:41.680]  commodities are as well a metric of 24 commodities shows a drop of 43% since
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:47.720]  2011 with 28% of that coming in just the last seven months and that's part of a
[2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:53.680]  long-term trend in history when you try to cure debt with that you end up either
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:59.880]  in a an inflationary blowout and or a deflationary crash and we see and we've
[2:48:59.880 --> 2:49:03.720]  been saying consistently the place an error ship and a lot of very smart
[2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:08.720]  people who understand the debt crisis is unsustainable we've been saying no this
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:14.120]  ends in deflation and all we've seen Europe's worried about deflation US is
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:18.160]  worried about deflation commodity prices are collapsing older people are
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:22.360]  deflationary young people cost everything to raise old people downsize
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:26.840]  everything and with deflation accelerating the other D word comes to mind
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:31.640]  depression as we saw with a great depression economic hardship brings
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:38.240]  civil unrest and our government has been preparing for civil unrest it's war the
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:44.280]  greatest concentration of fighting troops in Washington since 1865 I knew
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:49.880]  something was going to happen that they might be attacked and I had a press card
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:56.840]  so I passed the police lines and then I saw the soldiers advancing and they
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:05.600]  started throwing tear gas I've never seen anything like it to prevent civil war
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:10.400]  in a major economic collapse governments will start foreign wars and the
[2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:14.560]  US is laying the groundwork for war with Russia and if the Russian economy
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:20.320]  collapses they will want a foreign enemy to war with Russia has already begun
[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:24.720]  with Western funded revolution and Ukraine economic sanctions and with the
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:30.040]  CIA and the Saudis targeting Russia's most important economic sector energy
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:36.560]  the CIA's ally Saudi Arabia is once more working against the interests of our
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:40.720]  country and working to make us dependent on foreign oil something the military
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:44.880]  industrial complex is used to push us into wars throughout the 20th century
[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:50.640]  and engaging directly in economic warfare on Russia pushing us towards real
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:55.840]  war as the world slips from deflation into depression for Info Wars Nightly

[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:12.480]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your host for the
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:15.960]  last segment here we're also going to take the calls of the people who've been
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:19.600]  waiting online to talk to us we're gonna take that and overdrive as well
[2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:22.840]  before we go back to the calls just want to remind you we've got a special
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:31.600]  introductory offer of 25% off of ancient defense that's now right now only 1499
[2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:37.200]  now that report that you just heard talking about how the Saudis are using
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:42.840]  oil prices bursting the fracking bubble here in the United States also attacking
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:46.120]  the Russian economy I think that's something we really need to think about
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:51.760]  what people are not looking at is just how vulnerable the global economy is
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:56.560]  because with all the zero interest rates with all the money being printed there
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:00.320]  is nothing that they can do even with falling oil prices that the World Bank
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.000]  has said that we're going to continue to see the global economy not recover this
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:09.260]  year even with lower oil prices and yet when we look at this climate change
[2:55:09.260 --> 2:55:14.880]  vote what explains the Republicans committing suicide why why are McCain
[2:55:14.880 --> 2:55:20.700]  and Lindsey Graham pushing Republicans to vote on climate change it's the key
[2:55:20.700 --> 2:55:25.760]  stone pipeline this is something that they passed in the House for the ninth
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:29.160]  time right after they came back from the elections and of course nothing at that
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:32.760]  point had changed in the Democrat controlled Senate they knew they weren't
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:37.320]  going to get the keystone pipeline through the Senate not signed by Obama
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:42.840]  either nevertheless they ignored doing anything about Obamacare they didn't do
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:47.040]  anything about the border they worked on passing the keystone pipeline the very
[2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:50.960]  first thing when they came back from the elections what is it about their corporate
[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:55.240]  masters the GOP's corporate masters that want the keystone pipeline so
[2:55:55.240 --> 2:56:00.040]  desperately that they've done it ninth nine times and now ten times and if you
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:04.600]  look at what they've done they've offered a carrot to Obama to get him to sign
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:11.040]  it they basically put in the clause about climate change Alex said and warned
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:15.240]  everybody that as the prices of oil were down before they bring them back up
[2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:20.640]  before the Saudis regain full control of the oil economy while they're down
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:24.680]  they're going to introduce new taxes many people have already been calling for
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:30.960]  new gasoline taxes this is when they can add new carbon taxes when oil prices
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:35.040]  are temporarily low but we see that what there's been massive deflation and
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:39.200]  commodities even though we've seen consumer prices rising it's looking very
[2:56:39.200 --> 2:56:44.280]  shaky are we going to have stagflation again or is this deflation going to turn
[2:56:44.280 --> 2:56:48.800]  into depression and war that's the other part of this I want to go back to your
[2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:52.960]  calls right now let's go to Josh in California Josh
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:59.840]  hello hey hi David go ahead you're on I wanted to discuss something Alex brought
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:08.280]  up a few days ago about George Soros and weaponized marijuana I believe Alex is
[2:57:08.280 --> 2:57:11.760]  correct about most of what he says about George Soros I've been studying the
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:17.000]  new oil order for since 1990 myself and and act in an activist in the cannabis
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:23.080]  legalization movement in California for just as long and what he said was you
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:26.960]  know kind of wacky and I wanted to set some some truth and straighten that out
[2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:34.320]  of it there's no such thing as weaponized marijuana to begin with well we
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:40.920]  have is we have people crossing strains that have to say 12% THC with strains
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:47.960]  that have 16% THC and then upping this the THC to say 14% and they keep doing
[2:57:47.960 --> 2:57:53.120]  that and you know we've gotten it to about 22% 24% is about the highest
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:58.240]  percentage of THC in cannabis today here's my take on it I know the
[2:57:58.240 --> 2:58:01.720]  concentration has gone up and I think it's it's been going up for a while
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:05.600]  because this always happens with prohibition the problem is not marijuana
[2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:11.520]  the problem is prohibition we saw the increase in alcohol potency during alcohol
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:15.040]  prohibition and of course we've seen the same thing with every drug that's
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:18.720]  being permitted and my personal take on it Josh is I think it's interesting that
[2:58:18.720 --> 2:58:23.320]  as we look at a global economy that can't be revived no matter what happens
[2:58:23.320 --> 2:58:27.400]  with cheap oil with free interest rates and as we look at depression are they
[2:58:27.400 --> 2:58:31.040]  going to bring it back as kind of a distraction like they did when they
[2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:34.640]  legalized alcohol the second time hang on we're gonna continue with your calls
[2:58:34.640 --> 2:58:37.560]  right after the break thank you

[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:55.400]  uh naples for mars area i talked to alex about a month ago and uh linel was on
[3:00:55.400 --> 3:00:59.600]  the same time and linel had mentioned that he had a buddy up in new york that's
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:05.040]  a musician that reaches people and he was uh saying that if we started doing
[3:01:05.040 --> 3:01:08.000]  like concerts and things like that reach people through music and through
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:13.720]  families do family events and what i had proposed to alex was to have like a
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:18.040]  freedom and constitutional truth tour with the people and have like william
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:22.400]  ellison ted new jim and do a family thing but invite all the sheriffs and
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:26.800]  police in the united states to join us at these events to talk about the
[3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:31.560]  constitution to talk about america and our values and morals as you know just
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:36.840]  making a family uh event and alex said that it would get co-opted you know how
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:41.360]  everything does but i believe when we do it in a family atmosphere and not a
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:47.200]  protest but a parade you know where it's fun it's you know well it's true yeah
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:51.760]  william elson did farm eight years ago it's a great way to uh reach people when
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:55.400]  you do it with entertainment with family that's that's a good idea i'll pass that
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:02:00.840]  on thanks uh was there anything else you wanted to say okay thanks uh let's go
[3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:06.940]  to robert in california robert hello david this is robert uh i served in the
[3:02:06.940 --> 3:02:11.080]  navy you know and i just wanted to thank you a lot of people thank alex for all
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:15.040]  the hard work he's doing but i want to thank you jacari jackson and all the
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:18.320]  other guys there info wars because you guys are doing a great job well thanks
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:23.240]  we wouldn't be doing anything else if we had a choice even though go ahead so i
[3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:28.160]  was i was on board nuclear submarines for about eight years one of my main
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:33.560]  duties was the purification of water for the reactor for potable water and for
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:38.440]  the whole ship and we also created our own oxygen and we were able to survive
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:43.720]  down there and it kind of taught me a lot and getting out of the navy i wasn't
[3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:47.520]  really following alex and somebody referred me to him and i remember him
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:51.840]  talking about water fluoridation and and at the time it was kind of new to me so
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:56.800]  but when i speak to people they they seem skeptical that the government or
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:01.360]  whoever could put something like that in the water and it must be good for you
[3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:06.040]  well water isn't simple if you study water chemistry the book that we had in
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:09.800]  the navy was actually two volumes and they're about a foot and a half thick
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:15.400]  and so there's a lot to water and it's not simple and halogens like fluoride
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:19.240]  don't belong in your water and they don't they're not good for thyroid and so
[3:03:19.240 --> 3:03:23.040]  for anybody out there who's still skeptical no absolutely no robert it
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:26.680]  was interesting when i was in Denmark covering bill deberg i had someone come
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:30.560]  up to me he goes yeah i recommend your program to people and they just can't
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:34.200]  believe what alex is saying they can't believe that anybody would put fluoride
[3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:38.320]  in the public water system and i think one of the things that we need to do to
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:42.080]  explain to people who are skeptical about this and say okay let's forget for a
[3:03:42.080 --> 3:03:46.440]  moment whether fluoride is safe or effective let's talk about a safe and
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:50.960]  effective medicine take your pick would you put it in the water supply knowing
[3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:55.200]  that you can't have any control over the dosage that a baby is going to get the
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:00.600]  same dosage as an adult male that's a very stupid dangerous proposition so
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:04.400]  anybody that wants to talk about fluoride i would start it at that point
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:06.920]  thank you robert let's go to a bob in california trying to go through these
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:10.040]  calls quickly go ahead bob
