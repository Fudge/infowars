[04:26.240 --> 04:31.000]  and over again it's alleged that mr. Madoff did this it's alleged and finally
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  one congressperson said wait a minute this is an alleged he's confessed on
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.720]  national television and then they just said look executive privilege executive

[08:06.120 --> 08:13.560]  information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[08:15.360 --> 08:22.840]  The United States has been hijacked like every other major nation in the world
[08:22.840 --> 08:29.280]  by tyrants. Every other nation in the planet has been hijacked from time to
[08:29.280 --> 08:34.880]  time more often than not by tyrants and the very crew that has brought down
[08:34.880 --> 08:40.120]  hundreds of third world nations through fraud and then brought their
[08:40.120 --> 08:46.120]  populations into sharecropper bondage through fraudulent debt now has this
[08:46.120 --> 08:53.160]  nation a stranglehold. If they are able to use their pitch man their front man
[08:53.160 --> 09:01.000]  Barack Obama to sell further erosions of liberties and freedoms for security
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.040]  further wars expansions of the dictatorial power of the private banks
[09:06.040 --> 09:12.040]  they will succeed and as things get worse and worse they'll always say the
[09:12.040 --> 09:16.400]  same thing hey we're in a crisis give us everything we want give them everything
[09:16.400 --> 09:21.240]  they want things get worse hey we're in a crisis give us everything we want and
[09:21.240 --> 09:28.640]  then things get worse hey see things got worse give us even more and then things
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.240]  get worse remember hope and change and everything's gonna be great and then
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.840]  now Obama says pass this stimulus package over a trillion bucks for golf
[09:40.840 --> 09:46.280]  courses and yacht clubs and CPS kidnapping children and abortions funding
[09:46.280 --> 09:55.160]  amongst other things federalization of police or we will have a catastrophe we
[09:55.160 --> 10:00.080]  will have a depression and all these CEOs and bank heads line up and like a
[10:00.080 --> 10:08.240]  bunch of parrots a tree full of cockatoos chirping the same message but the
[10:08.240 --> 10:14.040]  polls are out upwards of 80% of the people are against the stimulus 98% in
[10:14.040 --> 10:18.280]  the major polls 1000 to 1 phone calls against the original banker takeover
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.800]  they got 20% of the public who thinks it's quote free money in a handout who
[10:23.800 --> 10:29.200]  are for it and I hear them calling in to talk radio they are so dumb down they
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.320]  are like lambs to the slaughter it's like hey we need this money hey we need to
[10:33.320 --> 10:38.280]  give this money to people to get things going again you've got to pay all that
[10:38.280 --> 10:43.880]  back in taxes you buffoons it's going to devalue what money you do have it's
[10:43.880 --> 10:48.680]  going to devalue the currency and your savings while you also have to pay it
[10:48.680 --> 10:56.400]  back you understand that but they don't care criminals parasites at every level
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.000]  of government know that the globalists are completely imploding the West as
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.680]  they've done the third world so they're just busy snatching and grabbing
[11:05.680 --> 11:21.960]  whatever they can as fast as they can mad off whistleblower testifies blast the
[11:21.960 --> 11:30.640]  sec all things considered February 4 2009 when Bernard mad off was arrested
[11:30.640 --> 11:35.880]  and charged with running a giant Ponzi scheme many people were shocked but not
[11:35.880 --> 11:42.480]  Harry Marco Polos he's the man who looked at mad off's investment returns
[11:42.480 --> 11:50.120]  a decade ago and figured they didn't add up Marco Polos made several attempts
[11:50.120 --> 11:54.120]  were swayed the securities exchange commission investigate all for not he
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.600]  had no trouble Wednesday getting people to listen he told a congressional panel
[11:58.600 --> 12:02.920]  in Washington that the SCC is a failed regulator that was unable to protect
[12:02.920 --> 12:06.440]  investors well he said more than that I've just been too busy to go up to
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.280]  YouTube and grab all the select clips I watched a bunch of them last night we we
[12:10.280 --> 12:12.800]  may play some later in the show today we're certainly gonna post them up on
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.640]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com so see the media is kind of white
[12:16.640 --> 12:25.160]  washing what he really said Marco Polos said it took him just five minutes to
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.600]  figure out that made off was running a scam he only had to look at the
[12:29.600 --> 12:34.040]  performance chart for Bernard L made off investment securities yeah anytime you
[12:34.040 --> 12:39.800]  heard somebody say for 20 years or for 15 years or for 30 years like made off
[12:39.800 --> 12:47.000]  was claiming we have a 15 plus percent profit guaranteed you hear that you know
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.480]  it's a Ponzi scheme period and I hear it all the time with other scammers out
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.520]  there so if you hear that if you hear somebody say we have a guaranteed
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.800]  investment that decade a decade will give you 15 plus percent every time run
[13:02.800 --> 13:13.320]  don't walk run run screaming warning people in the other direction it was a
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.560]  45 degree angle without any variation he said it went in only one direction up it
[13:18.560 --> 13:25.280]  never had variation like the market does like this that was a key tip off
[13:25.280 --> 13:29.400]  Marco Polos and his staff did some more digging and came to the conclusion that
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.160]  made off was cheating his investors as the investment went on Marco Polos said
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.400]  he feared for his safety and that of his family so he presented his findings
[13:38.400 --> 13:41.800]  anonymously the Securities and Change Commission only a few officials knew his
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.480]  real name he said he kept returning to the SEC to figure to urge it to take up
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.920]  the case and was repeatedly ignored unfortunately as they didn't respond to
[13:52.920 --> 13:59.200]  my written submissions in 2000 2001 2005 2007 2008 here we are today Marco
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.800]  Polos said meanwhile made-offs operations grew bigger and he attracted more
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.040]  investors you have to in a Ponzi scheme Marco Polos said he made it clear to the
[14:10.040 --> 14:16.400]  congressional panel that he thinks the SEC fell down on the job I gift wrapped
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.000]  and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them it's not the largest
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.360]  Ponzi scheme social security the Defense Department the comprehensive annual
[14:24.360 --> 14:31.480]  financial reports those are the biggest Ponzi schemes in history okay fractional
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.960]  reserve banking itself is I gift wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.920]  in history to them and somehow they couldn't be bothered to conduct a
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.240]  thorough and proper investigation because they were too busy on matters of
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.440]  higher priority said if a 50 billion dollar Ponzi scheme doesn't make the
[14:47.440 --> 14:51.200]  SEC priority list then I want to know what sets their priorities let me tell
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.040]  you what sets their priorities we leaked this a year and a half ago just as much
[14:57.040 --> 15:00.840]  as I was allowed to say and then when it came out in the New York Times two months
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.640]  ago I covered it Mark Cuban who made billions of dollars three billion
[15:05.640 --> 15:13.520]  dollars selling a system to Yahoo and who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball
[15:13.520 --> 15:26.760]  team in a Hollywood production studio he called Charlie Sheena and said I hear
[15:26.760 --> 15:31.080]  you might be working on this loose change final cut film voicing it I'd like to
[15:31.080 --> 15:36.680]  release that through my production house 2929 and it was basically a done deal
[15:36.680 --> 15:42.000]  and then internally with no one even knowing this was going on because we
[15:42.000 --> 15:51.720]  were being surveilled one of the producers had a Air Force general who is
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.560]  the brother-in-law come to his house and say your children aren't safe if you do
[15:55.560 --> 16:00.800]  this and he's like well how do you know about this they said we know that's how
[16:00.800 --> 16:04.280]  real these terrorists are folks that's how real they are that's when you know
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.880]  it's real it's when they start doing this stuff and then we heard that they
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.360]  were threatening Mark Cuban secretly but that he was still gonna go ahead with
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.800]  it then they go public bill O'Reilly comes out and says you'll be destroyed
[16:18.800 --> 16:27.360]  don't do it like a mafia gangster machine and Cuban then the SEC sends an
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.960]  email and a phone call this is now the New York Times saying if you do this
[16:31.960 --> 16:38.240]  we're gonna open SEC investigations on you and your stock trading and they did
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.600]  it and it was a year investigation and they indicted Mark Cuban for selling a
[16:42.600 --> 16:45.600]  couple hundred thousand the guys worth billions and billions of his own stock
[16:45.600 --> 16:51.000]  something totally legal and he said I'm gonna fight you and he the fights on
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.720]  going so this is what goes on in America they listen to my phones they
[16:57.720 --> 17:01.560]  listen to Charlie Sheen's phones they follow me around they death threat me
[17:01.560 --> 17:07.400]  they call my wife up and threaten her the new orders real folks not just all
[17:07.400 --> 17:10.840]  the research in the data in the end and now the news open you know the Wall
[17:10.840 --> 17:13.920]  Street Journal saying the new world order is a great thing and will save us
[17:13.920 --> 17:18.080]  that's basically word for word and the North American Union is real and we're
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.000]  gonna take over the dollar and merge everything and set up a new form of
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.920]  government where you don't have any checks and balances or liberty they
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.040]  don't tell you that part but they go on to say in the Financial Times of London
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.280]  that yes now it's time for world government and the world government had
[17:30.280 --> 17:33.520]  to keep this secret from you but it's for your own good and yes it's
[17:33.520 --> 17:43.600]  dictatorial it's dictatorial you don't run anything and meanwhile the public was
[17:43.600 --> 17:47.280]  told for decades it didn't exist so they're hearing it on TV that it exists
[17:47.280 --> 17:51.000]  now and they're still you they're engaged in double think they say it
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.120]  exists and it is the answer to our problems but simultaneously I'm an
[17:55.120 --> 18:02.620]  evil kook liar you know this is quite a game of psychological
[18:02.620 --> 18:07.640]  brinksmanship I know they can set me up kill me anytime go after my family and
[18:07.640 --> 18:11.720]  I've just committed and just say you know God it's in your hands and then I've

[26:32.880 --> 26:36.240]  paragraphs with our link to it I want to cover this in the next segment one of

[26:40.440 --> 26:45.480]  you so much I just printed from the original source the post-cazette because
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.360]  I only have part of it just a few paragraphs over there I read it last
[26:48.360 --> 26:52.920]  night in entirety it's somewhere here but I can't find it so we'll cover that
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.600]  coming up in the next segment and maybe you don't want to hear about all this but
[26:57.600 --> 27:03.640]  you need to know that criminals have almost completely converted the upper
[27:03.640 --> 27:07.560]  echelons of federal state regional government county and city government
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.440]  and they're now finishing the phase of removing mid-level and low-level
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.800]  employees who are involved in crime and soon they will have a complete
[27:17.800 --> 27:22.200]  tyranny in place and then look out because they're all hungry they don't
[27:22.200 --> 27:25.240]  just want your money your house your land your business they want to dominate
[27:25.240 --> 27:30.840]  you their control freaks you know I put a private investigator on the local
[27:30.840 --> 27:36.520]  access TV cable board and because they were trying to shut it down it's the
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.800]  birthplace of access three years ago went to court did a lot of other stuff and
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.160]  that the director was sent to Huntsville prison for stealing what 350
[27:45.160 --> 27:48.800]  something thousand dollars now we knew it was more like a million we know who
[27:48.800 --> 27:54.520]  the other people were I even went into meetings as an investigator bluffed
[27:54.520 --> 27:59.640]  board members recorded them you know once we had enough evidence I went in
[27:59.640 --> 28:03.560]  with cat classic cop tactics and said we know you did this now go ahead and tell
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.760]  us what you did the city didn't want any of that past the director then I got
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.560]  death threats by the way but that's a daily occurrence no big deal I had one
[28:14.560 --> 28:17.960]  guy come up and put me in the chest at a telecommunications meeting and said you
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.560]  better watch it you're dead I just said oh look he just threatened me I mean
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.280]  that's who we're dealing with and it it went up into the telecommunications
[28:27.280 --> 28:32.240]  group it went into the city and they're just all in there in the city of
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.520]  Austin stealing everywhere and so because we had this guy red handed they
[28:37.520 --> 28:45.400]  sent him to prison red handed and they burned him and he shut up and he's
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.920]  about to get out of prison I think I'm like a ten-year sentence or something
[28:49.920 --> 28:55.320]  but I think he's supposed to be out this year so I mean don't tell me there's not
[28:55.320 --> 29:01.160]  corruption all I've seen is corruption and there's just thousands and thousands
[29:01.160 --> 29:06.400]  and thousands of cases that are so horrible and so incredible that I have
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.680]  trouble even believing it now or all the police corrupt or all the bureaucrats
[29:12.680 --> 29:16.280]  corrupt or all the social workers corrupt no but their bosses that their
[29:16.280 --> 29:21.400]  directives their mission is evil and they've incrementally twisted them a
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.080]  lot of decent men and women who are weak-minded into carrying out evil and

[35:06.640 --> 35:10.360]  to pay for her we've got a you know we've got to pay for her children she's
[35:10.360 --> 35:14.800]  evil she's bad you know whether it was a good decision or not for her to make
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.360]  when the family's middle class and the grandparents are paying for it that
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.720]  doesn't matter the point is they're selling the idea that children are bad
[35:22.720 --> 35:27.600]  and simultaneously hundreds of news articles on Fox TV and BBC about
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.800]  environmentalism and carbon footprint we've got to get past the taboo of
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.200]  saying that there's you know that we can't talk about population reduction
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.000]  we've got to do it we've got to get our numbers down and the only group that
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.480]  listens to that is the educated population higher IQs on average because
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.400]  there is a kernel of truth to it at least in this current technological
[35:51.400 --> 35:58.280]  system and so it is the people that don't care the people that don't have
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.120]  high IQs the people that don't have high educations that do have the children
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.600]  so and the establishment knew that when they did the four-year report from 45
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.360]  to 49 in England the Royal Commission on Population and then Kissinger's
[36:12.360 --> 36:18.840]  memorandum 200 CIA State Department 73 they know that globalist policies
[36:18.840 --> 36:22.240]  actually keep the third world deindustrialized where they can never
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.160]  be industrialized and that actually causes a blooming of population but
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.640]  they said they want to do that to hold them down industrially so they can be
[36:31.640 --> 36:34.680]  controlled by the New World Order and their resources and that they will then
[36:34.680 --> 36:39.640]  come in with soft kill weapons sterilization abortion forced abortion
[36:39.640 --> 36:46.520]  to reduce the third world response to being and starving squalor to having
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.840]  more children so these high and mighty globalist up there talking about how they
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.880]  want to save the earth all day they just want to tax your carbon footprint that
[36:55.880 --> 36:59.680]  has nothing to do with the health of the earth other than the fact that plants
[36:59.680 --> 37:04.720]  grow faster and are healthier if there is more carbon dioxide the ocean has
[37:04.720 --> 37:08.760]  billions of times depending on which study you look at how many billions of
[37:08.760 --> 37:18.520]  times all the carbon dioxide that is put out by humans it's ridiculous the
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.160]  ocean is made up of carbon dioxide and you say Alex what does that have to do
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.800]  with abortions well hmm once they sell us that human life is a bad thing and
[37:28.800 --> 37:32.880]  that human life is a negative life is no longer just cheap as it's been
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.360]  throughout history it's a liability and so we think of ourselves as bad and we
[37:38.360 --> 37:42.920]  think of other humans as bad and so we don't mind when we hear a million three
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.840]  hundred thousand Iraqis are dead in the last six years almost a million plus
[37:47.840 --> 37:53.760]  before that in the 14 years of siege we don't care when we hear about old folks
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.840]  basically being chained down and euthanized with morphine all over the
[37:57.840 --> 38:00.520]  country is reported by the Wall Street Journal and other publications it's on
[38:00.520 --> 38:04.800]  record they can even talk they beg for food and water please honey give me water
[38:04.800 --> 38:12.200]  nope I'm sorry the states now you're a guardian and you sign those forms saying
[38:12.200 --> 38:17.160]  we were guardian and you're gonna die we're gonna dehydrate you be nicer just
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.880]  to put a bullet in their head and so the point is there is a great evil already
[38:21.880 --> 38:30.640]  all around us and there are thousands of people in fact I want to get some of
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.240]  these folks on the show I've seen them in television interviews I interviewed
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.840]  some years ago I know one of them is a beautiful blonde lady I forget her name
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.960]  interviewed her about a decade ago in fact send your tips help us remember all
[38:43.960 --> 38:47.920]  their names and I could do a Google search myself and find them but who you
[38:47.920 --> 38:53.920]  recommend to Joey V at info wars dot com and we'll have some of the abortion
[38:53.920 --> 38:59.280]  survivors on there's thousands because pro livers know what's going on and they
[38:59.280 --> 39:04.480]  lurk around that's what the media says they lurk around late-term abortion
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.600]  facilities that are in more than 40 states and they've been arrested for
[39:09.600 --> 39:14.080]  pulling babies out of the trash cans and they put up bar bar fences around the
[39:14.080 --> 39:18.920]  dumpsters and so but the pro livers learned how to throw a rug over the
[39:18.920 --> 39:21.880]  bar bar and how to get over and they get caught up and stuff and they dig
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.480]  around the trash every day when they can and they get the dead babies out and
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.360]  try to give them proper burials or they try to bring media attention to it but
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.440]  it's disrespectful to the human or more often than not they end up finding a
[39:34.440 --> 39:39.400]  live baby now a lot of times the babies all cut up and sliced up or burned from
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.360]  the salts they put into induce the abortion and so the baby doesn't to
[39:43.360 --> 39:47.920]  survive and then the pro livers get in trouble how dare you try to save a baby
[39:47.920 --> 39:51.880]  now what they do with a partial birth abortion is they go ahead and pull the
[39:51.880 --> 39:56.200]  baby out on the table and they stick a knife in the back of its head and they
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.480]  stick a vacuum cleaner in and suck its brains out a suction system similar what
[40:00.480 --> 40:03.880]  you have at the dentist more powerful that they used to suck the saliva and
[40:03.880 --> 40:07.080]  the tritus out of your mouth when they're cleaning your teeth or doing a
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.920]  root canal and you don't like to hear this grow up this is what we're doing to
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.360]  humanity and when you do that to the weakest of us old people unborn babies
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.440]  newborn babies you better believe you're gonna start having police brutality
[40:20.440 --> 40:23.200]  you better believe they're gonna start shooting people for no reason you better
[40:23.200 --> 40:26.520]  believe they're gonna start putting you in FEMA camps Hitler did all this with
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.840]  abortions and infanticide and forced abortions and killing the infirm and
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.400]  getting rid of the old do you got it it's called eugenics it's the new world
[40:34.400 --> 40:39.680]  order belief system you're under it the bioethics boards these unelected medical
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.120]  courts hand out death sentences every five seconds
[40:47.440 --> 40:55.520]  but many times the babies don't make it now what happens is there have been
[40:55.520 --> 41:01.480]  confirmed cases what one in Missouri a few years ago where these abortuary
[41:01.480 --> 41:05.000]  people admit their Satanist to the news they admit it's a sacrifice when they
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.160]  kill the babies the offices stink there's blood everywhere they nurses that
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.920]  are new and you know it usually comes out when a new hires there who hasn't
[41:14.920 --> 41:20.600]  been in partial birth abortion and who rationalized that it was just tissue even
[41:20.600 --> 41:26.200]  though when the babies a half inch long it's got fingerprints a brain a heart a
[41:26.200 --> 41:31.440]  mind a soul they go in there and they walk into the back rooms and there's
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.240]  just babies gasping and dying they put them in freezing rooms because a lot of
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.760]  times even these killers don't like having to suck the brains out it kind
[41:40.760 --> 41:43.840]  of freaks them out so they they let them die slow that's kind of like the old
[41:43.840 --> 41:47.120]  people when they just tie them down and don't give them water with the
[41:47.120 --> 41:52.280]  dehydration everybody when I talk about that comes to mind Terry Shiva who they
[41:52.280 --> 41:55.640]  could debate whether she had you know he wouldn't let him brush her teeth for
[41:55.640 --> 41:59.200]  decades or whatever you know that could be debated whether she was a vegetable or
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.800]  not so they introduced dehydration of the world through her knowing that for
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.720]  decades they've been dehydrating people chained down begging for water and food
[42:06.720 --> 42:13.120]  on record Wall Street Journal series remember that and see how they introduce
[42:13.120 --> 42:20.720]  things to you learn their tactics state may compensate juveniles sentenced by
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.400]  judges I'm gonna get to that in a minute but first I wanted to get to this
[42:26.400 --> 42:35.560]  Florida doctor investigated in badly botched abortion this is not botched 18
[42:35.560 --> 42:38.160]  and pregnant
[42:40.200 --> 42:46.240]  Cycrelina Williams went to an abortion clinic outside Miami and paid 1200 for
[42:46.240 --> 42:55.280]  Dr. Pierre Jean Jacques to terminate her 23 week pregnancy three days later she
[42:55.280 --> 42:59.480]  sat in a reclining chair medicated to dilate her cervix and otherwise get
[42:59.480 --> 43:03.640]  ready for the procedure and with the doctor didn't arrive in time according
[43:03.640 --> 43:06.560]  to Williams in the Florida Department of Health she went into labor and
[43:06.560 --> 43:15.920]  delivered to the live baby girl now I love how once the baby's born it's a
[43:15.920 --> 43:21.400]  human being or if somebody shoots a seven month pregnant person and she
[43:21.400 --> 43:26.120]  loses the baby they charge him with murder this is the double think world
[43:26.120 --> 43:32.360]  we live in now the baby's born it's time to die imagine people think of Satan
[43:32.360 --> 43:36.280]  is killing a newborn baby and it's so evil it's so horrible it's people can't
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.680]  even believe it goes on though it does throughout history but then when we
[43:39.680 --> 43:43.000]  think about them chopping up a little baby after it's born it's like oh well
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.080]  of course that's very reasonable see you're engaged in double thing you've
[43:47.080 --> 43:49.920]  been brainwashed folks you got to break your conditioning and then suddenly you
[43:49.920 --> 43:56.760]  see it everywhere you see the hypocrisy in the fraud what Williams and the health
[43:56.760 --> 44:00.120]  department say happen next has shocked people on both sides of the abortion
[44:00.120 --> 44:05.120]  debate no it has it this is what they do one of the clinic's owners who has no
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.160]  medical license cut the infants and billy cord Williams said the woman placed
[44:09.160 --> 44:13.880]  the baby in a plastic biohazard bag and threw it out and there wasn't a pro
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.480]  lifer because most of them are in jail there to get it out of the trash that's
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.800]  standard folks see if the doctor would have been there that has sucked the
[44:23.800 --> 44:28.560]  brains and then it wouldn't have been a problem police recovered the decomposing
[44:28.560 --> 44:32.640]  remains in a cardboard box a week later after getting anonymous tips I don't care
[44:32.640 --> 44:35.760]  see somebody in the in the abortion where he did have a problem with this
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.080]  well you had a problem killing it when it was born why are you killing it five
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.760]  minutes before you know they induce labor and bring the baby out with its
[44:43.760 --> 44:46.920]  legs and as soon as the head crashed and they pull it out they just hold it
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.880]  they say as long as the baby's touching the woman in legalese so they kill it
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.320]  holding it up against her sorry you don't want to hear this but it's what's
[44:55.320 --> 45:00.360]  going on I don't care what your politics are what your morals are this should not
[45:00.360 --> 45:05.520]  be happening in our community said Tom Pinnacob a Miami attorney representing
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.120]  Williams in her lawsuit against the doctor and the clinic owners the state
[45:10.120 --> 45:15.640]  he's not a doctor he's an executioner the state board of medicine is to hear the
[45:15.640 --> 45:21.280]  doctor's case in Tampa on Friday and determine whether to strip his license
[45:21.280 --> 45:28.120]  well what about the person that killed the baby by exposure the state attorney's
[45:28.120 --> 45:32.560]  homicide division is investigating no charges have been filed Terry Chavez a
[45:32.560 --> 45:35.620]  spokesman with the Miami-Dade County state's attorney's office said this week
[45:35.620 --> 45:39.960]  that prosecutors were nearing a decision you know that people rioted when
[45:39.960 --> 45:43.440]  that poor black guy got killed execution style in the back and then the cop beat
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.120]  him up after he shot him because he got frustrated and then they confiscated the
[45:47.120 --> 45:50.240]  videos and then lied and said that the guy attacked the cop and then turned out
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.920]  he hadn't videos got leaked I wonder if folks will riot over this baby now they
[45:54.920 --> 46:01.600]  won't the doctor's lawyer Joseph Harrison called the allegations at best
[46:01.600 --> 46:05.520]  misguided and complete in an email the Associated Press he didn't provide
[46:05.520 --> 46:12.520]  details and it goes on and on and on the case says rile the anti-abortion
[46:12.520 --> 46:17.520]  community which contends the clinic's actions constitute murder the baby was
[46:17.520 --> 46:24.040]  just treated as a piece of garbage said Tom Brad Jacha president of the Thomas
[46:24.040 --> 46:27.600]  Moore Society a law firm that is also representing Williams people all over the
[46:27.600 --> 46:32.400]  community are just a guest even those who support abortion rights are concerned
[46:32.400 --> 46:35.720]  about the allegations it really disturbs me why because you are a
[46:35.720 --> 46:39.480]  delusional person because you've lived in the La La Land and don't know this is
[46:39.480 --> 46:45.720]  murdered I mean well let's give you it really disturbs me said Joni Steiner
[46:45.720 --> 46:49.960]  Steiner president of the Bowerd County chapter the National Organization for
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.960]  Women after reviewing the administrative complaint against the doctor I know that
[46:54.960 --> 46:59.240]  there are clinics out there like this see they're admitting it and I hope that
[46:59.240 --> 47:02.760]  we can keep women from going to these types of clinics hey how about we keep
[47:02.760 --> 47:08.240]  women from ripping babies out of their wombs and by the way depending on the
[47:08.240 --> 47:14.360]  study it gives you a 50 to 200 percent depending on the trimester increase
[47:14.360 --> 47:20.760]  in cervical ovarian and other forms of reproductive organ cancer when you have
[47:20.760 --> 47:24.320]  an abortion let me give you a little news flash if the baby needs to die your
[47:24.320 --> 47:32.560]  body will terminate if things aren't going right 99% of the time if your
[47:32.560 --> 47:38.120]  body's in danger the body will do it so so women just need to know you've had a
[47:38.120 --> 47:41.960]  abortion that's a good chance that you get in cancer it's also associated with
[47:41.960 --> 47:48.200]  breast cancer why don't you have the baby and adopt it hell if you end up
[47:48.200 --> 47:51.040]  having the baby and keeping it you'll have to fight CPS off anyways I mean
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.720]  they want CC I mean you know they're killing babies with one hand and then
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.440]  they're CPSing them with another well that's see if they can't get the baby
[48:00.440 --> 48:04.120]  dead while it's in the womb they want to get the kid on drugs screw them up
[48:04.120 --> 48:07.800]  after they're out and that's in their own documents a little mindless scumbag
[48:07.800 --> 48:11.240]  social workers don't know that you know either their pedophiles or they just
[48:11.240 --> 48:13.960]  like the money or they were beat up when they were kids and think everybody's
[48:13.960 --> 48:17.800]  their mommy and daddy they're out there paying them back and it goes on and on
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.400]  she came face-to-face with a human being and that changed everything the
[48:21.400 --> 48:24.920]  Department of Health accounts continues as follows just before noon she began to
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.920]  fill ill the clinic contracted the doctor two hours later she hadn't shown up he
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.280]  hadn't shown up William Flynn to labor and deliver the baby she came face to
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.520]  face with a human being yeah and her instincts were completely bent she wanted
[48:37.520 --> 48:40.480]  to keep maybe going out and partying and stuff why didn't you say give him my
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.240]  baby you know at least when you saw the baby and your instincts kicked in but
[48:44.240 --> 48:47.600]  no the new order was too powerful she came face to face with the human being
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.440]  and that changed everything the complaint says one of the clinic owners
[48:52.440 --> 48:57.200]  bellicose Gonzales came in and cut the umbilical cord with scissors and placed
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.000]  the baby in a plastic bag and the bag in the trash can God can you imagine being
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.800]  this Gonzales guy how horrible his life must be I got newsflash for everybody
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.000]  you do reap what you sow and you you get two judgments folks you're gonna be
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  judged in this life everything bad I've done has come back on me and everything
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.080]  good I've done is come back on me and so whereas I have an instinct and a spirit
[49:19.080 --> 49:22.760]  to want to be good and to love goodness I still flip over and do bad things
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.080]  sometimes and let me tell you I fear God called the spirit of the universe
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.280]  whatever you want the point is you will be brought to justice make no mistake
[49:33.280 --> 49:38.880]  Gonzales Gonzales is gonna wonder why he gets cancer why he has car wrecks why
[49:38.880 --> 49:43.480]  he loses his family he's gonna wonder why his life is so unhappy because you
[49:43.480 --> 49:51.160]  are a demon that's why because the universe doesn't like you understand
[49:51.160 --> 49:59.080]  that Williams lawsuit offers a cruder account she says Gonzales knocked the
[49:59.080 --> 50:07.000]  baby from the recliner chair where she gave birth onto the floor do you hear
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.240]  that you see when they dehumanize something they've got a they got to be
[50:11.240 --> 50:14.960]  hateful to it it's like I've seen cops breaking abortion protesters arms and
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.120]  then they'll pull out a club and start going after him again it's like oh I
[50:18.120 --> 50:21.400]  broke your arm and it kind of excites them I've got that in my martial law
[50:21.400 --> 50:27.120]  film the baby's umbilical cord was not clamped allowing her to bleed out
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.000]  Gonzales scooped the baby well sent an afterbath into a red plastic biohazard
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.080]  bag and threw it out just give me that baby I'm throwing it on the ground no
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.360]  working telephone can be found for Gonzales and an attorney who represented

[56:28.440 --> 56:34.440]  businessman Greg Sopala and goes on to say the judges could each face prison
[56:34.440 --> 56:39.000]  terms of seven years and three months according to the terms of the plea
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  agreements they signed last week no charges have been filed against the
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.480]  person that made the payoffs and what was it for they would just take innocent
[56:49.480 --> 56:53.000]  children there for no reason and give them criminal convictions to send them
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.440]  into the system and that goes on right here in Austin there people will be late
[56:57.440 --> 57:01.240]  to class three times in the government training camps and covering this for
[57:01.240 --> 57:06.680]  more than 12 years and they will call you in the portable buildings on so many

[57:14.720 --> 57:20.560]  on probation for three absences then the next time they do anything wrong of any
[57:20.560 --> 57:24.160]  just the smallest thing they are sent to juvenile there in the system and then
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.080]  federal money flows but the kickbacks go because a lot of these homes and
[57:29.080 --> 57:33.360]  prisons and facilities are private they then make payoffs and we know what's
[57:33.360 --> 57:41.080]  going on here and they just don't care so APD out of how to get artists of

[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:52.280]  the Madoff thing first broke you said that you had intel from inside sources
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:56.120]  because you know you've had the biggest financial newsletter out there for
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.840]  decades and retired brought it back the biggest private golden silver broker out
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:04.520]  there military intelligence a lot of subscribers in the State Department the
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:11.120]  Pentagon and you said that you had inside intel that it was a APAC scam they
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:15.600]  were laundering the money out through these admitted pro-Israel charities and
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:19.920]  that he was just the front man because their Ponzi scheme got out of control
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:23.440]  that's why he's allowed to be on house arrest with his own security guards and
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:28.760]  even get his jewelry out money out and that it could be connected into the
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:32.520]  White House and that's part of APAC buying off politicians that is now
[1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:37.520]  starting to come out in the news and now the FCC lawyer clams up on Madoff
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:42.360]  scandal sites executive privilege national security yesterday and that
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:48.400]  dovetails with the whistleblower since 99 going to them and saying he was
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:51.600]  concerned for his family and that basically believe the SEC was covering
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:55.600]  up for Madoff the media spins that and says that they were just dumb or that
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:58.560]  he's saying they were fools now I watch the testimony he's saying they're
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:02.280]  involved and now they've declared national security what's that sound like to
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:07.600]  you Bob Chapman the international forecaster giant cover up same old
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:12.520]  same old the last guy in there he was bad this one's just as bad and you know
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:16.680]  we're just not going to get to the bottom of anything it's like Congress the
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:21.000]  ones who are in compromise to bought off and get about 50 guys and gals and they
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.880]  who do the right thing and that's it and we just have no place to go it is the
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:30.840]  way I said it was several weeks ago and there's a whole bunch of people involved
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:36.240]  and nothing's going to come out it is one of the great and in the figures not
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:43.920]  50 it's a hundred billion oh so we're incredible and you know they're going to
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:48.800]  catch some poor soul shoplifting and they give them six months but me give me a
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:55.080]  break these guys it's been stealing billions trillions well remember how
[1:02:55.080 --> 1:03:00.240]  when Mark Cuban was going to produce the new loose change film it's down the New
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:04.400]  York Times we what we said was confirmed they called him and emailed him and
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:08.760]  said we're going to file an SEC complaint as an SEC lawyer on you for this
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:12.600]  and they did it for just selling some of his stock a few hundred thousand
[1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:16.720]  dollars worth and it was completely kosher and now they've indicted him so
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:20.160]  we know what the SEC does they go around harassing people that try to tell the
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:26.880]  truth well let me tell you something they have been they were harassing me
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:32.880]  since 1967 trying to put me out of business as stockbroker I mean I went
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:38.080]  through the middle of Hades for years I perpetually had three sets of oddities
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:43.400]  in my office trying to find some way to bag me and then later when they couldn't
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:48.320]  find anything they started to threaten me you know if you don't cooperate you're
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:52.200]  gonna have a serious problem this sort of thing that you told me I got calls
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:55.920]  about you know if you keep it up you ain't gonna be around you told me you
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:03.720]  had a White House official tell you just give us money yes that's true so absolutely
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:08.840]  true so so the bureaucracy is there to go after real businesses mainline people
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:15.000]  playing by the rules the big boys are immune I have beyond two sets of jurist
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.120]  adjures prudence one for them and one for us
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:26.120]  well I'll tell you Bob it just it just goes from bad to worse but the good
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:29.920]  news is a lot of people are finally waking up they're finally figuring it
[1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:35.480]  out and that's what this is all about Alex that's why you do what you do and
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:40.360]  I do what I do so hard because we've got to let the people know and we're
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:47.400]  reaching them all over the world and we should be happy that we can do that we
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:52.720]  can still do that and I only wish there were others like us who would step in and
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:58.560]  do the same thing because we need you badly stay there Bob Chapman will talk

[1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:13.560]  parasites are the most toxic agents in the human body they are one of the
[1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:17.640]  primary underlying causes of diseases and are the most basic cause of a
[1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:23.040]  compromised immune system dr. hazel parcels phd quote we have a tremendous
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:28.000]  parasite problem right here in the u.s. it is just not being addressed dr.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:32.280]  peter weiner quote in terms of numbers there are more parasitic infections

[1:07:57.280 --> 1:08:04.880]  life and psia I really like it he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on
[1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:13.320]  the GCN Radio Network Bob Chapman dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others we would
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:17.480]  have big arguments not tuning my horn but six eight nine months ago I would say
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:21.560]  that I believe we were gonna hit the depression in late 2009 I saw it coming
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:27.080]  in a year year and a half they saw it for sure coming within two to three years
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.720]  and now Bob and dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others are now revising that you know
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:35.960]  saying we'll look I mean we're just guaranteeing that it was gonna happen if
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:39.160]  things continue like this within three years it certainly could happen quicker
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:43.440]  so they're not wrong they were just being conservative now since we had you
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:47.520]  on a few weeks ago it looks like it's accelerating even more Bob so break down
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:52.560]  what's currently happening this new bad bank they're creating dr. Stan Monteef
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:57.560]  made a great point yesterday that all they've done is claim that you know shut
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:02.320]  down the economy put out bad news destroy confidence then cut off lending get
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:06.520]  trillions and trillions of dollars in the US tens of trillions globally out of
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:13.120]  the people's coffers then they told corporations and banks you can buy now
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:17.080]  you know put your money in the Federal Reserve with interest and then that made
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:22.880]  any available money flow into the central banks so they literally hoard the
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:26.600]  money loan out some of it and then people give it right back to them to get
[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:31.160]  interest just ensuring there will be no money out there floating around so this
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:36.440]  is all being done by design break it down well I think you broke broken it down
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:43.240]  pretty good the other factors here are the stimulus package and we don't know
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:47.960]  the exact form it's going to take yet but it'll probably be passed next week
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:51.840]  and the Republicans you're just making like they're doing something about
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:57.800]  something which they're really not and that'll probably last three six maybe
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:03.120]  nine months and it'll be over and they'll be back again and they'll probably
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:07.320]  get a trillion dollars a year to keep it going they're going to guarantee
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:12.200]  everybody's mortgage they're going to extend mortgages to 50 and 60 and 70
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:17.440]  years and the government's going to guarantee them the government is going
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:21.840]  to end up owning most real estate in the country probably about half of it when
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:31.920]  all is said and done and the the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have a real
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:37.200]  problem here and the problem is this they get interest rates down they get
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:45.860]  the the two-year rate on Treasury bills down to 0.70 or seven
[1:10:45.860 --> 1:10:54.000]  10 to 1% and they get the 10-year down to 216 well the two years now 0.94 which
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:02.880]  is not good for them and the 10-year is trading around 292 percent and what
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:07.960]  that means is mortgages have to go up in cost and they were hoping to keep those
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:13.600]  mortgages down between four and four and three-quarter percent I don't think
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:18.640]  that's going to be possible because of the tremendous amount of funding that
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:24.760]  has to be done by the US Treasury so far so for interbank lending it's going to
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:28.360]  be a low interest rate but for corporations even big ones airlines
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:35.480]  15 16% for the general public 10 15% so again a a complete double set of
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:40.720]  standards were for the globalist they get cheap money everybody else doesn't
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:47.640]  that's right and well even they're paying more but not as much as those who
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:53.480]  are not prime borrowers and the people who are not prime they can't get loans
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:58.240]  and but anyway going back so they're going to raise this two trillion dollars
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:04.560]  and of course even with all the money out there sloshy around in the world that
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:09.840]  owns approximately two trillion dollars where the Treasury is already and the
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:16.920]  Chinese who have 1.72 trillion dollars in Treasuries and Corporates Fannie's and
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:22.200]  Fannie Freddie's and that sort of thing they don't have the money to fund that so
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:25.520]  let me tell you what's going to happen and I think secretly they've been doing
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:29.280]  this already but of course it's a state secret and they're not going to tell you
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:34.480]  just like you just cited earlier in the program and what they're doing is the
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:41.720]  Treasury is printing up bonds and they are giving them to the Fed who in turn
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:48.000]  are creating money out of thin air and giving it back to the Treasury which the
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.400]  Treasury uses which is immediate monetization and it's very very
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:59.680]  inflationary and that's going to start clicking in March April May well Bob
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:04.320]  into the air Bob it's like it's gonna fly stop I don't want to interrupt I
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:07.080]  have to add this and I want you to finish up what you were saying you keep
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.640]  saying you think they're doing it and they are being totally secretive but
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:13.440]  then separately they'll also put out to their own people what they're doing the
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:16.440]  Washington Post in the New York Times I don't think you missed it because we've
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:20.840]  talked about before they admitted what a month and a half ago that the Fed was
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:27.360]  already quote testing secretly and preparing to issue its own bonds so
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:33.160]  that's true the only thing is they didn't say that they have done it and of
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:37.920]  course they're doing it and so it's going to get worse and worse because that
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:41.640]  trillion two trillion dollars is a drop in the bucket I mean they're going to
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:46.040]  have all kinds of responsibilities coming after that the one point three
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:53.880]  trillion dollar minimum budget deficit and do 93009 you know it could be as
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:59.080]  high as two two and a quarter trillion and that one point three is just a
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:03.400]  little bit higher I originally had projected that when people were caught
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:09.080]  talking about 500 billion but let's be clear but you know what that now I mean
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.960]  let's be clear though they're being secret where the trillions are going
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:15.960]  well it's going to their bodies so they can buy up more of the economy that's
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:19.880]  right that's absolutely correct okay you were getting into inflation when I
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:24.640]  interrupted you yeah the the inflation right now is running somewhere around
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:29.920]  10% and officially it's around around three and you can't look at the core
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:35.840]  figures because I don't mean anything and once this monetized debt starts
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:42.520]  hitting the economy which I gave you the months then inflation is going to take
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:47.720]  off again and people are going to say gee how did that happen well you know you
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:53.600]  this is a special area of economics that you know even people with masks is
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:15:01.480]  really don't get involved in it's an arcane area that is they teach very
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:08.960]  little about it at university and so the only way you learn this is by trudging
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:15.760]  through and working with it and at it for some time sometimes years I mean if
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:19.880]  you if you went to stockbrokers and asked them all about what we're talking
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:24.400]  about here 98% wouldn't know what I'm talking about I was about to add it's
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.760]  on record that all the major central banks and and then their their public
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:33.240]  fronts like to have a JP Morgan Chase and then it's got its fellow reserve
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:38.600]  component but it's public component is the you know JP Morgan Chase big banks
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:42.400]  like that that they have special banking schools once you become a real
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:45.800]  executive they send you off for six months ago now this is how it really
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:51.960]  works that's true the military has the same thing you know war college and
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:58.560]  things like that and of course academically it's getting your PhD but
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:05.880]  you're right and you know stockbroker is a salesman you know I was there for
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:13.760]  28 years and but what's going on today can is not going to solve the problem
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:20.720]  and they're extending this to some time frame that they want where they will
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:28.440]  allow deflation to take over from inflation in the whole house of cards
[1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:32.480]  will come tumbling down at the same time they're going to have their war well
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:38.120]  underway in the Middle East and when the two are ready that's when they'll do it
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:46.160]  and the outcome financially will be all the currencies will collapse and they'll
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:51.640]  be default devaluation almost all of them will do dreadfully there'll be a
[1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:58.400]  few that will do okay and in the meantime every single day every single
[1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:03.880]  currency is devaluing against gold I was about to say Jim or Jim Rogers is
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:08.520]  is and he's been right generally is saying exactly that every currency will
[1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:12.320]  implode in the next year to two and then the final one to fall will be the
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:20.880]  yawn but go ahead well the yawn I write about it for tomorrow's issue about the
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:24.560]  yawn getting weaker and then getting stronger and you have to read through it
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:30.520]  to understand the play-by-play it's like a baseball game maybe and this is the
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:36.120]  way it's going to happen or probably will happen China has 20 million people
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:42.360]  unemployed they do have problems it's all not sweetless and light over there
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:47.440]  and they're not going to be without their problems the whole world's going to
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:52.480]  suffer there's there going to be no escaping it and these elitists who
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:57.960]  believe that they can simultaneously drop all the currencies in the world
[1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:03.960]  finally because the fiat worthless and then go to another currency they're not
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:07.240]  going to get away with it I get letters from people from every country in the
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:11.200]  world practically telling me you're right and we're not going to put up with
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:14.880]  it and these representatives in our country who are working with the
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:20.080]  Illuminati we're not going to let them get away with it so I expect because I
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:23.880]  get letters like that that there's probably going to be revolutions in
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:29.080]  half the countries of the world well as a third world war going on the final
[1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:34.520]  revolution against humanity knowing this the elite and our own white papers
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:38.800]  know this they're still going ahead with it and there's no discussions of
[1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:42.320]  prosecutions there's no discussions of any of them getting in trouble instead
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:48.600]  they're put on the news as our saviors that's right what I what I thought was
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:57.240]  interesting was the in the interview in Congress of the gentleman who had been
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:19:03.320]  trying to expose us for ten years and he he said there please now all you people
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:07.640]  in the Russian mafia and all you drug deal is a lot your money I'm the good
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:12.920]  guy here I'm the guy that tried to save you so don't come after me I didn't do
[1:19:12.920 --> 1:19:19.040]  anything wrong and you know what does Congress do to zero I mean they don't
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:27.880]  want to go beyond that because they they know who is involved yeah he said some
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:34.120]  amazing things in the testimony and the none of it was on the news no they had a
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:40.840]  few clips of him you know making it look like the SEC were just buffoons when
[1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:44.160]  really they're there to make sure real legitimate business doesn't go on that
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:48.560]  everything has consolidated in the hands of the crime syndicate Bob Chapman's our

[1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:45.000]  they enjoy it they're into corruption and evil and power
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:48.120]  because they've all stabbed and killed and fought
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:53.240]  with each other to go to the top bob Chapman uh any comments about the
[1:33:53.240 --> 1:33:57.640]  control grid the technological tracking control grid they put in place
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:01.160]  no it uh it's not something i'm that familiar with so
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:07.000]  um i leave it to the other experts i only can be right about so many things
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.520]  no i hear you let's hurry through calls i can't spend five minutes to the next

[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:43.960]  i know it was a night um an inside job because i knew about it in the year
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:48.360]  2000 i had um i've been fired from my job because of it in the media
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:52.280]  i've had somebody attack me uh the police protected him
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:56.280]  and i just uh got escorted off the plane in southwest airlines because i found it
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:35:59.960]  they announced um in the air that it's a cashless plane
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:02.760]  and i think a whole bunch of other points but i heard you say you can't spend
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:07.880]  up that no no i listen i flew back from a trip on southwest airlines and it's a
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:11.880]  cashless plane everything is phasing that in that goes into this whole
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:15.160]  control grid but send me an email with your name and story maybe we should have
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:19.240]  you i think you a hard copy actually because my email
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:24.360]  was destroyed i wrote a letter to um to the senator and it actually and i
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:29.400]  worked with conspiracy and it actually stopped my computer out and put in dark
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:33.000]  letters do you really want to use this word gave you a box for yes or no
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.520]  okay where were you where were you working in the media on 9 11
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:41.320]  um i was working for hall communications uh uh w cty with the on-air dj i was
[1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:43.880]  the overnight dj i didn't even have that important of a job
[1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:47.720]  but i found out that there was a place called hypocrite's institute in west
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:49.960]  palm beach florida they had cures for disease
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:53.880]  and they told told me it was a conflict of interest while we were begging people
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:57.880]  for money please donate now we had actual information that we were not
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:00.360]  reporting to people about how cheers for disease
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:04.680]  okay how does that tie into 9 11 uh well because through
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:07.320]  wondering how these diabolicals how could people call it a conflict of
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:09.240]  interest i found out about our state panic government
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:13.240]  and then once i found out you know i'll do this do this send me another letter
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.000]  than i i must have missed that we we miss a lot of things but but thank you for
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.720]  the call uh we're going back to calls uh
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:23.160]  stan and martin and patrick here in a moment but but bob
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:26.280]  let's get back into the economy while we have you here today uh the callers are
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:28.840]  all over the map we're going to go back to them in a moment
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:31.080]  um bob
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:37.720]  i i i just got word here in austin that del just laid off uh around 20 percent
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:39.960]  of one of its divisions that are telling people they're going to lay off even
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:45.080]  more of their people um we see over a half a million layoffs a month they're
[1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:49.640]  talking about accelerating by a year into a million a month
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:52.840]  and i mean what do you do with fiat currency if there aren't even businesses
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:57.320]  to spend it in i mean how bad do you see this getting
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:01.320]  well it's it'll be a minimum of five times worse than the depression
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:06.120]  and we have so many other things going on now that weren't going on there
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:11.160]  then that are negative and so it's going to be very very tough and that's why
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:15.000]  you know like you do i tell people get food in and
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.560]  and weapons and filter and gold and silver coins
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:22.920]  you're going to need them i mean this thing is going to go out of control
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:25.880]  you're going to have revolutions going on war going on
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:29.560]  people are going to be drafted men and women uh shipped off to
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:33.880]  who knows where uh if for no other reason just to get them off the streets
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:37.720]  so that they won't be trying to overthrow the government
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:41.640]  and so uh you know you put all these things together
[1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:45.800]  and you say was it the depression like that no it wasn't
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:50.680]  it was bad but nothing like this i mean this is complete chaos
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:54.920]  and that is what's going to happen it's going to be a lot worse
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:58.280]  a lot of top economists are coming out and saying this is going to be worse than
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:02.200]  the great depression and i go back over the same ground but it's important
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:05.960]  we had a pretty moral on average compared to today population in the
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:11.880]  late 20s 30s uh most people 90% were agrarian living on the farm
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:17.160]  and were somewhat self-sufficient now less than 10% of people are self-sufficient
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:20.520]  of 10% are rural but about half of those are self-sufficient
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:24.600]  and then the 5% that are self-sufficient are going to be swarmed
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:27.880]  uh by people wanting their food wanting their water wanting them to take care of
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:31.560]  them and we know the quote authorities in a drill in new
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:35.480]  Orleans with Katrina only went after the wealthy and middle-class homes that
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:38.760]  were you know that did have solar power that did have food and water
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:42.520]  their mission was to leave all the other people alone
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:46.200]  and to go in and get people's guns so you don't just have the hordes of people
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:48.680]  to deal with the things completely right now which i guess you're saying is
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:51.960]  going to happen uh we're going to have the establishment the
[1:39:51.960 --> 1:39:57.000]  troops coming for our guns well i i you know maybe
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.240]  through law enforcement but the military is not going to do that
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.320]  i am convinced uh from what i've heard talking to
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:09.240]  people who are in and people who are retired that uh they're not going to
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:12.360]  they're not going to follow the dictates of the government
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:16.280]  and you know i've said before on this program and others that
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:21.400]  law enforcement should take a long look at what they're told to do because
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:24.120]  once they commit themselves against the people
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:29.240]  um they're going to have a problem and you know there's 450 million guns in the
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:33.800]  country there's 40 million men who can carry them
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:39.320]  uh you were looking at uh 750 000 vietnam veterans
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:42.440]  uh and you know people will go back as far
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:45.800]  as i do into the late 40s and early 50s
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:50.120]  and they're going to have their hands full we're not going to back off
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.000]  people are going to be out of their homes their cars
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:58.200]  their job are they going to be desperate and so they are going to do things that
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:02.040]  they normally wouldn't do well that's the issue they're not giving us a
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:06.600]  choice bob no that's true
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:11.560]  it's absolutely true now there is some good news curtain demo wrote a story
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:14.680]  last night folks should go get it increasing numbers of states declaring
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:18.680]  sovereignty and full wars dot com and uh it says
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:21.720]  washington new hampshire is on a montana michigan missouri
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:25.800]  oklahoma california georgia and now other states
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:30.200]  are introducing legislation saying we are sovereign and what does it say
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:33.960]  we will not let you pass any gun control laws we will not let you pass hate crimes
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:36.040]  laws we will not let you pass laws against the
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:39.160]  first amendment which u.s senators are announcing we are going to try to ban
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.320]  talk radio and free speech i have the clip
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.960]  we have time we'll play next hour uh they are saying and doing it and and
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:48.680]  they're saying we are not going to let people go to fema camps
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:52.920]  we are ordering state police and local police under the state constitution
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:56.360]  i mean it's in here to follow the bill of rights and constitution
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:59.400]  and to not follow unconstitutional federal orders
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:03.800]  those seeds we planted five years ago of fighting the patriot act and getting
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:06.600]  states to say no to it i think it's sprouting and this is
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:10.760]  encouraging bob it certainly is and it nullifies
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:14.040]  part of what i just said if the states were to do that
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:16.920]  then law enforcement would do what they're supposed to do
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:23.240]  and not listen to federal dictates and that would be wonderful
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:26.920]  well the only hope we've got with this banker controlled implosion is for the
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:33.320]  states to stand up and have real order and and be representative of the people
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:36.920]  well for the state to stand up and say look we're not going to put up with
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:40.760]  what you're doing anymore and you know then i think you would see
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:45.080]  states arbitrarily and unilaterally leaving the
[1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:48.840]  union now that's a possibility as well and here's
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:51.720]  another issue there's a whole bunch of states saying no
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:55.400]  we know the feds and the troops are trying to take over state houses
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:59.080]  and county courthouses that's on record and they admit under north com
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:04.040]  john war defense authorization act pd-51 and now the pentagon reorganization
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.680]  of a month and a half ago under secretary of defense gates
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.040]  that they are preparing to take over local government forcibly
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:12.760]  they'll get away with that a few places but they're not going to get away with
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:17.560]  it everywhere it's going to turn into a shooting war
[1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:23.400]  that's right well be prepared and hope for the best that's all you can do
[1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:27.080]  uh... you know this there's nothing more well we've lost congress
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:31.320]  the court system doesn't work and uh... the people who run government are
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:34.280]  evil and the people who run wall street banking and
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:40.600]  insurance companies and corporate america many of them are evil as well
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:43.960]  well it's a culture of corruption you're weird if you're not corrupt in the
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:48.200]  system that's right
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:51.880]  can you imagine that fellow trying for almost 10 years
[1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:56.120]  to get the scc to act i've been writing about the scc
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:00.760]  for 35 40 years and how they protect wall street
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:04.440]  that's what it's all about they're not to protect the
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:07.960]  average investor these people are as criminal
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:13.560]  as the people that we have in jails and the cftc the commodity futures trading
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:17.720]  corporation is equal as bad they stand by along with the
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:26.760]  scc and watch the markets be manipulated by the government
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:32.120]  bob time frame what is the united states currently on the trend it's
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:35.640]  following the track it's on 12 months from now
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:41.000]  february 6 of 2010 what will this country look like
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:44.520]  deep in depression because it's already started
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:49.640]  uh i think that you will be seeing the second stimulus package only this time
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:54.040]  it won't be 800 or 900 billion it'll be two trillion
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:57.800]  and this will you know they're trying to extend this until
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:02.040]  their timeline fits it's too hard to
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:06.280]  give a future date but that evolutionary process
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:10.680]  you know the u6 right now unemployment is
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:15.000]  somewhere in the vicinity of around 15 and a half percent
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:21.880]  15 percent that'll be over 20 probably around 22 by the end of the year
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:26.920]  and the following year it'll be over 30 that's where we're headed
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:31.560]  let's look at that europe has 20 21 depending on the region
[1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:34.520]  unemployment they're having massive riots every day
[1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:38.840]  the media is trying to keep it quiet the icelandic government's already fallen
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:43.880]  but the news out of europe is amazing uh so if you're saying we're at 15 percent
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:47.000]  do you think america will follow the pattern and when we hit 20 unemployment
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:51.080]  the riots will start i think so and that will be toward
[1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:54.360]  the end of the year and into next year and they won't be riots it'll be
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:58.760]  demonstrations look we want a job about you know we want to work
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:02.440]  and so on and so forth and then of course the uh
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:05.880]  from time to time that'll get out of hand or the uh jupro
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:09.320]  provocateurs will be sent in by the government
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:14.280]  uh to cause riots so the government can try to use more control over the people
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:17.320]  and say well look all you people who are out of work we're gonna camp to send you
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:20.360]  to over here at least you have a place to sleep and
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:26.280]  and food and we can indoctrinate you and now it has materialized now they are
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:30.600]  announcing the camps and not only that um
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:36.040]  you know all of the jobs almost all the jobs from here on out
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:39.800]  for the next several years that are created are going to be u.s.
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:46.920]  government federal jobs federal jobs with fiat money
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:50.680]  that's right and of course inflation is going to go ballistic
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:56.920]  and you know you've got uh 902 dollar or 20 ten dollar gold
[1:46:56.920 --> 1:47:01.560]  gold is going over three thousand dollars and if you don't
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:05.320]  if you have done what you know you're supposed to do
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:09.240]  about having that defensive insurance position at home
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:13.320]  you've got to get more coins you've got to get more gold
[1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:16.680]  you've got to get more silver it's the only thing that's going to be worth
[1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:19.080]  anything
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:24.120]  gold has been hovering around 920 it's right there today
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:27.640]  how long can they keep it at that or will it just keep rising or will it
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:31.880]  correct again next week it's going to fly
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:36.760]  and uh this exercise today uh i'm a little surprised it came up about
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:41.880]  even to minus two on the day and uh maybe monday might be down a little bit
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:45.880]  the rest of the week it's going to attack 930 and break it
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:51.320]  and uh it's 1033 and today or whatever the highest was up there
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:55.800]  was say 1020 it's going to get challenged
[1:47:55.800 --> 1:48:00.040]  i mean you know being in gold and silver
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:04.760]  you're not only going to keep your assets together
[1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:10.440]  and retain what value you have but you may make an awful lot of money
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:13.720]  of course if you survive
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:20.600]  oh bob i wish this wasn't happening let's take another call
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:24.520]  let's talk to parker in tennessee parker you're on the air with
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:29.640]  bob Chapman parker dropped stan in missouri go ahead stan
[1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:34.440]  oh alex and bob i've been listening to you guys talking about revolutions well
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:37.480]  i believe it's a new world order once these revolutions to happen because
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:40.680]  they've got to get the people around the globe in a state of panic to bring
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:44.360]  about their new world order well they've said that kissinger says it's an
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:49.160]  opportunity bob i'm a product of the 1960s i lived through 1960s i
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:53.000]  imagine bob did too and i've seen what the american communist party tried to
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.560]  do this this country way back in the 60s they wanted the eternal revolution
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:00.600]  that was started by the weatherman but it was also
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:05.400]  backed by the american communist party anybody that's a history in order to
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:08.680]  know that well that was a manufactured revolution
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:12.200]  and they certainly are counting on people to resist and that is part of
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:15.480]  their plan i mean rama manual is on record i have a video he says
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:18.760]  we love this crisis we've got to take advantage of this we can't waste this
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:22.920]  crisis bob chairman he that's absolutely right
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:28.840]  and uh they are going to and uh we have to try if we can
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:32.680]  up until whatever point we can to restrain ourselves and not get sucked
[1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:35.560]  into it but there will come a time when you can't
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:40.200]  turn the other cheek anymore and if rama manual thinks that
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:46.440]  he is uh going to survive this thing if it gets to that point that he desires
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:51.960]  uh he's got another thought coming well another problem we've gotten bob well
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:55.400]  very well knows this himself we have too many people that are socially dependent
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:58.440]  upon the government for some kind of assistance
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:01.800]  like the state of california is going broke understand for welfare where you've
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:05.560]  got 44 million people on social security le and disabled
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:09.240]  34 million people living in poverty and i just figured that up on my calculator
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:14.840]  that comes to 78 million people they're socially dependent upon the government
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:17.560]  and actually you know that's an understatement
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:21.720]  because there's the periphery of that you've got children
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:26.440]  uh you've got people who are not counted such as illegal aliens
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:30.520]  and so it's over one-third of the population is dependent
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:33.320]  you're absolutely right
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:39.720]  all right thank you stan i appreciate your call that's exactly how they want

[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:23.400]  you know the globalists giggling and smiling and have the their body languages
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:26.120]  that they're having a great time they love what they're doing to us
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:30.840]  Obama hoping change is now do what i say or it's going to be a catastrophe
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:34.760]  uh he's gone back on everything he said he would do automatically
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:38.840]  uh or or he's lied about it he'll say oh i'm getting rid of lobbyists and bring
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:42.360]  in lobbyists or he'll say i'm capping salaries which is
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:45.880]  bad enough that just means selectively but the big boys are immune
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:48.680]  uh you know the torture is going to continue the secret arrest is going to
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:52.760]  continue uh so this is also an opportunity for humanity
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:57.320]  if people will just stand up and say no uh and and and not go along with this
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:01.000]  but if we acquiesce they're going to get their new world order
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.480]  well we're going to keep on feeding the information and when push comes to show
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:08.920]  they have to stand up on their high legs and say no we're not going to do that
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:13.320]  anymore and it'll be up to them uh i think half the
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:17.800]  population will stand up and uh you know when you're you get an empty
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:21.720]  belly and you don't have any place to sleep um
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:25.960]  you get to be a pretty ordinary critter
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:29.480]  yeah the tax laws are written where the big boys don't have to pay taxes the
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:32.280]  general public does and i even found a newspaper quote with
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:36.120]  Rockefeller saying that he said i don't pay any i don't know any income tax but
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:41.000]  i send a small check each year because i'm such a good person
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:45.560]  and he's worth yeah just leverage trillions just amazing
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:49.080]  um let's take a final call here for you everybody else will get to you the next
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:53.240]  hour martin in california you're on the air with bob Chapman go ahead
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:56.680]  hey guys how you doing um alex you know thanks a lot
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:00.120]  for waking me up i kind of got woken up late in the game in
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:04.520]  july although i've been following a lot of this stuff for years um
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:08.280]  well let me ask you a quick question because i'm barely making it with my
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:11.400]  fiance right now like i'm actually an i'm out of work
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:15.720]  audio engineer and and she works and we're getting by barely but
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:19.640]  we have an opportunity to possibly buy a home is that even something we should
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:23.000]  even look at i mean absolutely not you keep on
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:26.120]  renting at least for the next several years don't
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:29.960]  don't even let it get into your mind okay because yeah that was my
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:33.960]  fear is it's like i make my money sporadically she you know
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:37.160]  right now it looks like the payment would be less than my rent
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:40.600]  but i don't want to get in that trap where she loses her job this next year
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:43.800]  something happens and we're out the door
[1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:47.320]  yeah well you're down to the internment camp and when you are
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:51.800]  and when you are having a good month if you can't take some of that money and
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:55.960]  buy some gold and silver coins yeah and i i have uh that's what we've been
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:57:58.360]  trying to do have been i've been eating like crazy
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:02.280]  that's the only that's the only investment it's not a hundred percent
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:06.920]  but all the other shows the only investment that is set to make gigantic
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:10.840]  profits is it a hundred percent no i told you that i'd be made off but look
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:16.520]  at where gold's gone from 280 five six years ago to 920 today
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:19.880]  and so we've been right all along because inflation means it will go up in
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:23.480]  value the gold's not really worth more the dollar's worth less and
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:26.440]  bob Chapman i want to thank you for spending so much time with us today and

[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:48.120]  putting in a major newspaper in england
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:51.400]  that shows the government staging nuclear attacks and setting up martial
[2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:54.680]  law and putting us in femur camps and setting up a north american union
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:57.640]  and then turning the economy back on and we're all slaves
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:00.760]  why is the line in telegraph one of the largest newspapers in the world's in
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:03.960]  the top five uh reporting things like this
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:08.440]  what does this mean they've been asked over and over again in the three part
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:11.640]  series what's going on and they won't respond so we'll uh talk about it with
[2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:16.200]  steve watson coming up for the next three and a half minutes i am joined
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:20.040]  by ted anderson you just heard bob Chapman
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:23.720]  talking about what a great investment silver and gold is and it may go up it
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:27.560]  may go down but in the yearly trends it's only going straight up
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:31.800]  and i dearly believe in this investment and ted told you yesterday
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:36.120]  that he bought gold at the 830 level it's now at 920 and then he's almost out of
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:40.120]  sovereigns and frank's excellent gold pieces
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:43.880]  he is selling them at below spot he is selling them at below
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:48.200]  what the market is what anybody else is doing
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:52.200]  and he's doing this because he bought it when it was 830 this is the end of my
[2:01:52.200 --> 2:01:55.240]  friend and he says if gold stays where it's at
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:57.960]  uh monday which it looks like it's gonna keep going up but if it even stays
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:01.160]  where it's at he can't offer this anymore so this is the very tail end of this
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:04.200]  and it goes throughout the weekend and again he is the owner of the genesis
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:08.440]  network as well so the tiny amount of profit he makes because he bought it
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:11.880]  when it was inexpensive he passes all the savings on to you
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:14.840]  goes back into the network and ted is radically expanding everything we do
[2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:18.680]  including running national ads for the creature from jack o'allon book
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:21.800]  to get educated folks about the federal reserve so that's certainly exciting
[2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:26.200]  uh... ted tell folks the offer today yeah right now what we're doing
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:30.280]  is uh... we still have the frank we have some of those available still at that
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:34.920]  217 level and the british sovereign is at 265
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:38.360]  uh... we you know i i mentioned it to you last time
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:42.200]  going out in the marketplace that 920 level i'm looking at
[2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:46.520]  two hundred and thirty dollars on the frank and the british sovereign is is
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:50.840]  280 so right now at this particular time that is a
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:53.960]  big discount every now and then i'll have somebody calling wait a minute you're
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:56.760]  selling stuff for less than spot what does that mean
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:03:00.440]  what that means is when the spot is lower and i lock in on a coin
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:05.400]  uh... and the spot price goes up i'm heavily discounted in the current market
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:09.000]  and uh... sometimes that point you know when you divide it down you can say
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:12.840]  well it's more than spot but the coins all trade for over spot that's the way
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:16.120]  they are now right now that is discounted
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:19.640]  uh... you know it's it's coming up on thirty dollars a coin
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:22.440]  and the fractional gold pieces i mean i've been
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:26.440]  i want to know most people are sold out and you're even getting close
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:30.440]  uh... so folks eight hundred six eight six two two three seven now the brokers

[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:58.680]  about blackjack is the name of a cartoon you could call it but it's only
[2:09:58.680 --> 2:10:03.720]  posterized photos um and we'll start putting those on screen
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:07.880]  where somebody nukes major cities in england the united states
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:11.240]  and then marshal laws brought in people are putting fema camps
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:16.280]  uh the union of north america un e is set up
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:18.840]  basically everything the globalists are actually planning and what they say in
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:23.240]  their own policy reports and in the first part of the series
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:26.440]  though it doesn't let you know it's the government it's an mi6 intelligence
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:30.200]  report you see we'll put that first part up on screen
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:33.480]  and they're talking about mi6 things terrorists are about to strike
[2:10:33.480 --> 2:10:36.360]  but then later you learn that it's really basically
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:39.800]  uh a bunch of guys in a sent com type command center
[2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:43.720]  is this a warning from the london telegraph are they uh you know trying
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:46.600]  to warn the world what's happening but they're establishment owned
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:49.800]  you know why did fox tv news corps put out the lone gunman
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:52.840]  where the government hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control to fly it in the
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:56.040]  world trade center to blame it on afghanistan six months before the real
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:11:00.520]  attacks they even use a drill of hijacked jets flying into
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:04.760]  buildings uh to basically make everybody
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:07.800]  stand down that's exactly what happened in real life
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:11.720]  and they do this over and over again uh they came out with a tom clancy
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:15.480]  video game uh eight years ago where the united states
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:19.960]  through the georgian sneak attacks out those set of you i mean what is this
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:22.920]  is it good is it a warning why won't the paper
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:26.280]  after tons of inquiries tell people what is going on
[2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:30.760]  and can we put that on screen guys we're uh working on that
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:34.600]  good because i want to uh put some of the comic images there it is in my five
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:38.120]  report warrants government of eminent terrorist attack
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:43.160]  june 20th 2 p.m a coalition of homegrown extremists is london
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:46.120]  assistant christian doomsday cultists see they're gonna
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:51.400]  train everybody see the the london telegraph couldn't come out and say
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:54.920]  christians doomsday cultists is what the anti-terror system is for
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:58.440]  we're going to swing this giant anti-terror system and the drug war
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:01.800]  system on to the american people on the british people and say that
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:04.920]  everybody's a wide al-qaeda though some media is doing that
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:07.800]  this is a way to just get this into the nomenclature and the idea
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:10.760]  such a strike may take place from a biological chemical or even a nuclear
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:14.040]  attack in one of our main population centers and it goes on
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:18.360]  let's go ahead and bring up steve watson human intelligence indicates this
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:21.320]  group is ready to strike at any time
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:24.200]  in the event of such an attack the likelihood of many thousands casualties
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:27.560]  is high so it teaches you that prime minister takes
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:31.160]  statement on threat breaking news prime minister addresses house
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:36.760]  of threat and they show gordon brown the current
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:40.280]  prime minister they have this obsession with scripting
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:46.680]  they had a fx show oil storm with the mayor of new orleans himself in the
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:49.640]  film where the hurricane goes in blows over
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:54.200]  floods like poncha train breaks things and exactly what happened that happens
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:58.280]  that area before katrina again i got there's hundreds of examples
[2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:02.040]  steve watson what do you make of all this then we'll start going step by step
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:07.480]  through the three-part series in the international publication
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:12.840]  hello alex it's good to be back on again yeah basically um
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:15.880]  well if we want to start with what we make of it then
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:19.880]  um that's pretty clear i think from the articles we wrote but
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:26.920]  basically um it's well we don't want to tell people what to
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:31.720]  think but it's either it's either clearly a propaganda piece or it's
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:37.640]  from somebody who's somehow an insider and has got
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:41.080]  being able to get this into a major
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:46.200]  british newspaper but i mean we've got to be clear about it it's not
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:50.840]  1984 by george orwell it's not an artistic masterpiece it's
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:57.880]  basically to begin with it was a set of poorly photoshopped images just
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:04.440]  thrown together of major cities being nuked
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:10.600]  basically and um it's very difficult to understand why that
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:15.960]  was able to get into a major one of the biggest newspapers in the world
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:20.120]  essentially um
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:25.880]  but there's a there's a series of commenters on the articles who have
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:30.360]  started to question why we're even questioning it
[2:14:30.360 --> 2:14:33.800]  saying you know it's good what's wrong with it and saying that it's
[2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:38.440]  suspicious that we're even covering it and even accusing others of being
[2:14:38.440 --> 2:14:42.360]  fear mongering but basically we're not the ones posting
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:46.520]  poorly photoshopped images of cities being nuked so
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:50.520]  well let's explain i mean i know why they're doing this this is done viciously
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:54.200]  even we we can debate but i know my i've studied the enemy
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:57.640]  they want to create panic they want to create fear so that when they trigger
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:15:01.240]  things people will panic so they have an excuse to bring in even more control
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:04.600]  that's what they show after the newt goes off everybody lines the pump
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.040]  society breaks down martial law at the end saves us though
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:11.640]  we go to fema camps north american union saves us
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:14.920]  uh british union saves us with the e u world government saves us
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:18.440]  and what the wall street journals say last week they said the new world order
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:23.800]  will save you and they said that it that that's the
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:27.160]  only thing that will so they have to introduce this everywhere
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:32.120]  so they're doing it but but just go ahead well yeah i mean that's why i
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:35.640]  believe it to be a propaganda piece it's made to look
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:39.640]  or it was in the beginning it was made to look crude on purpose
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:43.560]  in order to discredit you know every issue that was
[2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:49.480]  brought up within it you know be that north american union be it internment
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:54.360]  counts false flag terror by putting it into the pages of a comic strip or
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:59.640]  crude photoshopped images it it kind of demeans the
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.480]  the subjects that which are you know which do need to be
[2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:07.640]  rationally debated and they are real agendas that are which the
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:11.480]  establishment itself is fear mongering about
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:15.720]  well exactly and if you ask yourself why is this in the telegraph
[2:16:15.720 --> 2:16:21.080]  i mean the majority of telegraph readers are conservative english people in
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:25.240]  their fifties or their sixties so what are they going to take from
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:31.400]  a series of crude photoshopped images yeah this is not some cyberpunk comic
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:35.000]  bookshop publication well exactly they're not going to think
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.600]  oh this is a warning i need to look into this that's going to dismiss every
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:42.600]  issue in there is you know pulp fiction
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:47.160]  um
[2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:53.640]  it's been touted as fiction you know but we know that there's agendas to
[2:16:53.640 --> 2:16:58.760]  implement domestic police state control um continual pushes towards global
[2:16:58.760 --> 2:17:03.480]  government that kind of thing and you've got to look at
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:07.080]  who owns this who owns the telegraph as well
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:10.360]  well get to that in a moment but i just want to add the point now the addendum
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:13.480]  here that you're absolutely right this is meant
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:16.600]  while they're simultaneously in the financial time saying world government's
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:19.400]  good we kept it secret from you for your own good
[2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:23.160]  we're taking over its dictatorial you'll have no rights but we know what's best
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:25.960]  while all these hundreds of publications are announcing world government
[2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:30.520]  that's the answer to the crisis they then are mudding the waters with it in
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:33.400]  entertainment and right there in the news pages
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:38.360]  to where when you mention it to people they'll say oh you got that out of the
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:43.000]  comics so again this is this is psych warfare
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:48.520]  very very clearly uh but yeah let's look at who owns the London telegraph
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:53.960]  okay well how when was London telegraph established it was
[2:17:53.960 --> 2:17:58.600]  established in in the uh mid-1800s by
[2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:04.840]  british nobility been owned by all along the line it's been owned by barons
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:09.960]  by counts all the way up to Conrad Black uh who
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:13.000]  recently is involved in scandal and then had to sell
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:18.600]  the telegraph to the Barclay brothers uh Frederick and David Barclay who now own
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:22.680]  and run the telegraph both regular attendees at
[2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:26.280]  Bilderberg meetings um basically they're not gonna
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:29.560]  they're not gonna print anything they know it's not some rag that's gonna
[2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:33.720]  print a few poorly thrown together
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.480]  images so and and right now we're showing images
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:40.920]  of uh in the u.s. and england they put millions in
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:44.120]  concentration camps it's the right thing to do
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:47.080]  so they're showing everybody what's supposed to happen riot police crush
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:51.000]  anyone protesting is aiding terrorists they claim that syrian
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.760]  iran detonated the nuke so the united states of england nuke
[2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:58.680]  those nations and then at the end of the comic book the north american union
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.080]  saves us
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:06.200]  yeah so stay at home i'll wait for the instructions emergency transmission
[2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:09.160]  so they're they're just preparing the subconscious
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:12.200]  for when this really happens so that we'll go along with it they are
[2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:18.760]  map making in the mind steve yeah i mean preparing the subconscious is
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:23.880]  that's classic you know description of what propaganda is
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:27.560]  um if you read propaganda by
[2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:33.640]  edward bernay sort of a definitive text on it written in the 20s
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:36.360]  um
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:39.880]  he goes over in detail i can read you some quotes if you like yeah stay there

[2:24:56.280 --> 2:25:02.280]  uh the first sort of instalment showed pictures of mi5 logos with the date
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:07.800]  june the 20th and the caption saying uh mi5 report
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:11.880]  warns government of imminent terrorist attack
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:15.720]  uh so then the date jumps forward to june the 21st
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:20.040]  shows a caption of what is apparently a large nuclear device
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:26.040]  um twice a small nuclear device loaded into a white van uh in the center of
[2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:30.920]  london then it shows people panicking buying groceries fleeing
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:35.400]  the city and then on it jumps to june the 22nd
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:41.240]  and there's an image of a nuclear explosion over the city
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:45.240]  uh it then shows various photoshopped crude images of
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:51.720]  sort of ruins of famous london landmarks such as you know big ben etc uh
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:56.920]  houses of parliament and then that's where part one ended so
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:00.440]  you know wasn't a lot in there to go on to begin with
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:03.880]  so very strange that's when we started questioning why it was in there
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:10.440]  part two comes along about a week later um it continues the theme but with
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:15.960]  images of nukes going off in new york washington dc la
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:22.840]  portland mexico city toronto and then another series of sort of
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:27.640]  crumbling remains of these major cities
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:32.440]  um so i mean really even a plot or a storyline it was just at this point it
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:36.680]  was just a series of pictures put together on photoshop
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:44.120]  supposed to you know depict this situation but
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:47.400]  the final image of part two is an important one because it showed a sort of
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:50.760]  mock screenshot i think you've already had it up on the
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:55.640]  on the screen there for the viewers of an emergency transmission from the
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:27:00.360]  department of how one security which reads stay at home and await further
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:04.600]  instructions and then it has a sort of an eagle
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:10.120]  and if you've seen pictures of nazi propaganda and things and flags etc
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:12.600]  symbolism it's exactly the same as that and it's
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:17.960]  perched on top of a globe and underneath are the words union of north america
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:23.080]  and then below that the words novus odosiclorum which translates as new
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:27.000]  order of the ages or traditionally new world order
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.520]  and then there's also images of british policemen with this kind of
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:37.800]  this these kind of images on their uniforms and helmets etc
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:43.320]  and then part three kind of it changed into a comic book style
[2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:48.200]  um so at this point you've got series of nuclear attacks have gone off to usher
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:53.880]  in a sort of fascist world government headed by union of america
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:28:00.200]  uk canada and mexico and then it sort of switches to this comic strip
[2:28:00.200 --> 2:28:08.440]  which shows a group of men supposedly officials of this new union
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:15.400]  seemingly pleased with god bless you and god bless the union of north america
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:21.560]  seemingly pleased with the reports that they're pouring over of casualties
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:26.760]  and destruction and they say oh this has exceeded our wildest
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:31.080]  expectations we need to move on to phase two so at that point you're clearly
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:34.680]  supposed to deduce that these people who are
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:38.840]  representing a new form of government are somehow involved in
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:43.240]  the operation related to the attacks and then
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:49.720]  as we've gone over the further images show military attacks on iran Syria china
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:55.000]  domestic police state martial law uh concentration camps set up to hold
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:03.320]  collaborators and dissenters images of the amaro coin
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:08.360]  um indicating that new global currencies being created
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:16.600]  and that's where part three ends so who knows if there's going to be a part four
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:20.120]  but if there is a part four i assume that you know
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:24.360]  this is all going to be there to save everyone well steve i did see some tiles
[2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:28.920]  in there where it's like oh the panic's over you know the economy's back i i
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:33.720]  did see one along those lines at the end uh but um
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:37.880]  there's more than just in conditioning our subconscious here
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:43.560]  psychopaths like to leave tokens at their crime scenes they like to
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:49.240]  call and taunt the police they like to brag so uh coming from this paper it's
[2:29:49.240 --> 2:29:55.400]  it's just very chilling we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:55.400 --> 2:30:00.440]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:03.160 --> 2:30:07.320]  with rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an

[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:18.200]  to love their servitude people can be made
[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:24.760]  to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to

[2:33:36.840 --> 2:33:40.840]  i have to a better start from the beginning
[2:33:42.040 --> 2:33:46.440]  too many kids are what's making planet worse a lot of these kids come from
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:49.560]  bad gene pools they don't have stable parents making good
[2:33:49.560 --> 2:33:54.520]  decisions mercury containing vaccines may help
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:58.520]  not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics
[2:33:58.520 --> 2:34:01.960]  these new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:05.480]  actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:09.960]  fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:12.920]  cancer? I doubt the government had the right under
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:17.080]  US law to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:19.240]  conditions i have to work the dark side all the
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:24.040]  well spend time in the shadows any attempt to achieve world order
[2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:28.520]  must be the work of the devil will join me and i'm glad to sit here at the
[2:34:28.520 --> 2:34:33.000]  right hand to say there's a need for new world order
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:45.160]  someday in the next few years a solution will emerge
[2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:51.720]  you know what's amazing i look at all these unhappy people who even have
[2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:57.800]  jobs a lot of folks don't and they think life's boring we're spinning
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:01.720]  through the black void of space surrounded by
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:09.720]  trillions of galaxies quadrillions of planets nebulas black holes
[2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:18.360]  for an incredible sphere with a ribbon of atmosphere and huge oceans with all
[2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:23.160]  these amazing life forms we are these creatures who don't even
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:29.640]  know our own history who are just now developing technology
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:34.600]  who knows what we could do in the stars and instead we have a bunch of
[2:35:34.600 --> 2:35:39.320]  criminals running our system and the public is unable to truly dream
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:44.600]  outside their control paradigm and so they are just basically following the
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:48.360]  the manipulations and programming that the establishment uses
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:55.800]  punching their primitive buttons now let us go ahead and
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:00.680]  go back to steve watson steve i want to cover a few other
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:06.280]  issues with you but anything else you want to add about this particular
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:11.720]  story of this blackjack series in the london telegraph
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:16.520]  well i suppose the the other thing to mention is that a lot of readers
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:20.840]  asking for clarification contact with the telegraph
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:24.520]  and the overwhelming response from the newspaper itself was
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.760]  a hostile one they're belligerent to call us
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:33.080]  apparently no one wants to talk about it at the telegraph
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:37.320]  readers have been interrogated as to why they care
[2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:42.760]  what the piece is supposed to be people have hung up on them
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:47.000]  basically the paper won't advise you know
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:51.400]  oh yeah asking questions or even being able to read now is seen as like out
[2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:54.920]  being al-qaeda i mean literally it's like what you you're asking questions
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:36:58.760]  you're you're taking photos of the police you're a terrorist
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.960]  they're trying that in england now too aren't they
[2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:05.640]  well exactly i mean the papers yeah the papers got angry basically and wouldn't
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:09.800]  give an explanation at all as to the content that they're
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:15.480]  supplying their readers so i suppose that that's where we are with it really
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:19.240]  there isn't any i'm sure there'll be more development
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:24.120]  but um some people on other forums claim to have
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:29.320]  identified who the author is but i would check that i don't think there's any
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:33.240]  direct evidence of that at the moment so we're still that's another thing normally
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:36.840]  in an art section they would tell you who the artist was but the way this is
[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:40.280]  exactly that's the point of an art section isn't it for
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:44.440]  artists to gain recognition and that's what the readers were
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:47.560]  concerned about but you know they wouldn't even tell the readers who the
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:53.320]  artist was so what is the point of the piece
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:56.120]  that shows everybody going into fema camps and
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:37:59.160]  nukes going off and the government staging the attacks and setting up a
[2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:02.440]  north american union and merging it with england which
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:05.720]  they say the england's actually merged with the north american union
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.480]  as the anglo-american establishment airstrip one
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:16.040]  um boy they are nasty normally when they do stuff like this and we're
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:19.640]  seeing a lot of this pop up in tv and shows like jericho and others it means
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:23.320]  they're planning it when they knew coming to have to
[2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:27.240]  watch the public run around and worship the government it's never ends
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:31.480]  i just want to lose everything i guess i just go ahead i mean it's going going
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:36.040]  back to the propaganda thing it's you can see it as an effort to
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:40.040]  frame the subconscious because that's what propaganda essentially is that's
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:45.960]  what burn haze wrote um it's it's a mass manipulation of framing
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:50.600]  of the world that you live in and then you know creating the
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:55.400]  appearance that you are you have free will within that but you're always
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:00.200]  trapped within the framed world around you it's like
[2:39:00.200 --> 2:39:05.720]  i suppose the best um example is the prisoner
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:09.320]  with pastry mcguin who escapes the village but he's still
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:12.440]  you know he's still within the village because the village has been crafted
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:18.600]  over over centuries all around us and that's essentially what propaganda is
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:22.360]  bernay's wrote organizing chaos
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:27.400]  and you know that's it they understand go ahead this blackjack seems it
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:30.760]  doesn't it see doesn't seem to be a social commentary it's just a cold
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:35.240]  piece and in that sense it's got the hallmarks of
[2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:39.000]  the propaganda of social manipulation bringing a sort of
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:44.040]  standard to bear for the masses
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:48.520]  yeah it's a uh flaunting in our face what uh
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:53.320]  they may do to us but this action itself is a form of terrorism the threat
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:56.760]  of violence well they know they've seen the statistics the polls the numbers in
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:00.200]  england the us and europe where the majority of people believe that the
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:03.240]  9-11 was an inside job or that there's a cover up
[2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:07.160]  and i think this is a message to us and the new world order crowd loves
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:12.360]  multi-dimensional uh images they love something that has different effects on
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:15.160]  different classes and they see themselves as real
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:20.200]  artists at this art form and so it's also a threat to everyone it's an inside
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:24.040]  joke to them it further conditions and creates anxiety in the public then when
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:26.840]  we talk about real government sponsored terror they'll say oh you saw that in a
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:29.240]  cartoon
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:33.720]  yeah it's always gonna it's always gonna evolve the propaganda as well
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:37.960]  but i'll read you a quote from bernay's his sort of end quote in propaganda
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:42.120]  he says if the public becomes more intelligent in its commercial demands
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:45.320]  commercial firms will meet the new standards if it becomes where the old
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:48.920]  methods used to persuade it to accept a given idea or
[2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:51.960]  commodity its leaders will present their appeals more
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:55.640]  intelligently propaganda will never die out intelligent men must
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:59.160]  realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:02.840]  productive end and help to bring order out of chaos
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:07.080]  so it's always going to be evolving and changing in multi-dimensional level of
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:12.440]  it but in the end it's all about framing the society we live in we know
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:18.440]  that that's you know that's what their agenda is that's what they're about
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:21.720]  these are some sick people
[2:41:23.720 --> 2:41:27.720]  i mean these are some really really sick people
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:32.040]  i mean but but you know other people other readers
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:35.160]  are saying it maybe somebody who's sending a warning that's
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:39.880]  perfectly fine for them to it's a valid point for them to bring that up but
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:43.640]  it's not though we can give our opinions it's not to us to tell them what to
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:47.000]  think they may have even allowed somebody who thought it was a warning to
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.480]  put it in
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:53.160]  uh and then using it as a sigh up but i doubt that i mean if you look at
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:56.360]  i'd say 90 percent chance this is a sigh up
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:59.800]  in fact i'm really a hundred percent but i'll just say 90 and because they
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:02.840]  didn't put who the artist is there's a lot of issues here
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:06.600]  see when you see an article in newspaper and it doesn't have a name
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:09.880]  that automatically means from the editorial board of the paper
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:12.520]  and you'll see articles that don't even say from the editorial board it'll just
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:15.960]  be there and this is from the editorial board that's
[2:42:15.960 --> 2:42:20.440]  that's the language of a newspaper that if it doesn't say
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:25.080]  who it's from it's just an article that is the sense of the paper
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:28.920]  uh and so in the language of this that's what we're dealing with
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:31.800]  and people can say well why are you focusing on this because
[2:42:31.800 --> 2:42:37.080]  so many times what they put out
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:41.640]  is what they end up doing and people say oh the lone government episode of the
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:44.360]  government flying a hijacked jet in the world trade center get martial law and
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:47.160]  you know attack afghanistan and using a drill
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:51.160]  drill to make them stand down that's just a coincidence what we happen to have
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:55.320]  folks from the x-files dean haglin one came to my house
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:43:00.120]  you know the door is the tv guy to say no the cia planted this stuff on us so
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:04.840]  um this tells us a lot about the globalists they're very intelligent
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:08.600]  but they're also psychopathic uh they're very intelligent psychopaths
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:13.560]  sadistic psychopaths and they're very bored this is you know
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:16.520]  what all these aristocrats having too much time on their hands
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:21.080]  uh turns into and uh this is what they giggle and snicker about their little
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:25.240]  secret meetings and they they think the revelation of the method is funny
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:28.360]  and they also say they're god they're the new man
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:31.480]  because they can scientifically coldly understand
[2:43:31.480 --> 2:43:35.800]  their own human intellect and then so they can kill a baby and not feel any
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:39.480]  emotions or they can blow up a country and not feel emotions or they can kill
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:43.160]  3 000 people in two towers and not feel anything and it's only us that are
[2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:47.400]  primitive and weak that let our emotions control us no
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:51.800]  i am a human being i was developed on this planet i have children
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:55.560]  i am a reproductive creature i am meant to be nurtured if i am meant to defend
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:43:58.520]  my family i am meant to build this is who i am
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:04.040]  this is the species this is what we are and uh watching what the globalists do
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:09.880]  it it it's it's a horrible aberrant form of humanity
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:16.120]  uh and uh you know their whole social Darwinistic view everything they do
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:18.840]  it's really just selfishness and the proof is
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:22.200]  they're holding humanity back if they were so slick and so powerful
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.320]  they wouldn't be trying to poison people and dumb them down so we'd be more
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:29.960]  manageable if they're such god men they would be trying to empower everyone
[2:44:29.960 --> 2:44:33.400]  and and and and and you're trying to build us to the highest level because
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:37.560]  they're so much higher than us uh
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:41.960]  but they've got this sick subconscious rationale and they claim they're
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:44.920]  scientific and cold but at the end of the day they are some of the most
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:48.520]  hedonistic petty uh control freak individuals out there they
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:52.440]  are totally governed by their human instincts but by the most lesser forms
[2:44:52.440 --> 2:44:57.400]  of them Steve Watson well exactly if you want to
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:01.080]  put it a different way it's a total total lack of any sort of
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:05.880]  spirituality or you know belief in the rest of the
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:11.160]  human race really they want it all and they want to control it all
[2:45:11.880 --> 2:45:15.480]  they don't just want it all they want to desecrate it all they want to mutilate
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:19.880]  it all they want to vandalize it all they want to
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:23.240]  kill everything beautiful pull down everything decent
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:27.320]  they boil with hatred at youth and life and goodness
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:30.440]  because by its very nature it's a bunch of old demonic
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:35.640]  creatures uh who are totally given over to evil by the choices they've
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:38.920]  made in life that are in control of it
[2:45:42.600 --> 2:45:48.360]  i agree you agree yeah um i could have put it right back
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:52.120]  myself what's going on over in england i'm
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:54.760]  how's the economy going over there i've never seen your jobless numbers are
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:59.400]  about as bad as ours are worse and iceland's the government's fallen
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:01.960]  but british banks own iceland so people can't even get their money out of the
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:06.680]  banks europe's in 20 unemployment we're reading about riots
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:10.120]  all over europe that were being told that it's that the level of the riots is
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:15.080]  being suppressed uh your take on made-off uh all of this
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:20.760]  well the economy is the same as over there it's on its knees i mean
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:23.960]  basically because we've got the same policies over here
[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:28.920]  you know bailouts we had a recent bailout to the tune of
[2:46:28.920 --> 2:46:33.800]  um or it was a guarantees the government guaranteeing
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:39.720]  bank loans to the tune of 200 billion um all this printing excessive money
[2:46:39.720 --> 2:46:44.200]  they've just the bank of england's just dropped rates to the lowest
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:48.520]  you know they've ever been since the since the initiation of the bank of
[2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:51.720]  england so keeping them artificially like all the
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:55.160]  same policies that you know your government's got over there and
[2:46:55.160 --> 2:47:01.160]  that's because by proxy the both governments have run
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:05.960]  out of by the international bankers and corporations out of london
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:11.160]  so yeah it's exactly the same over here as it is over there and
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:17.240]  while there are some you know protests and riots and things over here they're
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:21.080]  not getting any sort of mainstream coverage and they're nowhere
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:27.000]  near on as big a scale as they are in your at the moment
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  but you know it's nice to be seen whether that will change
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:38.120]  in other news uh watching obama not just go back on every promise but
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:41.880]  arrogantly say we're getting all the ceo pay capped
[2:47:41.880 --> 2:47:45.160]  which then they can selectively put caps on other people and then all the big
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:50.040]  CEOs in banking have loopholes there are no caps or
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:53.080]  saying we're gonna we might shut down wantana but we're gonna continue secret
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:55.880]  arrest and we're gonna block the british government from releasing torture
[2:47:55.880 --> 2:47:59.480]  info uh and we're gonna appoint all these lobbyist
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:05.400]  and on and on and on where i he's now for naftan gatt i mean our people in
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:09.480]  england starting to talk about the fact that he's automatically going back on
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:14.280]  all his promises no they're not to be honest at the
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:18.040]  moment they're still the you know the sort of
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:22.520]  summation of what we're getting in our media is
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:27.880]  still the sort of you know the sort of mess ionic
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:33.000]  uh image of the great new leader obama you know there's no
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:37.240]  there's very little very little focused on the nightly news on
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:41.960]  you know the actual the actual nuts and bolts of the
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:46.680]  executive orders that he's been issuing so it's just all part of ongoing hype to
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:49.960]  make everybody feel good while the looting is completed
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:55.960]  but yeah it's still going on and i think it'll go on for the foreseeable future
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:48:59.720]  i mean you know there's no there's no
[2:48:59.720 --> 2:49:04.120]  investigation of what he's doing already um
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:07.560]  it's going to take something significant i think for that to
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:13.000]  for that to change over here well i love how the mainstream media keeps
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:17.320]  saying obama you know he wasn't part of the bailout that was bush obama went
[2:49:17.320 --> 2:49:21.240]  and cheerleaded for it they're all together in on it
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:26.840]  and obama's camp followers uh i'm just so tired of watching the
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:30.280]  left right bait and switch over and over again and that's why we're in slave
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:33.880]  because the public loves to feel like they're important loves to feel like
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:38.760]  they've had a hollow victory instead of a real victory
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:46.200]  yeah i mean the big one was um his executive order which protected
[2:49:46.200 --> 2:49:53.640]  continuation of cia renditions and um you know a good an article i wrote about
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:57.800]  that a few days ago good quote in there was from a british
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:01.160]  a british labor member of the european parliament
[2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:04.680]  and the european parliament was responsible for investigating the
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:10.440]  renditions and he said you know he directly said you can't criticize obama
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:13.640]  because at the moment he's got a godlike status
[2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:18.680]  um you know he said on the surface it looks like he's
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:22.520]  closing all these secret prisons and everything but
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:25.400]  you know people have got to look further into what
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:31.160]  he's actually his actual executive orders say and it says directly in there
[2:50:31.160 --> 2:50:36.440]  that he's leaving open the door for uh both rendition and the continuation of
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:40.440]  the secret facilities military facilities which we know
[2:50:40.440 --> 2:50:45.160]  they use the torture steve watson i want to appreciate you the great job you're

[2:53:28.680 --> 2:53:32.760]  life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:36.520]  exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too

[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:45.000]  the mail from germany i'm not going to say the guy's name
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:51.480]  this is his first name's reiner and he sent me a 1923 weimar republic
[2:54:51.480 --> 2:54:58.840]  deutsch mark these are the ones they had wheelbarrows to buy a love of bread with
[2:54:58.840 --> 2:55:02.520]  so we'll cut over there to this camera and i'll give folks watching on prison
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:09.640]  planet dot tv a close-up shot of that it says
[2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:16.920]  it says that this is a fiat mark the 1923 mark note from the town of
[2:55:16.920 --> 2:55:23.640]  ogersheim sheen where the former chancellor helmut kohl was born
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:29.480]  and we appreciate the present we appreciate the gift and this one is for
[2:55:30.760 --> 2:55:35.480]  110 a hundred a thousand hundred thousand 20 million
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:42.520]  deutsch marks that's 20 million right yeah 20 million deutsch marks and uh
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:47.960]  you could maybe at one point buy maybe a slice of bread with this maybe if you
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:51.560]  were lucky so that's what could happen to your fiat
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:54.520]  currency and that's what they're doing as soon as the confidence is lost in the
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:58.440]  dollar uh... that there's pretty much no way that this isn't going to happen
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:02.600]  massive massive inflation and evaluation of the currency
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:05.880]  well they had prettier money than we do even though
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:10.680]  this piece of paper you couldn't at one point in germany
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:14.120]  you couldn't buy the paper to print this on
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:20.760]  for 20 million deutsch marks giving an idea of it
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:24.040]  perhaps we should scan this in and put it up on the web for just the regular
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:27.960]  radio listeners who aren't watching right now live at prison planet tv

[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:43.960]  a different term for they call the patriot act uh patriotic
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:48.440]  there's just all sorts of little word manipulations uh that they engage in
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:52.680]  so we're going to be playing that coming up uh just a little bit later
[3:01:52.680 --> 3:01:57.880]  in this radio transmission and i guess up next is patrick in canada thanks for
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:02:01.240]  holding patrick you're on the air
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:05.160]  how you doing brother good sir thanks for holding good i just wanted to let you
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:08.040]  know of a story that i heard yesterday from one of my customers
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:11.560]  absolutely made my head shake uh him and his wife
[3:02:11.560 --> 3:02:15.080]  they were leaving a couple weeks ago to go on a trip to the caribbean
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:19.240]  flying air canada which is basically the largest airline in canada
[3:02:19.240 --> 3:02:23.320]  and upon getting to the booth where they basically checked their tickets
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:27.240]  the ticket agent told him that due to his name
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:30.840]  he was on a terror list and unable to board the plane
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:33.880]  he's got one of those weird names for the first and last name are the same
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:38.120]  i.e. william william type of type of thing and they said that
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:42.200]  that type of name is very common to use by terrorists
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:45.800]  but what was even more puzzling was that the agent said to him
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:50.840]  if you want to sign up for frequent flyer we can remove your name from the
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:53.640]  list yeah no no let let me explain this and i'll hold
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:56.360]  you over if need be there's over a million americans
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:02:58.920]  will know fly less 25 000 added a month plus
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:02.520]  england's got two million they're gonna you're not gonna be able to gun
[3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:05.720]  anything and they know with your driver's license
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:09.320]  number they know who you are where you live they know you're not a terrorist
[3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:12.920]  it's about getting us all used to oh i i've got to go away with you i'm a
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:16.440]  terrorist oh we've got to take you in your name suspicious you're on a list
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:19.080]  it's not just going to be in the airports the pentagon admits it's going to be on
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:22.360]  the streets where the troops of the paramilitary police pull you over
[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:24.920]  and they just grab whoever they want who's on the list and well you're in the
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:27.640]  list this shouldn't be a problem and you're used to being in the list so
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:31.960]  many times when they finally take you you don't fight back this is very
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:35.000]  sadistic what they're doing and i have heard reports they're doing it well
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:38.520]  they call it trusted traveler we'll just sign up with us
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:41.000]  and agree to go through more screening and then you'll be all right is that what
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.640]  he said well that's it but it's like they're rewarding
[3:03:43.640 --> 3:03:47.560]  terrorists now but it's not terrorism it's a
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:50.920]  blacklist if somebody was really a suspected terrorist they should be
[3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:56.680]  arrested it's total crap they're the terrorists they carried out the attack
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:00.280]  what else did he say what else did he say well basically that was it him and
[3:04:00.280 --> 3:04:04.040]  his wife were harassed to the point where his wife was almost in tears
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:07.880]  and they were in such disbelief that you know by subscribing to whatever
[3:04:07.880 --> 3:04:11.240]  options they were giving him that they've removed his name from the list
[3:04:11.240 --> 3:04:15.000]  they basically had to cancel their tickets and go and sit and wait five or
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.640]  six hours for another airline to get their trip
[3:04:17.640 --> 3:04:22.120]  so just complete man handling of an individual for no real reason
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:25.640]  no but that's what it's about going through the checkpoints being searched
[3:04:25.640 --> 3:04:28.920]  your children being searched at school it's about training you
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:34.360]  to have learned helplessness it's an absolute joke
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:38.680]  it's real man these people are building death camps
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:42.280]  there's so many how many people is canadian you know airports do they beat
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:46.440]  to death anything else you want to add sir no that's it i love the show bro keep

[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:08.040]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while
[3:07:08.040 --> 3:07:10.360]  taking hot showers than when drinking the water
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:13.880]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:17.400]  are absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower

[3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:25.720]  there's a whole bunch of these but they are coming after the first amendment
[3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:30.840]  because that's al-qaeda too uh with the fairness doctrine for the web talk radio
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:35.480]  you name it they mean business it's all part of the violent radicalization act
[3:08:35.480 --> 3:08:38.680]  and a lot more so you'll hear from a u.s senator
[3:08:38.680 --> 3:08:42.120]  coming up but uh... we had him on once about three or four months ago and i
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:44.120]  wanted to get him back on because we had a lot of
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:48.040]  questions uh... from listeners out there about
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:51.720]  how does a box the size of a water cooler without the
[3:08:51.720 --> 3:08:55.800]  water bottle on top produce seven and a half gallons of water a day in normal
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:08:59.800]  humidity it produces water in the desert
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:03.960]  how does that work so we have the founder of a color blue
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:08.760]  uh... the designer and uh... he is also uh...
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:12.360]  of course of the uh... individual who we have on air with us and
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:15.080]  so he's perfect to be able to discuss all these things
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:19.480]  and uh... he's a tyler palmer tyler i appreciate you coming on with us
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:23.320]  well thank you alex and i appreciate being able to come on again it was a
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:26.760]  pleasure talking to you the last time and uh...
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:31.720]  uh... again it is wonderful to be able to explain the technology to all the
[3:09:31.720 --> 3:09:35.800]  people listening okay break down how an atmospheric
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:39.560]  water generator works and then it also has filters in it after it grabs the
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:42.600]  water out of the air i mean i know the media has said that carbon
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:45.240]  dioxide that makes up most of water and water vapors
[3:09:45.240 --> 3:09:49.160]  is toxic waste but i mean that you know the clouds are the water
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:53.080]  and there is there is water in the air it's it's not it's not with al-qaeda
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:56.840]  i know they want to put a tax on it but uh... explain to us uh...
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:09:59.800]  how you grab this al-qaeda out of the atmosphere
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:05.640]  so people can drink it well uh... if anyone's ever sat and enjoyed a cold
[3:10:05.640 --> 3:10:09.400]  drink on a hot day they probably noticed that uh...
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:14.440]  uh... maybe their wives or girlfriends will will say to use a coaster you know
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:19.320]  put the coaster below the drink or you mean enjoying a cold glass of al-qaeda
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:24.120]  right a cold glass of al-qaeda because the on the exterior of the glass
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:27.400]  there's moisture that's condensing and that
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:31.640]  that moisture um... is the ambient moisture that's
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.320]  in all air uh... it doesn't matter if it's the desert
[3:10:35.320 --> 3:10:39.800]  or if it's uh... in the polar in the northern polar regions
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:45.160]  there's moisture in the air and um... our machine uh...
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:51.400]  condenses that water vapor and filters that condensate and makes it
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:55.240]  potable drinking water uh... that you can
[3:10:55.240 --> 3:11:00.040]  have at your home and control uh... so that uh...
[3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:03.240]  you know here in california where i am
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:08.360]  we now have mandatory rationing and toilet to tap most of your big facilities
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:12.200]  they take the sewage and then and then supposedly clean it up with all sorts of
[3:11:12.200 --> 3:11:14.520]  nice chemicals that are worse than drinking the poop
[3:11:14.520 --> 3:11:18.680]  and then feed it back to you but again that's good water water out of the air
[3:11:18.680 --> 3:11:23.480]  is al-qaeda water and i know that they are trying to restrict and ban and tax
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:26.760]  people with their own wells now they i guess you could hide one of these
[3:11:26.760 --> 3:11:29.320]  acola blues and land the free home of the brave in your house
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:33.000]  even if they outlawed and get a little bit of the water out of the air i mean
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:36.440]  maybe yes that we have we have plenty of people in
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:43.160]  in apartments and in uh... rural areas who who use the machines and uh...
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:46.840]  they get all their drinking water needs met uh... by
[3:11:46.840 --> 3:11:51.160]  this one little device that's about the size of a water cooler like you said
[3:11:51.160 --> 3:11:54.520]  if you plug it into a solar panel you've got it right i mean you can be off the
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:57.560]  grid right you can be off the grid in
[3:11:57.560 --> 3:12:02.440]  in all ways you know in terms of electricity if you have solar uh...
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:06.200]  and then now with water you can be off the grid so
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:10.120]  you can be your own independent al-qaeda production unit
[3:12:10.120 --> 3:12:14.120]  yeah i know this is kind of terroristic having a garden having a water
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:18.440]  purification on the air having your own power that you could that could be
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:21.880]  you can do some crimes with power accord you could electrocute somebody
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:24.840]  you could do it just like a just like they want to register guns for everybody's
[3:12:24.840 --> 3:12:26.680]  safety because you know guns are what are evil
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:30.840]  electricity you could put wires in the wall and run outside with wires and
[3:12:30.840 --> 3:12:33.880]  shock somebody so we got a ban electricity right
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:39.560]  well water will soon be evil too if it's not and delivered by the municipality
[3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:42.280]  so what do you mean soon i mean i mean to be serious
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:45.560]  there's ads everywhere demonizing bottled water saying drink your tap it's
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:48.840]  healthy there's ads telling us the mercury filled uh... literally mercury
[3:12:48.840 --> 3:12:51.320]  filled high fructose corn syrup is wonderful
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:55.160]  there's ads telling me so yeah no no we need to get off the grid
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:59.720]  yeah and and and our our technology and our company
[3:12:59.720 --> 3:13:04.600]  really wants to help people to be off the grid and be self-deficient
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:09.960]  and we see this uh... like uh... in addition to having your own garden your
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:13.160]  own firearms and oh that is
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:18.360]  oh and and your your own energy source
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:21.400]  your own water now uh... it complete
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:25.160]  uh... the the cycle of course it your your storeable food
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:30.760]  is important even more evil right if if you have water
[3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:36.520]  um... you know you can go on for an indefinite period we can have that i
[3:13:36.520 --> 3:13:39.480]  mean you could you could commit a crime if you have enough water to drink
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:42.360]  right you've got only have the government give it to you if you've been
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:46.040]  good you'll be a little pit cage and if you're good like a monkey they'll feed
[3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:48.840]  you i mean let's get serious though it is important to get off the grid but
[3:13:48.840 --> 3:13:51.000]  more importantly this produces a lot of water
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:54.120]  even in the desert a lot of water you have bigger units for people that have
[3:13:54.120 --> 3:13:58.200]  uh... larger needs very affordable right and the great part is it goes through
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:02.600]  all these other filtration systems inside right uh... we have a
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:05.800]  several different uh... filtration systems
[3:14:05.800 --> 3:14:11.640]  um... chief amongst them is the uh... activated carbon that is impregnated
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:13.080]  with silver
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:16.840]  um... and as many people know silver is a uh...
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:20.920]  a natural and i'm right in my way to make it impregnated there's too many people
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:24.520]  on the planet that's another climate crime
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:29.400]  well it's it's a chemical term uh... no i understand but it's a job
[3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:35.880]  but uh... so so we have uh... the the activated carbon filters and then we
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:38.920]  also have the uv uh... light
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:43.240]  in the system uh... two hundred and forty five nanometer uv light
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:48.680]  which are uh... in a sense it completely uh...
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:52.280]  if there's any bacteria in there let's say it's RNA
[3:14:52.280 --> 3:14:57.080]  is is stopped from from uh... from reproducing
[3:14:57.080 --> 3:15:01.240]  and it just wipes out all the bacteria that could be in the water because i don't
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:04.920]  know you know i think i'm gonna drink big healthy glasses of municipal tab water
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:08.440]  full of mercury lead arsenic chlorine sodium fluoride
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:11.480]  and then and then all the dead bacteria just kills those and i'm right
[3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:14.600]  i mean well let me ask you a question why are you an extremist
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:18.440]  and i mean i mean toilet to tap in many major cities drinking
[3:15:18.440 --> 3:15:21.160]  sewage water that's been burned with chemicals
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:25.160]  that sounds delicious i mean something yeah yeah sir do you have some kind of
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:28.280]  authority uh... problem you know they've got mental illness
[3:15:28.280 --> 3:15:31.880]  designations now for that for people that think they need to be self
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:35.640]  sufficient and people that don't trust the government or don't trust toilet
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:39.480]  water sewage you don't want reclaimed sewage
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:45.160]  well yeah i mean i just i i may be anti-establishment and i have trouble
[3:15:45.160 --> 3:15:49.400]  with authority but i just don't like the taste of sewage i mean i'm
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:15:52.760]  call me crazy but uh... well you know what i'm gonna keep
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:55.400]  drinking sewage water i don't think people should call and get a
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:15:59.080]  no getting serious this is awesome folks this is an awesome i've got one at my
[3:15:59.080 --> 3:16:03.400]  house my friends have been getting we've got i wanted the office here

[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:07.320]  this is a great unit it's uh... you know there's some other stuff out there but
[3:17:07.320 --> 3:17:11.240]  this is the best one we found especially for the price gorgeous unit
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:15.320]  and it's it's it's high tech i mean everything's controlled there and you've
[3:17:15.320 --> 3:17:19.160]  got hot water that comes out of it too tell tell folks about the control panel
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:22.840]  right it really is state of the art and uh...
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:26.600]  we it comes in to follow up on the colors we have gray
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:31.160]  black uh... will silver uh... black uh... red green
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:36.680]  and white uh... and the blue one and the uh...
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:41.080]  the the lcd screen uh... it has a little computer on it
[3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:46.120]  and it monitors the temperature of the hot and cold water tank the two separate
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:49.800]  tanks on there the hot water tank uh...
[3:17:49.800 --> 3:17:54.200]  will keep the water up to a hundred and ninety nine degrees Fahrenheit
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:17:58.600]  and it'll heat it as little as a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit
[3:17:58.600 --> 3:18:04.040]  and then the cold water aside will chill it to thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:08.280]  and all the way up to about fifty four Fahrenheit now you can talk you can
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:12.680]  toggle those and turn them off and have it just be the room temperature
[3:18:12.680 --> 3:18:17.320]  but i i think it's better tasting and more effective
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:21.400]  to have uh... you know hot water when you need it and yeah well
[3:18:21.400 --> 3:18:24.840]  all other water even if we put it through a filter which is still good
[3:18:24.840 --> 3:18:27.880]  comes downstream through all the cities and towns the runoff
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:30.760]  when you're getting out of the air it's it's about as clean as it gets and then
[3:18:30.760 --> 3:18:33.800]  it goes through filters you cannot beat this water
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:37.720]  eight hundred six nine one sixty forty three eight hundred
[3:18:37.720 --> 3:18:41.720]  six nine one sixty forty three after hours call tonight folks

[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:48.440]  uh and i just wanted to throw out a real quick youtube plug uh two channels not
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:50.840]  so much five two four and here in the light of day
[3:24:50.840 --> 3:24:53.880]  uh you know we gather up videos and everything from all across the internet
[3:24:53.880 --> 3:24:57.000]  and i piece them all together for everybody to watch
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:01.720]  excellent but um what i really wanted to talk to you about was more
[3:25:01.720 --> 3:25:06.600]  local uh posthumous violations uh... you know you have
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:09.560]  i'm sorry you're out in california where the marines run checkpoints with the
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:15.320]  police at the friday wis go ahead uh... actually i am in the monterey bay area
[3:25:15.320 --> 3:25:19.000]  and what we have going on here is uh supposedly from what police in the
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:22.200]  mainstream media tell us is that it's a gang war
[3:25:22.200 --> 3:25:26.360]  well um our mayor has been completely ineffectual in trying to combat this
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:30.360]  uh he's tried to organize fast and uh other
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:35.000]  real uh new age type stuff to help you know gather awareness in the community
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:39.480]  but uh the only thing that's happened is just make crime worse around here
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:42.680]  well society's imploding and as the economy goes to hell in a hand basket
[3:25:42.680 --> 3:25:45.880]  it's only gonna get worse and they've you know they've made shoot them up to the
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:50.440]  culture uh there's a uh...
[3:25:50.440 --> 3:25:53.160]  well we keep talking about it go ahead and talk about posthumous i'm finding a
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:56.760]  clip they just did big urban warfare drills again with block helicopters
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:00.040]  mainstream news uh in louisiana go ahead
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:03.240]  um yeah the uh what's the kicker though is that now
[3:26:03.240 --> 3:26:06.280]  uh the mayor has gotten the naval postgraduate school
[3:26:06.280 --> 3:26:09.560]  in monterey involved in uh searching for evidence
[3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:13.400]  and uh gathering new strategies to help combat this so-called gang war problem
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:16.120]  well that's what governor belgoivet said three or four months ago before he got
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:19.000]  almost probably said we're going to use the national guard to help us get the
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:23.640]  guns off the streets uh so again who's specifically in uh in the
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:28.200]  military uh the naval postgraduate school
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:32.760]  naval post graduate school yeah well i mean this is the way to introduce to
[3:26:32.760 --> 3:26:36.440]  the public through the threat integration centers the fema centers
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:39.640]  and this is announced by the way in the fema camp bill
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:42.680]  they're going to have military police everybody together quote just helping
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:46.360]  where we're just helping the army's just here in a car wreck they say that they
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:49.400]  help you're against an army helping in a car wreck
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:53.000]  but again it's to sell the idea and set the precedent
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:56.200]  exactly and i mean that's the thing that kills me most about these uh you know
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:26:59.480]  the citizens around here in this town everybody just that you know they're
[3:26:59.480 --> 3:27:07.160]  they're more sheep out there bleeding obama obama obama obama
[3:27:07.160 --> 3:27:10.920]  but wait he said the torture continues a cigarette arrest no liar
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:13.800]  ah but wait he's actually for the banker bell out
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:19.000]  no but uh well yes they both did it they're both together no
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:22.600]  well he's actually briefing up troops in the middle east no
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:25.560]  well he's appointing all these criminals from the banks who don't pay taxes
[3:27:25.560 --> 3:27:32.200]  no obama obama i'm sorry go ahead no that's fine uh that was actually great
[3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:35.400]  uh basically what you know what i'm trying to do now here in my community
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:38.760]  is really you know you know raise the constitutional awareness
[3:27:38.760 --> 3:27:43.720]  of what's going on with these events you know this is a precursor to martial law
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:48.440]  but we're already under martial law it's physical martial law on the ground
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:52.920]  another degree in the Richter scale absolutely absolutely i agree with you
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:56.200]  100 percent in fact speaking of the devil paul was in an article based on
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:27:59.320]  mainstream reports u.s. troops in black helicopters and made new orleans
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:02.840]  drop bombs this has happened so many thousands of times around the country
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:06.040]  that now i don't even cover it when i used to run around hiding in the bushes
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:09.720]  to videotape and people who deny it was going on go to info wars guys
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:14.760]  it's the bottom story in uh... news in focus the bottom story in featured
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:17.960]  stories and i want to put that up on screen anything else so so what's the
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:21.720]  public think about having the navy there you know the navy's creating its own
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:25.400]  private army now uh... you know that's right and uh you know that
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:28.040]  the defense language institute and the naval postgraduate school you know
[3:28:28.040 --> 3:28:30.600]  they're one of the premier anti-terrorism facilities
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:34.760]  in the military today well the uh... the monorail bay facility trained the
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:37.640]  terrorist in their own head of it came out and said that
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:42.440]  that's that's right exactly colonel butler
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:48.840]  but it is about carol butler when you can say obama
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:52.520]  uh... you know it it's really funny too because you know i'm i'm actually a
[3:28:52.520 --> 3:28:56.200]  former service member myself i was in the navy for a few years
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:28:59.880]  and uh... you know now that now that i'm out and uh... you know i've been
[3:28:59.880 --> 3:29:03.560]  woken up and i see everything that's going on i'm i'm really glad that i'm
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:06.840]  not in the military anymore i'd you know it's just against everything i believe
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:09.000]  in what they're doing now it's horrible
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:11.640]  well you know they're running these tv ads where they equate the new military
[3:29:11.640 --> 3:29:15.000]  with george washington george washington was fighting what our
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:18.840]  military's become right now it's not our military anymore it's not our
[3:29:18.840 --> 3:29:22.200]  government anymore and i and i'm just sad that good men and women are joining
[3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:24.520]  it because they're gonna be used go ahead
[3:29:24.520 --> 3:29:28.120]  uh... just just a kind of parallel what you said right there you know our mayor
[3:29:28.120 --> 3:29:30.600]  now with this whole gang war and this you know
[3:29:30.600 --> 3:29:34.440]  uh... exponential increase in violence you know he's equating it to a low grade
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:38.600]  9-11 and uh... you know that just that curled my blood when i heard that
[3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:42.440]  oh everything's a 9-11 the financial collapse they engineered to 9-11
[3:29:42.440 --> 3:29:45.080]  and yeah the crime race is going to explode they're going to come with a gun
[3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:47.960]  control get ready the bills are introduced they're coming for your guns

[3:33:40.280 --> 3:33:44.840]  ranting speech i saw part of it in and back and forth in the editing rooms we're working on the
[3:33:44.840 --> 3:33:49.400]  obama film and he was just saying what do you think a stimulus is everybody's like standing ovations
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:53.720]  and everyone he's getting all heated and angry and i just love the america people so much if we
[3:33:53.720 --> 3:33:59.400]  don't turn this around it's going to be a catastrophe and people just like oh he cares so much because
[3:33:59.400 --> 3:34:04.680]  they're gonna they're killing the economy not obama people that run things bush didn't run things get
[3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:10.120]  past the puppet we've got a graphic in the film where it's obama's face and you zoom right into his
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:15.240]  eye and you go behind that and it's the builder bird group in the new world order we've got another
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:20.760]  one where the curtains part and they pull bush aside and put obama in and behind the next curtain
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:26.520]  is the new world order so he's like i care so much about you i'm so mad at these bankers and
[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:30.680]  meanwhile he's bankrolled by all of them and he isn't putting salary caps on them and it's all bull
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:38.600]  bull oh man it is just insane to see all of this going oh i'm so concerned about you oh i just care
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:45.800]  about you so much oh i'm just uh let me compare this great acting and the slickness and he's
[3:34:45.800 --> 3:34:50.920]  smart and everything compared to bush i mean yes but bush was a puppet too and i know i keep
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:34:56.120]  saying that i know you the listeners know that what about the general public how do we reach out
[3:34:56.120 --> 3:35:00.440]  to these people here's paul watson's story that i'm going back to your calls us troops and black
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:08.040]  helicopters invade new orleans drop bombs that's right all the years this didn't exist they do
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:12.040]  terror drills and not announce it to the media and then there'd be smoking buildings and the
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:17.160]  media would say did not happen it's all lies the public's insane that was a scyop covered in my
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:27.960]  police state films but now it just goes into all of it oh my goodness well anyways it's up on
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:32.600]  present planet dot com and info wars dot com right now uh let us go back to your phone calls
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:39.560]  because i want to get into the fairness doctrine peter in pa you are on the air sir hi alex long
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:44.760]  time listener starters young buck on the shore wave just want to say thank you i salute you peter
[3:35:44.760 --> 3:35:49.080]  what's up thank you sir well a couple things i'd like to address real quick i wonder if anybody
[3:35:49.080 --> 3:35:55.640]  uh notices that uh i don't know if it's a civil war that's brewing or what i mean with the eight
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:36:00.920]  states and vermont looking to succeed i don't think anybody's even noticed the similarities
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:07.240]  between barack obama and a blink in the civil war no he knows that listen listen they've got psych
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:11.960]  warfare war games the pentagon admits of how society will break down the first place i read
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:16.600]  about the u.s breaking up was 10 years ago in a pentagon perspective saying they believed it was
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:20.440]  going to happen but they want to break us up so the globalists can take us over into the union
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:25.720]  and now exactly what i was thinking that was my next step um you know let me tell you let me tell
[3:36:25.720 --> 3:36:31.560]  you this is too important look curtain emma did an article on this yesterday okay they know after
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:35.480]  federalizing things and bankrupting the states by design that things are going to fall apart very
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:39.560]  good i mean we're talking in sane times we're going into folks almost no way to avert it
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:45.320]  because they're hot showing it making sure it's happening now what you have to understand is
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:50.120]  that they understand the people are going to revolt at the state level and try to bring in
[3:36:50.120 --> 3:36:53.560]  liberty they know the people are going to demand that made off and the rest of them actually be
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:59.400]  punished and so that's what north com does is actually block the states and then they're comparing
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:03.720]  lincoln and everything that happened with what obama is going to do so he says i'm going to be
[3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:09.000]  like lincoln he means that he's going to have the feds occupy everything but absolutely that it's
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:14.600]  all scripted go ahead oh i mean i'm not topic just quickly i want to touch on i have a good
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:20.520]  body i'm going to call him the ribasaur he had he was in the military he is so fed up that he's
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:27.000]  ready to hit montana with his guns but i mean what i'm saying as far as that goes is people
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:33.720]  look at lincoln like lincoln was a good president okay he is corpus gone camp let's explain what
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:39.640]  happened for those that don't know and i've read the writings of lincoln i've studied it lincoln
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:45.480]  wasn't bad the south wasn't bad now let me explain what happened this is mainline history but it's
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:50.840]  not taught in school but in real scholarly history books it's admitted now listen the british had
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:38:00.520]  lost the war uh in the 1780s started the 1776 they came into their agent uh alexander hamilton
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:06.360]  uh who mr burr then killed they said step outside back then they just step outside
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:10.680]  punk they went out and shut you know he killed him uh in a duel and he wanted to make george
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:14.440]  washington king he wanted to set up a new banking elite and they were making deals with british on
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:19.480]  the side they they killed him then they tried with the british by the turn of the century
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:27.000]  1800 to overthrow the u.s there were rebellions armies marched on the capital okay then andrew
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:32.280]  jackson came up later loving or hating the point is he routed the british banks out the british
[3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:37.640]  banks he gave speeches the british banks went into south carolina georgia and they and they said the
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:43.080]  north scott taxes on you let's have a rebellion and split off and britain will let you have the
[3:38:43.080 --> 3:38:52.920]  entire south and then in to the west and so the south in the 1830s rebelled and uh andrew jackson
[3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:58.200]  had to mass an army and only because he was from the south they stood down and he said i'm going
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:01.720]  to march down there and kick your butt this is a british conspiracy it was it was in the
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:10.200]  newspapers so that stopped then the um the civil war wasn't about ending slavery it was about
[3:39:10.200 --> 3:39:16.280]  controlling western expansion and taxation and representation of the southern states and so the
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:21.400]  british were in the south funding the rebellion they brought in the cannons the weapons everything
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:30.040]  then when the war started they massed troops in canada in ottawa and in um toronto 20 000 of them
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:36.440]  and and put a fleet off new york threatening to invade so then the british czar sent a fleet
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:41.720]  for the north to menace them that's why later in 1917 the british overthrew their cousins the
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:48.040]  czars that was over that and other issues but but you're absolutely right that lincoln wrote all
[3:39:48.040 --> 3:39:51.960]  these letters and all these things and said i do not want to free one slave it's not what this is
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:57.400]  about uh this is but but but he used the only political support he had was the abolitionist
[3:39:57.400 --> 3:40:02.520]  who said we're going to support you but then you've got to free the slaves and then lighten the war
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:07.160]  to destabilize things in the south he did do that so so so regard i mean that's just a historical
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:13.400]  fact but but then people say well then aren't you for the south no andrew jackson wasn't for the
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:18.920]  south he knew that it was a setup so uh you're absolutely right go ahead certainly one more
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:24.040]  thing i'd like to touch on um you know the telegraph you know with the psi apps backslash
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:29.720]  propaganda conditioning i'd also like to touch on the fact everybody thought we were nuts when
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:34.360]  uh the playing cards came out the n w o cards and the female pamphlets with the world trade
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:39.800]  center in the car here in there the government flies jumbo jets blows up the world trade center
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:43.320]  stages everything they've been doing and that that guy was right here in austin that made those cards
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:50.360]  i mean that's i i don't know who that guy was talking to or who he's with but i mean i don't
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:55.160]  know if you saw the writing on the wall but i mean they're all tied in the illuminati they just
[3:40:55.160 --> 3:40:59.640]  they put it out there right for the blind right down to what did me i hear you in the narnia
[3:40:59.640 --> 3:41:06.200]  series the a is the masonic symbol i hear you and i appreciate your call sometimes they plant these
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:12.360]  in pop culture other times they pick up pop culture ideas and then stage it the cia and the defense
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.160]  department the last time i saw it the defense department alone was spending 48 million dollars
[3:41:17.160 --> 3:41:23.640]  a year paying for scripts from the biggest script writing houses in uh in los angeles in and in
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:31.400]  burbank in places of fictional terror attacks as scenario so the there's a big sigh up going on
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:34.440]  you're absolutely right let's go to the next caller got a hurry now that was a great caller
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:38.280]  about spent seven minutes with him bradley in Delaware you're on the air go ahead bradley
[3:41:38.760 --> 3:41:44.200]  hey alex it's brady but thanks uh yesterday had jason bermason and you've talked about
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:49.960]  that game crackdown mm-hmm and in that game you're a super soldier for the state did you know at
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:57.080]  the end of that game they actually the guy that's like your controller actually says you know who
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:01.720]  set this all up we did it and it's like they're throwing it out there blatantly obvious and most
[3:42:01.720 --> 3:42:07.320]  people just so at the end of the game they admit that that the government started the terror attacks
[3:42:07.320 --> 3:42:12.280]  as a pretext to attack the population and and and on giant cartoons they're putting in one of
[3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:17.160]  the biggest newspapers in the world the government stages terror attacks to put us all in fema camps
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:21.160]  and bring in the north american union you're telling me that game then that that that you've
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:26.840]  gone to the end of uh does like all the other games uh there was another game do sex where at
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:31.720]  the end of the game you learn the government was staging the terror attacks yeah that's exactly what
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:36.600]  it is and i think it's the end uh hold on at the end the commander calls you in it says good job
[3:42:36.600 --> 3:42:41.480]  we stage the terror attack yeah at the end of the game you're actually playing the soldier and you're
[3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:47.160]  fighting gangs and terrorists and taking out criminals and at the end of the game he goes
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:51.640]  well who funded these people well guess who it was us it was off the government the guy that's
[3:42:51.640 --> 3:42:59.560]  running you and then what do you say what else does he say i that's all i remember i played
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:04.360]  the game about a year ago uh i know through the whole thing that you you have unlimited funds
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:09.240]  you get all these guns all the time that all you want all you want you can jump on buildings and
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:14.200]  pull stuff up and it's like they're they're just shoving it in your face like here you go
[3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:18.760]  this is what we're doing and these young children are identifying with their tribal warfare programming
[3:43:19.320 --> 3:43:24.120]  uh with walking up and assassinating citizens barman said you go around killing americans right
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:30.680]  yeah basically well you're yeah because it looks a lot like uh seattle or uh washington dc and i
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:35.240]  guess one one quick thing and i'll get off because i know you're short on time um i was talking to
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:39.400]  somebody i know that's in the law enforcement division and he said that they're trying to
[3:43:39.400 --> 3:43:45.160]  secretly or quietly push through gun confiscation gun vans my question is if they're trying to
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:49.160]  push it through congress and they don't have any real power why don't they just do it well they
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:55.080]  are they have gun sweeps from the national guard in illinois and other places uh they are tracking
[3:43:55.080 --> 3:44:01.480]  gun owners uh they've introduced the bills without even uh well just with executive fiat
[3:44:01.480 --> 3:44:05.880]  not even a bill the other saying they can just say whoever they want can't own a gun
[3:44:05.880 --> 3:44:10.760]  i mean this is it man that these are look the same banks that funded the bolsheviks on record
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:17.720]  and the same banks that funded hitler and malin and snouty classified uh in fact
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:22.360]  guys bring it in here to me i brought my book to sent into tyranny in and it's got paper shoved in
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:27.240]  with it i think it's laying on the table over there it's david rockefeller quotes these are
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:32.040]  bibliographed okay these quotes i'm putting in the new film for in game these are quotes i didn't
[3:44:32.040 --> 3:44:36.520]  use these are quotes that we sent off for the newspapers went to the library these are real
[3:44:36.520 --> 3:44:43.080]  quotes and in here he talks about how he doesn't pay taxes in here they say the super national
[3:44:43.080 --> 3:44:47.480]  sovereignty of an in intellectual elite with world bankers is surely preferable to the national
[3:44:47.480 --> 3:44:51.480]  auto determination practice of past centuries david rockefeller and bill deberg group address
[3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:57.960]  he's got other um sickening quotes in here about all the things they're planning i
[3:44:58.680 --> 3:45:05.160]  i'm sorry go ahead oh i i agree with you i'm i'm glad that you woke me up and and that fox news
[3:45:05.160 --> 3:45:10.840]  report this morning that we're all um you were crazy and we're idiotic and we we have a mental
[3:45:10.840 --> 3:45:18.280]  disorder uh i i don't think that they understand what's coming out of their own mouth well i mean
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:24.200]  i mean absolutely thank you they have different slices of the public totally dumbed down can't
[3:45:24.200 --> 3:45:29.000]  even talk uh you're pretty much dumbed down you know know about cartoons and football
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:34.840]  someone informed to think they're geniuses then kind of establishment uh wonks who think they
[3:45:34.840 --> 3:45:38.840]  know more who are in the left-right paradigm and then evil people who serve the new world
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:43.320]  order that really know what's going on and then the good people and so they're servicing different
[3:45:43.320 --> 3:45:47.320]  propaganda that's why they'll stay on shows every day there is no plan for a world government if you
[3:45:47.320 --> 3:45:51.720]  say it you're a child molester there is no plan for a world government if you say it it's secret
[3:45:51.720 --> 3:45:56.760]  racism code there is no plan for a world government or gun confiscation if you say it you're mentally
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:46:00.680]  ill and they now have mental mentally ill psychological designations hundreds of them
[3:46:01.800 --> 3:46:05.560]  if you believe in a new world order conspiracy theory this is an fbi training manuals you're
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:11.560]  a terrorist you're mentally ill while then to a certain segment the so-called intelligentsia
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:15.960]  in the financial times of london and the wall street journal they say world government was kept
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:21.640]  secret for your own good it's here now it's going to save you this is word for word it is dictatorial
[3:46:22.280 --> 3:46:26.680]  but dictatorial is good what did they the rockefeller say in that quote

[3:54:39.800 --> 3:54:48.280]  now this is uh mr press with his radio show in dc with a us senator saying oh yes we want to
[3:54:48.280 --> 3:54:51.800]  poll talk radio accountable and then we want to tell stations what they've got to air and what
[3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:58.120]  they've got to do so uh here you go the attack on the first amendment and this is all being spurred
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:03.480]  by the domestic act that they're trying to push the violent radicalization act restricting internet
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:08.280]  free speech this show and a lot more maybe they take me off the air it'll be a vacation i don't know
[3:55:10.200 --> 3:55:14.600]  Alex you gotta stop them from doing this okay i'll try what about you uh let's go
[3:55:14.600 --> 3:55:22.120]  ahead and go to some of this audio you certainly have been one of if not the most supportive voices
[3:55:22.120 --> 3:55:27.160]  in the united states senate for progressive talk radio so i know you must be dismayed to learn
[3:55:27.160 --> 3:55:33.000]  that here in washington dc as we've been talking about this hour obama 1260 is going away they're
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:37.160]  changing the format they're dumping progressive talk which is you know senator they've done in
[3:55:37.160 --> 3:55:43.240]  market after you hear that radio station named after obama sacramento you know miami this last
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:48.520]  week because you suck that's why can we do about that and aren't owners of radio stations
[3:55:48.520 --> 3:55:55.880]  you're a sniveling idiot provides some balance of voices absolutely absolutely this is such a
[3:55:55.880 --> 3:56:02.600]  a disservice to the public and um i continue to think that uh we need to be seeing a couple
[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:10.120]  things happen just uh continuing to support um great uh radio hosts like yourself and and promoting
[3:56:10.120 --> 3:56:17.400]  uh more uh programs that are that are um coming into the marketplace but we're going to have to
[3:56:17.400 --> 3:56:23.640]  have some accountability you know if we had something called the fairness doctrine um back
[3:56:24.360 --> 3:56:30.440]  until the 80s when it was removed where where you had to have balance and i think something
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:38.040]  that requires that that in a market with um uh you know owners that have multiple stations
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:45.800]  that they have got to have balance there has to be some community uh interest balance you know
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:54.120]  standard that this is both sides have to be heard and i think that you know i see this myself as a
[3:56:54.120 --> 3:56:58.600]  as a member of the senate when you see okay and it goes on and on how they want to do this and
[3:56:58.600 --> 3:57:03.240]  they're talking about introducing bills or having the fcc through fiat do it just just order it they
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:07.640]  did this before until the late 80s you couldn't have any political opinion it was just all repeat
[3:57:07.640 --> 3:57:13.480]  government propaganda and then it became neocon fake information but so what you can't stop free
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:19.000]  speech and you can't shut it down and um they want to make people put bill press on
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:27.160]  with that buzzing audio i mean they want to make you listen to this and they keep talking about
[3:57:27.160 --> 3:57:31.720]  both sides as if it's republican democrat no it's republican democrat together here
[3:57:31.720 --> 3:57:36.680]  and then we the people are right here and this whole attack the fcc's talked about regulating
[3:57:36.680 --> 3:57:43.480]  the internet and websites and news sites and um the government's talked about making all
[3:57:43.480 --> 3:57:47.960]  sites be handicap accessible little sites and people can't pay for that and can't do it that'll
[3:57:47.960 --> 3:57:52.040]  bring it down to a handful they are trying to shut down free speech on the internet to
[3:57:52.040 --> 3:57:58.600]  and taxing and regulating and uh no more peer to peer or you know more net neutrality they're
[3:57:58.600 --> 3:58:02.840]  attacking free speech so in the time we've got let's continue to fight for free speech and expand
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:09.560]  our platform as much as possible we had uh bob Chapman on we had steve wantson on i covered a
[3:58:09.560 --> 3:58:16.440]  lot of key news in the first hour dealing with the uh eight states saying we know your new world
[3:58:16.440 --> 3:58:21.560]  order we know you're building FEMA camps this is in bills and we're not going along with this so
[3:58:21.560 --> 3:58:25.000]  that is very exciting and a story that occurred demo wrote that links to all the mainstream
[3:58:25.000 --> 3:58:30.360]  documents and information on that so uh we'll be back tomorrow well back sunday actually uh
[3:58:30.360 --> 3:58:34.280]  four to six p.m. on the radio but the retransmission starts now at info wars
