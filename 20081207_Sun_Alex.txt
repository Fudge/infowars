[00:32.800 --> 00:41.800]  Hi, I'm Jody Jordan. President-elect Barack Obama tells NBC that the survival of the U.S. auto industry is important,
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.800]  but that any proposed bailout needs to work toward an industry that actually works.
[00:46.800 --> 00:55.800]  It is a huge employer across many states. Millions of people directly or indirectly are reliant on that industry,
[00:55.800 --> 00:58.800]  and so I don't think it's an option to simply allow it to collapse.
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.800]  And a key Michigan lawmaker says he's not sure there's enough votes to pass an auto industry rescue plan,
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.800]  but Senator Carl Levin says he's confident an agreement will be reached on a 15-billion-aid package.
[01:10.800 --> 01:14.800]  Ron Gettelfinger is the president of the United Auto Workers.
[01:14.800 --> 01:25.800]  We're very hopeful that Congress and the administration will be able to pass legislation that will help us out of this economic downturn that we're in.

[02:27.800 --> 02:36.800]  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the U.S. took the wrong approach to Iraq after Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003.
[02:36.800 --> 02:44.800]  She was the national security advisor at the time, and now tells Fox News Sunday that the Bush administration should not have put a single department,
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.800]  the Pentagon, in charge of running Iraq.
[02:47.800 --> 02:56.800]  India's foreign minister denies charges that he made a threatening phone call to Pakistan's president at the height of last month's Mumbai terror siege.
[02:56.800 --> 03:02.800]  Pakistani officials insist that he or someone else in India's foreign ministry placed the call.
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.800]  NBC is named David Gregory to be moderator of Meet the Press.
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.800]  Tom Brokaw has been serving as Enra moderator since Tim Russer died in June.
[03:11.800 --> 03:15.800]  Gregory is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.
[03:15.800 --> 03:23.800]  And it looks like Florida and Oklahoma are headed for a match-up at college football's national championship game next month in Miami.

[03:54.800 --> 04:07.800]  Senator John McCain says the situation in Afghanistan will get tougher before it gets easier, describing the situation as similar to how things were in Iraq.
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.800]  It's a tough situation there. We're going to have to have additional troops and additional help.
[04:13.800 --> 04:16.800]  McCain has been visiting as part of a Senate delegation.
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.800]  President-elect Barack Obama has asked McCain to report to him on his findings.
[04:21.800 --> 04:30.800]  government have blasted their way into two transport depots in Pakistan and torched scores of vehicles destined for US-led troops in Afghanistan.
[04:30.800 --> 04:39.800]  The bold attack revs up concern that militants are trying to choke key supply routes for Western forces in Afghanistan and drive up the cost of war.
[04:39.800 --> 04:42.800]  This is Lieutenant Colonel Rummy Nelson-Green.
[04:42.800 --> 04:51.800]  We're always concerned and we are always in prudent planning and coordination for viable alternatives if need be.
[04:51.800 --> 04:57.800]  But thus far, these attacks have been militarily insignificant and have not created a great impact on our operations.
[04:57.800 --> 05:01.800]  An offensive Christmas parade in Texas has turned tragic.
[05:01.800 --> 05:08.800]  A 10-year-old girl died yesterday after Beaumont police say she jumped off a float and was run over by a trailer.
[05:08.800 --> 05:11.800]  This is police supervisor Monica Smith.
[05:11.800 --> 05:14.800]  It appeared that she had suffered serious injuries.
[05:14.800 --> 05:23.800]  There was an ambulance that was at the parade that was from the Dover and the child was transported to St. Elizabeth and she was later pronounced deceased at the hospital.
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.800]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN-USA, Radio News.

[07:08.800 --> 07:10.800]  Welcome and thank you for joining us today.
[07:10.800 --> 07:18.800]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and we're going to have wide open phones at 877-590-5525.
[07:18.800 --> 07:26.800]  Kurt Nemo, the editor and one of the chief writers over at infowars.com, will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes.
[07:26.800 --> 07:36.800]  He's done a detailed report two weeks after the terrible Lubeye attacks in what was formerly Bombay, India.
[07:36.800 --> 07:46.800]  The implicated being tied to Pakistan, a lot more has now unfolded and developed there and the evidence is clear.
[07:46.800 --> 07:49.800]  This is a Western intelligence operation.
[07:49.800 --> 07:54.800]  By the way, most of the Indian papers happen to be in English.
[07:54.800 --> 08:02.800]  So it's the Times of India and literally scores of other mainstream papers are now reporting this.
[08:02.800 --> 08:07.800]  So that's where our information is coming from, not just out of Pakistan.
[08:07.800 --> 08:12.800]  We'll explain the very nuanced situation that we're dealing with here.
[08:12.800 --> 08:16.800]  This is Cloak and Dagger, this is Complex, this is Black Ops.
[08:16.800 --> 08:22.800]  And so we're not sure if it's elements of Pakistani intelligence that we know are Western controlled.
[08:22.800 --> 08:24.800]  That's mainstream admitted.
[08:24.800 --> 08:27.800]  We don't know if it's MI5, MI6.
[08:27.800 --> 08:29.800]  MI5 does operate outside England, not just six.
[08:29.800 --> 08:31.800]  We don't know if it's CIA.
[08:31.800 --> 08:39.800]  We don't know if it's Mossad, but we have elements of all of those clearly implicated in the Pakistanis, not just with not having a motive,
[08:39.800 --> 08:43.800]  but with the evidence clearly are not involved in this.
[08:43.800 --> 08:47.800]  And this is meant to kick off a war in the region.
[08:47.800 --> 08:48.800]  So we'll be going over that.
[08:48.800 --> 08:54.800]  In fact, the Indian Express reporting today, Rice, U.S. will act against a ledge,
[08:54.800 --> 09:01.800]  move by perpetrators in Pakistan will not with not just bombardments, but to perhaps even a physical invasion.
[09:01.800 --> 09:06.800]  Now, remember two months ago, Joe Biden and Barack Obama and others said the crisis will be Pakistan.
[09:06.800 --> 09:17.800]  There's going to be a huge international crisis leading up to the inauguration on the 21st of next month in early 2009 on the 21st of January.
[09:17.800 --> 09:24.800]  And we went on there and said it's going to be Pakistan because separate from talking about the international crisis in other talks,
[09:24.800 --> 09:27.800]  they had been gearing up to go into Pakistan.
[09:27.800 --> 09:29.800]  And that's the new place the Pentagon wants to go into.
[09:29.800 --> 09:32.800]  So we'll break that up coming up in 30 minutes.
[09:32.800 --> 09:38.800]  This is getting really, really serious. Hundreds of NATO vehicles were torched and blown up in Pakistan today.
[09:38.800 --> 09:40.800]  That's up on Reuters right now.
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.800]  We have that up on infowars.com.
[09:43.800 --> 09:49.800]  McCain is in the Indian Express as well, a warning Pakistan of Indian strikes.
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.800]  John McCain hasn't really been surfacing since he lost back in November,
[09:55.800 --> 10:07.800]  but now he pops up and tells the newspaper and tells Pakistani officials and Indian officials that there are elements of the Indian government
[10:07.800 --> 10:10.800]  repairing a new war with Pakistan.
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.800]  They had a somewhat of a war, a border skirmish with artillery and helicopters and mortars.
[10:15.800 --> 10:18.800]  Thousands were killed on both sides in 2002.
[10:18.800 --> 10:22.800]  Both countries have the bomb and medium range delivery systems.
[10:22.800 --> 10:29.800]  They can fire missiles at least 3,000 kilometers a piece, but a little over 2,000 miles.
[10:29.800 --> 10:31.800]  So that's a very, very serious issue.
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.800]  And we have the RAND Corporation.
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.800]  That's where the Big New Brzezinski Obama's advisor comes from.
[10:37.800 --> 10:47.800]  Brzezinski came up with a 9-11 plan, the New Pearl Harbor event, that was then plagiarized by the neocons.
[10:47.800 --> 10:53.800]  Brzezinski publicly said we need giant terror attacks in the U.S. as a pretext to go into the Middle East,
[10:53.800 --> 10:56.800]  but he said he wanted to start a war in Central Asia first.
[10:56.800 --> 11:02.800]  This was a national security advisor to Carter, founder of the trilateral commission with David Rockefeller.
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.800]  So he's the real brains here along with Henry Kissinger, but I'm already getting into this.
[11:07.800 --> 11:09.800]  It's very complex.
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.800]  The average American thinks that this is in the Middle East what we're facing.
[11:13.800 --> 11:15.800]  This is in Central Asia.
[11:15.800 --> 11:17.800]  And I'm not saying you're stupid.
[11:17.800 --> 11:24.800]  You know, all about the football scores and all about the Cowboys not going into the playoffs.
[11:24.800 --> 11:33.800]  So you need to start spending some time learning about this, not the Cowboys and the playoffs.
[11:33.800 --> 11:35.800]  I combine that word with the Playboys.
[11:35.800 --> 11:37.800]  Cowboys and the Playoffs, Playboys.
[11:37.800 --> 11:39.800]  Seriously.
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.800]  You know, I love this nation.
[11:41.800 --> 11:42.800]  I love this country.
[11:42.800 --> 11:48.800]  I love to be an American, but I hear all these charity groups and people for PR reasons running around.
[11:48.800 --> 11:50.800]  Let's give toys to needy children.
[11:50.800 --> 11:52.800]  Let's give toys to needy children.
[11:52.800 --> 11:53.800]  What they need is a future.
[11:53.800 --> 11:58.800]  What they need is their liberties and freedoms, the Bill of Rights being given to them and being protected by the American people.
[11:58.800 --> 12:06.800]  What they need is a true free market economic system and not this crony capitalism with 8.4 trillion.
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.800]  Last week we were here and it was 7.8 trillion.
[12:09.800 --> 12:14.800]  As of Wednesday, AP and Reuters reported that it is now 8.4 trillion.
[12:14.800 --> 12:17.800]  And I guess next week it will be 9 trillion or something.
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.800]  Hundreds and hundreds of billions of day being stolen.
[12:19.800 --> 12:21.800]  More than a trillion a week being stolen.
[12:21.800 --> 12:24.800]  Seven weeks ago the banker bailout took place.
[12:24.800 --> 12:26.800]  And again, they always mislabel things.
[12:26.800 --> 12:28.800]  It was not a banker bailout.
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.800]  It was a foreign banker takeover of the United States.
[12:33.800 --> 12:36.800]  So we'll be breaking down some of that as well today.
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.800]  Barack Obama went on to meet the press this morning and I have a transcript of it here.
[12:41.800 --> 12:43.800]  Very, very chilling.
[12:43.800 --> 12:47.800]  And he said, headline, this is from AP,
[12:47.800 --> 12:52.800]  economy to get worse before it improves.
[12:52.800 --> 12:59.800]  And so when you hear things like that coming from the president-elect,
[12:59.800 --> 13:02.800]  you had better hold on to your wallets and look out.
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.800]  Because what's happening is foreign offshore banks are imploding this country and the world
[13:06.800 --> 13:08.800]  by design to consolidate them.
[13:08.800 --> 13:11.800]  So we'll get into that for you as well.
[13:11.800 --> 13:14.800]  I also have a little police state stack of news here.
[13:14.800 --> 13:17.800]  And this is on the tip of the iceberg.
[13:17.800 --> 13:20.800]  I have seen the last few days.
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.800]  Toronto bans bottled water sales but junk sodas remain legal.
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.800]  This is out of natural news reporting on a story out of the Toronto Starb on Friday.
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.800]  Now, a government that can ban bottled water, saying plastic's bad for the environment,
[13:36.800 --> 13:38.800]  can ban anything else they want.
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.800]  See, it starts with low flush toilets and it starts with washers and dryers.
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.800]  Then it starts with remote controlled thermostats, the government controls in your houses.
[13:46.800 --> 13:48.800]  It's already happening in California.
[13:48.800 --> 13:51.800]  Then it moves into banning fireplaces, space heaters.
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.800]  This is happening in Europe, happening in U.S. cities, happening in Canadian cities.
[13:55.800 --> 14:01.800]  It sets the precedent to control and regulate your everyday life.
[14:01.800 --> 14:02.800]  It is feudalism.
[14:02.800 --> 14:03.800]  It has surfed them.
[14:03.800 --> 14:09.800]  It's worse than any surf or feudal slave in ancient Europe or ancient China had to live under.
[14:09.800 --> 14:11.800]  This is total control.
[14:11.800 --> 14:16.800]  And in the same speaking of control all over the nation from Oregon to Ohio,
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.800]  every day I see reports of natural organic farmers being raided by the police.
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.800]  Now, coming and saying you're not allowed to have unlicensed agriculture
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.800]  and you've got to have all these special licenses to be able to go to the farmer's market
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.800]  or have a food co-op here in the land of the free home of the brave.
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.800]  I mean, Russia wasn't this bad.
[14:38.800 --> 14:40.800]  Though Stalin did try some similar things.
[14:40.800 --> 14:42.800]  It's like the Bob Dylan song.
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.800]  Some day even your home garden is going to be against the law.
[14:46.800 --> 14:52.800]  That's in sundown on the union was made in the USA.
[14:52.800 --> 14:54.800]  Oh my goodness.
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.800]  Yeah, they want to grow their corn on the moon and eat it raw.
[14:59.800 --> 15:03.800]  And I mean, that is literally what this is turning into every form of control.
[15:03.800 --> 15:09.800]  Well, the same rural county in Ohio, and this is all over the Ohio papers.
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.800]  We've got links to it up on prisonplanet.com.
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.800]  If you want to link through to it, you have a page just of links to the different news stories there.
[15:15.800 --> 15:19.800]  We do those little boil down stories like the Kurt Nemo posted.
[15:19.800 --> 15:22.800]  But police SWAT team holds entire family at gunpoint.
[15:22.800 --> 15:24.800]  It was a local farming co-op.
[15:24.800 --> 15:31.800]  And so for the farmer's market, getting ready this weekend, the people came and, you know,
[15:31.800 --> 15:34.800]  mashed their produce.
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.800]  I guess their last crop of the year.
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.800]  And, you know, some of the canned vegetables and things there at this facility.
[15:42.800 --> 15:48.800]  And the police with machine guns SWAT team came and held them at gunpoint for nine hours,
[15:48.800 --> 15:49.800]  took their computers.
[15:49.800 --> 15:55.800]  I didn't have a warrant, by the way, took their computers, took their food, took everything.
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.800]  And the reason this is important, it's the same county last year where they arrested a bunch of Amish people.
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.800]  And in one case, the Amish man was giving raw milk, which is much better for the course of the past,
[16:06.800 --> 16:08.800]  right stuff to needy people.
[16:08.800 --> 16:10.800]  So they arrested him.
[16:10.800 --> 16:13.800]  So see, they're going to put poison in your baby's formula.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.800]  You'll melamine and say that's okay and mercury in your vaccines and have wide open borders
[16:17.800 --> 16:20.800]  and total tyranny and the government's caught shipping and drugs every week.
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.800]  But the Amish and the people growing vegetables, they're going to jail.
[16:24.800 --> 16:27.800]  That's the freedom. We'll be right back.
[16:29.800 --> 16:33.800]  Santa, Christmas Eve and you haven't left yet?
[16:33.800 --> 16:35.800]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[16:35.800 --> 16:36.800]  No.

[17:04.800 --> 17:07.800]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?

[17:47.800 --> 17:54.800]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections. Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[17:54.800 --> 18:00.800]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the long-term fiscal outlook document.
[18:00.800 --> 18:09.800]  Clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control, this will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank deposits.
[18:09.800 --> 18:14.800]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the US dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[18:28.800 --> 18:34.800]  The headlines are clear. The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[18:34.800 --> 18:37.800]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[18:37.800 --> 18:39.800]  The market of beast is at hand.
[18:39.800 --> 18:45.800]  The governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system. Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[19:44.800 --> 19:49.800]  Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in Northern Minnesota.

[20:38.800 --> 20:45.800]  Through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[20:45.800 --> 20:51.800]  We are live. It is December 7, 2008.
[20:51.800 --> 20:57.800]  Not December 7, 1941. A day that will live and end for me.
[20:57.800 --> 21:01.800]  Coming up later, I'm going to break down with Barack Obama's planning for the United States.
[21:01.800 --> 21:08.800]  It's IMF and World Bank shock therapy. You don't know what that term is. Google IMF World Bank shock therapy.
[21:08.800 --> 21:19.800]  That's where they implode the nation's economy and take all of the assets into the hands of foreign corporations and banks, claiming that it will be good for the nation.
[21:19.800 --> 21:23.800]  That's why he's saying it's going to be painful. A lot of people aren't going to like this.
[21:23.800 --> 21:32.800]  He's going to have the mainstream media fully behind him because the mainstream media is predominantly over 90% of it owned by foreign offshore multinational globalist corporations.
[21:32.800 --> 21:37.800]  So get ready with Barack Obama. It is going to be painful.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.800]  It would have been painful with John McCain as well.
[21:45.800 --> 21:52.800]  I'm still not used to this phone system in here. How do I pull the phone system back up on my screen if I don't have it up here in front of me?
[21:52.800 --> 21:54.800]  Thank you. Come in here and do that for me.
[21:54.800 --> 21:56.800]  Jared and I appreciate it.
[21:56.800 --> 22:01.800]  I've got my weekday show with my own phone system that I am used to.
[22:01.800 --> 22:08.800]  And on this one, sometimes it gets minimized and then I can't pull it up. I don't want to. Maybe it's this caller data one.
[22:08.800 --> 22:10.800]  No, see, it's not up there.
[22:10.800 --> 22:25.800]  All right. Well, while you guys are fixing that, finishing up with the situation all over the nation of the game wardens and the environmental police and the Department of Natural Resources, federal state, local,
[22:25.800 --> 22:29.800]  they are just harassing farmers and ranchers everywhere.
[22:29.800 --> 22:35.800]  And now, federally, and at several state levels, they're trying to pass a flatulence tax.
[22:35.800 --> 22:41.800]  This is in the Associated Press Friday. We've been telling you about it for years, but now it's in the news. You want to look it up.
[22:41.800 --> 23:02.800]  Where the methane that is released from the cows is going to be taxed $160 plus per cow, $60 something per pig, all this money, as if methane from animals is bad.
[23:02.800 --> 23:18.800]  As if that isn't a naturally occurring part of the planet. Whales release masses of methane. Some whales eat as much as 7000 pounds of plankton a day and release the amount of methane that hundreds of cows would release.
[23:18.800 --> 23:21.800]  I guess we've got to go out and kill all the whales.
[23:21.800 --> 23:30.800]  No, this is about taxing all human activity and setting the precedent to be able to put a tax on literally breathing.
[23:30.800 --> 23:49.800]  We exhale carbon dioxide. We exhale carbon dioxide and Barack Obama has sworn to list it as a toxic waste, as a controlled poison, as a threat to the environment.
[23:49.800 --> 24:00.800]  Government is going to tax it at the local, federal and international level, and the Times of London and others have reported that the very bankers orchestrating a worldwide financial collapse.
[24:00.800 --> 24:04.800]  We have their own documents for doing it by design. We've posted those. We've covered it.
[24:04.800 --> 24:11.800]  We told you years ago we're going to then propose a worldwide carbon tax where you buy the carbon credits and pay the taxes to them.
[24:11.800 --> 24:17.800]  And that now has openly been announced in hundreds of newspapers in the last month.
[24:17.800 --> 24:26.800]  So we have banning bottled water in major cities in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, banning or taxing fireplaces, banning or taxing space eaters.
[24:26.800 --> 24:38.800]  Just all of this control coming in saying a fireplace is bad for the environment, saying that it adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.800]  I mean, is this freedom? Is this what liberty is all about?
[24:43.800 --> 24:48.800]  That's why I said at the start of the show, it's great that people collect all these toys and give all these toys to poor children.
[24:48.800 --> 24:54.800]  But what those children really need is to not be in government training camps, government indoctrination centers, the public schools.
[24:54.800 --> 25:04.800]  What they really need is to not have melamine poison that they've always said is deadly poison and causes all sorts of cancer and kidney failure, especially in small children.
[25:04.800 --> 25:14.800]  And that's just a fact. We need to not have lead in the toys. We need to really deal with serious environmental problems. But no, that's not going to happen.
[25:14.800 --> 25:20.800]  Now the FDA says, ah, you know what melamine is good for you. You know what, mercury and shots are good for you.
[25:20.800 --> 25:29.800]  So all of this is about control. All of this is about taxation and regulation and big corporations and big agribusiness.
[25:29.800 --> 25:37.800]  They lobby to get laws passed to shut down small family gardens and farms that are producing organic food.
[25:37.800 --> 25:50.800]  Just a couple years ago, the big dairy producers using this bovine growth hormone, raising your girls and boys, you know, six and a half, seven feet tall and mom and popper, you know, five, two and five, eight.
[25:50.800 --> 25:59.800]  And we've got all this acromeglia going on. Acromeglia is just off the charts or acromeglia-like diseases.
[25:59.800 --> 26:05.800]  That's why your girls are going into puberty. It was at seven, eight years old. Now it's five, six years old.
[26:05.800 --> 26:15.800]  It's all the hormones. And there's hundreds of studies on that and all the chemicals being put into the cows and the antibiotics and the rest of it.
[26:15.800 --> 26:29.800]  So what happens? A couple years ago, big agribusiness came in and tried to get the federal government to pass laws where organic milk companies just couldn't say we're organic and we don't have growth hormone.
[26:29.800 --> 26:44.800]  Now they failed. But in many cases, they're not failing. In fact, last year they succeeded about 18 months ago and getting a law passed where before, if something had a government organic stamp on it, it had to be 100% organic, organic fertilizer.
[26:44.800 --> 27:01.800]  No GMO. It couldn't be cross species. There couldn't be cockroach genes in your tomatoes or pig genes in your tomatoes or your potatoes or your corn or your wheat, which has caused sterility and mice and a lot more and all sorts of health problems and caused all sorts of allergies.
[27:01.800 --> 27:16.800]  They've been tied to cancer and lab animals massively. And they came in and got the law changed where the majority, 75% of the fillers in the food product can be GMO, genetically modified organisms.
[27:16.800 --> 27:32.800]  And see, they're fighting so you don't even have a choice, the freedom to find out what you're being fed, what you're eating. Now there's ways around that. Now there are lots of private and groups that are individually testing and have their seals of approval.
[27:32.800 --> 27:54.800]  And that's who we have to count on. You can't count on government. Not a government that's busy doing stakeouts to see if Amish are selling whole milk, doing stakeouts to see if farmers markets are selling organic food that are SWAT team rating organic farmer co-ops for not having a $10 certificate.
[27:54.800 --> 28:12.800]  Everything is about throwing the book at the American people, throwing the book at the grassroots economy, ensuring that the grassroots main street economy falls in on itself so they can bottom out the dollar and destroy every other major currency of the world to bring in a World ID card.
[28:12.800 --> 28:25.800]  And we already have a World ID card under treaty in 2000. We had a National ID card in 93. They're just now getting around to telling you that you have a National ID card, a real ID act. But we have the executive orders I covered in my film America Destroyed by Design.
[28:25.800 --> 28:43.800]  And so what they're doing is moving in a system to implode the world's currencies and down the road they're going to devalue the dollar and every other currency even more. And then finally, when there's not enough physical money circulating in the economy, the banks have cut off real
[28:43.800 --> 29:02.800]  liquidity to Main Street. The real economy has come to a standstill. The blood has stopped flowing. The world economy is a zombie right now. The major ship companies can't even get the credit or the insurance certification from the major retailers that are planning to buy the goods when they get here.
[29:02.800 --> 29:24.800]  So the majority, the AP reported two weeks ago, 90 plus percent of the ships are staying in port. That's why there's so many shortages of different items. And then after the economy implodes, and after there's not enough physical money to even pay debts in this debt economy, they will bring in the World ID, the world currency.
[29:24.800 --> 29:39.800]  We'll be right back with Kurt and M.O. and I know we have loaded phones. We'll get to all of you. The holidays are right around the corner. The crowds, the countless hours in traffic, finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.

[31:14.800 --> 31:42.800]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank. We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America. We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident which will force
[31:42.800 --> 31:54.800]  unpopular decisions. Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted on our Christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available isn't a government bread line.
[31:54.800 --> 32:03.800]  When the president is faced with the expected national security incident, the in-place patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[32:03.800 --> 32:13.800]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food. This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[32:13.800 --> 32:28.800]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself, food for these unknown times. Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633.
[32:28.800 --> 32:39.800]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[33:43.800 --> 33:50.800]  All right, we're going to have open phones for the balance of the broadcast after Kurt Nemo leaves us. I'll keep you for one segment, maybe part of the next.
[33:50.800 --> 34:02.800]  Then we're going to get to Eric, David Jack, George, Sam, Chad, Chris, many others that are patiently holding all across the country and the world.
[34:02.800 --> 34:10.800]  You know, just to flesh out and finish up my point, our children don't need a bunch of toys and a bunch of commercial garbage.
[34:10.800 --> 34:17.800]  I'm not saying you shouldn't get them. I'm not saying Christmas isn't fun. I'm saying the spirit of liberty and freedom is what is valuable.
[34:17.800 --> 34:30.800]  And out of that comes material possessions. Out of that comes success. You know, there are hundreds of countries in the world that have greater natural resources or as great per capita as the United States.
[34:30.800 --> 34:36.800]  But 90-plus percent of the public are abject slaves in places like Mexico or North Korea.
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.800]  Why is that? Because they never had liberty. They never had a system that didn't put up with corruption.
[34:41.800 --> 34:44.800]  They never had a system where they were allowed to live their lives.
[34:44.800 --> 34:52.800]  And what has happened to the United States and the Western world for that matter is that the people have become disengaged from society.
[34:52.800 --> 35:02.800]  So international corporations with their own armies, their own mercenaries, their own intelligence agencies, their huge lobbying arms have come in and taken over the government
[35:02.800 --> 35:09.800]  and are lobbying for tyranny here in the United States. I mean, they're openly announcing all over the news now 20,000 combat troops.
[35:09.800 --> 35:12.800]  It was 3,000 a couple of months ago to be on the streets of America.
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.800]  Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense, came out yesterday and said, we need more foreigners in the military.
[35:18.800 --> 35:33.800]  Then they spun the story and the Associated Press about, oh, well, this is being done so that we'll have more linguists and more Arabic speakers and more Mandarin speakers.
[35:33.800 --> 35:36.800]  They've always done that. This is a cover story.
[35:36.800 --> 35:43.800]  If you Google Foreign Tribes in America, hundreds of mainstream articles about, what, 20% of the armies illegally and they legalized?
[35:43.800 --> 35:49.800]  The biggest army recruiting centers in the world is in Mexico City and Manila, Philippines.
[35:49.800 --> 35:51.800]  No, combat foreign troops.
[35:51.800 --> 36:01.800]  So not only are we going to have troops on the streets of America for civil insurrection, for civil unrest, as the Army times and the Army admits they're doing,
[36:01.800 --> 36:08.800]  total tyranny, 100 degrees from freedom, that abolishes the governors under martial law, but says that in there.
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.800]  What Gates put out in the Washington Post last week, what we've been telling you about for years.
[36:13.800 --> 36:23.800]  But it's going to be foreign troops making up large contingents of that, not some outside foreign military, but foreign troops in our military.
[36:23.800 --> 36:25.800]  And they're hiring felons.
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.800]  Google military hiring felons and you'll see hundreds of mainstream articles.
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.800]  Police departments are hiring illegal aliens to be police.
[36:35.800 --> 36:42.800]  You can't make this stuff up. So you want to give your children something, give them liberty and freedom.
[36:42.800 --> 36:46.800]  Give them a future to not live in a controlled nightmare police state.
[36:46.800 --> 36:49.800]  Now I want to go to Kurt Nemo here in a moment.
[36:49.800 --> 36:56.800]  For those that don't know, the Rand Corporation, it was reported mainstream news two months ago.
[36:56.800 --> 37:04.800]  We wrote stories about it at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com said, we need a huge theater war bigger than Iraq.
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.800]  Bigger than Afghanistan, bigger than Serbia to, quote, get the economy going.
[37:09.800 --> 37:14.800]  What they mean by that is to get the people to go along with what they're doing, to get us to stand down and rally around the flag.
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.800]  As these international groups take us to war for empire.
[37:18.800 --> 37:20.800]  That's what empires do when they're in trouble.
[37:20.800 --> 37:25.800]  Napoleon or Hitler or the Soviets, they always start wars.
[37:25.800 --> 37:28.800]  Because that silence is opposition at home.
[37:28.800 --> 37:36.800]  And they are openly proposing trying to start a war between Pakistan and India, two nuclear powers.
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.800]  And, you know, this happened a few weeks ago.
[37:40.800 --> 37:43.800]  We withheld judgment, looked at all the evidence.
[37:43.800 --> 37:55.800]  And now the Indian and Pakistani papers for the last week are reporting that members of the army intelligence were caught leading and commanding other terror attacks in India
[37:55.800 --> 38:01.800]  and involved in this one and the five anti-terror chiefs out of thousands of anti-terror forces that were in Mumbai.
[38:01.800 --> 38:10.800]  They were the only guys that got killed, chief among them, the head of Indian anti-terrorism, who had been in the papers two days before saying,
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.800]  Western intelligence is controlling Muslim terrorists that they're funding.
[38:14.800 --> 38:15.800]  This is not Pakistan.
[38:15.800 --> 38:19.800]  And this is a false flag government staged event.
[38:19.800 --> 38:22.800]  He was shot three times in the chest within minutes of the attack starting.
[38:22.800 --> 38:30.800]  So you got the army killing the separate people there who are within the Indian government who are exposing this.
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.800]  People always say, well, this stuff was government.
[38:32.800 --> 38:34.800]  We'd find out it had come out.
[38:34.800 --> 38:35.800]  It is coming out.
[38:35.800 --> 38:38.800]  And folks, just go check out the story at infowars.com.
[38:38.800 --> 38:41.800]  Kurt's got links to all the mainstream stories that back all this up.
[38:41.800 --> 38:55.800]  And two Mondays ago, about eight days ago, it was in Reuters and Der Spiegel that the German intelligence was caught right when the Muslims that the West brought into attack with Serbs.
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.800]  Well, now they want NACO out there in Kosovo, Southern Serbia.
[38:59.800 --> 39:01.800]  And so, and the Serbs want them out.
[39:01.800 --> 39:04.800]  And it was unpopular for the Germans and NATO to still be there.
[39:04.800 --> 39:14.800]  So the German secret police were caught staging terror attacks and separate NATO troops caught them and they admitted to it.
[39:14.800 --> 39:29.800]  Just like SAS, Special Air Services assigned to MI6 were caught in 2005 in Iraq, in Basra, staging terror attacks dressed up with fake beards on, attacking our troops.
[39:29.800 --> 39:30.800]  Now that was confirmed.
[39:30.800 --> 39:33.800]  That was times of London.
[39:33.800 --> 39:36.800]  See, people wonder why I talk about government-sponsored terror.
[39:36.800 --> 39:38.800]  Aren't I supposed to when it's confirmed?
[39:38.800 --> 39:40.800]  I mean, you know, admitted.
[39:40.800 --> 39:42.800]  Let's bring up Kurt Nemo for this segment and the next.
[39:42.800 --> 39:45.800]  And I promise nothing but your phone calls after that.
[39:45.800 --> 39:49.800]  So be patient because I want to talk to all of you from San Diego, Las Vegas, Germany, Texas.
[39:49.800 --> 39:52.800]  In fact, we'll go to Germany first when we do go to calls.
[39:52.800 --> 39:54.800]  Kurt Nemo is a writer for infowars.com.
[39:54.800 --> 39:58.800]  He's written for major newspapers and produced for major TV programs across the country.
[39:58.800 --> 40:01.800]  I hired Kurt a couple years ago to do a great job at infowars.com.
[40:01.800 --> 40:03.800]  He runs infowars.com for us.
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.800]  And he did a great report, kind of a roundup of this news.
[40:07.800 --> 40:09.800]  Arrest provides more evidence.
[40:09.800 --> 40:12.800]  India, Israel, the United States behind Mumbai attacks.
[40:12.800 --> 40:15.800]  And then he goes through that, the AP reporting on it as well.
[40:15.800 --> 40:20.800]  Kurt, a basic boil down of the evidence.
[40:20.800 --> 40:25.800]  Well, hey, Alex, what happened on Saturday is the Indian officials arrested a guy.
[40:25.800 --> 40:27.800]  His name is Mukhtar Ahmed.
[40:27.800 --> 40:38.800]  And he's accused of providing SIM cell phone cards to the terrorist, the L.E.T. terrorist.
[40:38.800 --> 40:43.800]  He was arrested and the Associated Press covered this.
[40:43.800 --> 40:48.800]  It turns out he works for the police in Kashmir.
[40:48.800 --> 40:51.800]  And he's a current insurgency operative.
[40:51.800 --> 40:55.800]  And so it begs the question, you know, is the ISA responsible for this?
[40:55.800 --> 40:57.800]  Or is Indian intelligence?
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.800]  Well, I mean, the head of all Indian anti-terror forces, and this is in our stories,
[41:02.800 --> 41:08.800]  and Maidstream Indian Babers reporting, he was caught by the head of Indian intelligence
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.800]  running the staged attack on the train that killed 63 people.
[41:13.800 --> 41:18.800]  And so the head of the Indian anti-terror force had been reporting,
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.800]  hey, this is a false flag, and then he gets killed the day of the event.
[41:23.800 --> 41:26.800]  And of all of his forces, he's the one that gets killed and his four deputies.
[41:26.800 --> 41:29.800]  They all die, none of the junior people die,
[41:29.800 --> 41:35.800]  and then the Indian police stand down and won't shoot at the people running around on LSD.
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.800]  Right, that was the attack that was in Melgon, I guess it was, in western state in India.
[41:41.800 --> 41:48.800]  Yeah, it's no coincidence this guy, what's his name?
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.800]  His name is Karkai, was killed when he entered the hotel.
[41:53.800 --> 41:55.800]  He was one of the first people to die in there.
[41:55.800 --> 41:57.800]  Yeah, obviously they're covering up the tracks,
[41:57.800 --> 42:00.800]  and they're trying to get rid of the people who know what's actually going on.
[42:00.800 --> 42:02.800]  This is a false flag terror attack.
[42:02.800 --> 42:04.800]  I mean, you take a look at it.
[42:04.800 --> 42:13.800]  I mean, the Indian press admits that the raw, the Indian version of the CIA
[42:13.800 --> 42:20.800]  basically has a relationship with the CIA and Mossad that's common knowledge in India.
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.800]  Well, what Pakistan is saying is, look, we want peace.
[42:24.800 --> 42:29.800]  We've been wanting to work with India and the very same Muslim terror groups
[42:29.800 --> 42:32.800]  that the US founded in the 70s, and that's a fact,
[42:32.800 --> 42:35.800]  what is known as al-Qaeda and its splinter groups,
[42:35.800 --> 42:39.800]  they've been staging attacks against the Pakistani government the last six, eight months,
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.800]  building, blowing up hotels they're in, doing this,
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.800]  and Pakistani intelligence says, look, we've been a puppet of the West,
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.800]  we're trying to kick them out, elements of our ISI, Pakistani intelligence,
[42:52.800 --> 42:56.800]  they are working for the West to do this as a pretext to get a war started
[42:56.800 --> 42:58.800]  between Pakistan and India.
[42:58.800 --> 43:01.800]  And we come back, Kurt, let's talk about more of the evidence of this being an inside job,
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.800]  not just the motive, but all the evidence coming in,
[43:04.800 --> 43:09.800]  these guys all on cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD, the supposed attackers,
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.800]  and then they catch only one guy and he's the guy that we see the images of on the news.
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.800]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, total false flag, but why are they doing it?
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.800]  What is a false flag? We'll talk to Kurt Nemo when we get back.
[43:21.800 --> 43:35.800]  He's over at infowars.com. Check out his story.

[46:46.800 --> 47:12.800]  This is Keelorex.
[47:12.800 --> 47:38.800]  This is Keelorex.
[47:38.800 --> 47:45.800]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide,
[47:45.800 --> 47:53.800]  this is The Alex Jones Show.
[47:53.800 --> 47:57.800]  World War I started through proxy states under World War II.
[47:57.800 --> 48:04.800]  The Rand Corporation, the Big New Brazinski, and others have said they want a war on the scale of World War III,
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.800]  and he wrote in the Grand Chess Board in 97 and in public white papers in the last year,
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.800]  that they want to start the war in Pakistan and India.
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.800]  That's why the West has given nukes, thermal nuclear weapons to both sides,
[48:17.800 --> 48:25.800]  with 3,000-kilometer range delivery systems.
[48:25.800 --> 48:28.800]  And right when they're about to sign a peace deal, here come the terrorists.
[48:28.800 --> 48:32.800]  The police stand down for three days and hundreds dead.
[48:32.800 --> 48:39.800]  And then the only people getting killed are the high-level police commanders who had publicly been in the newspaper
[48:39.800 --> 48:44.800]  saying the government is staging this.
[48:44.800 --> 48:48.800]  That is the only place that we saw this happening.
[48:48.800 --> 48:49.800]  Kind of like that.
[48:49.800 --> 48:53.800]  It was like Johnny Carson.
[48:53.800 --> 48:55.800]  All right, you know, I'm not laughing about that.
[48:55.800 --> 49:01.800]  The point is, is that this is not Iran, this is not Iraq, this is not Afghanistan,
[49:01.800 --> 49:03.800]  this is not attacking Serbia.
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.800]  This is potentially starting World War III.
[49:07.800 --> 49:10.800]  China has sided with Pakistan.
[49:10.800 --> 49:11.800]  Russia doesn't know who to side with.
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.800]  They usually side with India.
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.800]  The United States has got intelligence operatives all over India.
[49:16.800 --> 49:19.800]  And right on time, Joe Biden says there'll be this big crisis.
[49:19.800 --> 49:21.800]  It's going to be in Pakistan.
[49:21.800 --> 49:24.800]  And voila, look what starts happening.
[49:24.800 --> 49:26.800]  Kurt Nemo, other thoughts on this?
[49:26.800 --> 49:30.800]  Well, Alex, I just wanted to say that what's really interesting is, in this news article,
[49:30.800 --> 49:35.800]  it was all spelled out right there that this counter-insurgency group run out of the police
[49:35.800 --> 49:44.800]  department in Kashmir, this guy, this operative, was caught red-handed facilitating a terror
[49:44.800 --> 49:45.800]  attack.
[49:45.800 --> 49:49.800]  And in the next paragraph, the Associated Press goes on to say that, well, you know,
[49:49.800 --> 49:52.800]  it was just India's having problems with its intelligence.
[49:52.800 --> 49:54.800]  It was an intelligence failure.
[49:54.800 --> 49:55.800]  It was a screw-up.
[49:55.800 --> 50:00.800]  So in the very next paragraph, they made excuses for this obvious fact that Indian intelligence
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.800]  through their police department in Kashmir is running false-like terror attacks.
[50:04.800 --> 50:10.800]  But then you have the train bombing with the Army Intelligence Anti-Terror Captain running
[50:10.800 --> 50:11.800]  the organization.
[50:11.800 --> 50:16.800]  You have the Southern Poverty Law Center caught in FBI memos literally running the top people
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.800]  at Elohim City, the white supremacist compound with the bombing of Oklahoma City.
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.800]  FBI documents have now come out.
[50:23.800 --> 50:25.800]  This is mainstream news.
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.800]  I had the lawyer who sued over this and got it all out that the FBI was basically running
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.800]  the Oklahoma City bombing, and McVeigh thought that he was working for him just like Lee Harvey
[50:34.800 --> 50:35.800]  Oswald.
[50:35.800 --> 50:43.800]  And remember, in 1993, New York Times, CBS News reported, Ahmad Salam, the CIA and FBI
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.800]  hire this Egyptian intelligence agent.
[50:48.800 --> 50:49.800]  They bring him over.
[50:49.800 --> 50:52.800]  First, they're going to build a dummy bomb, and it's real Muslim terrorist.
[50:52.800 --> 50:54.800]  But the point is, he's the leader of the group.
[50:54.800 --> 50:59.800]  He goes out and finds these idiots, creates the bomb with real explosives, gives them
[50:59.800 --> 51:02.800]  the detonator, and then he thinks that they're going to bust them.
[51:02.800 --> 51:06.800]  He goes to the FBI, and they say, no, we're letting the bombing go forward in two days.
[51:06.800 --> 51:07.800]  He flips out.
[51:07.800 --> 51:09.800]  This is all in the mainstream news.
[51:09.800 --> 51:14.800]  Goes and records more than 12 hours of the FBI, him saying, let's stop the bombing.
[51:14.800 --> 51:16.800]  We weren't supposed to let this really happen.
[51:16.800 --> 51:17.800]  This is a sting.
[51:17.800 --> 51:19.800]  And they said, no, we're letting it happen.
[51:19.800 --> 51:21.800]  We're letting it go forward.
[51:21.800 --> 51:25.800]  And then he knew they were setting him up, so he recorded them.
[51:25.800 --> 51:28.800]  And then they had to pay him a million three to leave the country.
[51:28.800 --> 51:30.800]  And, of course, they bombed the World Trade Center.
[51:30.800 --> 51:36.800]  So we have these false flags where the government finds the crazies, brings them in, funds them,
[51:36.800 --> 51:38.800]  allows them to take action.
[51:38.800 --> 51:41.800]  You have real terrorist attacks that do happen occasionally.
[51:41.800 --> 51:46.800]  Then you have the totally staged events like 9-11, where we know the supposed hijackers
[51:46.800 --> 51:50.800]  were U.S. government agents training at U.S. military bases, and that's on record.
[51:50.800 --> 51:53.800]  But the media won't cover it after the fact.
[51:53.800 --> 51:55.800]  So, Kurt, it's just incredible.
[51:55.800 --> 52:01.800]  Well, the media will report parts of it, but it takes people with a sense of dedication
[52:01.800 --> 52:07.800]  to put this stuff together and put the puzzle pieces together and come up with the whole picture.
[52:07.800 --> 52:10.800]  The media, most people read the newspapers, and they read the headlines, and they go on
[52:10.800 --> 52:13.800]  the Fox News, some bites, and they don't put the whole picture together.
[52:13.800 --> 52:14.800]  Exactly.
[52:14.800 --> 52:17.800]  But what I'm saying is people always say, well, this stuff would come out.
[52:17.800 --> 52:21.800]  It would come out if the feds cooked the bomb and trained the driver and gave them the detonators
[52:21.800 --> 52:23.800]  in 93 for the World Trade Center.
[52:23.800 --> 52:26.800]  It would come out if German intelligence was staging terror attacks in Serbia.
[52:26.800 --> 52:27.800]  It would come out.
[52:27.800 --> 52:28.800]  It does.
[52:28.800 --> 52:33.800]  They caught the British in Basra dressed up like Arabs running around shooting people.
[52:33.800 --> 52:34.800]  Right.
[52:34.800 --> 52:36.800]  Well, Kurt, this is so bold.
[52:36.800 --> 52:41.800]  The larger issue is they're clearly going to stage some more events between Pakistan and India.
[52:41.800 --> 52:46.800]  India is now reporting they're considering massive attacks on Pakistan itself.
[52:46.800 --> 52:48.800]  I mean, we could be in World War III here.
[52:48.800 --> 52:49.800]  Definitely.
[52:49.800 --> 52:52.800]  Well, precisely, as you said earlier, that's exactly what they want to do.
[52:52.800 --> 52:57.800]  They want to create a crisis in South Asia and in Central Asia, and they want to have
[52:57.800 --> 53:03.800]  World War III, and that's the only way they can bring their control grid into being is
[53:03.800 --> 53:11.800]  to demand that the people of the West buckle under the severe crisis of a third World War.
[53:11.800 --> 53:14.800]  Well, this will make everybody rally around Obama, too.
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.800]  Hey, you know, we've got an international crisis going.
[53:16.800 --> 53:21.800]  Never mind the fact that AP reports that seven weeks after the bank or takeover, known as
[53:21.800 --> 53:25.800]  the bailout, 8.4 trillion, and most of it's going offshore.
[53:25.800 --> 53:27.800]  None of it's going for the mortgages.
[53:27.800 --> 53:28.800]  Yeah.
[53:28.800 --> 53:31.800]  But that's okay.
[53:31.800 --> 53:35.800]  If you're patriotic, Kurt, you'll just give up all your liberties and freedoms and let
[53:35.800 --> 53:38.800]  offshore banks take all our money and that we have to pay back in taxes.
[53:38.800 --> 53:42.800]  Well, that's precisely what this is, the cover for all those operations that the bankers
[53:42.800 --> 53:43.800]  are doing.
[53:43.800 --> 53:44.800]  Exactly.
[53:44.800 --> 53:45.800]  That's what Rand Corporation says.
[53:45.800 --> 53:47.800]  It is a political diversion.
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.800]  The big government funded think tank.
[53:49.800 --> 53:52.800]  It's a private think tank that sets a lot of their policy.
[53:52.800 --> 53:58.800]  It was the big New Brzezinski, and they're saying we need a giant war, and then wallah
[53:58.800 --> 54:00.800]  right where they say they need it.
[54:00.800 --> 54:01.800]  What happens, Kurt?
[54:01.800 --> 54:02.800]  Well, exactly.
[54:02.800 --> 54:05.800]  I mean, look what happened in 2003 when Bush invaded Iraq.
[54:05.800 --> 54:10.800]  You know, the people mostly and generally, you know, 90-some percent of them, you know,
[54:10.800 --> 54:12.800]  agreed with Bush, you know?
[54:12.800 --> 54:17.800]  I mean, even though at the time we knew that it was bogus, nonetheless, and this will be
[54:17.800 --> 54:22.800]  consistent, the magnitude of this attack or this coming Third World War, if we call it
[54:22.800 --> 54:28.800]  that, it will be even worse than the Iraq invasion, and more demands will be placed on us to buckle
[54:28.800 --> 54:29.800]  under.
[54:29.800 --> 54:33.800]  Well, there was only one difference between the Neocon camp that took over the Republican
[54:33.800 --> 54:35.800]  party, the former Trotskyites.
[54:35.800 --> 54:36.800]  I'm not just saying that.
[54:36.800 --> 54:39.800]  If you didn't know that Neocons were Trotskyites, Google it.
[54:39.800 --> 54:45.800]  They had themselves, and the old lines of Big Nebrezinski, even James Baker, you know,
[54:45.800 --> 54:54.800]  type arm, and that was, no, we want the invasions and the wars to be a little more east in Central
[54:54.800 --> 54:55.800]  Asia.
[54:55.800 --> 54:56.800]  Right.
[54:56.800 --> 55:01.800]  And so the policy is now shifting away from Iran, though Israel's been talking about it,
[55:01.800 --> 55:03.800]  going it alone and attacking.
[55:03.800 --> 55:08.800]  Well, the basic premise is the same, and that's what Brezhinsky said.
[55:08.800 --> 55:13.800]  He said, they want to break these places up, balkanize them, so I think his quote was
[55:13.800 --> 55:20.800]  so that the vassals don't get up and try to organize and do anything.
[55:20.800 --> 55:22.800]  So basically that's what they're doing.
[55:22.800 --> 55:27.800]  They're just trying to balkanize and break up and create strife, order through chaos,
[55:27.800 --> 55:31.800]  and the old British maximum of conquer and divide.
[55:31.800 --> 55:35.800]  It's basically the same thing in a new guys.
[55:35.800 --> 55:36.800]  Absolutely.
[55:36.800 --> 55:39.800]  Maybe, you know, we know so much, we forget folks don't.
[55:39.800 --> 55:43.800]  Maybe we should do an article sometime this week tying it back to that Rand Corporation
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.800]  document and the Rand Corporation report about needing World War III and spell this out
[55:49.800 --> 55:52.800]  for people because this is Obama's international crisis.
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.800]  This is the beginning of it, and you've got all these Kulei drinking Democrats that think
[55:56.800 --> 55:59.800]  Valhalla has arrived, no more wars.
[55:59.800 --> 56:05.800]  Meanwhile, he's saying, no, no, no, austerity, cutting your paycheck, depression, wars.
[56:05.800 --> 56:06.800]  You're not going to like what I do.
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.800]  By the way, we're going to ban your fireplaces and your space heaters.
[56:10.800 --> 56:12.800]  The New York Times basically said the same thing.
[56:12.800 --> 56:17.800]  We need a war to rally the people and to keep them in place, and that's, you know, the Rand
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.800]  reports basically the same, but like you said, they're shifting it a little bit to the east
[56:21.800 --> 56:22.800]  as opposed to the Middle East.
[56:22.800 --> 56:24.800]  It's going to be in Asia.
[56:24.800 --> 56:25.800]  Kurt Nemo, I appreciate you calling.
[56:25.800 --> 56:27.800]  Good to hear from you, and thanks for coming on the show.
[56:27.800 --> 56:30.800]  We'll watch infowars.com for your reports.
[56:30.800 --> 56:31.800]  Okay, Alex, bye.
[56:31.800 --> 56:36.800]  I'm going to jam in a call here from Germany because he's been holding the longest.
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.800]  We're going to come back, and in rapid succession, go to all of your calls in the next hour, so
[56:40.800 --> 56:41.800]  stay with us.
[56:41.800 --> 56:43.800]  Sam, in Germany, go ahead.
[56:43.800 --> 56:49.800]  Hey, Alex, I just want to call up and ask maybe, basically, I wanted some tips on staying
[56:49.800 --> 56:52.800]  motivated, because I get pretty depressed about this whole thing.
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.800]  And also, I'd like you to explain how gun confiscation would fail in America.
[56:58.800 --> 57:00.800]  Well, first off, we don't have a choice.
[57:00.800 --> 57:03.800]  I mean, things are bleak, things are bad, but there's also a lot of good things in the
[57:03.800 --> 57:04.800]  world.
[57:04.800 --> 57:07.800]  The people are waking up to tyranny all over the world.
[57:07.800 --> 57:10.800]  Government-sponsored terror, banker looting.
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.800]  All of this is being exposed, and so they're going to have a tough time getting away with
[57:15.800 --> 57:16.800]  all of this.
[57:16.800 --> 57:19.800]  But the reason you should be positive is you've only got one life to live.
[57:19.800 --> 57:24.800]  You're a good person, so we need you to be positive to fight the bad people in the world,
[57:24.800 --> 57:26.800]  and being negative is only going to make things worse.
[57:26.800 --> 57:30.800]  True, well, that's good to hear.
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.800]  I think I'm actually going to come back to the US for a little while, kind of see some action
[57:34.800 --> 57:35.800]  on the ground.
[57:35.800 --> 57:37.800]  Hey, I saw it in Der Spiegel and Reuters.
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.800]  Did you see it living in Germany last week when the Germans got caught staging terror attacks?
[57:42.800 --> 57:45.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Der Spiegel, yeah.
[57:45.800 --> 57:47.800]  It's a worldwide deal.
[57:47.800 --> 57:48.800]  It's just part of the Newell Order.
[57:48.800 --> 57:51.800]  I mean, what did the Germans say when it was just in the newspaper that the government is
[57:51.800 --> 57:54.800]  staging terror attacks against itself?
[57:54.800 --> 57:59.800]  You know, one group of police, of NATO police, caught German intelligence attacking their
[57:59.800 --> 58:00.800]  own buildings.
[58:00.800 --> 58:02.800]  So what's going to happen?
[58:02.800 --> 58:06.800]  Well, I think it really depends which part of Germany you're in, but I think people here,
[58:06.800 --> 58:11.800]  it doesn't shock them, but they kind of understand that you have corrupt government because they
[58:11.800 --> 58:14.800]  got so screwed during World War II, you might say.
[58:14.800 --> 58:15.800]  You know, it was so bad here.
[58:15.800 --> 58:19.800]  So it's not that shocking to them, but I think people are just kind of in a daze here.

[1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:41.800]  Officials in Pakistan say militants blasted their way into two transport terminals today.

[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.800]  This is Lieutenant Colonel Rummy Nelson-Green.
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:49.800]  That's hard.
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:54.800]  These attacks have been notoriously insignificant and have not created a great impact on our operations.
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:01.800]  And President-elect Barack Obama is holding a news conference later today to formally announce his choice to head the Department of Veteran Affairs.

[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:42.800]  It's a well-known fact that there are a million and one uses for duct tape from temporary repairs like patching ripped up holsteric to the unexpected mending of a wedding dress on a big day.
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:46.800]  The duct tape guys, Jim Berg and Tim Nyberg, have seen it all.
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:50.800]  You know, the only thing people love more than duct tape is telling their duct tape stories.
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:54.800]  It seems as though everyone can think of an instance when the sticky stuff came to the rescue.
[1:01:54.800 --> 1:02:10.800]  As the winner of the duct brand duct tape saves the day contest, Sergeant Joshua Roach, a soldier from Boise, Idaho, took home the $5,000 grand prize in the whole year supply of duct brand duct tape for his unique use of duct tape to repair a truck in a trailer while serving in Iraq.
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:24.800]  The dynamic duo reports seeing duct tape, in traditional gray or 19 colors, used for everything from repairing things like broken luggage, fallen hemlines, and ripped camping tents to retrieving lost wedding bands and marking boxes and bags for easy identification.

[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:15.800]  We'll look at his agenda.
[1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:17.800]  He claims he's going to rebuild the infrastructure.
[1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:19.800]  That means turn all your roads into toll roads.
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:21.800]  He's going to, quote, expand the internet.
[1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:23.800]  That means go to internet too and restrict free speech.
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:25.800]  I have it all right here in front of me.
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:27.800]  And a lot more.
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:34.800]  And domestic one million person spy army, foreign troops in our military and mainline army on the streets of the United States.
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:40.800]  But finishing up very quickly with Sam in Germany, then to Eric and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:48.800]  Sam, you're making a point about it's in major German newspapers that the German government stages terror attacks and just got caught attacking their own government buildings.
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:52.800]  This time in NATO facilities in Kosovo.
[1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:55.800]  And then you had the one other comment on that.
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:58.800]  And then you were asking me about the second amendment.
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:08.800]  Yeah, well, I just wanted to say that basically from what I've, the people I've talked to here in Germany that knew about the Spiegel article or the Spiegel article was that I mean, of course they were shocked.
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:10.800]  But I think at the same time they weren't so shocked.
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:17.800]  I think people in Europe understand that governments are corrupt because of the corruption they've had in governments here, you know, that are on the books.
[1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:22.800]  I think people here are kind of like it in some ways, like in the US, they're kind of asleep at the wheel.
[1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:24.800]  They're just a lot more aware of their surroundings.
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:25.800]  I don't know.
[1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:27.800]  It wasn't, it was nothing dramatic.
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:35.800]  I guess my question, I mean, my question on the second it was, I've been talking to some people, how, okay, if they try to do good confiscation in America.
[1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:36.800]  Okay.
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:37.800]  How could that fail?
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:38.800]  How will it fail?
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:42.800]  Because a lot of people have talked to you think that they can totally get it done.
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:46.800]  Listen, I appreciate your call me briefly answer that and go to other calls.
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  It's a process of destroying the Second Amendment, suing the manufacturers, banning them in cities like Chicago and New York.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.800]  You know, just 15, 20 years ago all over the country, people drove around with rifles in their gun racks.
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:00.800]  Now the cops pull you over.
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:03.800]  Doesn't matter if the rifle's legal, doesn't matter if you're allowed to have it.
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:08.800]  Most of the TV shows are based in New York and places that have gun controls.
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:11.800]  So the dramas show cops arresting you for owning a gun.
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:18.800]  The general public gets their news and information from TV so they think because NYPD blew, you get arrested for having a gun.
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.800]  That happens in Austin, Texas.
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:24.800]  Listen, it's a demonization of the Second Amendment.
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:25.800]  This is about 10 years ago.
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  I've told the story many times.
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:27.800]  I'll tell it briefly.
[1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  I had a carpet cleaner in my house and I have a radio studio in my house as well and up and I didn't have children then.
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.800]  So I had a shotgun in a rack up on the wall.
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:42.800]  And the carpet cleaner said, I need to talk to you.
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:43.800]  And he said, I can't clean this room.
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:44.800]  You've got a gun in there.
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:46.800]  And I said, where are you from?
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:49.800]  And it was someplace up north, not bashing folks up north.
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:50.800]  A lot of them are prostitutes.
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:53.800]  He just had grown up in some urban center and didn't know that guns were legal.
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:55.800]  I said, listen, we're in Texas.
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:56.800]  I'm in my house.
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:09:59.800]  I can take that shotgun and walk down the street if I wanted to.
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  It's my Second Amendment.
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:02.800]  And he said, oh no.
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:03.800]  He goes, I'm leaving.
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:07.800]  Then I had a bad feeling a few hours later and called, got the manager on the phone.
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:10.800]  He said, Mr. Jones, he's a new employee.
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:12.800]  Don't understand this.
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:13.800]  Don't worry.
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:17.800]  He did come and say he wanted to call the police, but we didn't call the police on you.
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:20.800]  And needless to say, I'd ever use that carpet cleaner again.
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:23.800]  Well, I heard a promo for one of the local shows here.
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:26.800]  Last hour, local listeners would have heard it on 590.
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.800]  Folks on the syndicated stations wouldn't have.
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:30.800]  Can you pull that promo up?
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:32.800]  It's the morning show promo.
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.800]  It's where Ed and Sergeant Sam are arguing with each other.
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:41.800]  And they're debating.
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:43.800]  And this happens all the time.
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:47.800]  About 12 years ago, I lived in wood hollow apartments and I was walking out of the car
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.800]  to go deer hunting at our ranch in East Texas.
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:53.800]  My Mustang was parked in my space right by my apartment.
[1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:54.800]  I walked out.
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:56.800]  I popped the back and old lady's walking her dog.
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.800]  She sees me sticking her rifle in a box of 243 shells in the back.
[1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:01.800]  And she goes, and runs off.
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:04.800]  I'd even forgotten about this until I heard that promo earlier.
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:06.800]  And this was 12 years ago.
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.800]  This was before Columbine and all that.
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.800]  And I went to the store, came back, and then a neighbor told me, yeah,
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:14.800]  the police pulled up and were checking and asking about a gun.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  So the point is, you can't even put a gun in your car now
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.800]  because the public thinks guns are illegal.
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:22.800]  Now, gun owners know it's not.
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:26.800]  The police know it's not illegal, but they still have to respond to a call.
[1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:31.800]  And so the enslaved public has been trained to feel good and safe
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:34.800]  when they see cops and SWAT teams and guns.
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:38.800]  But when a fellow slave has a gun, they get very upset.
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.800]  And there was a debate about this, I guess, last week on their morning show here.
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:46.800]  Do you call the cops when you see somebody with a gun in downtown Austin?
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:47.800]  Austin's. Morning news.
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:48.800]  No, I don't.
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:49.800]  Why don't you?
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:50.800]  Oh, why should I?
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:51.800]  Because they're 9 out of 10.
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:53.800]  They're probably breaking the law if they're a young punk with a gun.
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:54.800]  No, man, wake up, man.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:55.800]  No, you wake up.
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:57.800]  Use your brain, cowboy.
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:11:58.800]  Hey, partner.
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  Hey, partner, you're not my partner.
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:02.800]  Come on.
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:04.800]  We take mornings from 530 to 10.
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:05.800]  Here we go.
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:08.800]  You're a liberal, if you like this, you're due to Dibrel.
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:09.800]  Keep it coming.
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:10.800]  We got 50 more minutes for you.
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:11.800]  Rednecks to keep calling.
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.800]  Rednecks with small units.
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:14.800]  Just keep on calling.
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:15.800]  You need a big one.
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:16.800]  On news radio.
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:17.800]  All right.
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:18.800]  K.L.B.J.
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:19.800]  All right.
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:21.800]  So, see, you have a small member.
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:24.800]  You are evil if you own a gun.
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:25.800]  Okay.
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:27.800]  I mean, that's what that comes down to.
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:33.560]  I think the answer is Vermont style concealed carry, where it's just a second amendment.
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:39.800]  You can have open carry, concealed carry, train all these anti-gun, gilded people, castrated
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:42.960]  people, that it's our country, it's our second amendment.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.660]  That's what counts as our liberties.
[1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.360]  That's what our veterans fought and died for.
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:49.160]  Let's get another call before we go to break and I promise I'm going to get to everybody.
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:51.160]  Eric and San Diego, thanks for holding.
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  You are on the air.
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.160]  Welcome.
[1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:54.160]  Hey, Alex.
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:55.160]  It's great to be on again.
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:56.160]  Good to hear from you.
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:57.160]  What's up?
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:12:58.160]  Hey, Alex.
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:12:59.160]  I've got a couple of things.
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:07.840]  I was wondering if the story on Raw Story crossed your radar about Barry Cooper and cop
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:08.840]  busters.
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:09.840]  Do you see that?
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:10.840]  No.
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:11.840]  Tell me about it.
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:12.840]  Oh, it's excellent.
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:15.760]  What he did is, he's in Texas, he's a formal cop.
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:22.400]  He's put a bunch of people in jail, previously in his previous occupation as a cop, in jail
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:25.400]  for marijuana and stuff like that.
[1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:30.080]  What he did is, he rented a house in Texas, set up a couple of grow lights and grew some
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:32.280]  Christmas trees.
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:35.240]  Well, I did hear about this.
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:36.240]  Tell folks.
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  Yeah.
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:44.800]  Basically, the cops come in, they falsified a search warrant and barge into this house
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:48.240]  to find that it was bugged and a complete setup.
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:52.840]  Yeah, I did hear about that and I meant to tell my producer to set that up.
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:53.840]  What's the headline of that?
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:57.680]  We're going to write that down because there's this growing group, my friend Kevin Booth,
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:01.960]  who made the American Drug War film that's aired a bunch on Showtime and won a bunch
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:04.000]  of awards that I consulted on.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.440]  I forget the name of the growing national former narcotics officer group.
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:10.160]  It's like tens of thousands are in it.
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:11.160]  Oh, yeah.
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:12.160]  It's called Leap.
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:13.160]  Leap.
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:14.160]  Who were first?
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:15.160]  Yeah.
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:16.160]  Monforcement.
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:17.160]  Monforcement.
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:18.160]  Something.
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:19.160]  Against prohibition or something.
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:20.160]  Against prohibition.
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:21.160]  Exactly.
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:25.520]  And I've had some of their, yeah, let's have Leap on because again, just like prohibition
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:30.600]  for a decade with alcohol, crippled the alcohol, energized the gangs, criminality, corrupted
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:34.640]  the police, same thing with the drug war, but that's why they made drugs illegal.
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:38.880]  The big drug cartels lobbied to make drugs illegal in the 30s and that's actually come
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:43.600]  out in congressional testimony because they make bigger profits when it's illegal.
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:46.800]  And yeah, I mean, I've been here in Austin and seen the Travis County SWAT team in one
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:50.840]  case that we covered that ended up on the news where the woman had blood weeds growing
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:51.840]  in her backyard.
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:53.080]  I mean, everybody's got blood weeds.
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:56.720]  If you don't mow your yard, you know, if it's jungly out there, if it's an unkempt,
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:58.720]  you know, back 40 or whatever.
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:03.720]  And that's their excuse to raid everybody without warrants is this blood weed.
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:07.960]  And then I saw a couple of cases this weekend where they're now raiding people with tomato
[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:12.320]  plants and then they, even though there's tomatoes hanging off of it, in one case I
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:17.120]  saw, in fact, I meant to print it off and get it in the stack, but it's not here.
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:21.640]  They still took a sample of the tomato plant to see if the tomatoes were marijuana.
[1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:27.000]  I mean, again, this is a complete fraud and a complete joke and they catch police all
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.360]  the time now because citizens are putting hidden cameras in their houses.
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:34.440]  The case in Tennessee where they torture the guy for an hour to make him say he had drugs
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:37.120]  he didn't have and to make him sign the search warrant.
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:41.600]  I mean, that's my point is that what's more threatening marijuana or the corrupt police
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.800]  state that comes along with it?
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:44.800]  Absolutely.
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:45.800]  Hey, Alex.
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:53.040]  Alex, I've also got a somewhat related thing and it's your story with that video with the
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:54.040]  kid.
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.120]  I'm basically exposing the New World Order.
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:59.440]  Yeah, well his textbook says New World Order, World Governments Good.
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:01.240]  But then his teacher is telling him he's crazy.
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:04.440]  It doesn't exist even when the school textbook says it.
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:05.440]  I know.
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:10.040]  My kid's first year high school and either in social studies or history class, the teacher
[1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:13.840]  was just pumping the U.N. big time.
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:15.840]  I mean, just glorifying.
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:19.360]  Get them out of the government training camp or send your son in there with 100 copies
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:22.200]  of my films and use what they're doing against them.
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:23.200]  Good to hear from you.

[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.400]  Are your kids safe when they go out?

[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:47.240]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:52.640]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:55.680]  law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:32.120]  Hi, John Hümner from Mitus Resources.
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:35.040]  Are you tired of watching your hard earned assets dwindle away?
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:39.480]  Is government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of 20
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:40.480]  billion a week?
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:43.640]  Are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard earned money?
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:47.320]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:51.840]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:53.960]  How much are you willing to lose?
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:54.960]  Take action now.

[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:06.920]  For recent decades numerous economic systems have failed.
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:11.320]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:14.000]  the United States to be the next target.

[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  bad to me?
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.240]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.240]  will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:42.160]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:45.200]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist, heard on this network.

[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:13.000]  be just another sheeple in the corporate controlled flock.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:29.480]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.

[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:51.600]  Before the show ends, I'm going to get into Barack Obama's quote policy when he's playing
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:52.600]  due to the country.
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:54.120]  You're a little bit of a listener.
[1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:59.000]  No, I'm not saying I was for John McCain, you see, there's more candidates than just
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  the two.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:05.240]  We've gotten this problem because the establishment can give you both the choices and control both
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:10.840]  the choices who are both New World Order, and I know I keep repeating that, it's just
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:11.840]  so mindless.
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:15.560]  I'm not even against Barack Obama, the guy is a puppet, he will run nothing, it's the
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:23.400]  institutions behind him, it's the policies, get ready, he's going to bring you a depression
[1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:25.440]  because that's what the New World Order is bringing you.
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:29.160]  Jack in Las Vegas, you're on the air, Jack, welcome.
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:35.040]  It was good, it made my day on Friday when you went, Obama, I was pretty depressed in
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:36.040]  that.
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:50.960]  Obama, Obama will save me, hold on a second, I've got a group of Obama callers, they're
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:22:00.720]  having an Obama appreciation meeting, an Obama appreciation, a political meeting, just called
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:08.560]  in from Albuquerque, hold on, put them back on the line again, hold on, I've got a bunch
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:15.920]  of neocon followers, a mainline, right wing talk radio calling in, oh wait a minute, say
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:20.800]  you like Sean Hannity, you like people to take Oxy Cotton, the other talk show host?
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:22.800]  Wait, who is that there?
[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.800]  I'm sorry, go ahead and make a point, Jack.
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:29.600]  My name's Jack, by the way, but it's all good.
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:34.200]  It says Jake on here, Jack, but we'll call you Billy Bob, go ahead.
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:38.200]  I had a couple questions, I know it might take a minute or two, but I appreciate you
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:39.200]  keeping on the line.
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:44.280]  First of all, I just want to say, the first thing that got me awake was the entertainment
[1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:48.560]  business, people like Paris they had on on Friday and Immortal Technique and people like
[1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:53.320]  Bill Hicks, that got me sort of involved and then I got more and more into it and I found
[1:22:53.320 --> 1:23:00.480]  out about your scanner darkling and like a walking life and got me into it, but my question
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:05.120]  that I had for you is, I had a couple of, I had two questions, my first question is,
[1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:10.200]  I was wondering if, like, I've been hearing a lot of stuff about Hitler, how he might
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:17.320]  be like a Rob Child, or he possibly a Freemason, was he like, I mean, there was no doubt that
[1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:24.640]  Hitler was into the occult and there was no doubt that his father was born illegitimately
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:29.800]  out of the Rothschild house, his grandmother was a servant girl in one of the Rothschild's
[1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:35.840]  houses, but that's not, now the Nazis then tried to cover up his father's birth certificate,
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:39.560]  they tried to cover up his whole family tree and so that's where all of that discussion
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:40.560]  comes from.
[1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:41.560]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:44.840]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to David in California.
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:47.840]  David, welcome to the airwaves.
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:48.840]  Hello, yes.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:49.840]  Thanks for holding.
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:50.840]  Go ahead.
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:51.840]  Yeah, I was wondering.
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:55.840]  I've got a couple of questions to take off speakerphone for a second.
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:56.840]  Obama!
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:57.840]  Obama!
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:08.440]  So, I was watching, watching for Reid Zechariah today on the CIA and the news network and
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:17.320]  he had a general and a former ISI officer on an interview with a guy and the guy says,
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:21.800]  he mentions, they're talking about, of course, the Indian attack and he says that it appears
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:27.960]  to be, and obviously, an intelligence operation and then I just wanted to, I was wondering
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:29.640]  how far would they go with this?
[1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:34.040]  Well, I know the former head of the Pakistani ISI has already come out saying the West stage
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:36.520]  this attack to blame it on Pakistan, but go ahead.
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:37.520]  Right, exactly.
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:38.520]  So, he said that on CNN.
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:42.800]  He said that on CNN, I couldn't believe it, on Reid Zechariah and they didn't edit it.
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:44.240]  I'm like everything else they edit.
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:47.960]  Well, you know that Sarkaria guy is actually a Bilderberg group member, one of the few journalists
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:50.400]  that is a Bilderberg group member of the 125 members.
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:56.440]  Wait a minute, excuse me, on CNN today, they had the former head of ISI, it's the same
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:57.440]  guy.
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:58.440]  Actually, I don't know if it's a head.
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:01.440]  He was a former ISI officer and a general in the Pakistani army.
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:02.640]  I didn't get the guy's name.
[1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:07.440]  Well, there's a former head, I've got to pull it up, who said last week that the West stage,
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:09.200]  these attacks then gave evidence.
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:11.440]  And now even the Indian media is saying that.
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:12.440]  That was on CNN.
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:13.440]  What did the host say?
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:18.080]  Okay, well the host says, basically, you know, please expand on what you're saying.
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:21.040]  He goes, well, it appears to be an intelligence operation.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:27.640]  Nobody knows really who perpetrated this or organized it, but then he gets into 9-11 and
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:29.520]  this blew my mind.
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.680]  He actually made the point for 9-11 truth and they left it in the show.
[1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:43.320]  But, however, what he says, I'm paraphrasing in my memory, he says that it was that 9-11,
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:47.120]  in his opinion, Frida Caria asks him, well, who in your opinion committed 9-11?
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:54.000]  He said, well, it apparently appears to be a, quote, neocon Zionist operation planned
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.640]  and operated, planned in America and carried out in America by the same people.
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:06.720]  And then Frida Caria goes to commercial break, but they have a little piece they insert in
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:11.720]  and Frida says, you know, just so that you guys know, much of what he's saying is false.
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:12.720]  And he goes to commercial.
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.720]  I was like, well, you had to add that little footnote.
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:16.720]  With no evidence.
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:17.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:20.720]  And it's unbelievable that they left that in.
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:26.800]  I only say that because I post, I have posted twice on the Jack Capri file.
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:30.880]  Back in July, I think I sent you guys my, my, uh, letter.
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:33.240]  Jack Capri does the piece with Blitzer every day.
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:34.240]  Exactly.
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:35.240]  Right.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:37.600]  And Jack Capri asked, back in July, who do you think would be better at catching up
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:38.600]  on them a lot?
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:42.040]  And McCain or Obama, please post them, blah, blah, blah.
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:47.080]  So I post in, and a simple, simple little note, and I know I forwarded this to Aaron
[1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:48.480]  at an award.
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:53.240]  I post, uh, well, according to Venizer Bouto and on her David Frost interview on November
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:56.920]  2nd, and you can, anyone listening can do this search, November 2nd, Frost.
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.960]  Yes, he says, Ben Lawton died, yeah.
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:02.920]  And he says that he was murdered and we have the man in prison who murdered Ben Lawton.
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.720]  And so I, in my post, I said, according to Bouto, he was killed recently in Pakistan.
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:12.400]  So, uh, don't think anyone's going to catch the guy ever because of the faith that he
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:13.400]  fixed it.
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:17.320]  I said, but just keep on pretending and the, and our idiocracy will never know the difference.
[1:27:17.320 --> 1:27:22.000]  Well, my posting appeared on their, on their blogs for about a half an hour that they deleted
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  me.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.920]  And I was saying that that broke their rules.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.520]  I didn't, you know, promote violence toward anyone.
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:32.760]  Well, YouTube, Google, censoring my videos, everybody else's because they're desperate.
[1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:34.160]  They're losing all credibility.
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:35.160]  Right.
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:40.200]  And as, as William Colby said, former director of CIA, the CIA owns any one of any significance
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:41.200]  in the major media.
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:42.360]  And this is 100% true.
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:47.160]  Uh, I mean, you do not have to break their rules in order to get deleted.
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:48.160]  And that's a fact.
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.160]  I've been deleted.
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:50.160]  Listen, do me a favor.
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:55.280]  Uh, put that together with the Fareed Sakaria program, uh, write up a blurb and send that
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:58.160]  to Aaron and info wars.com or send it to Mike and info wars.com.
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:27:59.160]  They'll get it to me.
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:00.760]  Uh, but I just can't keep track of all this.
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:03.000]  No, I mean, it's in the Pakistani news.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:04.640]  It's in the Indian news.
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:08.960]  It's in the British news that this, uh, looks like it could be a Western operation.
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:10.760]  So it's not just Alex Jones saying this.
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:15.240]  And for anybody that turns their nose up at Israel being involved in terror, you've got
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:20.320]  to have a problem with Ross and Jerusalem posts and a few other of the big Israeli daily
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:28.160]  papers because, uh, if you Google, uh, Israeli fake al Qaeda groups, uh, you will be on Israeli
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:29.160]  newspapers.
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:33.800]  And so if you got a problem with somebody saying that about Israel, have the problem
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:40.000]  with Israel's own newspapers because Israel admittedly has been caught staging hundreds
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.680]  of terror attacks against themselves.
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:46.400]  Now, uh, are there real terrorist attacks?
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:47.400]  Absolutely.
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:50.480]  But, but every time Israel doesn't want a peace deal, every time they want to try to
[1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:51.480]  go after a grip.
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:52.480]  Well, I mean, here's the point.
[1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:53.480]  UPI reported.
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:29:07.800]  Oh, what in, uh, when was it in 2003 that Israel founded Hamas to be a counter to Hezbollah?
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:14.240]  Hezbollah Shiite Hamas is Sunni.
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:18.160]  It's very sophisticated folks and you need to get informed on this like you are on football.
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:29.320]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:34.480]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generator starting

[1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:57.960]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[1:29:57.960 --> 1:29:59.960]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:03.800]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.

[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:36.240]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when
[1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:38.960]  they should be finished stocking up on food.
[1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:43.160]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:47.720]  desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually
[1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:49.120]  increasingly hot water.
[1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:51.880]  We'll snap out of it, we now have a deadline.
[1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:54.200]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:58.800]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about
[1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:03.600]  January 22 as the time a major international incident would force the new president to
[1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:05.960]  make unpopular decisions.
[1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:10.200]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:12.440]  prior to the inauguration.
[1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:17.600]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:21.920]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:26.680]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:30.760]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[1:32:30.760 --> 1:32:33.360]  The spirit of America is independence.
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:36.080]  The greatest gift of independence is food.
[1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:41.120]  Over one-third of Americans can't afford to buy food and pay their other expenses.
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:44.520]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or canceled.
[1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:49.520]  Last year, the eFoodsDirect Holiday Food Unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with
[1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:50.880]  a great price.
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:56.000]  This year, to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:58.280]  serious holiday unit.
[1:32:58.280 --> 1:33:03.600]  This super food supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has
[1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:04.720]  more food.
[1:33:04.720 --> 1:33:08.600]  That's safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:13.120]  Gift certificates are available for shipments that will not arrive by Christmas.
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:16.120]  Food is the gift of life and love this holiday season.
[1:33:16.120 --> 1:33:21.960]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:24.960]  That's 800-409-5633.
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:27.960]  That's 800-409-5633.
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:53.960]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:34:19.960]  But we are back live.
[1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  It's what it all comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:29.520]  Here at the promo earlier, we're evil.
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:33.520]  We are bad men if we want to own guns and pass on liberty to our children.
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:35.520]  We're cowardly.
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:37.520]  We're shriveled.
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:39.800]  We don't have any male appendages.
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:43.720]  That's the attitude of people that want to be slaves, and I'm sorry for them.
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:45.520]  I think it's trendy and cool.
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:50.280]  Oh, I'm for turning my guns in, but I love it when we have troops on the streets.
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:54.800]  You see, the government being oppressive and illegitimate, using troops on the American
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:57.640]  people, but let's take the American people's guns.
[1:34:57.640 --> 1:34:58.640]  That will be much safer.
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:04.200]  You know, a lot of folks think that, oh, so what about tyranny or police brutality or
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:08.320]  violating the Fourth Amendment or warrantless spying?
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:11.760]  People think that tyranny is some quaint thing that can't happen here or that tyranny happens
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:12.760]  to somebody else.
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:19.120]  Tyranny is done so that the corrupt elite can rob and tax and over-regulate the people.
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.640]  Tyranny is a horrible thing.
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:23.480]  That's why tyranny is a bad thing.
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:26.640]  So a lot of you that don't care about tyranny or don't think it won't affect you because,
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:29.520]  oh, I don't care about freedom, I'm not going to speak out against the government.
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:32.800]  Well, don't worry, you're going to get hurt just as bad by tyranny.
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:34.560]  See, you can't get out of this.
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:38.480]  You can only fight back against it or get down and lick boots.
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:42.040]  The phones are always loaded on this show, but they've been loaded since the very, before
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:43.040]  the show started.
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:46.360]  I'm going to do phone blitzing now because I want to get to everybody and I want more
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:47.560]  people to be able to call in.
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.280]  At the very end, I'll cover some of Obama's new policies and a few of the little giblets
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  of news.
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:57.800]  Here I have 877-590-5525.
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:00.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chad in Texas.
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:01.960]  Chad, go ahead.
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:02.960]  Chad, welcome.
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:03.960]  Chad, in Colorado.
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:04.960]  Yes, sir.
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:05.960]  Could you call me?
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:10.460]  I lost that caller.
[1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:14.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas.
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:16.160]  George, you're on the air.
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:17.160]  How are you doing, Alex?
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:18.160]  Good.
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:20.080]  You know, I just fell out of my chair this morning.
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:25.040]  I was just, I don't, I watched Fox NFL Sunday and they were talking about all the football
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:30.720]  players, New York Giants players, arrested for carrying a gun and they were telling
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:32.120]  old how bad it was.
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:33.560]  Yeah, well, that's the message.
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:39.920]  See, just like I said last or earlier this hour, that's what's done over and over again
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:44.680]  is that they take media stories out of Chicago and out of New York where there's total gun
[1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:49.560]  bans against the slave citizens and then they advertise that guns are illegal and so when
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:53.840]  you've got a carpet cleaner or a plumber in your house in 98% of the country where it's
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:57.720]  not illegal, where you still have a somewhat of a second amendment, they call the cops
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:36:58.720]  on you.
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:36:59.880]  I mean, it happens all the time.
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:00.880]  They're in your house.
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:01.880]  They see a gun case.
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:04.240]  They see a, you know, a gun frame on the wall.
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:05.600]  They start freaking out.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:09.920]  They have been trained to be scared of guns and that's just disgusting.
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:10.920]  Go ahead.
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:14.560]  So they were, they were on there talking about how horrible it is that, that these NFL guys
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:18.280]  want to protect themselves while the economy implodes and crime explodes.
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:19.960]  How dare them want to protect their families?
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:20.960]  How dare them?
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:27.480]  Well, you know, the thing is, before I left Florida, a woman called the police and this
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:31.800]  guy's house got swat teamed and all his guns taken away because she was looking through
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.440]  his front window and he was just cleaning his guns.
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:37.440]  She felt threatened.
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:42.080]  I know, sir, sir, sir, I read hundreds of news articles a day for listeners that don't
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:47.640]  and I see articles every couple of days where a, where a mainline guy who's a plumber or
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:51.480]  a works at an auto plant, there's been a lot of cases, we've interviewed some of them.
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:53.720]  He'll tell his neighbors, Hey, you better get some horrible food.
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:58.320]  Things are falling apart or they'll be carrying their guns out of their car to go to the shooting
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:02.760]  range or they'll be cleaning their guns on the back porch and they get swat team and
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.280]  the cops say, well, there's no law, but we're going to go ahead and take your guns because
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:07.280]  it's an arsenal.
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:11.840]  So, so, I mean, tell me, so they swat team this guy for cleaning guns with this good
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:13.240]  little spy watching him.
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:14.240]  And then what happened?
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:17.800]  Well, I mean, he didn't get arrested, but he lost his guns.
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:18.800]  It's like New Orleans.
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:20.480]  They took hundreds of thousands of guns.
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:22.840]  They busted into houses, took them high and dry.
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:25.840]  People trying to get out of the city and their RVs and trucks, they'd stop them, search
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.240]  them, take their guns and they never got them back.
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:32.240]  And it's the same thing with just all of this.
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:36.040]  And now in Illinois, the governor announced three months ago, they have the National Guard
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:37.920]  confiscating guns door to door.
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:42.920]  Well, the thing is, I'm good part part where I live, it's a sin if you don't own a gun.
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:46.280]  Well, that's the kind of places we need everywhere because again, slaves are disarmed.
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:48.160]  Now, let me explain how this works in Illinois.
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:52.000]  They're totally banned in Chicago and several other cities, a bunch of towns.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.120]  I mean, it's so enslaved in some areas of Illinois.
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  Great people, by the way.
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:58.560]  There's like four affiliates up there, two of them going to Chicago.
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  Great people.
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:04.800]  I got, my cousin lives up in Chicago, wonderful, you know, nice city, but the evil of the
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:10.240]  government, you know, with the son of the mob boss, you know, being the mayor for life.
[1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:12.740]  They have, you have to have a card to own a gun.
[1:39:12.740 --> 1:39:16.440]  And so they love SWAT teaming old people because they'll get old and won't renew their card
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:17.760]  and that's in a database.
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:25.820]  And the day your card is, is, is expired to own a gun, you get SWAT teamed.
[1:39:25.820 --> 1:39:30.080]  And so, and routinely when I see the articles, it's called cage units up there, the state
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:33.560]  police anti-gun units, and now they use the National Guard and they just go door to door
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:37.840]  every day to the houses, okay, here's a list on the computer of those that didn't renew
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:38.840]  their card.
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:42.960]  They're still going to have guns and they SWAT team you again, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:44.960]  enslaving the people.
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois, speaking of folks in Illinois.
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:49.160]  Go ahead, Chris.
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:55.360]  Hey, please ask these seven and seven, chilly oppression, make it the wise man mad.
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  Absolutely.
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:04.120]  Alex, the GMO food situation, I feed the animals in my backyard because like you, I love nature.
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:11.760]  You're all kind of funny thing in the middle of the winter, squirrels will not eat GMO
[1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:12.760]  foods.
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:15.120]  There's no farmers where the pigs won't eat the GMO crop.
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:19.960]  Yeah, they'll sniff it, they'll look at it, and then they'll look at me like I'm crazy,
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:20.960]  like I'm trying to poison them.
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:28.520]  Now, if I go and get what you call organic foods, they'll eat it right up and come back
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:29.520]  for more.
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:33.720]  Sir, there are thousands of studies, I just had an expert on Friday, thousands, I mean
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:38.160]  all these GMOs, they feed them to rats, they can't have babies anymore.
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:40.520]  It's being done by design, go ahead.
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:45.880]  And even those rats, just like a man who's imprisoned or a man who may be in a dire situation,
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:47.480]  you'll eat your own waste byproducts.
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:53.720]  See, those lab animals are starved so that they'll eat the foods for the research.
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.320]  But a free animal or human with the right to choose will choose what's best.
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:03.160]  And all I can say is that we have to get back to looking at nature for our direction because
[1:41:03.160 --> 1:41:05.160]  I've noticed no butterflies this year.
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:11.040]  I've seen like maybe, this whole summer I saw maybe three swallowtails and maybe one
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:12.040]  monarch.
[1:41:12.040 --> 1:41:16.600]  I always saw swallowtails growing up, you never see them anymore, and of course almost
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:20.360]  all the bees in England have died, half of our bees have died, and they have major German
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:25.960]  and Russian studies, university studies I've had the scientists on here on the show.
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:31.120]  It's all linked to one GMO corn, and when the bees, other bugs won't eat it, but the
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:34.320]  bees will, then the bees die.
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:41.320]  And so that's the major issue there, it is just so horrible, but the reason pigs and
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.560]  squirrels and others that have been studies on this won't eat many varieties of GMO corn
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:51.080]  and other foods that have had mainly cross species, other genetics of their animals put
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:55.280]  into it is because they're olfactory nerves, they're noses, that's why they use the pigs,
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:57.800]  they use pigs to find truffles.
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:00.760]  Some police agencies now use pigs other than dogs.
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:05.320]  Pigs have a nose even better than a bloodhound, and the pig is smelling something in there,
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:09.280]  we can't smell, thousands of times better sense of smell than we have, good to hear from
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:10.280]  you.
[1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:13.640]  Bobby in California, good to hear from you, you're on the air world wide.
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:19.200]  Hi, I was going to call it, Lou Dobbs broke a story the other day about United States
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:22.960]  funding Russian scientists that are building up the Iran nuclear program, did you hear
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:23.960]  about that?
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:28.320]  Yes, the United States, what was that, was only 15 million to a Russian science institute
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:34.280]  is helping Iran develop their nuclear reactors, but again, that's a shill in and of itself
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:40.280]  because if you Google US and England help arm Iran, actually the US and England have
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.960]  been arming Pakistan, India and Iran with real new components, so that's kind of a red
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:45.960]  herring.
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:51.920]  Do you think they're trying to build up Iran nuclear, so they could bomb it?
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:43:00.320]  You ever seen the old Western where the evil gunfighter hired by the mining company has
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:06.480]  just killed the little miner's dad, and then he throws the gun down in front of the ten
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:12.040]  year old's feet and says, pick up the gun, pick it up, well that's what they're doing
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.920]  with these conference, they give them the weapons so they can blow the daylights out
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:16.920]  of them.
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:22.040]  You mean they're setting up Russia so they can bomb Russia and say that they helped Iran
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:23.040]  go?
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:25.200]  Oh no, you're right, NATO says they want to launch a sneak attack on Russia, just like
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:29.920]  they snuck attack areas of South Ossetia, well they're right back.
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:33.200]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:37.000]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  world.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:42.840]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who

[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:49.280]  or saline solutions.
[1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:53.840]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano sized particles, it can be better utilized
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:58.520]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern day
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:43:59.720]  antibiotics.
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:04.080]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:08.040]  and copper, with a money bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:12.320]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:16.200]  would steal our God given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:46.960]  diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:51.720]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:54.320]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:59.040]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally

[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:35.400]  in the water.
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:39.200]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:43.160]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:47.080]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure,

[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:58.920]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and

[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:03.400]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.

[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:37.840]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:54.280]  All right, let's keep what's creaking for your phone calls, Brian in Austin, Texas.
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:55.280]  You're on the air, Brian.
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:56.280]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:01.640]  First off, I just want to say that I owe you an apology because six weeks ago I had been
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:05.800]  considered a right-wing Republican Christian conservative and I ridiculed you to other
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:06.800]  people.
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:07.800]  I regret it.
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:11.120]  Well, what woke you up?
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:18.320]  Somebody told me to go watch a 9-second video of Building 7 and then of course I had a heightened
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:24.560]  awareness and fear over what the Fed printed all this money and so I watched Fabled Enemies
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:27.800]  and a few others and I'm just shocked.
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:31.440]  Well, I mean, did you hear me years ago say that they were going to do this with the banking
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:35.160]  and they were going to put troops on the streets and everything's being announced now?
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:40.040]  Well, you know, I'm living proof that what you're doing is working because some of the
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:43.320]  things you would say, I say, you know, I want to believe that but gosh, I just can't get
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:45.240]  myself to believe this and this and this.
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:47.720]  But the good news is you don't have to believe me.
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:49.920]  Everything I talk about is documented.
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:50.920]  No, I know.
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:56.440]  But if I tell you they're arresting Amish people for selling each other a whole milk, I got
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:48:57.440]  the news article.
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:01.560]  Well, no, I believe everything you're saying now, Alex, it's just that the information
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:06.880]  is getting out and I had to see it to believe it and now I've been able to absorb it.
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:11.960]  But something that I think may or may not have gotten on your radar is they had an unbelievable
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:16.560]  stellar group of people, if you call them stellar, or at least that's the way they appear
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:23.360]  in Colin Powell and Rudy Giuliani, Zig Ziglar, and they were charging $19 for this big seminar.
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  No way it's profitable.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:28.880]  Oh yeah, they advertised on every radio and TV station had to be hundreds of thousands
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:33.400]  and how are they making money saying 20, 30 people could come for $19?
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:34.400]  They're not.
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:37.720]  You know what they were telling people to leave your money in your 401k so they can
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:38.720]  steal it?
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:44.200]  Well, Zabigniew Brzezinski, all of these people have been coming to Austin, the head of the
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:47.600]  Federal Reserve, he should be going to prison, according to Ron Paul.
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:52.400]  He came to town to propagandize and act like they're the good guys when they're engineering
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:53.400]  all of this.
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:54.800]  So you saw through that?
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.240]  Yeah, I absolutely did.
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:00.840]  I wouldn't have had I not watched that 9-second video and then started listening to you and
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:04.960]  now I'm starting to study a little bit of British history and it's absolutely frightening.
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:10.480]  Last night on the Austin News they talked about a fusion center here and the news program
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:12.520]  couldn't even tell us what a fusion center was.
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:16.800]  How many years did I say they're building FEMA command centers to federalize your local
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:20.360]  police and they've now announced the governors will be federalized?
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:25.680]  They told us the reason that Austin is more likely to be hit by a terrorist attack is
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:28.760]  because of our population and because of I-35.
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.600]  What laziness on the part of the media?
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:35.080]  Fusion center is a federalization tyranny center.
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:40.360]  Well, Alex, what you're doing is working because again, I owe you an apology.
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:44.680]  I left a message several days ago for you just because I just felt guilty, but I will
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:46.960]  never ridicule anything that you say again.
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:51.160]  I mean, obviously, I'm an independent thinker, so I have the right to disagree.
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:52.160]  No, no, no.
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:53.160]  Ridical whatever you want.
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:57.240]  The thing is, I try to tell the truth and 98% of the time I am accurate.
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.160]  You know, I was listening to a rebroadcast of my show the other day and I was talking
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:03.880]  about Arnold Schwarzenegger shouldn't be able to be our president.
[1:51:03.880 --> 1:51:05.920]  We shouldn't change the 22nd Amendment.
[1:51:05.920 --> 1:51:10.720]  You know, it turns out Obama, you know, isn't natural born and can't be president.
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:12.280]  We shouldn't amend that for him either.
[1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:17.040]  And then I said, because Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a U.S. citizen.
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:20.640]  And later I listened to the show and I go, I meant natural born.
[1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:22.780]  So I make mistakes like that all the time.
[1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:26.400]  But when it comes to the basic information, I am accurate.
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:27.400]  Okay.
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:28.400]  Let's go ahead.
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:30.600]  I mean, I also oversimplify because of time.
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:32.760]  I mean, I want to go to your calls right now.
[1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:36.520]  But earlier I said they're confiscating guns using the National Guard in Illinois.
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:39.720]  Well, what they're doing is they're going door to door knocking and saying, can we see
[1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:40.720]  your guns?
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:43.080]  It's called knock and talk, Google that.
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:45.880]  So it's not like they're door to door, every house taking the guns.
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:48.320]  They're trying to take the guns.
[1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:52.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in California.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Here on the air, welcome.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  How are you doing today?
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  Good, sir.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  Listen.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  I want to relate to a story.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  I live in the Beach Cities area of the Donna Beach at the suburb of Los Angeles.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.480]  I want to relate to you a story about the army.
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:09.120]  My brother-in-law and me, we experienced, I was in Carson, California, right off the
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:12.600]  91 freeway on Friday, about 11 o'clock in the morning.
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:16.240]  And you know, we were at a stoplight right about the freeway, it's kind of an industrial
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:18.920]  poor area in Carson.
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:23.400]  So we saw these three canopies that were truck full of just military people and it was full
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:24.400]  on army.
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:27.400]  You know, we could tell they were soldiers and in our time, that's what we found.
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:28.400]  Regular army.
[1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:33.840]  Regular army used to be in every fusion center, in every city, surveilling illegal, the American
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:34.840]  people.
[1:52:34.840 --> 1:52:38.760]  Listen, I just wanted to know if you had information about anything going on in Los Angeles, there.
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:43.280]  And also, you know, I'm a freelance writer and I covered some local events, city council
[1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:44.280]  meetings, stuff in this area.
[1:52:44.280 --> 1:52:49.640]  Have you heard anything about the El Segundo military entrance processing station?
[1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:50.640]  Yes.
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:54.800]  I mean, I covered it when they were first talking about it in the city council, so what exactly
[1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:55.800]  is that going to entail?
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:59.240]  They said it's going to be open by the summer of 2009, so what exactly is that going to
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:00.240]  entail?
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:03.960]  They're going to turn the public schools into military academies, and I'm all for military
[1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:08.280]  academies, but not when it's public schools, like Nazi Germany, they are going to build
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:11.880]  huge military bases and take old bases and reopen them.
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:16.160]  All over the country, they're moving the National Guard, which has now been federalized, under
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:20.080]  Homeland Security, Northcom, in with local police departments, they are, I mean, just
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:21.080]  classical tyranny, sir.
[1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:22.880]  I don't know what else to tell you.
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:24.880]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:31.000]  Thank you, sir, and I wanted to also apologize for a missed opportunity on the BBC broadcast.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:32.760]  World, have your say.
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:36.360]  They did here in Austin, and gosh, I don't know, I'm sorry, I just didn't get everything
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:37.360]  and I wanted to.
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:39.720]  I didn't know that that happened here in town.
[1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:44.680]  It was great, and I was able to at least say my revolutionary name, which you don't let
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:48.080]  me say, by the way, which is, I don't think, constructive, but I don't know what you're
[1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:49.080]  talking about.
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:54.040]  My name is Ronnie, Referseed, and it's kind of a, I call it revolutionary because it's
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:55.440]  tearing up the Republican Party.
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:54:00.720]  They wouldn't let me go to the, as a delegate, despite the overwhelming support of the...
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:05.160]  Well, I mean, it's okay for you to say Ronnie, Referseed, I mean, you're claiming I'm not
[1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:06.160]  letting you say...
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:10.480]  Well, I guess I was trying to, you know, and I've heard you say you prefer people to have
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:14.360]  only one name, and this was the kind of exception, because like in my case, that's actually my
[1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:15.520]  name on the ballot.
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:16.920]  When I ran for Congress in the year 2000...
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:22.600]  Okay, well, it's different if somebody is a candidate for something, but listen, here's
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:23.880]  the deal, man.
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:26.720]  I don't care if people smoke pot, I don't smoke it.
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:30.480]  But people that smoke it, act like it, that's their revolution.
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:33.960]  That's how they're fighting the man, or having roster hair, or having tattoos.
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:35.240]  Look, I don't care.
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:38.840]  Do what you want, just don't say, I'm a square because I don't do it.
[1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:42.800]  I'm against drug prohibition, but I don't think drugs overall are good.
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:47.720]  Now, I think marijuana is not as bad as alcohol, let me be clear about that, okay?
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:51.720]  I think alcohol, I've seen the studies, is clearly worse, little car wrecks, death, liver
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:53.080]  disease, everything.
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:57.120]  I'm just making the point here that people stoned out of their head calling into the
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:58.760]  show is annoying to me.
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:01.600]  I mean, I get sick of pot heads.
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:04.520]  People who smoke pot every five minutes, I mean, I'm tired of it.
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:07.640]  I mean, if you smoke some pot at night, like you'd have a drink or something, fine with
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:08.640]  me.
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:11.160]  But just, I don't want to hear about it all day long.
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:19.360]  Let's talk to, is that Chess, it's C-H-E-S, in South Dakota.
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:20.360]  You are on the air.
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:21.360]  Welcome.
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:22.360]  Hi, Alex.
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:23.360]  Yeah, we're calling.
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:26.000]  We're doing, I want to tell you how we're fighting the Info War up here.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.880]  You've talked about micro FM, but we use these certified transmitters.
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:34.280]  We've created a daisy chain of low power transmitters in Sioux Falls and Omaha.
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:37.960]  They're actually live right now in the two cities, and we're growing these by about one
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:38.960]  transmitter a week.
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:41.920]  So, you have legal little tiny ones, but get them in everybody's houses.
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:46.280]  Yeah, actually, these transmitters are certified, only on the AM side, they have available these
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:47.280]  certified transmitters.
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:49.480]  They actually cover almost a three mile radius.
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:52.160]  You get six of these in a city like this, you're all over the airways.
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:53.160]  Where did you get them?
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:55.200]  Well, there's a man in New Hampshire that builds these.
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:55:56.200]  He's an engineer.
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:57.200]  I'm an engineer.
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:55:58.400]  I used to work there in Dallas for Southwestern Bell.
[1:55:58.400 --> 1:55:59.720]  I learned about this back then.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:00.720]  Hey, listen.
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:05.760]  Give us your name and number, because I know that small AMs are legal, and I would love
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:09.400]  to have you guys as a sponsor or just to promote you, period.
[1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:11.000]  Well, this is blowing up.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.680]  I mean, I'm getting emails everywhere now.
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:15.680]  So how many of these transmitters you got going out there?
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:16.880]  I've got five.
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:21.800]  I've got one in Omaha and four here in Sioux Falls, and everybody in Omaha now.
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:23.840]  We've got enough demands to cover them.
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:27.840]  We're trying to get some people to donate money so we can get them across, but that's
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:28.840]  not important.
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.200]  I just want to tell you, this works, and it's getting attention.
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:36.320]  And those are the small AMs that are legal.
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:41.680]  Yeah, it's called the Hamilton Rangemaster, but I can get them at a discount for listeners.
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:44.000]  But and Ted Anderson's folks know about me.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.520]  I've been talking to- Well, we want to talk to you.
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:51.280]  We want to put you on hold right now and get that information, okay?
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:52.440]  Last caller, Drew in Arizona.
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:53.440]  Go ahead.
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  Hey, buddy.
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:57.440]  Turn your radio off.
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:56:59.160]  Okay.
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:04.040]  That's another pothead caller.
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:05.040]  I'm going to hang up on him.
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:06.040]  I'm joking.
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  That's a prank caller that keeps calling in disguising his voice.
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:10.760]  I know who he is, so we just hung up on him.
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:12.360]  Look, I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:15.200]  I didn't cover all the news I wanted to, but I did cover a lot of it.
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:18.960]  Obama, economy, worse before it gets better, CBS News.
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:21.280]  He says he's going to do a lot of things people aren't going to like.
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:22.480]  The economy is going to get worse for it.
[1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:23.480]  It's better.
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:28.120]  There's going to be early moments of the interview on Meet the Press, taped Saturday,
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:33.080]  and then aired today across the nation, and then tomorrow on my weekday show, I'm going
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:37.320]  to go through Obama's unveils 21st century New Deal.
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:41.920]  They're going to take over the web like they took over AM and FM radio 80 years ago.
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:45.200]  They're basically going to shut down the free web and go to Internet too, and they're going
[1:57:45.200 --> 1:57:50.560]  to turn most of the major roads into international biosphere corridors, international zones.
[1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:55.600]  I want you to go on those ABC News and APR reporting, more foreign troops to make up
[1:57:55.600 --> 1:58:01.040]  our military, more mercenary groups to be operating in the United States.
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:08.600]  I've got a video here where the police, this guy falls in the waters drowning, so his sons
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:10.560]  are yelling and screaming, so they taser them.
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:12.600]  I mean, just, I'm not bashing the police here.
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:17.760]  I'm saying you've turned into just morons, not all of you, but a large portions of you.
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:19.760]  Oh, and Reuters reported the queen.
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:24.040]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:23.000]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  spray.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:29.960]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:31.280]  We are under the microscope.
[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:35.360]  Red light cameras and sneak cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
