[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:23.040]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.040 --> 00:30.840]  okay folks big show lined up for you today obviously here we are Wednesday the
[00:30.840 --> 00:38.160]  28th day of December 2011 and you want him you've got him Lindsey Williams is
[00:38.160 --> 00:42.320]  gonna be on with us in the third hour with his former Royal Company exec
[00:42.320 --> 00:46.280]  source much of what he's predicted has come true some of it hasn't as a
[00:46.280 --> 00:49.920]  globalist according to his source of change their plans but basically pretty
[00:49.920 --> 00:53.640]  much everything his source is putting out now is just there for the world to
[00:53.640 --> 00:59.280]  see and we'll be getting Lindsey Williams on to discuss all of this with us
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.920]  in the third hour today and to take your calls Dr. Busby is gonna be joining us
[01:05.920 --> 01:11.960]  he's one of the foremost experts on radiation he's British scientists known
[01:11.960 --> 01:15.400]  for his reports about the negative health effects of very low-dose
[01:15.400 --> 01:19.800]  radiation Busby is the director of Green Audit Environmental Consultancy
[01:19.800 --> 01:24.120]  Scientific Advisor for the low-level radiation campaign which is set up in
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.600]  95 he's a professor at the University of Ulster and of course he also was
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.960]  advised the BBC the EU and other major groups and organizations and he gave us
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.000]  really accurate information the first few weeks of Fukushima that turned out to
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.840]  be absolutely accurate though it's pretty shocking at the time so we'll get
[01:42.840 --> 01:48.680]  about a 45-minute update on Fukushima and just that ongoing disaster with Dr.
[01:48.680 --> 01:56.200]  Busby Christopher Busby coming up in a part of the second hour today now I
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.920]  ended up covering something last night on the news because a listener mentioned
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.440]  it and it reminded me of a big hit piece in CBS news and other publications and
[02:06.440 --> 02:12.800]  TV programs last week where the system gets very upset when I touch upon a
[02:12.800 --> 02:18.120]  certain area because it hits at the core of what they're doing changing the
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.960]  human species as we know it genetic chemical biological manipulation is
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.920]  going on on record the world eugenics dictatorship that's in control of almost
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.440]  every nation for now 40 years it'll be 40 years in a few months has been taking
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.000]  blood from all children at birth and saying it's for a blood test when it
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.040]  really goes into eugenics database I told you that 15 years ago it was
[02:42.040 --> 02:47.160]  declassified four years ago that's just to give you an example of what's really
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.280]  going on and what's really going on is there's a huge secret global system the
[02:52.280 --> 02:58.680]  documents we have from it are voluminous but imagine what we don't know and so I
[02:58.680 --> 03:05.880]  thought I would get into the chemical biological radiological genetic
[03:05.880 --> 03:12.320]  manipulation going on the DNA damage happening to humans this is the real
[03:12.320 --> 03:17.640]  world we're down here with American Idol and dancing with the stars and X factor
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.680]  and the NFL and celebrities and all the rest of it meanwhile the scientific
[03:23.680 --> 03:27.720]  dictators could care less about all that that's just stimuli tribal
[03:27.720 --> 03:32.160]  manipulation they use to control us and they try to steer art and literature and
[03:32.160 --> 03:37.560]  information and entertainment so that it never points in the direction of
[03:37.560 --> 03:44.200]  reality nevertheless some of their own people do like to throw it in our face
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.040]  from time to time like oldest Huxley who wrote in 1932 basically what they've
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.600]  now achieved girls going into puberty at age five men not going into puberty till
[03:54.600 --> 04:00.200]  15 feminized breast cancer off the charts other cancers directly linked to
[04:00.200 --> 04:05.200]  bisphenol a but that's only one chemical so I thought I'd spend some more time on
[04:05.200 --> 04:14.240]  this today coming up at the bottom of the hour I will get into that and before
[04:14.240 --> 04:19.560]  that I will get into all of the news here's some of the key news coming up
[04:19.560 --> 04:26.760]  Iran promises to close down oil route if sanctions imposed that's at info wars
[04:26.760 --> 04:30.840]  dot com for the second time in two days Iran is threatened to shut down the
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.160]  trade of our moose if new sanctions are imposed in response to its nuclear program
[04:35.160 --> 04:40.920]  vice president Iran threatened Tuesday to close down the straight and cut off oil
[04:40.920 --> 04:45.440]  exports the west imposes sanctions on the country's oil shipment so they say you
[04:45.440 --> 04:51.320]  cut us off we cut you off because they import around half their oil or around
[04:51.320 --> 04:56.200]  half the refined gasoline that plenty of oil is another refineries so we'll be
[04:56.200 --> 05:03.280]  breaking all of that down on the other side hundreds of nations have fallen to
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.000]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.240]  history as they're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.200]  underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this influence on our
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.440]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[05:20.440 --> 05:25.680]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[05:25.680 --> 05:30.240]  republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.640]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[05:34.640 --> 05:38.360]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.360 --> 05:42.320]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.320 --> 05:47.880]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[05:47.880 --> 05:53.560]  the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[08:16.160 --> 08:26.560]  it is Wednesday 28th of the day of December 2011 the waning twilight the
[08:26.560 --> 08:34.520]  dusk is night falls on 2011 Iran promises to close down oil route if
[08:34.520 --> 08:39.400]  sanctions imposed we have a detailed report and breakdown by Curt Nemo at
[08:39.400 --> 08:47.000]  info wars.com then of course we also have Harats out of England out of out of
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.160]  Israel and we also have report on the BBC reporting the same thing Israel US
[08:52.160 --> 09:00.560]  discuss triggers for military strike on Iran newsweeks the Daily Beast is also
[09:00.560 --> 09:07.360]  reporting that countries are discussing red lines in Iran's nuclear program that
[09:07.360 --> 09:13.040]  if crossed would justify a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities what
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.600]  about the red lines of our so-called government stealing tens of trillions
[09:16.600 --> 09:20.640]  of dollars what about the red lines of our so-called government setting up
[09:20.640 --> 09:24.200]  FEMA camps and openly saying they'll use the military against the American
[09:24.200 --> 09:29.240]  people to put us in FEMA camps and and and secretly arrest us what about all
[09:29.240 --> 09:36.000]  those red lines being crossed here's another one another report dealing
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.040]  basically with the same subject out of Harats or Haritz Israel could easily
[09:42.040 --> 09:49.240]  attack Iran Israel the United States and others are saying last week the
[09:49.240 --> 09:55.400]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that oh we can easily attack Iran I
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.320]  just don't think Iran understands that oh I think Iran understands that well
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.320]  and is preparing to drop blocked straight-off or moose that will
[10:06.320 --> 10:13.840]  conservatively double oil prices in this nation continuing Iran again could
[10:13.840 --> 10:20.080]  easily block a vital oil route Admiral warns Iran's Navy commander says blocking
[10:20.080 --> 10:26.240]  oil flow to the Strait of Hormuz would be as easy for us as drinking a glass of
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.200]  water so again Iran's Navy commander says blocking oil flow to the Strait of
[10:32.200 --> 10:37.800]  Hormuz would be as easy for us as drinking a glass of water Iran could
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.080]  easily block oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz a vital transit round
[10:41.080 --> 10:45.120]  for Persian Gulf oil if Western governments impose further sanctions on
[10:45.120 --> 10:49.720]  the Islamic State Iran's Navy commander said Wednesday blocking the Strait of
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.760]  Hormuz would be as easy for us as drinking a glass of water but for the
[10:52.760 --> 10:58.760]  time being there is no need to do so their head Admiral told Iran's press
[10:58.760 --> 11:04.000]  TV the European Union has threatened to expand its sanctions on Iran after the
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.400]  UN atomic watchdog published a report in November expressing serious concern of
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.520]  the country's controversial nuclear program well why can Israel have 400
[11:12.520 --> 11:18.880]  nukes then EU foreign ministers plan to discuss a possible Iranian oil embargo
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.400]  at their next meeting on January 30th the admiral's comments follow a
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.000]  televised statement by Iran's vice president who on Tuesday warned that
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.280]  Iran would not allow one drop of oil across the Strait of Hormuz should
[11:33.280 --> 11:37.840]  Western governments impose further sanctions now again there the West is
[11:37.840 --> 11:42.560]  saying that is the bankers that run Europe in the US and England and Israel
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.520]  are saying that they will stop ships they will shut down pipelines they will
[11:46.520 --> 11:55.080]  model oil into Iran and Iran imports around 50% of its refined gasoline they
[11:55.080 --> 11:58.440]  have plenty of crude oil they don't have the refineries they don't have the
[11:58.440 --> 12:02.240]  infrastructure and of course the globalists want to bomb the sovereign
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.160]  country destroy its infrastructure then have internal al-Qaeda grips attack
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.560]  claim their freedom fighters and then have Western backed invasion of the
[12:09.560 --> 12:17.040]  nation at least on their Western flank and break it off in some new
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.680]  Wahhabi a slash Kurdistan situation just like the West is now getting ready to
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.960]  try to break Iraq in three pieces which is always the plan so this is how the
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.560]  globalists destroy national sovereignty and basically turn different sectors
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.840]  into their own little minion to them I'm now inventing words but that's what
[12:36.840 --> 12:43.280]  little fiefdoms little little substates and again I'm not saying Iran is some
[12:43.280 --> 12:47.480]  cornucopia of goodness I'm not saying their leadership isn't corrupt most
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.240]  governments are run by very wicked people it's that our government along with
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.000]  the British and others have overthrown Iran not once not twice but three times
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.480]  in the last 70 years and the West has always believed they own Iran and they
[13:04.480 --> 13:07.640]  do not want any sovereign countries they don't want the US being sovereign
[13:07.640 --> 13:14.800]  either and so they are basically prodding and pushing and manipulating Iran into
[13:14.800 --> 13:19.840]  some type of response so that Israel and the United States can blast the
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.520]  country into the Stone Age and then it'll be off to the races and Israel will
[13:24.520 --> 13:29.000]  be attacked from all sides and then Benjamin Netanyahu with election coming
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.360]  up can look like the Churchill fighting the evil Hitler and that's his
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.560]  advisors that have said that the Washington Times and others and so the
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.080]  war planners and the social engineers know that even if most people are
[13:42.080 --> 13:48.200]  against war once a big one is kicked off people tend to get politically in line
[13:48.200 --> 13:53.520]  and do what they're told and so so what if we're in a depression so what if
[13:53.520 --> 13:57.400]  they're taking your pension funds so what you know what if you riot you get
[13:57.400 --> 14:04.120]  shot and so the West wants this new regional war that many experts agree
[14:04.120 --> 14:09.560]  could lead to World War three as a political cover for what they're doing
[14:09.560 --> 14:16.880]  Europe wants it that'll unify the Europe under the banker takeover Israel wants
[14:16.880 --> 14:20.560]  it that'll get their people who are rioting and standing in food lines as
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.360]  well in line the United States leadership and control arm wants it so that
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.240]  they can attack a country they don't like which will actually stir up the
[14:29.240 --> 14:33.840]  whole world against us so they can then stage false flag terror attack so there
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.520]  may even be real ones domestically and use that to further crack down and roll
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.320]  out the triple funding for TSA checkpoints on the highways that the
[14:43.320 --> 14:47.480]  LA Times announced a few days ago the TSA not just for airports anymore
[14:47.480 --> 14:53.120]  shopping malls highways they're coming to your underwear soon their hands are
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.760]  going in the pants soon a total journey into tyranny with the borders wide open
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.760]  and all the training manuals are for Christians conservatives libertarians
[15:02.760 --> 15:09.480]  Ron Paul type supporters people that understand what's going on now if you
[15:09.480 --> 15:14.240]  actually read the UN report as Ron Paul has said it says they fear they could
[15:14.240 --> 15:22.200]  use this down the road to get material to build a nuclear weapon and this is
[15:22.200 --> 15:28.520]  just a replay of Bush and Colin Powell with the anthrax vials saying here are
[15:28.520 --> 15:33.200]  the photos of the trucks here is the anthrax now they knew those trucks were
[15:33.200 --> 15:42.160]  British sold mobile 18 wheeler trailers that pump up hydrogen balloons for
[15:42.160 --> 15:47.840]  directing artillery that the British and the US sold to them US and British
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.360]  systems are sold to them for the seven year seven and a half Iran-Iraq war that
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.200]  was fully funded by the West to have the Muslims kill each other again and get
[15:57.200 --> 16:02.680]  them all into debt again and the establishment didn't like it that
[16:02.680 --> 16:08.280]  Saddam was actually paying back his debts and he said can I invade Kuwait
[16:08.280 --> 16:11.440]  they're stealing oil and the West said go ahead April Gillespie said we don't
[16:11.440 --> 16:14.880]  get involved in an Arab affairs and the same thing they told him whenever he
[16:14.880 --> 16:21.840]  attacked Iran and he said okay I'll attack they said go ahead that's how
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.240]  they manipulate these people just like Manuel Noriega and been in prison for
[16:26.240 --> 16:32.240]  decades on record shipping drugs out of Panama into the US for the CIA and then
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.000]  he got a little uppity and started buying palaces in Switzerland bigger than
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.480]  the globalist and they just said oh my gosh Manuel Noriega is on the film of
[16:43.480 --> 16:47.920]  Panama deception he has kidnapped call American college students in Panama and
[16:47.920 --> 16:52.320]  then when the special forces got there after blowing up and engaging in mass
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.040]  murder in Panama City with C-130s flying around with cannons and
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.480]  gatling guns just randomly blowing everything up and shooting everybody up
[17:00.480 --> 17:05.160]  it shows the college students come out and they go no one ever held us here but
[17:05.160 --> 17:10.680]  we appreciate the army being here just for our safety none of it was true none
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.720]  of it was real it's all just completely made up and everybody's like good kill
[17:14.720 --> 17:19.840]  them kill them attack Panama or you're not a fan of that drug dealer Manuel
[17:19.840 --> 17:27.000]  Noriega are you this is how stupid the system thinks we are this is how dumb
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.320]  the system thinks you are and most Americans think Iran is Arab they don't
[17:33.320 --> 17:36.680]  even know it's a different group entirely Persians and I hear them on
[17:36.680 --> 17:41.000]  radio saying kill them Arabs a new guy ran I mean it killed them Arabs in

[24:53.200 --> 24:59.800]  really I've covered a tiny tiny bit of the spectrum which is about 30 40
[24:59.800 --> 25:06.160]  articles where it's admitted that the UN and the world government and Planned
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.160]  Parenthood want to break up the family and put chemicals in the water where you

[26:02.840 --> 26:17.600]  out of it and to a certain extent that is happening you know what it is people
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.280]  have given up people have decided to myopically just fly their airplane
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.760]  right the side of a cliff or drive the car off the side of the cliff and people
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.600]  just get focused on their little task in life and the little routine and they
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.400]  just want to live down here in this controlled environment and let a bunch
[26:36.400 --> 26:41.800]  of chicken neck potbellied control freak anti human scum run everything and
[26:41.800 --> 26:46.120]  jack our food and water and air with all sorts of poisons and then sit up
[26:46.120 --> 26:52.880]  there giggling about it like it's funny and entertaining and I for one have
[26:52.880 --> 26:58.400]  just had it you know it even contributes to the false reality to
[26:58.400 --> 27:03.000]  debate newt genrich and they try to explain to people that he's new world
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.760]  order trash you see the media endorsing him that's all you need to have to know
[27:07.760 --> 27:14.080]  or to talk about Mitt Romney rising in the polls in Iowa if you can even
[27:14.080 --> 27:23.240]  believe that Ron Paul still in first place I mean Mitt Romney a empty ghoul
[27:23.240 --> 27:29.720]  in a fancy suit reading talking points at people who supports abortion open
[27:29.720 --> 27:35.600]  borders amnesty cities carbon taxes world government wrote Obamacare and you
[27:35.600 --> 27:43.880]  see the sniveling cowardly dumbed down simple minded Republicans running
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.880]  around with limp wrist talking about how great he is because they want to say
[27:48.880 --> 27:54.720]  that they're voting for and endorsing the winner they want the delusion they
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.600]  want the vapor they want the mirage instead of the real thing they want
[28:00.600 --> 28:06.520]  fantasy land and most people I talked to are living in fantasy land well I'm not
[28:06.520 --> 28:13.440]  living in fantasy land okay I live in the real world every stinking day and I
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.600]  have to sit here and watch these control freak globalists getting away with all
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.640]  the stuff they're carrying out murdering people all the world forced
[28:21.640 --> 28:26.080]  abortions jack in the food and water almost impossible to avoid what they're
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.840]  doing to me and it makes me angry I bet most of you if you walked up in a
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.800]  restaurant most of you new listeners and think this is funny and you saw
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.240]  somebody sticking something in your water and you found out it was a packet of
[28:38.240 --> 28:42.240]  poison or something even you'd get angry you'd yell and scream you'd probably
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.360]  call for the police to come help you or you might be mad enough to actually
[28:46.360 --> 28:52.640]  punch them in the nose and tackle them and put them in a headlock but I sit here

[33:24.560 --> 33:30.400]  up the society has gotten and how people from cradle to grave are taught to
[33:30.400 --> 33:35.480]  chase after things that don't matter that are like fishing lures we're not
[33:35.480 --> 33:39.120]  just mindless little fish that run up and grab a purple worm or a topwater
[33:39.120 --> 33:46.440]  minnow bait because it looks like it's real we should be able to be smart
[33:46.440 --> 33:53.040]  enough to analyze it and see the manipulation an example is these reports
[33:53.040 --> 34:00.480]  all over the country of brawls and riots and riot police and smoke and
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.680]  panicking people stampeding each other and hundreds of teenagers running a
[34:05.680 --> 34:12.320]  muck at a food court brawl just crazily that wanting their Air Jordans and
[34:12.320 --> 34:19.360]  hearing that some rapper might have been at the mall so they descend into
[34:19.360 --> 34:32.240]  absolute insanity thinking that they're gonna be fulfilled by chasing after
[34:32.240 --> 34:41.720]  garbage it is it is a false plastic culture that has been forced into these
[34:41.720 --> 34:47.440]  people and the individuals that are growing up like this it acting like
[34:47.440 --> 34:52.240]  this there's major studies out where the the language has already been reduced
[34:52.240 --> 34:56.880]  massively most of these teenagers you try to talk to them can't even talk or
[34:56.880 --> 35:07.720]  if they do it's gibberish verbal versions of text messages we are being
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.280]  scientifically reduced scientifically dumbed out in fact if you guys will give

[35:42.280 --> 35:46.960]  we have a special report with all the documentation coming out Thursday or
[35:46.960 --> 35:52.480]  Friday that Aaron Dykes and I are working on a video slash text report that
[35:52.480 --> 35:58.440]  we are putting together you see this article from a week ago CBS News CBS
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.640]  Nightly News and there were literally hundreds of these going off the same script
[36:02.640 --> 36:07.680]  the same talking points it says Ron Paul disavows racist newsletters under his
[36:07.680 --> 36:15.240]  name okay and of course you read in here it's supplement letters it's little
[36:15.240 --> 36:18.760]  promo letters by the company he had hired to promote his newsletters to
[36:18.760 --> 36:23.720]  different newsletter list that would you know make comments about yeah the people
[36:23.720 --> 36:29.520]  quit rioting when their welfare checks you know arrive and stuff like that so
[36:29.520 --> 36:33.440]  they try to make it of this whole issue the racism isn't blowing up brown
[36:33.440 --> 36:39.160]  people all over the world no no no or no no it's it's just digging up some 25
[36:39.160 --> 36:42.760]  year old newsletter and making a giant to do about it and then asking him over
[36:42.760 --> 36:45.880]  and over again to answer the question even when he's in an interview and
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.360]  answers it three times they say answer it you won't answer it and then he answers
[36:49.360 --> 36:53.680]  it again then they cut back to CNN and they say well he wouldn't answer it but
[36:53.680 --> 37:01.000]  that's not why I'm getting into this right now in this article they say and
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.360]  it's the same in hundreds of these that Paul's willingness to appear on the
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.440]  radio program of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and remember conspiracy
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.560]  theorist means someone not buying what confirmed liars who've been caught
[37:14.560 --> 37:20.080]  lying thousands of times and caught putting poison in the water and giving
[37:20.080 --> 37:26.360]  black men syphilis and little kids in in Honduras syphilis and last year giving
[37:26.360 --> 37:32.800]  kids all over the world in polio vaccines live polio and killing them not
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.080]  trusting those people a government caught shipping drugs in thousands of
[37:37.080 --> 37:41.360]  times a government caught shipping guns into Mexico caught blowing up Oklahoma
[37:41.360 --> 37:51.480]  City conspiracy theorist means a sane person oh look 72% of cities
[37:51.480 --> 37:54.800]  floored at their water and if you look at what's in the so-called fluoride and
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.680]  almost every case has got radioactive isotopes from the limestone where they
[37:59.680 --> 38:09.480]  mine this oh gee that that's that's bad news see see I know that the American
[38:09.480 --> 38:13.040]  Medical Association was forced to admit that fluoride fractures your teeth and
[38:13.040 --> 38:16.040]  causes dental fluorosis and the American Dental Association was forced to
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.520]  admit it six years ago as well I knew back when I got made fun of that
[38:20.520 --> 38:26.760]  bisphenol a was massively increasing different forms of cancers in in in
[38:26.760 --> 38:34.520]  sexual tissue ovaries testicles breast things like that prostates because I had
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.000]  the hundreds and hundreds of mainline university studies then because I
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.040]  interview the top scientists here every day like dr. Busby that's coming up in
[38:42.040 --> 38:52.840]  the next hour you see so I'm aware of all of this information I know what's
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.200]  going on I've got my head screwed on straight but hey what do they care to
[38:56.200 --> 39:02.680]  their readers oh Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist I watch the reactor
[39:02.680 --> 39:08.320]  three mox plutonium reactor blows sky high ejecting fuel rods I went and blew
[39:08.320 --> 39:12.600]  up the plans of it online blew it up researched it got top scientist on I
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.880]  said dr. Busby and others that looks like fuel rods going sky high and they
[39:17.880 --> 39:21.280]  said they were storing hundreds of thousands of them over 200,000 of the
[39:21.280 --> 39:27.080]  of the 600 plus thousand that were stored there on top of that mox 3 and he
[39:27.080 --> 39:30.360]  said yes those are fuel rods being blown sky high and then I talked to other
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.000]  experts and had them on former head of the Star Wars program had him study the
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.440]  video for us then we had top radiologist on and radiation experts who studied the
[39:41.440 --> 39:45.000]  isotope readings coming out of there and said this means fission is taking place
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.920]  meltdown the containment cores have been breached and then months later it came
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.920]  out five of the six containments breached some of them melted out and had
[39:54.920 --> 40:00.560]  complete meltdown and further explosions but it's just off the news and I'm the
[40:00.560 --> 40:05.160]  conspiracy theorist when the environmental protection agency raises
[40:05.160 --> 40:11.840]  the level of radiation in some cases thousands of times what it previously
[40:11.840 --> 40:17.760]  was depending on the isotope I say you know they said this lower level was not
[40:17.760 --> 40:21.680]  safe now they're saying a higher level safe that's just waving a magic wand
[40:21.680 --> 40:28.440]  because I have a tiny thimble of critical thinking I am a conspiracy
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.760]  theorist hey over the Pentagon says they want to put troops on the streets so
[40:33.760 --> 40:38.240]  here's the Army times there's stars and stripes shut up conspiracy theorist no
[40:38.240 --> 40:41.000]  it's the government says they're going to be patrolling America with the
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.880]  military shut up crazy man but I mean it's in the stars and stripes now they've
[40:47.880 --> 40:52.960]  passed the NDAA to have the military arrest you and you disappear forever and
[40:52.960 --> 40:57.200]  I can play five senators that authored the bill saying that's what it does and
[40:57.200 --> 41:02.520]  it says it in clear English and they've got articles out in the news today saying
[41:02.520 --> 41:11.040]  I'm a conspiracy theorist because I know how to read this is their response
[41:11.040 --> 41:15.640]  because they know the public more and more is like the snot nose teenagers who
[41:15.640 --> 41:20.040]  can't even talk text messaging each other running around who feel totally
[41:20.040 --> 41:24.600]  empty but if they could just see a celebrity their life would be made it
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.040]  would be like if they could just find a unicorn it doesn't do anything to meet
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.000]  a celebrity it doesn't do anything they're just like other people now there
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.920]  are painters and artists and musicians and people I'd love to meet but not
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.000]  because they're a celebrity because they're an interesting person and they
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.080]  have celebrity because of their talent but more and more these celebrities it's
[41:46.080 --> 41:51.040]  not even that they're purely manufactured crud to sell an agenda and
[41:51.040 --> 41:57.080]  you've got people rioting to buy overpriced shoes that are ugly and
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.120]  people are teaching their kids I love you because I got you this I got you a
[42:02.120 --> 42:07.480]  connect Microsoft that spies on you so you can live in a fantasy land with your
[42:07.480 --> 42:12.560]  friends and be a space captain who beats aliens all day while a real world and a
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.320]  real war is going on against each and every one of us and the future destiny
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.720]  of this species is being decided and we have a nation of a bunch of adult
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.120]  arrested development men and women and I'll tell you why because they're jacking
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.000]  the food and water with chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals and they
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.800]  are jacking our psyche with propaganda and mind-numbing trash and the brain
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.040]  waves are lower in the Western world now the average person is in a dream state
[42:42.040 --> 42:48.200]  and I am here to break you out of it if you're giggling hearing this right now
[42:48.200 --> 42:54.360]  it's because you've been pre-programmed pal now listen to this article listen to
[42:54.360 --> 43:00.200]  CBS News the reporter tied the newsletters to Paul's willingness to
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.000]  appear on the radio program of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones forget
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.080]  everything I say forget me saying it's wrong to torture people's children in
[43:08.080 --> 43:14.200]  front of them army's own report army report on Abu Ghraib just type that in
[43:14.200 --> 43:19.160]  read it if you've got the will how they raped the kids with the battery acid oh
[43:19.160 --> 43:25.480]  yeah hellraiser type Jeffrey Dahmer couldn't didn't doesn't even approach it
[43:25.480 --> 43:31.240]  and murdering children and murdering people's wives and that's what we signed
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.800]  on to and you're worried about Iran you better be worried about the globalist
[43:35.800 --> 43:42.200]  who see us as animals as lower than then then then then then rat droppings it
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.120]  goes on Paul's willingness to appear on the radio program of conspiracy theorist
[43:47.120 --> 43:53.560]  Alex Jones who reportedly accused the government of encouraging homosexuality
[43:53.560 --> 43:59.320]  with chemicals so that people don't have children he noted that Paul seemed
[43:59.320 --> 44:06.600]  to open to Jones suggestion that the military north com combatant command is
[44:06.600 --> 44:11.640]  taking over the nation gee that's what a command is is a war zone they say
[44:11.640 --> 44:14.800]  they're gonna operate they're gonna arrest citizens they're now running
[44:14.800 --> 44:20.120]  military checkpoints everywhere with TSA and this remember the CBS is saying I'm
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.560]  crazy while the NDAA and all of this is one of the hottest topics in the news
[44:25.560 --> 44:31.080]  all of this is happening now and I'm more of a kook because world
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.120]  governments being announced by the very banks we said that would run it through
[44:34.120 --> 44:42.600]  the derivatives exactly as we said not hard it's all trilateral CFR plans I'm
[44:42.600 --> 44:47.160]  more of a kook because they now admit that BPA is sterilizing people and
[44:47.160 --> 44:51.760]  making men feminine and women hyper feminine and giving him cancer I'm more
[44:51.760 --> 44:55.640]  of a kook because they're now putting the TSA and the troops on the streets I'm
[44:55.640 --> 45:00.640]  more of a kook because I'm right and I'm accurate and I'm real and I've studied
[45:00.640 --> 45:05.000]  history and I know what I'm talking about and what's even more frustrating is
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.680]  when you find out this propaganda is for people who are in a trance you read it
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.000]  you're like but all of this is admitted how am I a conspiracy theorist how do
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.920]  they sit up there with this moral judgment and if they say it isn't real it
[45:17.920 --> 45:26.760]  isn't how do they do that they do it with childlike gullible people who they
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.200]  have nothing but disdain and hatred for who watch this is a transcript of CBS
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.760]  nightly news who sit there and watch it and think oh and feel good about
[45:35.760 --> 45:40.920]  themselves I'm not a theorist like Alex Jones I trust my government honey get me
[45:40.920 --> 45:48.320]  a big brimming cup of that tap water stick me a BPA lined TV dinner the
[45:48.320 --> 45:52.240]  microwave and heated up so I get a mega dose of it and give me some powdered eggs
[45:52.240 --> 45:58.520]  that are that are that are 200 parts per million fluoride in it total brain
[45:58.520 --> 46:03.400]  damaging rat poison give me some of that baby because I'm not going to listen to
[46:03.400 --> 46:10.280]  that bad man the good news is more and more people aren't listening to this
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.000]  enter enter enter kind of waking up from the trance at least partially so that's
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.520]  why they're coming out with the SOPA bill which by the way inventors of the
[46:19.520 --> 46:24.200]  internet Google yahoo all of them admit yes it's the end of the internet and the
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.040]  selective shutdown Chinese style censorship it's selective internet kill
[46:28.040 --> 46:31.840]  switch and cast sunset the White House says they will shut down people that
[46:31.840 --> 46:38.560]  don't believe man made global warming is real I mean see see see here's the thing
[46:38.560 --> 46:45.640]  we now live in the paradox where it's all happening but the system has such
[46:45.640 --> 46:49.840]  disdain they say it's not happening like they're a magician and they've hypnotized
[46:49.840 --> 46:56.080]  people I mean it'd be so easy just to wake up see what they're doing the little
[46:56.080 --> 46:59.640]  man behind the curtain now the reason I get into that is this one line has been
[46:59.640 --> 47:03.560]  a talking point for about three years and I figured it out they're really scared
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.200]  of this because their big enchilada is the hormonal manipulation they've got
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.520]  electrical going on as well dr. baggage breaks that down but this
[47:14.520 --> 47:19.840]  hormonal agenda is everywhere in their literature and it's everywhere in the
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.520]  products in the printer ink and the tin can linings and the coke can linings in
[47:24.520 --> 47:31.160]  the Pepsi can linings in the juice box linings it's everywhere and that's why
[47:31.160 --> 47:36.320]  men are feminized that's why breast cancer is off the charts one of the big
[47:36.320 --> 47:39.680]  drivers the US is number one in the world and growing and there's never a
[47:39.680 --> 47:45.520]  discussion about how do we why is it increasing what's causing breast cancer
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.480]  to go out the charts what's causing lung cancer go out the charts even though
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.560]  smoking the last 30 years is reduced what's causing obesity to go up even
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.040]  though people are actually eating less they did 50 years ago do you know that
[47:56.040 --> 48:02.320]  what is causing all of this and it's because it's the additives folks and
[48:02.320 --> 48:08.120]  it's not just to make it taste good it's there to add dick to you this is a
[48:08.120 --> 48:15.040]  chemical warfare attack it's a brave new world but they don't have you like THX
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.200]  1138 lineup for your government does drugs every day they do that with the
[48:18.200 --> 48:27.360]  kids now that's the major plan it's in everything and so here is CBS News and
[48:27.360 --> 48:30.680]  hundreds of other publications last week in this week we have a document cam
[48:30.680 --> 48:35.640]  shot please going over this and saying Alex says the government's putting
[48:35.640 --> 48:45.000]  stuff in the water to make people gay and of course they don't get into the
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.480]  facts here of my original reports that they boil down to something you know
[48:49.480 --> 48:53.360]  that sounds silly here is a memorandum this is this is on record this is
[48:53.360 --> 48:58.080]  Library of Congress to the World Population Council the Population
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.520]  Council the global Planned Parenthood from the head of Planned Parenthood
[49:02.520 --> 49:12.640]  1969 and published to the full group in 1970 and they say to reduce population
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.680]  encourage increased homosexuality you see that right there like zoom in even
[49:16.680 --> 49:22.400]  more for him please increased
[49:22.720 --> 49:29.640]  encourage increased homosexuality you see that you see this isn't some moral
[49:29.640 --> 49:33.680]  judgment about what somebody does sexually this is the point that men
[49:33.680 --> 49:38.560]  have lower sperm counts this is science men have higher estrogen men's
[49:38.560 --> 49:42.400]  genitalia size in the last few decades has gotten smaller all these studies are
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.480]  out there men's cancer is increasing just from bisphenol alone and guess what
[49:47.480 --> 49:53.160]  that's only one of many fertility control agents in water supply that's the
[49:53.160 --> 49:58.400]  next point what is the White House science are called for in two books he's
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.720]  written eco science and others but the stuff in the water to sterilize you look
[50:03.720 --> 50:10.480]  at the sperm count dropping and then you say yeah but look at the so-called
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.720]  minority population exploding they say they're going after those folks some
[50:14.720 --> 50:18.400]  people are racist I think that's a good idea when you get deeper into eugenics
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.720]  they're actually targeting groups that are seen as more intelligent they want
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.360]  to wipe out their competition just like a grizzly bear will eat male cubs or a
[50:27.360 --> 50:35.320]  lion will eat male cubs sometimes male whales will go and hold a baby male
[50:35.320 --> 50:42.240]  under till they die that's what's really going on that's who they're really
[50:42.240 --> 50:45.960]  targeting in their own manuals and I have the manuals right here children
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.360]  that show high intelligence that are males and aggressive and won't be
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.880]  followers brain damage them and that's what they do and it is the ultimate six
[50:54.880 --> 50:58.120]  society we're going to read more of these documents straight ahead stay with

[54:33.160 --> 54:36.880]  to talk about how horrible Newt Yenrich is and Mitt Romney but they're all just
[54:36.880 --> 54:41.640]  window dressing Ron Paul isn't window dressing that's why they're coming
[54:41.640 --> 54:47.960]  after him but Ron Paul himself is just a doorway into reality the rabbit hole goes
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.720]  a lot deeper I mean Ron Paul is being criticized for in one of those news
[54:52.720 --> 54:56.640]  letters talking about you know could could governments have been involved and
[54:56.640 --> 55:00.440]  he reportedly wrote you know one of his Jewish friends told him he thought Israel
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.720]  was behind it well I mean it was in the New York Times and CBS News that the FBI
[55:06.720 --> 55:12.320]  ran the whole thing we know the names we have the recordings of it it's public
[55:12.320 --> 55:19.880]  but again that's a conspiracy theory to have New York Times CBS News it's on
[55:19.880 --> 55:28.640]  record it's in my film Road to Tyranny and so I'm here and I've got look at all
[55:28.640 --> 55:32.960]  these documents for folks that are watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv if
[55:32.960 --> 55:35.600]  you're listening on the radio the next few days we're going to do a whole
[55:35.600 --> 55:39.080]  report we've already shot the report to be put together right now that'll be on
[55:39.080 --> 55:42.560]  YouTube and everywhere else for everybody to see it for those that can't
[55:42.560 --> 55:49.680]  see I've got about 50 documents or so here government documents I've got you
[55:49.680 --> 55:55.280]  in UNESCO documents here about destroying the family this is taught in the
[55:55.280 --> 56:01.440]  entire Western world when your government is signed on to UNESCO we'll
[56:01.440 --> 56:08.160]  show people right here when you're signed on to the UN and you're signed on to
[56:08.160 --> 56:16.440]  UNESCO this is in teacher training and it says UNESCO initially attempted to
[56:16.440 --> 56:21.200]  impose its international curriculum to prepare students for world government in
[56:21.200 --> 56:27.560]  1949 using a 10-part series teachers titled Towards World Understanding which
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.400]  stated one of its chief aims of education today should be prepare boys and
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.840]  girls to take active part in the creation of a world society it also
[56:35.840 --> 56:40.440]  stated I'm quoting as long as the child breathes with a poison air of nationalism
[56:40.440 --> 56:46.080]  they say the same thing about the family education and world-mindedness can
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.880]  produce only precarious results as we have pointed out it is frequently the
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.120]  family that infects the child with extreme nationalism the school should
[56:55.120 --> 56:59.120]  therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes that
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.240]  favor jingoism now this is the corporate global government wants to get rid of
[57:04.240 --> 57:09.560]  your government because it's a firewall to them in case they can't fully take it
[57:09.560 --> 57:15.800]  over like they've done the US government and it goes through it all but here is
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.360]  Planned Parenthood in a report for the Population Council that advises the UN
[57:20.360 --> 57:25.480]  and you notice this was implemented in China compulsory abortion of out of
[57:25.480 --> 57:29.840]  wedlock pregnancies compulsory sterilization of all who have had two
[57:29.840 --> 57:34.720]  children payments to encourage abortion the in Travis County where I live they
[57:34.720 --> 57:39.040]  make well now I moved out of Travis County actually a woman point is you
[57:39.040 --> 57:48.040]  you you pay taxes to pay for abortions discouragement of private home ownership
[57:48.040 --> 57:52.640]  they've got other lines in here eliminate welfare payments for first two
[57:52.640 --> 58:00.440]  children and it goes on to here to say encourage women to work read this right
[58:00.440 --> 58:09.440]  here encourage women to work glorious China Miss magazine on record CIA not to
[58:09.440 --> 58:15.120]  empower women but to make the state their pimp so they're working full-time so
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.640]  the state gets the kids so the house is a mess everything falls apart so the kids
[58:19.640 --> 58:23.280]  get on drugs so the state can be the mommy and daddy and brainwash the kids
[58:23.280 --> 58:27.640]  and turn them against them here it is just what we saw in Soviet Russia in
[58:27.640 --> 58:32.640]  Cuba and Communist China and it's our government and it's the UN pushing it
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.200]  because the corporations can't have families they want a bunch of mindless

[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:31.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.320]  look the system wants you docile the reason a lot of people can't get angry
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:42.520]  is because the additives in the food and water have rendered you down into
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:53.760]  basically flaccid jellyfish like little servile drones myself included and
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:58.160]  that's why men aren't men women aren't women people say whatever happened today
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:03.960]  when men were went you know men women were women cars were cars whatever
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:08.120]  happened to that it's called living under a eugenics system in fact Aaron just
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:11.200]  ran her in the break and he said you know in my article I wrote last week
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:15.760]  about China taking the children and the property of people that have more than
[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:23.200]  two children I put a link to you know US government training videos from the
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:29.280]  70s in China where it shows a inspector that comes by and make sure that the
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:33.280]  women are on their menstrual cycles and make sure they take their birth control
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:38.280]  pills little inspectors I mean everything in this 1969 plan was
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:42.920]  implemented in China as the model and they told that dictatorship will give
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:46.840]  you all this power and move everything to your country if you'll be the model
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:50.920]  and then using your giant workforce you will be able to leverage the whole
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:56.640]  world to accept this new system through economic warfare this is the heart of it
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:03.200]  and I get up here with detailed reports about breast cancer several thousand
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:06.600]  percentage point increased the last 50 years the highest in the world in the
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:10.120]  US and it follows according to the industrialization the bisphenol and
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:13.320]  the rest of it and I get up here and I show the reports where they want to
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:19.720]  encourage homosexuality so you don't have families and you see the TV
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:24.040]  messages making fun of families making fun of kids making fun of people that
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:28.800]  have children we're the ones under attack it's it's the establishment that's
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:34.360]  bigoted against us in a cold system to get rid of the family and then then they
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:38.400]  add chemicals to the food and water and the printer ink the bisphenol a to do
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:43.240]  this here's more of the documents encourage women to work and then we have
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:48.160]  all the different documents miss magazines CIA all about breaking up the
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:53.160]  family and then look where women are today totally unhappy turn into absolute
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:58.920]  sexual objects like they've never been before now I'm gonna go there's some more
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:01.640]  of these documents
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:07.200]  this one Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure and sterility International
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:13.680]  Journal of Bioethical Sciences here's people rioting for a woman's face slash
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:17.760]  men beaten and robbed for Air Jordans we'll zoom in on some of these documents
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:31.080]  there FDA faulted for stance on chemical in plastics is that camera going
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:33.480]  closer
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.520]  FDA faulted for stance on chemical plastics again this is four years ago
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:41.920]  when they were trying to bamboozle the public and not at least admit that it's
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:49.480]  sterilizing people in cars and a carcinogen here's another one synthetic
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:55.760]  estrogen BPA coats cash receipts cash registered receipts and then it gets into
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:01.840]  the chemical being 30% higher in retail workers that's linked to a report from
[1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:05.440]  the Centers for Disease Control in fact here's that Centers for Disease Control
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:10.440]  report and you know what CBS does they just say conspiracy theory show one of
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:15.040]  it increases cancer massively show one of it lowers your testosterone and turns
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:19.140]  men into feminine creatures and hyper feminizes women and burns out their
[1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:27.760]  sexual tissues but it didn't stop the truth from happening and coming out in
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:36.480]  October of 2010 Canada declares BPA toxic move towards bans on it so that's
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.800]  just some of it we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back with dr. Busby and

[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:54.840]  major issue because it's so outrageous if people just get the facts and get the
[1:04:54.840 --> 1:05:00.800]  word out these globalists will fall people got to face the horror of them

[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:10.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:14.480]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:19.160]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:23.800]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:28.160]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:33.400]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:37.680]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists

[1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:08.480]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:13.520]  what two or three years ago there was the big melamine scare thousands of
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:18.600]  people died in China from it plastic in the milk because the plastic powder
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:24.160]  could trick the test for the level of protein in it and they executed quite a
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:29.440]  few people for it but when that same powdered milk hit the US the FDA came
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:33.640]  out and said you know what melamine isn't bad for you that's wall street
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:38.560]  journal New York Times you can pull that up FDA says melamine not bad it's this
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:44.520]  magic wand behavior and as you know I don't know six months or so ago radioactive
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:48.240]  isotope levels were going up and so they would raise the different isotope
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.960]  levels depending on what isotope went up from 25 times what it previously was
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:59.520]  25 times that is safe to in some cases 100,000 times and that was on the EPA's
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:04.160]  own website and you know people can laugh at that at government getting so
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:09.120]  delusional that it just waves a wand and says don't take any precautions go
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:12.360]  ahead and just eat the food you know back in Chernobyl for six months they
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:17.080]  said don't eat the food you know ship it in from other countries don't drink
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:22.440]  milk out of Europe but when they found higher levels of radiation in some cases
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:26.200]  a hundred times in the milk they just waved a magic wand and said let your
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:30.680]  kids have it and they found it in Vermont they found it in California all
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:37.880]  over the country and now all that radioactive waste and the stuff from
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:42.200]  the tsunami is hitting the west coast Geiger counters are going crazy but
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:46.360]  government says don't worry it's not bad for you just like for 50 years they
[1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:52.080]  kept secret that big salt reactor out in Simi Valley blowing up they kept a
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:56.080]  total meltdown as bigger bigger than Chernobyl secret what else is going on
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:02.560]  we don't know about suddenly Francis had big disasters suddenly in other areas
[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:07.600]  of Europe higher radiation showing up suddenly Canada's having big leaks it's
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:12.960]  like all the sudden since the magic wand was waved who knows maybe they'll
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:16.800]  store reactors in your basement or something and people look at this they
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:21.280]  say it's crazy but look at North Korea that's just in after our guest leaves us
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:24.840]  in about 30 minutes I'm going to break this down more fake wailing millions
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:30.240]  showing up to scream and yell and worship and fake cry because if you
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:36.440]  don't you go to a slave labor camp I mean what a joke but that's what happens
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:40.960]  when people buy into delusion and play along with lies and that's what our own
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:47.720]  elite are doing with all of these issues now joining us is Dr. Busbee
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:53.080]  Christopher Busbee he is a chemical physicist he's advised BBC he's advised
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  EU groups he's a very respected professor University of Ulster in Northern
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:05.000]  Ireland and he joins us today he's got several websites that publishes peer
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.240]  reviewed work you can look at it there but I have to toot his horn in fact
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:11.640]  having him back on we had him on quite a bit there when it was getting a lot of
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:15.400]  attention and the public would actually listen day one he said we have these
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:19.640]  isotope readings this shows there's been meltdown those are reactor rods being
[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:24.240]  blown in the sky this is a cover up this is much worse than Chernobyl and we got
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:27.880]  criticism when he was on people said oh this is fair mongering it couldn't be
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:33.280]  true months after once it wasn't in the news their own top scientists went
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:37.920]  public resigned leaders of Japan resigned they covered it up there's been an
[1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:42.040]  exodus out of central Japan to the south even though the government says it's
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:45.440]  safe the public isn't stupid there's been reported deaths associated with
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:50.560]  radiation poisoning the Fukushima 50 who went in and now it's just out of
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:55.880]  sight out of mind so giving us a report you know as we prepare to leave this
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:12:02.280]  disastrous year 2011 and I'll pull up the date exactly how long ago Fukushima
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:07.640]  was in a moment is Dr. Busbee to recap what happened and then to explain to us
[1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:12.600]  what he thinks may be going on with all these new disasters and where he sees
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:16.560]  this going in the future Dr. Busbee thank you for joining us
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:24.040]  okay well I think people in the future looking back at this event in in Japan
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:29.080]  will recognize that this is probably one of the most serious public health
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:36.200]  accidents like that in the history of the human race the huge amounts of radio
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:40.760]  activity were released and still contaminate very large parts of northern
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.520]  Japan and there has been a probe recently by the Japanese government into
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:49.160]  you know into what happened and I have to say that the probe found that all of my
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:54.640]  predictions right back at the beginning when I was on the BBC and ITN just after
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:58.880]  the accident the catastrophe occurred all of my predictions were
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:02.800]  shown to be accurate although at the time everyone was saying like you said you
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:06.000]  know this is just scaremongering the guy's wrong he's making it up and so on
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.720]  I have to say also that nobody's apologized to me about any of this and
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:14.480]  there's been a definitely hush about about these effects and we learn very
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:18.760]  little about what's really happening at the reactor reactors even now the wrong
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.480]  questions are being asked and no answers are forthcoming and then we get
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:29.880]  twilight zone comments by people in London Guardian saying oh I'm now for
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:35.960]  nuclear power because of Fukushima it's so wondrous and I mean it's it's
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:42.120]  so bizarre yes well that guy George Mombio he actually took it into his head
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:46.800]  to attack me personally from the columns of the Guardian two weeks running and
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:53.000]  raked out an awful lot of scurrilous nonsense and lies and so on about me
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.840]  personally I was I was quite irritated by all of that and there's not much I can do
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:00.880]  about it and the Guardian newspaper have refused to well they haven't allowed me to
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:06.280]  make any sort of response so it seemed to me that this was part of the general
[1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:11.520]  operation that was taking place worldwide to try and push nuclear as an
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:17.280]  option to solve all of the problems relating to the energy supply to modern
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:21.600]  civilization but my my my my concern about all this is that the modern
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:25.400]  civilization that they're trying to fuel is something that is very bad for the
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:29.560]  people who live within it you know it's actually killing people that the system
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:34.240]  itself which is which is something that you you talk about a lot and but I'm
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:38.040]  absolutely with you that the system itself is not sustainable it just
[1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:43.280]  absolutely isn't and something has to be done and not not just about nuclear power
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:46.680]  but about the whole the whole economic structure of the system and the power
[1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:51.760]  structure within it before everybody in the world you know just doesn't survive
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:56.840]  it's quite terrifying well I mean here's an example 30 years ago and I've talked
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:01.520]  to top economists on this subject the US and British governments and others
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:06.280]  gave out pretty accurate economic numbers on unemployment on inflation now
[1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:09.920]  they just put out completely fake numbers they say unemployment's 8.9
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:17.080]  it's really 22 plus they say inflation 3% it's really 11 or more and I mean it
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:22.640]  it's almost a insanity by the ruling class now where their children are
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:28.600]  breathing this radiation and I mean in in Chernobyl in 86 they made a real
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:32.080]  effort as you know to keep people from eating the food and and drinking the
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.040]  milk for at least six months to mitigate some of it now there's not even an
[1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:41.520]  attempt yes that's right the Soviets everyone at the beginning of this
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:45.360]  Fukushima catastrophe we're talking about how it wasn't anything like
[1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:50.040]  Chernobyl actually the Soviet authorities evacuated people from
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:54.520]  Chernobyl very quickly and they did then they really did do their best what we
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:16:05.280]  see here is an almost totally cynical and criminal set of policies which which
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:10.640]  are sacrificing an enormous number of people to a kind of God of nuclear
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:15.040]  futures and I'm not quite sure how it happens because people ask me again and
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:18.640]  again they say you know how is it that these people don't recognize that they
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:21.920]  themselves and their children will suffer the consequences of these
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:25.560]  exposures but it does seem as if they don't it seems as if there's some kind of
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:32.360]  zombification or or Sovietization of history in the West now where the big
[1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:37.280]  newspapers and I include the Guardian where George Bombio was writing his
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:43.600]  pieces having been converted to nuclear they seem to have become part of a
[1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:47.880]  an appalling sort of cover-up system right rather like you know the worst days
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:55.000]  of Stalin it's really hard to know where this is all going you've really put in a
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:00.440]  good verbal description of it it of something that is indescribably insane
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:05.040]  but but breaking down the real history which they now admit for those that don't
[1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:09.400]  know because it's been buried what really happened if we go back to the
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:16.440]  tsunami March 11th 9 almost 10 months ago 2011 what really happened with those
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:22.200]  six reactors okay well what as far as we can tell what happened with this there
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:29.560]  was an enormously powerful earthquake and that the earthquake caused damage to
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:34.040]  the reactors before the tsunami hit and this damaged the reactors cut off the
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:38.120]  cooling supply to the reactors and so of course they started to melt they started
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:42.480]  to boil and the water boiled away and then the rods started to melt down now
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:47.040]  the story is that in fact they shut they went into cold shutdown
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:53.000]  automatically at the time of the earthquake and then what happened was
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.400]  that the backup generators the systems that were supposed to continue to provide
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:02.760]  cooling were wiped out by the by the water from the tsunami it actually
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:06.440]  really doesn't matter that much which of those is correct because what then
[1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:11.240]  happened was that they were in my opinion nuclear explosions and hydrogen
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:15.280]  explosions which which effectively destroyed most of those reactors in the
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:19.280]  first week and we can tell that from levels of radioactivity that were
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:24.640]  measured in various detectors quite far to the south of Tokyo you can you can
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:30.280]  see the levels of radiation increasing and staying high in the week
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:35.480]  following on the Monday following following the the tsunami so we know
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:39.600]  even at that time that the reactor that melted down but all about that time the
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:43.520]  International Atomic Energy Agency and TEPCO and the Japanese government were
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:46.920]  still telling people that there was no problem that the reactor pressure
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:50.800]  vessels were intact and so forth it was clear to me looking at the video
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:55.160]  footage on YouTube and in fact isn't it interestingly depressing that we have to
[1:18:55.160 --> 1:18:59.360]  now get our accurate news from YouTube rather than from the newspapers but
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:03.320]  looking at the video footage on YouTube you can see that the force of the explosion
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:06.320]  at least in reactor number three was so great that it couldn't possibly be a
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:10.000]  hydrogen explosion and at that time I was saying it was a nuclear explosion
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.520]  like the Chernobyl explosion and by the way I've had people on the show who
[1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:17.160]  aren't physicists and they just say oh that's impossible but I've talked to
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:22.240]  other physicists and they say no that that that things can purify out into
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:27.040]  levels and that you can get smaller explosions and here you are you know
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:30.400]  you're an acclaimed physicist you're saying this can happen but the media
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:32.360]  went along with it and said that can't happen
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:37.360]  no I know they said it couldn't happen but there was a very famous British physicist who was talking
[1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:43.080]  talked about the famous explosion that pushed him in Chelyabinsk in 1959 which was
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:48.200]  similar a similar explosion in a spent fuel bond and he said that couldn't happen either
[1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:51.480]  but it did happen and I think the way in which it happens is that when these
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:55.080]  when these say what stay there this is riveting stay there dr. Bosie will come
[1:19:55.080 --> 1:19:59.240]  back talk more about Fukushima what's currently happening there and then we'll

[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:19.520]  North Korea the Iran situation the economy it is all coming up and then
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:25.240]  we've got joining us Lindsay Williams and we'll take phone calls while he's on
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:30.840]  with us by the way dr. Busby you were getting into how nuclear explosions can
[1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:34.440]  take place and of course after you first reported this they did pick up the
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:38.480]  isotopes that they had to admit will only happen during those type of
[1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:48.360]  explosions my point that I would make is this
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:52.160]  is that actually you have put it in one at least in the reactor that way I think
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:56.240]  there was a new explosion you have plutonium and uranium mixed together
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:59.760]  now if the temperature gets high enough and what happens is that one of those
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:02.600]  will disappear off at a different temperature and then concentrate at a
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:07.560]  cooler part of the reactor vessel or the tank that this is contained in and of
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:11.600]  course it only needs to have a few kilograms of that to form a critical
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:16.400]  mass and then you've got an atom bomb so there's a mechanism that's quite easy
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:20.600]  to explain it's it's exactly like distilling alcohol and water you're
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:24.080]  distilling plutonium and uranium but just at a much higher temperature and so
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:29.680]  then when all the alcohol stroke plutonium comes together in one place bang and
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:32.960]  you've also got explosions going on around it that could be the precursor
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:38.760]  explosion there's an awful lot that we don't know about what goes on in these
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.120]  sort of situations and I think the fact is that the scientists don't either and
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.440]  this brings me to a point that I would like to quickly make is which is that
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:50.080]  physicists deal with mathematics and they reduce the whole world into very
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:55.680]  simplistic equations which they believe are capable of explaining the world
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:59.040]  but actually very often they find that they aren't because they haven't put
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:02.520]  something in the equation that they didn't think of chaos theory well
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:06.720]  absolutely all sorts of stuff I mean we just remember that physicists have lost
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:11.000]  95% of the universe they call it dark matter they don't know what it is so
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.960]  whether we should believe physicists or not when they talk to us about nuclear
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:17.680]  power stations and all the calculations is a very interesting question well they
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:23.080]  proven from sure as you know doctor there's now been Nobel Prizes handed
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:26.720]  out proving that when you have these black holes you have these quasars you
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:31.080]  have these exploding suns that they're finding that the energy isn't there for
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:35.240]  that and that it is dark matter exactly but dark matter is a bit like just
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:39.920]  invoking a demon you know you put together a whole lot of equations and you say this
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:43.560]  will give us the answer and you find it only gives you five percent of the answer
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:47.040]  you say well the rest of it is a demon but I know you call it the dark and call it
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:50.400]  dark matter but it's not a lot different from Holy Mother Church at the time of
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:56.240]  Galileo as far as I can see yeah man has got a lot of high tech technologies but
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.720]  doesn't even understand most of what's connected to it I think that's true I
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:05.480]  think that the last century was the century of the physicists and it's about
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:09.800]  time we moved away from that and realized that physics is a very powerful tool
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:14.080]  but it's a very reductionist tool and it's about time that people started to think for
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:18.200]  themselves and that they stopped believing in this sort of magical idea that the
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:21.600]  physicist knows what he's talking about because generally speaking he doesn't and
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:25.760]  in the case of radiation and health which was my area he certainly doesn't
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:28.640]  because lots of people are going to die as a result of Fukushima and at the
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:32.800]  moment they're saying nobody is well I've seen reports in Japan though that
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:35.680]  people are dying but they always who work there but they're always saying
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:38.960]  something else did it of course that's what they will say it's exactly what
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:42.800]  they said but we've just had a book incidentally which I hope to plug it's
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.840]  called Fukushima and health what to expect and it's based entirely upon the
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:51.640]  research that was done after Chernobyl so we kind of know what's going to happen
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.200]  at Fukushima and it's already happening I get emails regularly telling me that
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:00.720]  people are just dropping dead in their school children are dropping dead one
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:04.000]  minute they're there then their heart stops and they fall down dead and this is
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:07.880]  exactly what we found in Chernobyl because the cesium gets into the heart muscle
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:11.360]  and it destroys heart muscle and when a certain amount of heart muscle is gone
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:16.480]  the heart is no longer viable then you get a heart attack and die incredible you
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:20.160]  know I wanted to get you back on to give us the latest on Fukushima I didn't
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:23.440]  even know you had a book out but when we come back from break please I want
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:27.320]  people to get it and read it and pass it on to friends so we'll definitely talk
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:30.080]  about the book when we come back we're about to go to break but what's the
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:33.680]  latest because they're claiming that they've stabilized Fukushima but we've
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.400]  heard this quite a bit the last nine months well I think this is discourse
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:42.040]  manipulation I mean stabilized means that it's not any worse than it was when
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:45.600]  they stabilized it but if by that they're somehow saying it's safe they're
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:49.480]  wrong I mean we know that there's in on isotopes are coming out in the last
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:53.720]  month but that show that a very short half-life isotopes that show that it's
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:57.920]  continuing to fish and I think it's pretty certain that the fuel is
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:01.160]  molten and it's gone through the reactor pressure vessel and is in the ground and
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:04.520]  Russia today telling me that there'd be cracks in the ground and steam is coming
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:08.200]  out and so on so we're talking about a very serious situation which they're
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:13.120]  just trying to downplay because they want to limit the damage that it's going
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:18.560]  to cause to the development of nuclear power worldwide well all I know is that
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:22.360]  they've got a history of covering this stuff up and it's not safe well you're
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:27.980]  right there and it's continuing that history well and I wouldn't all just
[1:29:27.980 --> 1:29:30.680]  blame it on physicists and obviously you're a physicist so you can talk
[1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:36.160]  about your own discipline but look 25 years ago they said never use DU in
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:40.880]  war it's deadly it blows back it's a soft kill weapon a delayed kill you can't
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:45.160]  use it and in 91 they just said we're gonna use it and now they just say it's
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:52.520]  good for the troops we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the
[1:29:52.520 --> 1:30:02.480]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know
[1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:06.080]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:10.000]  vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:13.480]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:16.840]  all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:20.600]  could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:25.360]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:29.920]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your
[1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:33.560]  family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified
[1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:37.720]  in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:43.360]  garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:53.840]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real
[1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:58.480]  crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:03.240]  survivalseedbank.com you've heard Alex explaining how the silver lungs
[1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:06.960]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:10.960]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung
[1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:14.480]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:19.320]  in or on the body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the
[1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:23.560]  silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:27.680]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:31.880]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly
[1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:39.080]  to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the
[1:31:39.080 --> 1:31:43.680]  skin and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute

[1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:35.160]  last week which is the way he wants okay we're gonna spend another ten minutes
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:38.480]  or so with dr. Bosby that I'm getting into more of the world news and then
[1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:42.080]  we're gonna get our next guest on and open the phones up for Lindsay Williams
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:46.800]  a promise to getting back to take your calls and recap what his big well
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:49.880]  company exec sources been telling him that's turning out to be very very
[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:52.840]  accurate about a year and a half ago he said they were gonna destabilize the
[1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:57.000]  Middle East and launch a big war but then next it would be China first Iran
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:01.120]  then China we're gonna get into all that coming up with Lindsay Williams
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:04.720]  author Lindsay Williams going back to dr. Christopher Bosby who's a chemical
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:09.560]  physicist and a leading expert on the effects of radiation on humans studying
[1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:13.120]  Chernobyl and other events he was the one that first said this is much bigger
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:17.080]  than Chernobyl and now they admit it's many many many Chernobals but the
[1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:22.000]  response is different but during the break we were discussing why the ruling
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:28.360]  class is so insane and then dr. Bosby you know was getting into that he doesn't
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:32.920]  believe in aliens but one would just say it's almost like aliens wanted to
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:37.400]  destroy the earth or change the habitat but then he expanded and said but it's
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:41.920]  more of just an out-of-control system and I said yeah like Richard Nixon talked
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:46.680]  about the fact that it was like a wild beast a machine an animal the whole
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:52.840]  system and the sum of our actions that we don't even see as bad adds to this
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:59.440]  giant machine I mean take GMO every major study organ failure in the mice the
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:04.880]  rats infertility but their science shows it does have this effect that bugs
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:10.760]  won't eat it and so so what if it does this because the mathematics say we've
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:17.000]  changed this trait so what if it changes all these other traits and as I said
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:22.680]  going to break the craziness is intensifying where I've had dr. physicist
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:28.760]  chemist in his own right dr. Doug Rocky on and their manuals on DU they had the
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:34.400]  50 60 70s 80s and 90s and he wrote the manual on it in the early 90s and he's
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:40.280]  on tomorrow said do you you can't use it because it ignites in that in the barrel
[1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:44.720]  of the cannon or the gun and you breathe it and it will reduce your life
[1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:50.280]  massively it will kill you and we can't use it well they had all this stuff
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:55.400]  stored and they said in 1990 we're gonna go ahead and use it and but then they
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:59.280]  still did some decontamination now they have them at shooting ranges for the
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.880]  military proving grounds bases everywhere they take it off base they use it
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:11.480]  they don't even read manuals now so there is a collective insanity taking
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:14.920]  place I know you're an expert on DU as well dr. Busby but in the time we've
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:18.960]  got tell us about your new book what you were trying to finish up on the Fukushima
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:23.840]  with this collective craziness and then these other disasters now popping up
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:33.200]  that don't even hardly make the news what's happening my new book is called
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:38.200]  Fukushima and health what to expect and you can order it from any bookseller or
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:42.320]  from green audit and what it does is it takes the the whole of the Chernobyl
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:46.160]  accident and all of the research that was carried out by my colleagues on the
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:51.720]  European Committee of Radiation Risk presented at the third international
[1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:56.400]  conference in Lesbos few years ago and it turns that into a predictive machine a
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:01.720]  predictive engine to to say what's going to happen in the people of North Japan
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:05.560]  and stuff that we're already seeing happening so that I think that's quite
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:09.880]  an important thing because that tells us all what is going to happen and it's
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:13.560]  not just cancer what we have what we have with radiation and what we've learned
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:17.760]  in the last 20 years is that these radio nucleides actually just reduce
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:22.120]  lifespan so you will find that there will be a reduction in lifespan in northern
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:26.160]  Japan in the same way as a reduction in lifespan in Belarus and Ukraine and
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:29.560]  those parts that were contaminated and in fact indeed in other parts of the
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:34.280]  world whole ranges of diseases that not conventionally associated with radiation
[1:37:34.280 --> 1:37:38.400]  will increase in their rates so that's the point so Fukushima and health what
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:44.120]  to expect now your second your second question was about the that what's
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:49.640]  happening now Fukushima and the answers we really don't know but I mean in a
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:52.640]  sense when they say they've stabilized it I think probably it's kind of
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:56.360]  stabilized itself I don't think the human being has had much to do with it really
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:01.880]  it's it's it's it's gone out of the out of the reactor into the ground and it's
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:04.960]  sort of generally cooled down to the extent that it's not getting vastly
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:08.520]  worse but it is producing lots of radio nucleides and they are still coming out
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:13.760]  of it and so that area will be will be poisoned for hundreds of years in my
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:17.360]  opinion people should not move back there because it's a very dangerous place to
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:22.000]  be and the contamination all along the coast and in the food is absolutely
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:27.200]  colossal my my advice to the people living there is if they can't get out
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:30.880]  then what they should do is they should they should try and limit the amount of
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:37.640]  food and milk and water that they ingest from that area and also I
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:41.320]  suggested that they take calcium tablets because calcium does actually block the
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:45.280]  access of strontium-90 and uranium to the DNA so that does work plenty of
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:49.480]  studies were done in the 1960s that show that that's that's the case and you can
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:53.440]  buy the calcium tablets in any health food shop so one calcium tablets a day
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:39:00.200]  will help now your third question was about the general mess of it all now
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:04.520]  the simplest answer to that I mean if we were just as Andy tribesmen and we
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:07.320]  didn't know any science and we were just looking at the world and trying to figure
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:12.160]  out what was going on it would be quite easy to conclude that the world had
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:16.480]  been taken over by aliens who were trying to and these aliens intention was to
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:21.160]  change the atmosphere and to kill human beings and of course I mean that's
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:25.560]  nonsense really because that isn't the case but in a political sense it maybe
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:30.880]  isn't the case because as I see it the world has become too complicated and too
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:36.640]  dependent upon mathematical analysis and the problem with mathematical physics
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:41.480]  and mathematical analysis of economics is that it is basically a reductionist
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:46.600]  system it's something that reduces complicated phenomena to very simple
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  phenomena using numbers and the problem is it's wrong because what it does is it
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:57.040]  tries to focus on little bits of the world and then study those to death and
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:02.080]  produce an answer and then try and reassemble it and it's been shown to
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:07.000]  certainly to my mind over the last hundred years that this is resulted in a
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:11.120]  monster it's resulted in the construction of an enormous machine the kind of
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:16.440]  economic system that is destroying the people that is supposed to help it's a
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:20.320]  sort of out of control system and so the question is what to do about it well in
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:23.920]  my opinion it is possible to do something about it we have to split our
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.280]  monster up into little pieces and deal with it separately and one way to do
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:33.520]  it is to reduce it down to nation states again and I'm not a nationalist but
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:38.640]  actually I think that we have to reduce the size of the units in order to make
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:42.640]  the thing more human scale these enormous units like the United States of
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.720]  America and the Europe and China they're just too too large and too
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:52.840]  complicated to deal with so we have to have smaller units well freedom normally
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:59.120]  works in very small decentralized systems I think so I think we need to
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:02.760]  go back to sort of small nation states and I think the United States of the
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:08.960]  unit is too big so there is a website which which I live in Latvia a lot of
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:13.560]  the time which is a very small ex-soviet country in the Baltic and it's got quite a
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:17.080]  large land area and quite a small population and we're trying to set up
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:22.400]  some kind of nation national system there that might be might be a possible
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:26.640]  to perform a model for the kind of thing that I'm talking about and there's a
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:31.080]  website called nationalstate.info which if anybody's interested they can go and
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:35.360]  look at and see the sorts of ideas that we have that will try and bring the whole
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:38.960]  of this monster down to a kind of human scale so it can be dealt with at the
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:43.120]  moment it's just out of control it's like Godzilla it's walking across the
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:49.160]  planet crushing whole populations crushing whole empires crushing towns and
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:53.920]  cities and now we see crushing northern Japan too I think that really is my
[1:41:53.920 --> 1:41:57.880]  answer that's my kind of message to the planet really the thing is out of control
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:02.360]  it's a monster and we have to sort of separate it up into little items so that
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:07.640]  we can produce some sort of human scale response to this otherwise we are all
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:12.680]  doomed in my opinion well I agree with you I mean just take the DU issue where
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:16.760]  their own manuals that we've shown here on air say do not use it it's deadly and
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:21.360]  then they make a political decision to say no it's fine and commit the
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:26.480]  military men and women to slow grueling horrible degenerative deaths
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.560]  yeah and their children too I mean the study that I've just done has looked at
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:37.080]  the the the offspring of the American soldiers in in the Gulf War and their high
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:40.840]  levels of congenital malformation in them as well as the high general congenital
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:44.280]  malformation rates in the Iraqi populations in Fallujah for example yes
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:49.280]  the killing around troops it wasn't Fallujah even major papers reported it
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.960]  was 16 times higher than normal birth defects that's right yeah sure and up
[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:58.160]  to 38 times the cancer too so some very serious things happening there but you
[1:42:58.160 --> 1:43:02.200]  see again we come back to this point about the size of the operation you see
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:09.960]  that the United States government if you like the Pentagon they want to win the
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:14.560]  war they want to prevent them saying from putting all his oil money into euros so
[1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:18.640]  they have to that's their operation you see that's the monster operation and of
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:21.960]  course in order to do that they have to win the war and that I'm had a lot of
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:26.640]  big tanks ex-soviet tanks with armor so they had to take out his tanks so they
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:29.800]  use the Peter's uranium and then of course as a result of that everybody
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:34.240]  suffers but you know that it's a question of what your of what your
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:38.480]  intention is and I think you have we have to reduce the size of the people
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:42.800]  who are operating with the size of the unit and that sort of thing wouldn't
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:48.920]  happen well I agree with you but there was a conscious decision to proliferate
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:53.960]  this and because they just don't care about the troops and they don't care
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:44:03.200]  about themselves it is a almost like a mad scramble for all these government
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:08.520]  contracts and it creates a market for this auction and then in the feeding
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:13.720]  frenzy kind of like sharks and feeding frenzies will will bite and kill each
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:15.840]  other
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:19.680]  interesting thing is that after they discovered the childhood leukemia cluster at
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:23.440]  Sellersfield which is a nuclear site in the United Kingdom there was a mori
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.680]  pole and they went to the hospital of the worker then they said do you think
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:31.360]  you're likely to have a child with childhood leukemia as a result of what
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:36.000]  was submerged and and secondly they said and would you leave your job as a
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:39.960]  result of if you believe this and they said and they all said well a lot of
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:43.920]  them said we do believe that the radiation causes childhood leukemia but
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:48.720]  we will not leave our job because the probability of having no money when we
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:52.040]  leave our job is much greater than the probability of having a child with
[1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:55.640]  childhood leukemia so everybody's keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that it
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:45:00.000]  won't be them and then more and more people don't care I mean I guess it's
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.920]  the analogy of peeing on the swimming pool and if you go to a city pool and
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:10.760]  there's 500 kids a day in it it is literally a stinking urine bath and
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:15.120]  there's so much chlorine in it you can't even swim and now the phenomenon of
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:19.640]  people too lazy and peeing in pools pools everywhere are ruined and it's it's
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:28.600]  kind of the same thing yes yes I tell you it is crazy because I mean some job
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:33.200]  if my child had a one percent chance of getting cancer higher I wouldn't take it
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:37.840]  but people aren't all the same are they I mean if you if you take this idea of
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:42.160]  childhood leukemia and you compare it with being bitten by a snake in in in a
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:46.440]  in a park you know and you said to a mother look the probability of your
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:49.880]  child being bitten by a snake and dying in this park is one in a million would you
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:52.880]  put the child in there she would say no wouldn't she but there is quite a
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:56.560]  difference between men and women in the analysis here and this brings me back to
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:00.520]  my point about rational thought and logic and physics and all the rest of it
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:03.880]  because if you look at the anti-nuclear movement you find that there are many more
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:07.960]  women in the anti-nuclear movement than there are men so it is about ways of
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:13.880]  thinking I have to say well look here's my issue I've studied as a lay person
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:18.160]  talk a lot of experts in nuclear power and certainly there's some newer
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:21.440]  technologies I want to get your view on this in closing and it could be done
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:26.840]  better but the system has shown and these corporations have shown I mean you
[1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:30.680]  take the semi-valley assault reactors you know bigger than Chernobyl blows up
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:36.000]  for 50 years they keep it secret so they've shown that they don't care and
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.880]  they don't even want to try to do it safely and they're crazy and so I mean
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:44.960]  it's kind of like a death penalty I am for the death penalty if it was in a
[1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:51.760]  village 3,000 years ago and 20 people in the village saw somebody kill a child
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:55.760]  well the village takes them hauls them up and hangs them I get that I'm for it
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:00.680]  but when you have a government so corrupt it's been caught framing people
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:05.040]  and a third of those on death row it turns out are innocent I have to be
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:08.720]  against the death penalty because you can't trust the implementation of it
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:29.760]  by a criminal government same thing well yeah we've got not generals even in
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:34.280]  the in the in the back now we've got generals that are sitting in their
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:38.880]  basement you know playing tiddlywinks all the whole world around them is going
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:44.360]  into I mean in closing look at these articles arrest pepper spray gunshots
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:50.360]  brawls and doors pulled off hinges chaos as stores across the US and thousands
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:55.120]  of shoppers scramble for new Nike Air Jordans because the system says this is
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:00.920]  success so people will kill for it meanwhile you see a similar type of
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:06.600]  insanity millions of North Koreans worshiping Kim Jong-il but at least
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:10.080]  there they know it's because they'll be put in a little slave labor camp if they
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:15.280]  don't this Western model of mind control is so much better because they're not
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:20.600]  fake fighting and screaming and crying they really think their life depends on
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:29.200]  some ugly tenacious well you mean the world of
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:35.760]  Russian oh it's already serious you're right it's and again we have this
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:39.680]  delusional thing DU is good for you radiation we're raising the levels
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:43.880]  saying it's safe oh it's not a depression we're gonna give you fake
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:47.560]  economic numbers yes well that's what I said that's the
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:49:08.160]  civilization of modern history well hopefully it bottoms out soon we turn
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:11.280]  the corner but doctor I got a bad feeling it's gonna get a lot worse for it
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:18.360]  turns I agree with you I agree with you it's time to head to the hills I think that's what I've done I yes sir I well
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:22.600]  God bless you we appreciate you coming on and to give folks the name of the book
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:28.560]  one more time it's called Fukushima and health what to expect and it's published
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:33.000]  by green audit books and it's available from all booksellers or from the green
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:39.920]  audit website which is www.greenaudit.org so just email admin at greenaudit.org
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.480]  all right thank you so much sir appreciate it okay cheers to you that
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:48.960]  was a good talk and again ladies and gentlemen reactors blowing up and them
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:52.760]  saying it's not a problem and raising the level of radiation that's safe letting
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:57.840]  troops use DU I'm not for any of the nuclear industry none of it I'm done
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:03.760]  I'm done two years ago I was pro nuke now reality set in the same thing with GMO
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:10.080]  I've looked at the documents I've looked at it it's deadly it's deadly deadly
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:15.240]  deadly and you know what they know it's deadly the last time Busby was on I
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:18.280]  meant to get to this he said many of my colleagues believe they're releasing all
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:21.960]  this radiation on purpose to reduce fertility I should have got him to talk
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:25.080]  about his other colleagues he says I don't know because I can't prove it but
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:31.840]  but if things are out of control the elite then lie to themselves and create
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:37.520]  cosmologies that then oh well this will just reduce fertility let this happen
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:41.760]  but the truth is they're just out of control because there's big giant games
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.640]  of globalists that team up together but none of them can step on each other's
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:51.480]  toes so the most extreme of the elite then set the precedent to make things
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:55.160]  even worse you see what I'm saying we'll be right back with a ton of news got a
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:51:05.360]  guest coming up Lindsey Williams stay with us that's what it sounds like when
[1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:08.800]  a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home

[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:17.000]  watching television with fake TV fake TV is a small electronic device that
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:20.520]  makes the same light as a real television so from outside it looks like
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:24.920]  someone is home watching TV fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but as
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:29.480]  far more convincing to burglars fake TV deters burglars cost far less than an
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:33.080]  alarm and is highly recommended by numerous police departments use it
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:38.000]  anytime you're away from home to order your fake TV for only 3495 go to fake

[1:53:55.680 --> 1:54:06.200]  at wood rope working to keep the world tied together you know it's really pretty
[1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:15.200]  simple the social engineers dangle all these fake politicians out they have
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:20.080]  the same model worldwide that vary only slightly on policies so that you think
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:25.400]  you're making a choice but really they control both outcomes and Carol Quigley
[1:54:25.400 --> 1:54:30.320]  wrote about that back in the 60s top professor for the globalist he said that
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:33.800]  you know political parties should appear different on the surface but really not
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:37.480]  be you know different when it gets down to real policies and that's why you look
[1:54:37.480 --> 1:54:42.000]  at newt genrich and Mitt Romney I mean they are Obama it is the same policies
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.680]  but they call it conservative and criticize Obama it is it is totally fake
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:52.720]  and you try to tell Obama supporters hey he's gonna continue everything Bush did
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:57.920]  and then he comes in and he does it and then conservatives get mad at Obama and
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:05.160]  I'm like well you should love Obama he did everything Bush was doing and it
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:10.720]  it it really is window dressing while we're here debating all of this Aaron
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:13.760]  is in there freaking out digging into documents from the Library of Congress
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:18.880]  where they want a license to have children and how the Western
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:22.480]  government's funded China to do this and he's gonna have it in the reports on
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:25.560]  the nightly news he's in the nightly news tonight we got a big report coming out
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:31.080]  tomorrow on the radio it should be done tomorrow if not to be the Friday on the
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:37.120]  government and industry is poisoning you they are adding chemicals to the food
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:40.560]  and water by design and we have the documents that they're doing it by
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.960]  design and the White House science are as a pioneer of it the current White
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:51.480]  House science are wrote government policy reports on it and they're doing it
[1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:57.640]  this isn't just theoretical and then you see real environmentalism totally
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:03.640]  co-opted by the globalists and reduced down to pay megabanks carbon taxes on
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:09.360]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe oh radiation is good for you and DU is good
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:13.600]  for the troops it's that carbon dioxide my goodness we've got to teach kids
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:18.400]  that's the danger you see they take our real concerns and create counterfeits
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:22.800]  they take our real energies to make a good world and then they shunt it off
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:33.000]  into what they're doing and it's so frustrating that was a very informative
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.440]  talk with dr. Busby at eight after next hour we've got Lindsey Williams joining
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:42.960]  us Ron Paul is maintaining his lead in Iowa public policy polling has come out
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:46.680]  with a bunch of other polls showing it some of them showing widening his lead
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:52.400]  but there's a new spin going that oh my gosh Romney's gaining on him Paul could
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:56.240]  be faltering not true but it could become a shelf of filling prophecy where
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:00.760]  people go well if he's losing I better not be on his bandwagon I want to pick
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:05.280]  whoever the winning team is that's like folks that you know only root for a
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:08.920]  football team once they're in the playoffs it's pointless the whole
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:13.560]  thing's pointless Paul holds slim lead over Romney and first post Christmas
[1:57:13.560 --> 1:57:20.200]  Iowa poll again rich unloads on Paul says he's worse than Obama no you are
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:28.560]  Obama with white skin and you've got all of this and then meanwhile we sit here
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:33.400]  and make fun of North Koreans worshipping their their evil dictators who
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:38.600]  have murdered millions of them they know most North Koreans they've said
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:43.560]  undercover anthropologists and sociologists in the most people know
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:48.240]  they're evil and know they're horrible even the state party apparatus
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:54.560]  apparatchik knows that but they play along with it and that's the danger here
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:58.600]  we can go two ways as things implode people can really wake up decide we
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:02.240]  can stand up and take our country back in our world back or we go the other way
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:08.160]  if people don't hit the barbed wire first as an example to others we're going
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:17.360]  to see the public get more into government worship more delusional and do
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:22.920]  whatever the system says and by any amount of lies and a lot of that's
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.360]  going to happen because under this new planned economy the only jobs there's
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:30.880]  going to be is in homeland security in tattling in spying in grabbing people's
[1:58:30.880 --> 1:58:37.000]  genitals in control-freaking in data mining the military industrial complex

[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:23.480]  Alex Jones
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:37.400]  okay I'm gonna try in this segment the next to shut up and give Lindsay Williams
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:41.360]  the floor he doesn't need much introduction here for our audience on
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:46.120]  AM and FM and XM but he was a pastor worked with some of the largest oil
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:49.040]  companies for three years and was brought into their board of directors
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:53.880]  meetings as a liaison to the Roughnecks and he wrote the best-seller energy
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:57.480]  non-crisis which has now been borne out that they have more oil than Saudi Arabia
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:04.720]  and Alaska discovered now one of his sources died last Christmas you know a
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:09.360]  year plus ago not this Christmas last week but a year before that and so he
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:13.480]  was able to go public with his name Mr. Fromm I know who the other source is a
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:17.280]  former CEO of a major oil company and he told him a year and a half ago he said
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:21.420]  watch the Middle East blow up I want him to recap the history of this in this
[2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:24.960]  short segment and come back he's got some more breaking news from his source
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.680]  he said they're trying to prod Iran into war that's where all this is going a
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:34.600]  pastor Williams thanks for joining us Alex thank you for allowing me the
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:40.040]  privilege of joining you today because I was given something a few days ago by
[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:46.200]  my elitist friend and he said I want you to go to a certain place and he said
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:51.640]  whenever you go there you will know what's going to happen next now when we
[2:01:51.640 --> 2:01:55.640]  come into this next segment I'm going to give you this and the reason I'm
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:00.960]  capping it ahead of time is to beg and plead with every person out in the
[2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:07.320]  audience of GPN and info was to go and get a piece of paper and a pencil you
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:12.560]  must write down what this man gave me when he said you go to this certain
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:18.440]  place and you will know what's going to happen next and this is going to impact
[2:02:18.440 --> 2:02:25.120]  the life of you Alex Jones it's going to impact the GPN as nothing ever has
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:29.680]  before it's going to impact my life and the life of every American out there as
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:35.720]  nothing ever has in your lifetime and I feel so honored that God years ago
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:40.280]  would have allowed me by his providence to live with the elite to know some of
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:45.320]  these people over these years and now I honestly believe Alex that they are
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:49.600]  clearing their conscience is the reason they're giving me some of these things
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:55.320]  so folks I'll recap the Middle East first right now and then in the next
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:03:00.800]  segment you're going to hear probably the greatest information that you'll hear
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:06.000]  in days and weeks okay first of all everything is happening in the Middle
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:11.400]  East exactly like they said it was going to happen let me state again what I was
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:17.120]  told the financial collapse is not going to take place right now it will
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:21.720]  happen and they have it planned they know when it's going to happen I do not
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:28.000]  have a date secondly let me go to Iran I know many of you thought back a week or
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.800]  two or three ago prior to Christmas that we were just ready to have a war with
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:38.840]  Iran and at the time I came on in four wars with Alex Jones and I said there
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:44.640]  is not going to be a war with Iran this month or next and it won't happen for a
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:50.360]  period of time but it is already planned you remember that Mr. Farms said to me
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:53.840]  back about two and a half three years ago he left on the phone and said
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:57.560]  chaplain is not going to happen for at least two and a half years well all that
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:03.600]  change now it is time for them to have a conflict with Iran and I warned you that
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.800]  it will take place in future months but that you have a window of opportunity
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:12.960]  right now to do something about preparing yourself for what is going to
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:18.120]  take place and I tried my best to warn you now on Christmas Day something
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:24.800]  happened that fits into all of this and I'm sure that many of you know what you
[2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:30.440]  must have by now realized that the Federal Reserve gave literally outright
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:37.880]  gave six hundred billion dollars American currency to the euro to the
[2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:42.800]  European Union to the European Bank on Christmas Day while you were having a
[2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:47.640]  good time they love to do things like this like this to have us the Federal
[2:04:47.640 --> 2:04:51.320]  Reserve years ago just before Christmas I tell you what stay there it's a sick
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:55.760]  joke we're gonna come back with a six hundred billion transferred your tax

[2:08:14.960 --> 2:08:20.400]  okay we are now into the third hour of worldwide broadcast I'm Alex Jones your
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:25.440]  host at the bottom of the hour in the last 30 minutes of this interview we're
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:29.520]  gonna have your questions or comments for Lindsay Williams the best-selling
[2:08:29.520 --> 2:08:33.360]  author of the energy non-crisis which has again been proven accurate he wrote
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:37.680]  it with 30 years ago exposing what he discovered working for the big oil
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:41.760]  companies in Alaska there was more proven reserves there than all of Saudi
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:46.440]  Arabia and of course what is allowed out of there when 80% of it goes to China
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:51.880]  and Japan it's a managed global economy and that's why they use the fake
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:58.280]  environmentalists and others to keep us off of our own oil supply our own natural
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:04.000]  gas you name it because they've got deals geopolitically the truth is the
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:08.440]  world is a wash in oil and the system is trying to keep it artificially scarce
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:11.960]  and then make us go into things like nuclear and other systems that are
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:16.520]  specialized so only certain insiders are able to operate now that's why they're
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:20.800]  shutting down our coal system it supplies 51% of our power right now it's
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:24.720]  it's it's it's a dastardly program of artificial scarcity but that's how
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:29.160]  Lindsay Williams has been known to the world in the last 30 years now he has
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:32.680]  two sources known to myself and Dr. Stan Monteef one of them died of course a
[2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:37.440]  year ago not this Christmas or last Christmas Mr. Fromm the other sources
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:42.400]  known to us and is a top you know globalist he's retired but he he told
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:45.640]  us what was coming up a year and a half ago in the Middle East he's told us when
[2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:49.280]  gas would go to 150 and then what that would go to 40 and it did everybody
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:55.640]  laughed at that and happened now he's been given Lindsay a lot of new
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:10:00.880]  information he's here breaking it today but you were finishing up with some
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:07.560]  points before you got into that Lindsay please continue in the past I have given
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:13.040]  information that the elite gave me I would come on the Alex Jones show and I
[2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:18.280]  would say I just had a phone call from Mr. Fromm and he said to your well the
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:23.440]  fuel price is going to go 147 dollars barrels 50 dollars barrel and about
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:27.480]  three years ago I came on your show and I said that people laughed at me and
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:32.600]  happened exactly like he said it now usually in the our ways in the past in
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:37.680]  fact I can't remember any time at the past 35 years I would come on your show
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:43.560]  Alex and I would say I have just been told this by the elite and you'll have
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:48.040]  to believe it based on the fact that they told it to me now the track record
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:52.320]  proves itself that every single time what they've told me has happened exactly
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:57.880]  like they have said it but I'm going to give today that has never been heard on
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:03.080]  international media you positively have not heard it on Alex Jones show before
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:08.640]  at least to my knowledge you haven't and to my knowledge there's probably not no
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:11.680]  more than a handful of people in the face of the earth and know what you're
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:16.400]  going to hear right now this time you don't have to take my word for it that
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:21.680]  the elite gave it to me I'm going to give you what they gave me and when you
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:28.160]  see this you are going to realize that it's going to impact your life Alex it's
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:33.920]  going to impact Genesis Network it's going to impact Lindsay Williams and my
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:38.320]  dinner table and it's going to impact every single person especially in the
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:42.520]  United States of America more than anything has in my entire life and I'm
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:48.960]  75 years of age I give this with fear and trembling now you have had time to
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:52.640]  get your pencil and paper if you didn't get them it's your own fault you're
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:57.560]  going to have to remember it but please write this down and then as I go
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:02.760]  through this you are going to go and prove this what the elite told me I
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:12.040]  want you to write down a date the date is November the 21st 2002 you have it
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:19.360]  November the 21st 2002 don't you dare change that dial you stay right here on
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:23.680]  the Alex Jones show through the entire time you are going to be appalled at
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:28.320]  what you're going to hear you can go after the show and prove this for
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:32.960]  yourself by going on the internet and looking up what they told me did you
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:39.000]  hear that I said they told me to go to this point and look it up and I would
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.080]  know what was going to happen next and I'm going to give it to you right now
[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:52.280]  on November the 21st of 2002 Mr. Ben Bernanke who is today the chairman of
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:57.520]  the Federal Reserve made us a speech I don't think anybody knew the importance
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:02.200]  of that speech I never knew it in fact I didn't know it existed until about two
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:10.040]  weeks ago and when I looked it up I trembled honestly and he gave something
[2:13:10.040 --> 2:13:16.560]  in that speech that now you are having brought to you because they're clinging
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:21.320]  to conscience I have only way to say it except men who are in their 70s and 80s
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:25.960]  were a part of the elite back when I knew them years ago and literally rub
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:30.400]  shoulders with them lived with them for three years today these men know they're
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:35.640]  facing eternity and these old men are talking and when you look up that date
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:45.120]  of November the 21st 2002 and go to National Economist Club in Washington DC
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:51.040]  and Ben Bernanke who was not Federal Reserve chairman at that time he still
[2:13:51.040 --> 2:13:57.640]  was just a governor and at the time he made a speech to the National Economist
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:05.320]  Club in Washington DC on November the 21st of 2002 now the reason I'm giving
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:10.160]  you that is because now I'm going to give you a brief background so that you
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:16.840]  will understand how I got this and why these people gave it to me many of you
[2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:20.480]  have heard me say before the Alex Jones show and by the way I'm trying to talk
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:24.840]  slow enough today so you can pick this up normally I go a mile a minute because
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:29.120]  I have so much to say and I do have that much to say today and you're going to be
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:34.120]  appalled but right now you must get the details on this because there has
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:38.320]  nothing ever affected your life like this is going to affect you in your
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:43.440]  lifetime so a little background briefly many of you have heard me say on the
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:48.560]  Alex Jones show that when I lived with the elite for those three years many
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:53.960]  years ago and got to know some of them personally they they have a code of
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:58.360]  ethics one of the first things I learned is not the code of ethics that Alex has
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:02.400]  not the same code of ethics when Julian says and many of you out there in the
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:06.000]  listening audience their code of ethics is not a code of ethics of the
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:10.640]  scriptures and the Bible is all found the fathers had their code of ethics is
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:17.080]  different but one facet of their code of ethics is they must tell you before they
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:23.320]  do it everything that they're going to do now Mr. Ken Trump said to me back
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:28.280]  about three oh I guess about two years ago before we died he said to me one
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:34.040]  day he said chaplain when the Federal Reserve begins to buy their own
[2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:39.480]  securities it's all over for the dollar and at the time I did not have the
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:43.640]  slightest idea what the man was talking about because the Federal Reserve had
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:48.800]  not begun to buy its T bills and securities that weren't bought by the
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:53.280]  foreign nation that's a monetization of debt now they're monetizing close to
[2:15:53.280 --> 2:16:00.000]  80% of it yes now in one year's time they began this approximately one year
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.760]  going Alex you're right that's a monetization of the debt and all they
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:08.080]  do is take it out of one pocket put it in the other one year ago they began
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:16.160]  doing this and as off right now the Federal Reserve owns owns three
[2:16:16.160 --> 2:16:23.200]  trillion dollars of the national debt it is funny it's a paper entry it's
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:28.640]  a computer type it is totally unbelievable and the communist Chinese
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:34.080]  are the other big owners they only right as off right now today as far as we can
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:39.280]  tell the Federal Reserve owns as much of the national debt as China does yes
[2:16:39.280 --> 2:16:43.480]  what I was T bills is what I was secure it is and it's their debt but they're
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:47.800]  maneuvering us into it so so so what was so important in this space that your
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:53.600]  source directed you to well what he said to me was he said go to this particular
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:59.760]  place and you will know exactly what they're going to do next and this is
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.520]  what I want to give you right now on that date of November the 21st 2002
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:12.040]  Ben Bernanke who later became the chairman of the Federal Reserve now
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:17.560]  what I was told was that the reason he became the chairman that this is so
[2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:21.560]  important books he became the chairman of the Federal Reserve because of this
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:27.320]  speech he said everything in this speech that the elite wanted to hear and
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:32.480]  because he was the most likely to carry it out because it seemed that he
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:38.760]  believed it and when when he gave this speech it basically put him in as the
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:44.120]  chairman of the Federal Reserve which he presently is and in this speech he
[2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:50.720]  told everything that he would do folks please it's everything he would do I'm
[2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:55.440]  going to outline them for you there are five points now this let me warn you
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:59.400]  ahead of time when you go to the speech it's very difficult to read it's our
[2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:05.320]  banker's jargon what I have done is taken it and put it in in simple terms
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:10.080]  that Lindsay Williams can understand and that I think you'll pick up on and in
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:14.480]  this speech he said that he would do five things let me tell you why when he
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:20.440]  say we do it and again again let me go back and say the elite said to me go to
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:24.960]  this place I understand they say this is a key speech so break it down yes
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:33.240]  number one he said if I am ever faced with another depression or another 19
[2:18:33.240 --> 2:18:42.720]  and 29 to 19 and 32 33 34 19 29 to 33 I will not restrict money supply I will
[2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:48.880]  monetize it yeah yeah he said number one he said I will lower the interest
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:53.200]  rates to zero now please read the speech okay everyone you've got to go to that
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:57.040]  point and read it for yourself it's a page as long I'm giving you some I'm
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.960]  actually I'm actually familiar with the speech but I'm glad you mentioned this
[2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:04.680]  so so I figured this was an important speech and I've seen the globalist
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:08.760]  quote it before so that's that's obviously what your your your contact is
[2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:12.520]  doing because this is the blueprint for what we're going under yes and my
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:18.000]  contact knew exactly what was going to happen next and I don't have a date for
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:22.880]  it I wish I did but I'm gonna give it to your number one he said I would lower
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:28.560]  interest rates to zero well you say it's a little above zero point three point
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:33.720]  four so what for all practical purposes when Ben Bernanke became the chairman of
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:38.480]  the Federal Reserve he did exactly what he said in that speech in November the
[2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:42.720]  21st 2002 and the reason that's such a big deal is obviously it means they're
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:46.320]  gonna basically devalue the currency down to nothing the decision has been
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:50.920]  made to kill the dollar as we know it which will be a giant transfer of
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:54.320]  wealth from the people to the elite Lindsay stay with us let's come down and
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:19:58.200]  give the rest of this key Bernanke speech straight ahead and then phone calls
[2:19:58.200 --> 2:20:04.840]  for our guest at 800 at 2 5 at 9 9 either one folks have you launched your
[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:08.960]  power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on if so this is

[2:24:55.640 --> 2:24:59.520]  three or four months and who knows they may be able to back it off and not
[2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:03.920]  started but it's just crazy Lindsay this is a short segment I your gracious to
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:06.960]  come back and you've got some breaking news today but I also want to go to some
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:10.520]  calls but they're pointing out this Bernanke speech and I'm glad that you're
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:16.800]  elitist friend you know former role company CEO is pointing you at the
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:22.320]  speech during the break I didn't try to go pull it up but I think this is a
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:26.560]  speech he gave quite a bit it's why he's known as helicopter bin back in the
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:31.040]  early 2000s when he was lobbying to be chairman as you pointed out when he was
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:37.560]  only a governor on on the one of the Fed offices real governor of America that's
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:42.080]  how they run it but this is important because it's the signal to debate the
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:47.360]  currency is that what your friend was pointing out well Alex when we come to
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:52.000]  the fifth point that's exactly what I'll say but if this is a short segment
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:56.480]  please let me give one thing is that I think so important it's very unusual
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:01.800]  that I'm on your show today now please bear with me folks because this is
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:06.840]  probably it's any way you put it I have had Alex I have had no telling how many
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:11.420]  talk show hosts to call me recently and say you haven't been on a while would you
[2:26:11.420 --> 2:26:15.320]  please come on between Christmas and New Year's I turned every one of them down I
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:19.880]  did not want to give this until after the first of the year oh wow I had to do
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:25.560]  more research on it your producer called on yesterday to my office and I was not
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:30.920]  here and the person who answered the telephone my wife said oh sure Lindsay
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:34.520]  will be glad to be on your show tomorrow that's the only reason I'm here
[2:26:34.520 --> 2:26:39.400]  today otherwise amazing that is Providence that is Providence so wow
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:43.840]  so break down because we see one of these speeches we get some info from it
[2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:49.280]  but a globalist knows how to decipher and all that weird banker language he
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:53.360]  does and whenever you go to Ben Bernan will give it one more time Ben Bernanke
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:59.400]  speech on November the 21st 2002 before the National Economist Club of
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:05.240]  Washington DC read the entire speech pages long and he said if I am over
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:11.200]  a phase with another great depression he said number one I will bring interest
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:16.240]  rates to zero well when he became Federal Reserve Chairman and most people
[2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:20.800]  think because of that speech he gave back in 2002 they liked what he said so
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:25.160]  well that's the first thing he did now folks please you've got to remember what
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:29.840]  he did back then when he first became Federal Reserve Chairman he took interest
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:35.240]  rates to and it's somewhere point two point three today for all practical purposes he
[2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:41.240]  took it to zero exactly what he said he would do number two he said I will buy
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:47.400]  securities from the banks to expand the federal balance sheets now folks you
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:50.520]  you're gonna have to go back and do some homework on this I mean you're gonna
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:54.160]  have to do some research on your own when you read that man's speech he's gonna I
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:57.860]  read it once I read it twice yeah that's massive corporate welfare that is
[2:27:57.860 --> 2:28:02.920]  getting the people in debt direct directly to the banksters in a form of
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:08.440]  economic espionage he said I won't buy the securities do you realize what they
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:11.560]  did when they bought General Motors what they did whenever they bought
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:16.080]  Chrysler do you realize what they're doing whenever they bail out all of the
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:20.800]  banks every one of their nationalizing everything but keeping the power in the
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:25.360]  private corporations just like with the EU takeover they're making the banksters
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:32.200]  the government yes and they bought he bought the securities from the banks to
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:39.480]  expand the Fed's balance sheet to make it look good number three and closer I
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:43.280]  get to number five the more afraid I get even giving this but you've got to
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:47.280]  understand where it came from he said go and look this up capital into your
[2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:51.120]  what's gonna happen next now he has already lowered the interest rates to zero
[2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:56.800]  he has already bought the securities from the banks to expand the Fed balance
[2:28:56.800 --> 2:29:00.880]  sheet number three he said I will increase the money supply you don't
[2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:05.040]  have any trouble understanding what he did there he just turned the presses up
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:09.800]  they took out of the computer's funny money that had no backing no existence
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:15.800]  whatsoever and over Christmas day folks is they they're doing getting
[2:29:15.800 --> 2:29:19.560]  everything ready for number five and I'll show it to you over Christmas day
[2:29:19.560 --> 2:29:24.880]  while you were having a good time partying and I'm so glad George Washington
[2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:30.640]  realized years ago on Christmas Eve that the Hessians would be drunk and it
[2:29:30.640 --> 2:29:36.480]  would be right now at Trenton for the good time and he's grooving one out
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:41.520]  basically on that night well that's when they turn the tide stay there amazing
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:45.200]  Lindsay stay there let's come back and continue with this key information
[2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:49.240]  straight ahead and phone calls for people that are waiting and we'll get to
[2:29:49.240 --> 2:29:54.840]  four and five straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[2:29:54.840 --> 2:30:03.320]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:07.760]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:11.760]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:30:11.760 --> 2:30:15.680]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[2:30:15.680 --> 2:30:19.680]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:24.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:30:24.240 --> 2:30:28.240]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:32.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:35.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:40.040]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:30:40.040 --> 2:30:43.200]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:30:43.200 --> 2:30:46.880]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[2:30:46.880 --> 2:30:51.640]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[2:30:51.640 --> 2:30:55.920]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[2:31:02.040 --> 2:31:05.680]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:31:05.680 --> 2:31:10.400]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:14.360]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:31:14.360 --> 2:31:18.200]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:31:18.200 --> 2:31:23.160]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:31:23.160 --> 2:31:28.440]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:31:28.440 --> 2:31:33.040]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:37.280]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:42.120]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[2:31:42.120 --> 2:31:46.640]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[2:31:46.640 --> 2:31:51.840]  to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:58.640]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:06.000]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:10.560]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:14.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[2:32:14.520 --> 2:32:19.200]  turned members influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:23.840]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:28.200]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:32:28.200 --> 2:32:33.440]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:32:33.440 --> 2:32:37.760]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:41.240]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:32:41.240 --> 2:32:46.480]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:32:46.480 --> 2:32:52.160]  have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:57.400]  at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[2:32:57.400 --> 2:33:09.280]  prisonplanet.tv defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's
[2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:18.280]  Alex Jones our info is hard core it's no joke you know I've started digging in
[2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:22.400]  to bio weapons and things and confirm the government programs for weaponized
[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:29.240]  cancer that's what AIDS came out of and it you know to realize that we're seen
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:33.720]  as animals and they've been testing all this on us and suppressing all of the
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:38.720]  treatments and things it's just so absolutely wicked and tears my heart
[2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:44.720]  out it tears my heart out and I've gone past the point of even being angry at
[2:33:44.720 --> 2:33:51.920]  these people it is more a stunning coldness that I feel and I just pray
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:56.640]  people get their hearts right with God because the world is going into a very
[2:33:56.640 --> 2:34:01.600]  insane time as crazy as things are now we ain't seen nothing yet as they say
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:07.160]  we're going back to Lindsay here in a moment and I promise your calls if you
[2:34:07.160 --> 2:34:13.720]  want to support us go to the info wars.com store by books by DVDs by
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:18.440]  t-shirts info wars flags all of it helps get the word out informs you to a
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:23.640]  higher level is a testament to what's really going on here is politico
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:29.640]  bloggers SOPA is the end of us and even mainstream media admits this is the
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:35.720]  total takeover an end of free speech preemptively and the Pentagon runs it the
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:39.320]  80 inventors of the internet have come out as you know and said that it is the
[2:34:39.320 --> 2:34:43.640]  end of freedom and that America has now been taken over by pure evil that's AP
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:49.080]  Reuters Department of Homeland Security is using fake Facebook and Twitter
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:52.960]  accounts to monitor posts containing certain keywords yeah and to spam this
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:58.000]  info and again the Department of Defense doesn't work for America it works for
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:03.480]  the New World Order global banks the average people individually are good in
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:06.640]  the military on average are some of the best people out there they join for the
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:11.120]  right reasons many of them I found the military are about the best group out
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:15.440]  there quite frankly for waking up being serious supporting Ron Paul supporting
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:19.240]  liberty but the run reason they're awake is they're in the middle of it they're
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:24.280]  seeing what we're talking about and you know I get mad at police all the time
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:28.720]  because there were the rubber meets the road but cops on average are waking up
[2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:33.040]  faster in the public I'm getting chills right now I really am I mean this is
[2:35:33.040 --> 2:35:39.040]  stuff is making me sick because it's it's like watching a child tied up in the
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:41.680]  middle of the road and knowing a car is going to come by and run him over and
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:46.240]  you're tied up to a tree and you can't save them or a child on a train track
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:51.600]  and zombies are walking by you're like untie me or untie that child and they
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:53.960]  look at you and you're all tied up and the kids tied up they go you're a
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:57.480]  conspiracy theorist I heard if anybody was tied to the tracks it was a
[2:35:57.480 --> 2:36:01.880]  conspiracy theory you're like look it's a child on the train track I'm tied up
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:05.920]  here to this tree just it's a real train track you know trains come down this
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:12.080]  right they're like I was told about people like you and I'm just like I mean
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:17.760]  it is a spiritual delusion I mean you heard dr. Busby last hour and he's
[2:36:17.760 --> 2:36:24.320]  saying it's like people are zombies or something it is crazy it is crazy and I
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:27.320]  was just during the break reading a document about weaponized cancer they
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:33.520]  put it in the stinking polio vaccines and got caught your grandma your grandpa's
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:38.800]  my grandma's grandpa's dying of cancer they killed them folks cancer in the
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:44.560]  last 10 years is up 2,000 fold in many types the last 50 I'm gonna go Lindsay
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:46.880]  Williams I apologize it just I was reading this document during the break
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:54.720]  and it just it's it's really getting to me it's really getting to me and all
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:37:00.560]  right we're gonna we're gonna go back to Lindsay Williams here if you want to
[2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:04.360]  support us till the end of the year we're offering everything special all 18 of
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:09.800]  my films 70 plus percent off the 360 bucks all 18 of them on DVD or 995 great
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:14.840]  way to wake folks up we've got all these other great videos we carry like Oklahoma
[2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:19.800]  City the noble lie proving that was a false flag inside job and when you
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:23.160]  realize the feds bomb those little kids on purpose I mean this these are not
[2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:29.080]  feds these are demons and people say well they're so dangerous why are you
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:33.800]  resisting them aren't you scared I'm scared of this continuing separately I
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:37.600]  was asking Lindsay because he's not here to plug his books and videos today I
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:41.640]  drug him on the show but I said look people need to get this information 2012
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:45.800]  the beginning of the end is his 3 DVD set that day where he breaks a lot of
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:50.160]  this down in true detail without myself and the calls and everything you know
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:53.600]  and the breaks interrupting him go to prophecyclub.com with the great work they
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:38:01.760]  do there to get all of his materials or 888-799-6111 888-799-6111 they got a lot
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:04.960]  of other material as well but it's important with all these moves toward
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:08.720]  censorship they start a nuclear war they start a bigger war they claim a cyber
[2:38:08.720 --> 2:38:12.280]  attack and shut the web down from general public and their plans are public
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:16.720]  it's to wire everything into government sites where every major site gives you a
[2:38:16.720 --> 2:38:22.520]  government message and only affiliated groups like Fox and CNN will be allowed
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:25.920]  to stay up and then they'll have the government messages as well packaged by
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:34.040]  them that's why you've seen Woodchuckaby with the Woodchuck show posing as a
[2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:38.160]  Christian conservative on Fox come out and say Obama's a Christian loving
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:42.960]  patriot who loves America I was told by high up Fox people before my sources all
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:46.720]  dried up because I was allowed to talk about I never gave particulars but they
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:51.720]  figured out who the two sources were and they're gone they're shut down that
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:55.680]  about a year ago they were told we're turning the direction we're gonna start
[2:38:55.680 --> 2:39:02.160]  back in Obama and because we're we're circling the wagons and you're gonna
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:07.720]  start noticing that I mean this is so disgusting and okay side issue I wanted
[2:39:07.720 --> 2:39:13.960]  to finish his other points we're gonna go to your calls it's just that that the
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:18.040]  whole system circle on the wagons right now because as Lindsay breaks down the
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:22.000]  speech that his elitist friend said look at this this is what we're gonna do
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:26.760]  it's just total confirmation of a total devaluation and what that means it
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:33.880]  means hyperinflation with a physical depression the perfect storm the the
[2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:40.360]  royal flush the creme dollar creme of the creme dollar creme of economic
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:45.320]  disaster with half the public a bunch of spoiled rotten jellyfish you don't want
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:49.520]  to work the other half of us carrying everybody on our backs it is going to be
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:54.840]  if we don't avert this it is going to be hellish with the capital H Lindsay I'm
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:57.640]  sorry I'm ranting a lot of sense a little bit overdrive here to finish
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:00.200]  with the calls but I want to go to the calls finish your other two points
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:05.920]  please in 35 years the everything that the elite have ever told me it has
[2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:10.400]  happened exactly as they said it you've heard me come on the Alex you on show
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:15.240]  and say it and that's exactly the way it happened please write this date down
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:21.960]  I'm begging you to go and read this speech the date was November the 21st 2002
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:27.360]  when Ben Bernanke gave us a speech before the National Economist Club of
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:33.520]  Washington DC he said if I am of a face to another the Great Depression which he
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:38.760]  was immediately after he came in as Federal Reserve Chairman the housing
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:44.080]  bubble at first the economy was in shambles the unemployment rate was going
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:49.920]  through the roof he said I will do five things he said first of all I would
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:54.400]  bring interest rates to zero look back at the last four or five years he did
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:59.080]  exactly what he said he said secondly I would buy securities from the banks to
[2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:02.640]  expand the federal balance sheet you're going to have to digest that one a while
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:06.920]  all of you out there please do he said number three I would increase the money
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:12.880]  supply that's exactly what he did after bringing the interest rates to zero after
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.800]  buying securities in order to expand the federal balance sheet then he increased
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:23.440]  the money supply exactly as he said in the speech he would and number four he
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:31.040]  said I would buy our country's debt QE 1 QE 2 he bought our country's debt
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:35.760]  beginning one year ago Mr. Frum had warned me three years ago that whenever
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:39.920]  this happened about two and a half years ago he warned me that whenever this
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:43.580]  happened it was the end of the dollar I didn't understand what he was saying I
[2:41:43.580 --> 2:41:49.400]  see it readily now and then Mr. Bernanke said I will do a fifth thing now the
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.960]  first four I have mentioned to you he has done them in the exact order
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:59.960]  precisely as he said he would he did not change one thing from his speech you've
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.480]  got to wade through that speech it'll take you hours to do it whatever you do
[2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:11.040]  you'll understand he did the first four in the exact order now here's what came
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:18.520]  in what happened to me just a matter of days ago my elitist friends and again
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:24.600]  they they're old they're clearing the conscience I believe you've got to go
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:30.920]  to productive speech of 2002 and you will know what's going to happen next and
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:34.960]  right now I'm going to tell you what's going to happen next I'll tell you exactly
[2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:39.000]  how much they're going to do it and I'll tell you the method they would use and
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.240]  you'll see it because Bernanke gave it and when you read his speech it'll send
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:47.880]  cold chills up and down your spine I do believe Mr. Bernanke said the fifth thing
[2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:52.120]  I will do and of course you know the economy is not getting any better the
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:56.680]  housing market is in shambles the unemployment rate is continuing to
[2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:03.360]  climb they just gave six hundred billion dollars over Christmas to Europe to the
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:08.760]  EU China and Japan just made a pact you realize what happened while you were
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:13.160]  having Christmas and and getting ready for New Year's China and Japan just
[2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:17.400]  signed the largest trade agreement ever signed in the history of the world you
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:22.320]  heard me correctly ever in the history of the world and they said we will trade
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:26.800]  amongst ourselves China and Japan the second and third largest economies in
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:32.560]  the world we will trade amongst ourselves and we will not use the dollar
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:39.520]  folks are you getting the message okay number five Mr. Bernanke said if I am
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:46.280]  faced with a continual depression he said I will I don't even want to say it
[2:43:46.280 --> 2:43:53.520]  it scares me he said I will devalue the dollar oh my goodness
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:58.240]  focus please all right he said how he was going to do I'm going to read you a
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:03.080]  portion of his actual statement you're going to read the entire speech for
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:09.040]  yourself you've got to and I want to read you just one sentence out of his
[2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:14.200]  out of his speech he said it's worth it noting that these are his exact words in
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:19.480]  that speech in 2002 he said it's worth noting that there have been times when
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:25.960]  exchange rate policy has been an effective weapon a striking example from
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:32.040]  US history is Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 40 percent devaluation of the
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:39.800]  dollar against the gold in 19 and 33 and 34 please please I beg of you folks you
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:45.440]  are facing a currency devaluation they said to me go and look at Bernanke's
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:49.600]  speech and you'll know what's going to happen next I did not say it was going
[2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:53.800]  to happen tomorrow I did not say it was going to happen next month it's in the
[2:44:53.800 --> 2:44:58.720]  works they plan to do it and I'll tell you how much they're going to devalue it
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:04.120]  yeah that's right he actually stated in his speech how much he would devalue the
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:09.760]  currency are you ready he said he would devalue it by 40 percent now how did
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:16.520]  FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt do it in 19 and 33 and 34 you remember he said
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:21.960]  bring in your one ounce gold pieces he said I will give you $20 for the
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:26.960]  because stamped on that one ounce gold pieces $20 oh people were patriotic oh
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:31.880]  yes we want to help back up our country we want to help get the country out of
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:37.760]  the mess it's in and within a few months time after the people turned in their
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:43.560]  one ounce gold for a piece of paper oh please people I'm begging of you Mr.
[2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:46.960]  Farms said to me chaplain if it's written on a piece of paper it's worth the
[2:45:46.960 --> 2:45:51.480]  paper it's written on they brought in their one ounce gold pieces and they
[2:45:51.480 --> 2:45:55.040]  were given a piece of paper that said you can go back to the bank and get you
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:00.280]  off we get you a gold back for 20 no I didn't say for $20 it just said we'll
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:04.560]  take them $20 and they gave them a gold certificate piece of paper today you
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:07.520]  know you've had that you don't have anything with a Federal Reserve note
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:11.920]  today it has no backing of gold or silver anything else and within please
[2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:18.320]  hear it within a few months Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced one day out
[2:46:18.320 --> 2:46:22.800]  of a clear blue sky with no wanting whatsoever the price of gold is going
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:27.080]  up to $35 an ounce yeah so that's the type of stuff we're gonna see we're
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:29.840]  gonna have to have you back up in the new year to break this down more we've
[2:46:29.840 --> 2:46:33.360]  got to go to calls and get their perspective because I promise we would
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:38.120]  but we had Gerald Salente on yesterday and he directed us to a clip from three
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:44.160]  years ago of Biden and Corzine and in the speech he says yeah we had a meeting
[2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:49.640]  with the other bankers about a bank holiday so they're certainly getting
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:52.400]  all of this ready and again a bank holiday folks where they shut the banks
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:56.840]  down for a week or two and when you come back your dollar's been devalued in a
[2:46:56.840 --> 2:47:01.080]  giant step not just incrementally and the inflation's already out there
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:05.840]  they're just putting out cook numbers but if they're talking about really
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:09.920]  devaluing it we're talking about a hamburger being 20 bucks instead of
[2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:14.920]  $5 you know when a hamburger was two bucks ten years ago we're talking about
[2:47:14.920 --> 2:47:20.200]  massive wealth redistribution that we're talking about destruction of those on
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:26.880]  fixed incomes it's just unspeakable let's go to phone calls here and I guess
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:30.320]  Chris in California has been holding the longest you're on the year with our
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:37.600]  guest go ahead yeah I Lindsay and Alex this is Chris I had a question maybe
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:42.680]  either you could answer I've been looking into this case you probably heard
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:50.120]  of it where there's about a month ago there was a case filed against some of
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:58.720]  these big names like the United Nations Bank I Moon for the Skone and the World
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.240]  Economic Forum and I think it's been largely going around the internet out
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:08.240]  of Benjamin Fulford yeah I've gotten calls about this have you called before
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:12.880]  or was it somebody else no I've been called before yeah you know we'll work
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:16.480]  on getting Fulford on to hear about a suit I haven't had time to go to the
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:22.680]  lawsuit tracker and see if that's a real case what's the name of the case well
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:32.080]  as you can look it up on a plaster case locator it's case number one colon 2011
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:40.680]  dash CV dash 08 500 I appreciate your call I don't know what Lindsay can say
[2:48:40.680 --> 2:48:44.680]  about that I don't know if he's aware of that particular statement but yes China
[2:48:44.680 --> 2:48:48.240]  and a lot of other groups have been suing different groups in China over the
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:51.720]  fact they've been sold derivatives you've got Bank of America and others
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:56.000]  taking houses they never had the deed to that are paid for so I guess the
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:59.640]  globalists kind of have to have a war Lindsay because they've cheated not just
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:04.600]  people but countries what is your latest source say about that well he hasn't
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:07.240]  mentioned that at all we've been talking so much about this currency
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:12.800]  evaluation he was just recently Alex until I was so startled and done founded
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:17.000]  and realized that everybody out there has 40% of everything that you own to be
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:20.920]  lost until I haven't had time to do anything else with this and then do some
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:25.120]  research on what other nations did when they devalued their currency different
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:28.840]  things are done by different countries and when it happens in America exactly
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:32.720]  how is the devaluation going to take place we don't know that all we know is
[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:36.280]  that he's going to do it but the mayor well they're not going to call it that
[2:49:36.280 --> 2:49:40.320]  nowadays the mind controls gotten so intense they'll call it an increase in
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:44.320]  the value or something I mean it's just untold evil let's talk to Nick in
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:48.320]  Illinois Nick here on the air got a question for Lindsay yeah I had a
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:53.360]  question what does Lindsay think of Michael Rupert he's the investigative
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:58.440]  journalist and he's the author that movie the collapse movie which talks
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:03.360]  about peak oil yeah peak oil is just funny is a $3 bill from from research
[2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:09.000]  but what's your view on peak oil Lindsay well there is no such thing as a peak
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:13.400]  oil it's the total misnomer when the Russians went down to drill that coal
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:21.960]  sg3 wells to 42,000 feet they hit the mother loa oil it's not a buy it's a
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:28.920]  biotic oil it has nothing to do with the with dinosaurs and rotted plants so now
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:32.960]  the whole textbook you've got to be written I'm sorry but if a person
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:36.760]  believes in peak oil it all they got to do is just find out very latest to what's
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:41.920]  going on there's a lot of top scientists say it's not man-made now
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:45.960]  obviously you can find some deposits that are it does exist you can find coal
[2:50:45.960 --> 2:50:50.160]  that's got you know dinosaur bones in it or whatever there's obviously some of
[2:50:50.160 --> 2:50:55.880]  that exists there is some fossil fuel but it's a very small amount of it you
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:50:58.840]  know I tell you what we'll come back and let Nick have a response back to that
[2:50:58.840 --> 2:51:03.320]  then we'll go to everybody else what nutrition are you missing that's
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:07.600]  leading to the four major diseases cancer arthritis heart disease and
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:11.400]  Parkinson's there are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:16.040]  protein glutathione to be linked to cancer heart disease Parkinson's macular
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:21.320]  degeneration lung disease digestive diseases diabetes Alzheimer's ALS
[2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:26.400]  rheumatoid arthritis and lupus in all at least 68 diseases what is the number
[2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:29.400]  one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione

[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  all right the official radio shows over in five minutes but I'm a little bit
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:14.760]  overdrive for internet listeners at infowars.com with Lindsay Williams
[2:54:14.760 --> 2:54:20.120]  we have a very special info wars nightly news tonight the globalist are
[2:54:20.120 --> 2:54:23.840]  poisoning the food and water we have all their documents by all their documents
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:26.800]  I'm sure we have a fraction of them we have giant stacks of the total proof
[2:54:26.800 --> 2:54:32.640]  other wicked plan it's it's we're all under attack by it and I know Nancy
[2:54:32.640 --> 2:54:37.880]  when the stars is on but this is the major issue and I'm again not talking
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:40.440]  to a regular audience but all the new listeners that tune in who may be
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:48.200]  laughing at this stuff this is not a joke it's not funny Nick in Illinois there's
[2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:53.760]  your answer on peak oil you know a lot of the globalists want to put out this
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:57.760]  idea that there's no resources so that when they cut them off and charge more
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:01.520]  for less people will think it's a self-fulfilling prophecy this is part of
[2:55:01.520 --> 2:55:06.160]  a post-industrial move that's taking place that's why they want to shut off
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:09.840]  coal we have enough coal to run the planet for thousands of years and do it
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:13.840]  cleanly all they put out is carbon dioxide so then they list carbon dioxide
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:18.840]  as a toxic waste you have any comments to that Nick I mean that's I totally
[2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:22.760]  agree with you I was just curious to see if you ever heard of Michael Rupert
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:28.600]  because he has a compelling documentary back in 2009 called collapse and I just
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:34.560]  was curious to see if that's no I know Mike I know Mike okay thank you all right
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:40.160]  thank you so much let's go ahead and talk to another caller here let's talk to
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:46.480]  Deb in Illinois you're on the air with our guest yes I'm calling to inquire
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:51.400]  about the shelters and the provisions that people are taking for this type of
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:58.560]  event and I've run across one in particular and they have indicated that
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:05.040]  Lindsay has even endorsed it I was very curious as to what his thought was on
[2:56:05.040 --> 2:56:12.320]  this and if those are pretty reasonable things to do it's a natural shelter I
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:17.480]  don't understand natural shelter what are we talking about we're talking a
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:23.320]  naturally occurring shelter you come out caves lean lean twos would be more in
[2:56:23.320 --> 2:56:28.640]  the area of a cave yes
[2:56:30.680 --> 2:56:35.040]  well Lindsay have you talked about people having caves they can run to or
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:38.520]  positively not in fact let me say emphatically I have endorsed nothing
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:44.720]  anyone out there who says I have endorsed any organization any shelter any
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:48.440]  provision whatsoever apart from what you hear me say right here on the Alex
[2:56:48.440 --> 2:56:53.480]  Jones show I did not endorse it I do not endorse anything I've had two big
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:56:58.200]  organizations asked me to be on their bulletin within the past two months I
[2:56:58.200 --> 2:57:02.400]  turned both of them down I don't do that the only thing I endorsed is what the
[2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:06.480]  elite told me I know it's true I tell it on the Alex Jones show and that's the
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:09.840]  only thing I do is I may agree with some of those but I've never said it over
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:16.800]  radio talk shows yeah my whole issue is that this depression is going to get
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:22.080]  bad in places like New York City places like that bad areas of Chicago yeah
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:26.640]  I've moved to the countryside but as long as you're ready to take care of
[2:57:26.640 --> 2:57:32.080]  yourself and you should be okay and if enough people wake up that's the only
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:35.880]  thing that's made these globalists change their plans and back off if enough
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:41.400]  people wake up well Lindsay is it ever too late to get them to pull back no you
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:44.120]  can definitely get her to pull back and that's the reason I'm on your shoulder
[2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:47.640]  there Alex you've got a coverage of probably two million listeners right
[2:57:47.640 --> 2:57:52.320]  now while we're talking these people have got to know you must know what to do
[2:57:52.320 --> 2:57:58.120]  according to Ben Bernacchi speech on November the 21st 2002 people please you
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:03.600]  can take precautionary action right now and I wish we had another whole hour
[2:58:03.600 --> 2:58:07.600]  Alex how so I could suggest to him according to what my elitist friends
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:11.720]  have told me what they should do and they should do it immediately and it's
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:14.840]  different than anything I've talked about in the panel well I tell you what
[2:58:14.840 --> 2:58:18.480]  we're gonna do five more minutes the main show's over but Deb does you have
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:23.200]  any other questions or comments no but I would really welcome his comments at
[2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:27.840]  some point in the future quickly about the what provisions exactly he thinks
[2:58:27.840 --> 2:58:31.880]  we should take okay well we'll get Lindsay's take on that straight ahead
[2:58:31.880 --> 2:58:35.960]  that's it for the main radio show see you back tomorrow live 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. but
[2:58:35.960 --> 2:58:42.920]  we'll come back and take a few more calls internet only straight ahead thank
[2:58:42.920 --> 2:58:52.880]  you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hi this is Alex Jones did you
[2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:56.360]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[2:58:56.360 --> 2:58:59.760]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[2:58:59.760 --> 2:59:03.560]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[2:59:03.560 --> 2:59:06.720]  seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[2:59:06.720 --> 2:59:10.640]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:14.760]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[2:59:14.760 --> 2:59:19.680]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:23.200]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:27.040]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:32.240]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank calm that
[2:59:32.240 --> 2:59:42.800]  survival seed bank calm or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[2:59:42.800 --> 2:59:48.080]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[2:59:48.080 --> 2:59:54.960]  is Alex Jones for survival seed bank calm coast to coast direct from Austin
[2:59:54.960 --> 3:00:01.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:26.360]  well I wish I wasn't staring there in the break it official US government
[3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:30.120]  documents cancer viruses and the vaccines I mean those aren't just words
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:35.080]  that's your mama your daddy your son your daughter dying young and a bunch of
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:40.840]  murder and scum that killed him and I put out videos on this last night and I
[3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:46.520]  see people going well there aren't too many people what are you gonna do well
[3:00:46.520 --> 3:00:51.160]  then you kill yourself then do not sit there and jack kids shots up with stuff
[3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:55.680]  that kills them and then lecture me about how there's too many of us oh but
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:58.320]  you're one of the ones that knows there's too many of us so you've got to stay
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:02.320]  around to do the killing all I got to say is is you people are going to be
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:09.040]  defeated and going back to Lindsay Williams you know the society issue but
[3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:12.320]  they're like how many we have 20 billion the earth's population is going to
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:15.600]  plane off at eight and a half billion every actuary shows that and then a
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:19.200]  minute and then a real collapse starts because when you don't have as many young
[3:01:19.200 --> 3:01:23.440]  people as there are old people you then can't take care of everybody but you
[3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:27.600]  don't know about that do you you have an actually studied population trends you
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:30.640]  just shoot your mouths off and I'm sorry I'm reading their comments during the
[3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:34.480]  break Lindsay you heard the ladies question what would you do to get
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:38.840]  prepared I mean I know I'd say try to get good friends and neighbors and family
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:42.480]  who are living in the real world who can mutually help each other that's most
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:46.400]  important have food have water have firearms be willing to use them to
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:49.440]  protect yourself having guns is nothing if you don't know how to use them if you
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:52.760]  can't have some gold and silver storeable food and water filtration I
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:57.000]  mean I've got a well I got a shotgun a rifle and a four-wheel drive and a
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:02.520]  country boy will survive I think it comes down to that Lindsay we need to do
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:06.520]  all of those things you just mentioned Alex we need to do everything that you've
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:10.960]  heard me say in the past we need to do you should have already done them
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:16.200]  everything on my new DVD series which just came out 2012 the beginning of the
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:20.600]  end you've got to do it now let's come down to what I was given in the last few
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:28.520]  days Mr. Bernanke said I will as the last the final straw I will devaluate
[3:02:28.520 --> 3:02:34.200]  the currency now how much did he say he would devalue it 30 he said he would
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:41.800]  devalue it 30% it's there he actually okay the elite they will tell you in
[3:02:41.800 --> 3:02:46.160]  their buzzwords what they're going to do then they will do it and then when you
[3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:49.600]  turn around and fuss after it's all over with an Alex I'm glad you're getting
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:54.920]  excited today I feel the same way and whenever the elite do this and then you
[3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:59.120]  come back and plus Adam and they say that what are you talking about I told you by
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:03.200]  the way I well that's what a vampire does in in lore reading this because I'd
[3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:06.200]  seen bits of this over the years different but reading this while we've
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:11.280]  while you've been talking some it is pretty wild he sells inflation as a good
[3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:15.560]  thing in the first paragraph I'm glad you're a latest source who had known to
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:20.280]  myself brought this up to you one final little call at the end here and we'll
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:25.000]  have to go to others tomorrow I'm sorry Abraham in Idaho quick question for

[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:50.920]  there's going to be an attack against Syria prior to Iran and did he give you
[3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:55.760]  a timeline of events leading up to an attack on Iran yes he did and if you
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:04:00.160]  would like that in a three-hour DVD presentation I produced it nine months
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:04.360]  ago it's entitled Middle East the rest of the story he told me every nation that
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:08.120]  will be attacked he told me what order they'd be attacked in he did say that
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:12.720]  Syria would come prior to Iran he did say that Iran would be the last place to
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:16.000]  be and by the way you're on record before any of this started saying this
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:20.920]  Lindsay what let's get one more of those questions quickly okay I actually want to
