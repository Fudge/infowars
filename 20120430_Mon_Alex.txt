[10:27.640 --> 10:31.840]  leaders and they're always at meetings about reducing population and putting
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.160]  stuff in the water they openly talk well we'll just do that while they already
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.200]  are and they're always obsessed with giving kids vaccines and leave a big
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.960]  wake of dead and dying behind them sterilizing giving them polio and it's
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.320]  like oh yeah Bill Gates dropped by 46,000 plus got it and her paralyzed
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.880]  are dead and India he's a nice man and we're just supposed to sit here in the
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.800]  twilight zone going oh one in 25,300 got autism three decades ago it's now one
[10:59.800 --> 11:03.920]  in 58 and they do estimate within four to five years it'll be one in ten and
[11:03.920 --> 11:10.440]  then a few years after that one in two there's no problem a decade again a
[11:10.440 --> 11:16.080]  decade from now at current trends one out of two won't be able to talk there's
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.840]  nothing going on everything's fine again I want to apologize that I've been so
[11:20.840 --> 11:28.480]  extreme what I've been is extremely weak and not focused enough and not been
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.520]  hardcore enough I've held back the truth from you because it's too
[11:32.520 --> 11:39.200]  incredible nine times out of ten it turns out I cut back on the full reality
[11:39.200 --> 11:43.280]  because my brain has an automatic gauge like we all do that just says it can't
[11:43.280 --> 11:57.440]  be that bad it can't be that bad well you know what it is that bad so let me
[11:57.440 --> 12:02.080]  just give you a smattering of the news headlines here and then I'm going to give
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.520]  the number out and we're going to take your phone calls over the next two hours

[12:23.200 --> 12:26.600]  for Bruce Fine something we haven't done here on air I think we're taking a few
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.720]  calls with him once always an amazing interview that is coming up and in
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.520]  studio tomorrow in the third hour we're gonna have Joel Scalzen Marine Corps
[12:35.520 --> 12:41.320]  fighter pilot nephew of Cleon Scalzen who wrote the naked communist exposing
[12:41.320 --> 12:43.960]  that the big mega banks with the documents and congressional documents
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.080]  that later came out proved that he was right that it was run by the mega banks
[12:48.080 --> 12:56.360]  see people like McCarthy were useful when he was just saying commies were you
[12:56.360 --> 13:01.360]  know secretaries working in the FBI when it turned out he discovered the army was
[13:01.360 --> 13:05.800]  running communism and funding the Soviets which is now already classified oh
[13:05.800 --> 13:13.360]  he was destroyed in ours and of course they've now released the KGB files five
[13:13.360 --> 13:20.080]  years ago New York Times headline McCarthy was right oh you bet he was you
[13:20.080 --> 13:27.160]  bet he was but commies are well who's the top scientist the big federation of
[13:27.160 --> 13:36.080]  scientists scientific American Reuters the Royal Institute I covered that
[13:36.080 --> 13:39.720]  yesterday on the air Reuters you name it reporting it the big national academies
[13:39.720 --> 13:43.520]  all the world say world government redistribution of wealth one child
[13:43.520 --> 13:48.560]  policies you must live in dormitories no more families and put things in the
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.880]  water to sterilize you but they're already doing it now because we're
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.000]  exposing them they're going yeah we put radioactivist steps in there it's good
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.840]  for you yeah mercury's in the shot remember ten years ago they'd say
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.040]  there's no mercury in the shots that's a conspiracy theory I remember it on the
[14:01.040 --> 14:04.400]  news I've played the clips people started looking and demanding from the
[14:04.400 --> 14:08.520]  doctor okay give me the insert says right there mercury the Marisol oh there
[14:08.520 --> 14:16.160]  is mercury in there oh you know what it's good for you and now doctors the
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.520]  journal pediatrics says so in a government study they're gonna have a
[14:20.520 --> 14:23.520]  government study saying get you get the shot in the head with double-ock bucket
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.280]  like brain range is good for you maybe jumping off the Empire State's pulling
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.480]  no parachutes good for you maybe jumping in a industrial wood shipper is good
[14:31.480 --> 14:35.120]  for you maybe running out in front of an 18-wheeler doing 120 is good for you
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.440]  maybe shooting yourself and they're taking a hatchet and just hacking
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.080]  yourself in the face is good for you because you know what the journal of
[14:41.080 --> 14:45.840]  pediatrics said so they said mercury actually this is exact quote improves
[14:45.840 --> 14:52.200]  cognitive behavior that's a little twist word cognitive behavior see in their
[14:52.200 --> 14:56.160]  word when you're behaving when your cerebral cortex has got little holes
[14:56.160 --> 15:03.720]  eating in it you're an android to them and they're gonna lobotomize you and
[15:03.720 --> 15:09.120]  if your child gets a little too little overcooked the orders are going out to
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.640]  soup up the vaccines and they're going well this is gonna fry even more it's
[15:12.640 --> 15:15.560]  gonna become very obvious they go just tell them they have convulsions tell
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.320]  them it's not normal to talk anymore pretty soon it'll be yeah I heard that
[15:19.320 --> 15:24.680]  conspiracy theorist he said people used to be able to talk oh but I guess he
[15:24.680 --> 15:29.600]  won't be able to talk at that point yeah I heard a conspiracy theory that women
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.880]  used to actually feed their young and that mammals fed their young with their
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.160]  breast with milk they produced yeah man I can't believe those dirty dirty
[15:38.160 --> 15:41.800]  extremist they're just terrible people by the way you think I'm joking I can
[15:41.800 --> 15:53.120]  play CBS news right now saying mercury is good for your child's brain oh yeah and
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.120]  after I had a caller yesterday from Oklahoma talk about how they took their
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.160]  child in and kept refusing the shots and the doctors try to lie and say it's the
[16:02.160 --> 16:08.640]  law and stuff like that but finally okay well there's mercury in it well mercury
[16:08.640 --> 16:11.880]  is good for your child's learning
[16:16.120 --> 16:22.920]  you see this is how sick it is now how it's all hidden out in the open let me
[16:22.920 --> 16:28.040]  mention some of the headlines here see this is how my brain works I read Murdoch's
[16:28.040 --> 16:33.240]  brace for damning phone hacking report FBI looks at well they're already
[16:33.240 --> 16:36.520]  investigating them but perhaps indicting people at news court you wonder why
[16:36.520 --> 16:42.400]  suddenly Fox News is worshiping Obama they're being blackmailed completely now
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.400]  and I've confirmed that there's basically memos up there leave Obama alone
[16:46.400 --> 16:53.880]  now I've just been told that I have no idea how right I am about what I've
[16:53.880 --> 17:00.840]  said about Fox CNBC Murdoch's brace for damning phone hacking report here's
[17:00.840 --> 17:09.120]  another one Cameron denies secret deal with Murdoch French news agency now see
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.520]  here's how my brain works and I'm not saying it's good they had the police
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.640]  spying on people and they were hacking folks but that's what big outfits do it's
[17:15.640 --> 17:20.640]  just ubiquitous it's like people 50 years ago walked up and called black people
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.520]  the n-word all over the place wasn't right it but it was ubiquitous they just
[17:24.520 --> 17:31.400]  did it well this is a beyond all that Google engineers knew for two years that
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.320]  the company Street View cars were stealing emails and passwords via Wi-Fi
[17:35.320 --> 17:39.960]  well yeah they were doing it for the US government they are the NSA they're at
[17:39.960 --> 17:44.520]  the NSA headquarters they've got a NASA development headquarters the former
[17:44.520 --> 17:49.320]  head of the NSA runs Google's operation just type in former head of NSA
[17:49.320 --> 17:54.560]  runs Google algorithm system just just just type in head of former head of NSA at
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.000]  Google it'll give you I think I think it's Reuters two weeks ago they were
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.400]  announcing it again the point is it was set up by NQTL set up by CIA 13 years
[18:03.400 --> 18:06.960]  ago do you really think it just came from nowhere and took everything over do
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.000]  you really think it's allowed to violate copyright when no one else is do you
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.040]  really think you can get away with anything at once it's meant to create
[18:13.040 --> 18:17.520]  market dominance it's a front group and Schmidt says well you shouldn't do
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.760]  anything that you don't want seen in the public on Google which they use to then
[18:21.760 --> 18:25.480]  break into your computer they hack your computer even if you don't want Google
[18:25.480 --> 18:32.320]  and even if you block their cookies they don't care that's come out because
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.200]  these are government operatives Google engineers knew for two years that the
[18:36.200 --> 18:39.320]  company Street View cars were stealing emails and passwords via Wi-Fi and the
[18:39.320 --> 18:43.680]  government's now dropped its Street View investigation there's the city
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.960]  morning Herald Google aware of data scoop now guess since this came out what
[18:47.960 --> 18:53.640]  they've announced the post office is going to have these now they're just
[18:53.640 --> 18:58.280]  going to go directly to government vehicles driving around providing Wi-Fi
[18:58.280 --> 19:01.960]  well because the government wants you to have free Wi-Fi but also selling a
[19:01.960 --> 19:07.080]  higher-grade service to whoever so you're on government networks and they
[19:07.080 --> 19:12.000]  say they're going to be grabbing your passwords and stuff which then destroys
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.320]  security and then they sell biometric IDs to get online again they wreck the
[19:17.320 --> 19:21.120]  system they offer the solution and that's already happening so here it is
[19:21.120 --> 19:25.920]  stealing your email and passwords via Wi-Fi isn't that just special so so the
[19:25.920 --> 19:29.840]  government can break into your computers whenever they want because it isn't the
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.680]  government see Google isn't a private company it's a government front but the
[19:34.680 --> 19:38.440]  government it's a front for is a private banking mafia that's why it came out
[19:38.440 --> 19:42.760]  the Federal Reserve private banks are surveilling Occupy Wall Street they
[19:42.760 --> 19:46.880]  mean the real arm of it they don't control not the arm they control calling
[19:46.880 --> 19:50.680]  for communism here's another one Google staff said they were unaware of data
[19:50.680 --> 19:56.240]  gathering FCC says but but here's the kicker the rest of story why is Murdoch
[19:56.240 --> 20:03.760]  in trouble but Google isn't you don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a

[24:44.880 --> 24:52.440]  me just stop right there and again recap this news the federal government what's
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.680]  left of it started an investigation of Google two years ago on Street View
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.160]  they've since dropped it but the findings of it have come out and their own
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.760]  people who would not purge of themselves before Congress came out and said yeah
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.120]  Google is watching and listening and dialing into your phone and dialing
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.880]  into your computer as Google said six years ago in a press release to their
[25:15.880 --> 25:20.320]  shareholders see the criminals that run the government create a private
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.800]  company with technology your taxpayer money paid for to be developed at
[25:24.800 --> 25:30.680]  universities and other institutions through DARPA they take it they create
[25:30.680 --> 25:36.160]  and make it a public NSA snoop system over public data on the web get
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.800]  everybody to opt into it and then make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[25:41.800 --> 25:48.440]  hundreds and still hundreds of billions of dollars last time I checked what is
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.800]  the net worth of Google look that up for me that's a nice factoid you know oh
[25:53.800 --> 25:58.920]  oh oh by the way that's everything that also dovetails with this here's a
[25:58.920 --> 26:05.640]  report from AFP Apple avoiding billions in global taxes report claims oh yeah
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.440]  here in Austin they're gonna be tax-free oh in towns where they've just got a few
[26:10.440 --> 26:16.600]  employees tax-free because a city manager snow to immediately do that and
[26:16.600 --> 26:21.840]  they move up the chain of command as enemy operatives oh but Al Gore's on the
[26:21.840 --> 26:25.720]  board he says our taxes need to be raised you make a hundred and twenty five
[26:25.720 --> 26:31.320]  thousand dollars a year and because you're rich he should be raised there
[26:31.320 --> 26:40.560]  they're exempt now the net worth of Apple is must be in the aggregate close to a
[26:40.560 --> 26:46.440]  trillion dollars you know no no no no that's incorrect it's not 1.5 billion
[26:46.440 --> 26:53.520]  the their executives make billions the stock of it it's it's the biggest
[26:53.520 --> 26:59.560]  company in the world now off and on with Apple and Exxon mobile okay I'll look
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.640]  it up during the break it's all right anyways and of course it fluctuates day
[27:03.640 --> 27:11.720]  to day last time I checked I think it is approaching in assets well over a
[27:11.720 --> 27:15.400]  trillion that's not counting everything leveraged but then you get into what the
[27:15.400 --> 27:25.920]  real power structure and then you've got on top of that on top of that you got
[27:25.920 --> 27:31.200]  the big mega banks that have hundreds of trillions of dollars a month in
[27:31.200 --> 27:36.560]  dollars globally just in the currency speculating markets and you've got 1.5
[27:36.560 --> 27:42.560]  quadrillion and growing globally that's a two-year-old number 1500 trillion in
[27:42.560 --> 27:46.520]  fake garbage derivatives they created that they've had the trader governments
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.200]  sign on to but I'm already digressing the point is Bloomberg Google
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.080]  well here's Washington Post Google engineer told officials Street View
[27:57.080 --> 28:06.280]  cars were collecting personal data FCC report says including well everything
[28:06.280 --> 28:15.320]  everything email passwords banking passwords user names everything but
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.520]  don't worry they've for now dropped the Street View investigation and find them
[28:20.520 --> 28:27.120]  $25,000 boy that'll really make them stop that'd be like if you robbed a bank of
[28:27.120 --> 28:33.280]  $100 billion and they said now you've got to pay me $500 for something now
[28:33.280 --> 28:40.520]  you're gonna rob banks again no sir I will never do that again and they just
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.720]  do this to make it look like the government's actually out there doing
[28:44.720 --> 28:50.120]  the right thing data harvesting at Google not a rogue act report finds New
[28:50.120 --> 28:58.840]  York Times meanwhile Rupert Murdoch his son may be indicted in England they're
[28:58.840 --> 29:02.440]  talking about indicting members of news corps here in the US the Justice
[29:02.440 --> 29:06.400]  Department the people that shipped guns into Mexico and drugs back into the US
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.680]  and hang grenades into Mexico that's AP CBS last week we reported on it six
[29:12.680 --> 29:15.600]  months ago but they reported it so now it's real
[29:15.600 --> 29:20.840]  wow they're not they're not in trouble over the Justice Department but Rupert
[29:20.840 --> 29:24.000]  Murdoch is just just thought I'd point that out I hear it as CBS News
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.960]  Republicans prepare contempt citation against holder overfast and furious
[29:27.960 --> 29:31.360]  course you know Breitbart said he was gonna release Obama at communist
[29:31.360 --> 29:35.440]  meetings they never released that video they released some water down stuff but
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.360]  hey the coroner is coroner did get poisoned and died but they're saying
[29:39.360 --> 29:43.400]  people get poisoned all the time and die maybe it was an accident so there's

[35:09.720 --> 35:14.320]  stance and fire right into their center of mass and if it's a crook with body
[35:14.320 --> 35:19.800]  armor I'm gonna shoot him in the head it's real simple anyways I'm gonna be
[35:19.800 --> 35:24.400]  getting into those reports very good news on that front more on Google spying
[35:24.400 --> 35:30.200]  the incredible news this is good news I hope it's not just show Republicans
[35:30.200 --> 35:34.360]  prepare contempt citation against holder over fast and furious another good
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.080]  good news article New York Times trying to stay in the game actually tells the
[35:38.080 --> 35:42.080]  truth terrorist plots hatched by the FBI admits almost every event they've
[35:42.080 --> 35:45.640]  actually manufactured and commanded them not infiltrating but actually
[35:45.640 --> 35:49.920]  creating the groups and finally mentally ill people see it's one thing to do a
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.840]  sting but you do it with mentally ill or low-grade morons people that are
[35:53.840 --> 36:00.320]  barely I mean they're in the low-grade moron 7580 IQ range and that's who they
[36:00.320 --> 36:04.920]  look for I mean how do you go find some mentally retarded person who's got a
[36:04.920 --> 36:10.200]  75 IQ and set them up I mean I've seen clubs these people in court they're
[36:10.200 --> 36:13.880]  like they don't even they're just don't even know where they are I mean that is
[36:13.880 --> 36:18.600]  so evil but I guess these are just reprobates they want to move up the
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.720]  chain of command and I say how to thank the feds it's better than actually
[36:22.720 --> 36:26.440]  blowing up the world trade centers like they did before and Oklahoma City and
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.800]  Gulf of Tonkin and stuff I mean at least you're just making it up and burning
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.600]  one person or two or three so I guess your power grabbing in a little more
[36:34.600 --> 36:38.760]  loving way you're just setting up innocent people or mentally ill people
[36:38.760 --> 36:43.960]  and it is better than what you usually do so but you know they like to do the
[36:43.960 --> 36:46.520]  more low-tech stuff because they get caught when they do the big boom-booms
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.920]  here's another one right March corner poison to death that's what the police
[36:49.920 --> 36:53.600]  say but hey you know everything's fine everything's fine he's about to release
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.600]  the final report scientists call for rethink on consumption population
[36:58.600 --> 37:02.400]  that's Reuters population reduction here it is scientific American Royal
[37:02.400 --> 37:05.680]  Society calls for redistribution of wealth and more birth control and of
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.520]  course the royal families calling for that via they get a big welfare check of
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.600]  over a billion bucks a year to heat their hundreds of pal hundreds of homes
[37:13.600 --> 37:18.120]  and palaces I mean some palaces have got more than a hundred different homes on
[37:18.120 --> 37:23.440]  them oh you haven't looked that up yeah that's that's welfare old ladies don't
[37:23.440 --> 37:26.600]  get heat and they're told not to take hot baths Prince Charles actually said
[37:26.600 --> 37:32.680]  that two years ago he said don't take a hot shower to be technical and but he's
[37:32.680 --> 37:37.040]  got trains and a bunch of aircraft but that's how it works just for the earth
[37:37.040 --> 37:41.120]  you die and he sits there and is a big fat slug and Robert Redford has a new
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.360]  movie coming out about how Prince Charles is like Jesus literally and they
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.600]  directed statues to him in Brazil saying he's God oh you don't believe me I'm
[37:49.600 --> 37:55.160]  sorry an angel protecting Brazil a golden statue guys will you show the golden
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.120]  statue in Brazil just type in golden statue of Prince Charles in Brazil where
[38:00.120 --> 38:06.160]  he's an angel such a little angel so is Ted Turner he says that we're useful
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.720]  feeders and 90% of us need to be killed at a press dinner or what in 95 or 94
[38:10.720 --> 38:16.040]  was it very nice man of course he has five children biggest landowner in the
[38:16.040 --> 38:21.840]  U.S. and giant aircraft and yachts but you see you're supposed to die not him
[38:21.840 --> 38:30.280]  let me explain how that works for Ted Turner okay let's continue here
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.240]  everything's okay though you can buy your way to heaven the Catholic Church
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.560]  brings back indulgences this is a daily finance and of course that's when they
[38:38.560 --> 38:45.960]  wanted to build st. Peters a silica they call it I guess it was 500 years ago or
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.600]  so it was basically hey tithe give extra money and your family won't go to
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.280]  hell and that got criticized the people in the Catholic Church not just without
[38:55.280 --> 38:59.920]  but but listen I got to say this why is the liberal media so-called liberal
[38:59.920 --> 39:04.880]  media the eugenics media making fun of the Catholic Church doing this to raise
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.080]  money because they're going bankrupt from lawsuits and things when they say pay
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.360]  Al Gore money Lord Rothschild money I mean I see it people have stickers in
[39:14.360 --> 39:20.960]  Austin saying they pay a carbon tax to the Al Gore's company it's the name of
[39:20.960 --> 39:26.120]  his company they pay money to drive a car just here's money Al Gore so you can
[39:26.120 --> 39:29.920]  have you know five houses some of them you know 20,000 square feet whatever
[39:29.920 --> 39:33.520]  you're right on the beach because it was supposed to be under water by now but
[39:33.520 --> 39:39.360]  the level is actually dropping so yeah I think it's stupid to pay Al Gore money
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.680]  to get out of Hades or purgatory I think it's but again Baptist Church I'll tell
[39:44.680 --> 39:48.800]  you you're gonna go to hell if you don't have 10% and I'm all for charity I just
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.320]  I like to give money to children's groups real groups I know that are
[39:53.320 --> 39:58.440]  actually helping children and I like to give money but they're not perfect in
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.640]  Salvation Army but about 90% of the money you give actually gets to them
[40:02.640 --> 40:07.760]  but again they want to tell you no you give your money to the church so the
[40:07.760 --> 40:11.440]  preacher can ride around like a glitter bug all day and go fishing all day so we
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.880]  can set up there and tell you that Romans 13 worship the government but if I
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.080]  could find a church that would speak out against the New World Order and speak
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.680]  out for liberty and tell their flock to get on the street and confront evil and
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.320]  there are some of those I'm giving some money some pro-life cribs if I could find
[40:26.320 --> 40:31.320]  one locally I would give them money I would give them 10% but I mean I can't
[40:31.320 --> 40:38.080]  find them I go to churches and I you know I think there's a spirits there the
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.360]  holy spirits there but it doesn't matter they're still government bootlickers
[40:41.360 --> 40:46.280]  it's like their hearts are right but they are deceived so I just I just don't
[40:46.280 --> 40:50.600]  need to like get the time machine and go back to Soviet Russia in 1949 you know
[40:50.600 --> 40:53.880]  you could go to church then but it would just be a government you know church
[40:53.880 --> 40:57.080]  telling you worship the government I just I just can't do it doesn't matter
[40:57.080 --> 41:03.880]  what church I go to it always gets around a government worship so there you
[41:03.880 --> 41:10.000]  go these days you can get a deal on anything even salvation Pope Benedict
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.880]  is announced that his faithful can once again pay the Catholic Church to ease
[41:13.880 --> 41:18.040]  their way through purgatory and into the gates of heaven never mind that Martin
[41:18.040 --> 41:24.200]  Luther fired up the Reformation because of them plenary indulgences are back
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.200]  the New York Times reports that even through the church officially broke the
[41:28.200 --> 41:34.240]  age-old practice you do do something good the church will help absolve you well
[41:34.240 --> 41:37.920]  I mean I sat in plenty of Baptist churches and others growing up being
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.640]  told if you didn't give 10% you were going to hell I was over visiting my
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.680]  grandmother yesterday before the Sunday show brought her some Chinese food I
[41:45.680 --> 41:49.920]  got lectured about tithing all day which is fine but I mean you know that's
[41:49.920 --> 41:56.680]  religion she said you know she's give that money the Baptist church even though
[41:56.680 --> 42:01.400]  she's too sick most of the time it has too much trouble getting to church she's
[42:01.400 --> 42:05.120]  still doesn't let me know has to doesn't have a lot of money for exactly the type
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.760]  of food she'd like to eat but let me tell you that church is gonna get its money
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.400]  so some glitter bug and ride around a brand new Cadillac all right I said
[42:12.400 --> 42:19.440]  enough Debka file Netanyahu's choice strike I ran before or after Israeli
[42:19.440 --> 42:25.720]  elections got that that's what's good that's all coming up before I spin out
[42:25.720 --> 42:31.360]  of control here we've also got chilling new face of the police we're gonna be
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.200]  getting to that report and how it dovetails with these two reports CBS
[42:35.200 --> 42:41.960]  runs defense for everyone's a terrorist FBI flyers and their headline is are you
[42:41.960 --> 42:47.120]  a terrorist and they say yeah basically in the new America the American people
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.800]  are the bad guys in Homeland Security there's not for al-Qaeda I told you the
[42:52.800 --> 42:58.520]  last four years I've seen the slow rebranding from al-Qaeda the land
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.520]  rights activists second amendment people libertarians conservatives
[43:02.520 --> 43:06.920]  constitutionalist and now they're announcing it they're saying yeah if
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.000]  you're into freedom you're the you're the bad man what watch out and that means
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.240]  they're getting ready to blow stuff up and blame it on us so get ready for the
[43:14.240 --> 43:19.840]  killers to really hurt some innocent people and blame it on those of us that
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.000]  know the globalists are taken over the last time the globalist posing as feds
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.160]  blew up a federal building in April 19th 95 17 years ago the last time they did
[43:31.160 --> 43:38.040]  that it was when states were passing anti UNESCO agenda 21 legislation one
[43:38.040 --> 43:44.120]  state passed it last week another is set to pass at Arizona this week and
[43:44.120 --> 43:48.520]  if I knew the globalist I'm not saying that's where they'll hit but look out
[43:48.520 --> 43:52.520]  Arizona look out federal buildings there we got to see if the feds blow up the
[43:52.520 --> 43:57.120]  federal building and kill some of their own people so they can cry and grandstand
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.440]  and say see criticism us did this you got all the White House memos saying G
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.760]  an Oklahoma bombing would sure make us look good right now geek maybe we need
[44:06.760 --> 44:12.840]  one and when you do blow it up I'm gonna be there with all the documents and all
[44:12.840 --> 44:16.840]  the memos where you said it pointing out you did it you're the suspects I mean
[44:16.840 --> 44:21.360]  think about how dumb they think we are you're already busy shipping hang grenades
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.680]  and 20 plus thousand guns we now learn down into Mexico and shipping them to
[44:25.680 --> 44:31.400]  gangs everywhere but this article dovetails with Curt Nemos article NSI
[44:31.400 --> 44:37.600]  instructional video public photography is terrorism and they're teaching police
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.520]  all over the nation that if you see anybody taking a photo of a cornfield
[44:42.520 --> 44:46.040]  anything they are a terrorist basically citizens are bad the government's gonna
[44:46.040 --> 44:49.320]  shove cameras down your throat and face can you and Google's gonna steal your
[44:49.320 --> 44:52.560]  passcodes and watch you over your home computer and public schools are gonna
[44:52.560 --> 44:55.640]  watch your kids over the laptops when they're in the shower at home to the
[44:55.640 --> 44:58.800]  bathroom door and the government's gonna kidnap children and shove them
[44:58.800 --> 45:02.280]  overseas for snuff films to be taped and it's gonna come out nobody's gonna get
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.640]  in trouble but if you try to film a cornfield you're going to jail so that's
[45:06.640 --> 45:18.280]  all coming up but I just want to say here that we will prevail they are
[45:18.280 --> 45:23.600]  completely panicking and and integrated in with all that after bin Laden al Qaeda
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.840]  essentially gone AFP here's another one the Atlantic bin Laden failure how was
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.480]  llamas in the US ended his war with the West I told you when they came out in
[45:33.480 --> 45:36.400]  the last two years with all these training videos for the feds and then for
[45:36.400 --> 45:40.600]  public where every al Qaeda person is a guy in a John Deere hat or a white guy
[45:40.600 --> 45:46.240]  in a business suit and everyone reporting them is black Hispanic or Asian and
[45:46.240 --> 45:50.600]  homeland security admits yes the new terrorist or white people so get ready
[45:50.600 --> 45:55.080]  for that I kept warning you good old boys I said listen they'll train you
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.520]  first on groups that they think the dominant group the old dying whites are
[45:59.520 --> 46:04.320]  gonna go along with when the middle class which is predominantly white is
[46:04.320 --> 46:07.600]  always the main target of the globalist whatever group they're going into
[46:07.600 --> 46:12.880]  whatever country they if it's Africa they target the middle class group get
[46:12.880 --> 46:16.960]  them to get give away their rights in the name of going after a minority then
[46:16.960 --> 46:21.120]  they overthrow and exterminate the dominant group and so that's the plan
[46:21.120 --> 46:27.120]  and so now it's white al Qaeda time first they segued white al Qaeda now it's
[46:27.120 --> 46:32.960]  just white people and here's another one the Atlantic war on terror is over but
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.040]  the TSA is coming to a street corner near you to grab your wife's breast and
[46:37.040 --> 46:40.560]  your genitals and your daughter's genitals and your son's genitals and they're
[46:40.560 --> 46:44.040]  gonna search your bags without warrant and they're gonna have armored pill boxes
[46:44.040 --> 46:49.240]  and if you get many problems they're gonna open up with 50 cal on you so
[46:49.240 --> 46:54.440]  there you go and al Qaeda openly works for him in a score of nations
[46:54.440 --> 46:59.240]  overthrowing those countries and there and when al Qaeda gets in charge they
[46:59.240 --> 47:03.400]  start having sex with the dead people you think I'm joking that was APD last
[47:03.400 --> 47:08.680]  week yeah when al Qaeda gets in charge through al Qaeda white yeah now the sex
[47:08.680 --> 47:13.560]  with the dead people begins the all the weird behavior begins the burkas the
[47:13.560 --> 47:19.280]  sexual mutilation of the women the murder of the blacks and libya orges of
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.080]  death 40,000 lined up and slaughtered slaughter continuing totally liberal
[47:23.080 --> 47:28.560]  war is peace give Obama a peace pie a peace prize a piece of the murder pie
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.960]  and just total killing everywhere al Qaeda running you know hot and cold running
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.880]  al Qaeda coming out of the woodwork it's wonderful al Qaeda's loving al Qaeda's
[47:36.880 --> 47:42.320]  good the American people are bad and that's basically it toll free number to
[47:42.320 --> 47:50.560]  join us 800 2599231 so again just al Qaeda is now good give your rights up
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.040]  because the John Deere cap wearing white person is evil and it's gonna blow up
[47:56.040 --> 47:58.960]  federal buildings you notice you see that all over the news now why he's gonna
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.760]  blow up buildings why he is evil let's go ahead and talk to Terry in New
[48:04.760 --> 48:10.800]  Mexico you're on the air go ahead welcome hi Alex you're not white are you
[48:10.800 --> 48:13.520]  man because you're with al Qaeda I mean I mean actually you're the new al Qaeda
[48:13.520 --> 48:19.920]  I'm sorry go ahead well actually I may be I have two things first and foremost
[48:19.920 --> 48:23.280]  I've created a new pledge of allegiance that I think is apropos I want to share
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.320]  that with your audience if that's okay yes okay I pledge allegiance to the Fed
[48:28.320 --> 48:33.640]  of the FEMA regions of America and to the global banks for which it stands one
[48:33.640 --> 48:38.400]  nation under debt indivisible with tyranny and indentured servitude for
[48:38.400 --> 48:45.440]  all very well said and you could add in a second verse we praise you for the
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.440]  10,000 plus infold and pediatric cancer we praise you for the 2000 plus cancer
[48:51.440 --> 48:55.960]  increases and other major cancer rips thank you oh gracious for the loving
[48:55.960 --> 49:01.880]  3,000% increase in type 2 diabetes thank you for the what what percentage is it
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.800]  from 25,000 to 158 of autism thank you for the curses thank you for the death
[49:06.800 --> 49:10.520]  thank you for turning the public into gibbering idiots thank you for all the
[49:10.520 --> 49:13.960]  humiliation and pain thank you for destroying America's good name worldwide
[49:13.960 --> 49:21.920]  thank you thank you thank you how's that sound that sounds great Alex I'll make an amendment and the
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.200]  second thing I wanted to say is that there's a lot of talk going amongst the
[49:26.200 --> 49:32.320]  FBI about radiological attacks implemented by sovereign citizens and
[49:32.320 --> 49:38.880]  they're talking about how troxler gauges which are used in construction
[49:38.880 --> 49:44.360]  they're going to take materials out of there to make radiological devices that
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.680]  could be detonated in major cities so there's a lot of talk about that so
[49:47.680 --> 49:51.600]  that definitely goes with the false flag that you've been discussing with all of
[49:51.600 --> 50:03.240]  us expand on that well it I can't really get too much into where I get this
[50:03.240 --> 50:06.960]  information from but basically what it comes down to is that there has been a
[50:06.960 --> 50:13.440]  lot of chatter concerning the creation of radiological exposure devices and
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.920]  they've been talking a lot about how some of these devices like troxler gauges
[50:17.920 --> 50:22.800]  which are used in construction have been stolen and that these materials that are
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.720]  cesium I believe is within those devices could be used to create so basically

[55:18.680 --> 55:25.880]  coach football is mimicking real warfare real history it's the facsimile or
[55:25.880 --> 55:32.480]  the representation of the real thing you understand that that's why the
[55:32.480 --> 55:38.200]  analogies give themselves to being involved civically we could turn this
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.520]  around we have begun to turn it around because we knew it was coming we were
[55:42.520 --> 55:46.680]  there to be made fun of an attack to warn people and now we've got the

[56:30.760 --> 56:36.120]  okay I'm getting rolling I'll get to your calls Eric in Pennsylvania you're on
[56:36.120 --> 56:43.600]  the air welcome. Yes Alex. Yes sir. It's an honor to speak to you. I'm calling to let you know I was at the
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.800]  Ron Paul rally in Pittsburgh like a week ago and the line to get into the Ron Paul
[56:48.800 --> 56:55.400]  show actually wrapped around the whole city block in Pennsylvania so I mean what
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.760]  I have to ask you is there's a situation going on right now where I feel like
[56:59.760 --> 57:03.800]  there's gonna be an event happening at the 2012 Olympics I feel like they're
[57:03.800 --> 57:08.000]  gonna do something at the native summit in Chicago and I have a feeling they're
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.040]  gonna hit us with a trifecta with the economic collapse afterwards. What's
[57:12.040 --> 57:18.960]  your insight on any of that? I'm sorry sir my my feed from you was breaking up
[57:18.960 --> 57:27.040]  what did you just say? Others may have heard it I just had some breakup. Okay well
[57:27.040 --> 57:34.760]  I lost the caller. Okay what was he talking about John? I was trying to
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.960]  catch what he was saying there but we'll go to break and come back here by the
[57:39.960 --> 57:44.440]  way our website is not infowarstore you know I'm always just saying go to
[57:44.440 --> 57:49.120]  infowarstore.com click on the shopping link it's infowarstore.com but I saw
[57:49.120 --> 57:55.840]  they made a graphic that said that and so I was going with that but it's just
[57:55.840 --> 57:58.360]  you know what sometimes I think there's just too much going on around here and
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.680]  we should do a lot less and just make sure it's all quality. I mean I'm really
[58:02.680 --> 58:06.160]  trying to work on that because it's like we're in a batting cage having a hundred
[58:06.160 --> 58:11.200]  different balls shot at us a minute and maybe we could hit ten balls a minute
[58:11.200 --> 58:16.000]  but we sure can't hit a hundred and I mean we probably won't even change that
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.160]  it is the thing it'll probably stay there and be that's the feeling of defeat
[58:20.160 --> 58:23.320]  that's what people are always oh you're doing such a great job I've got all this

[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.680]  right now at Lake Superior I understand that this war it's something that a lot
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.200]  of people understand Michigan was taken over 30 years gone the water rate
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.000]  everybody that's right the Chinese and European ships and others pull in take
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.840]  your water and take it right out and in some cases taxpayers even have to pay
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.640]  for the infrastructure for the ships to dock and do it yep and this isn't
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.320]  something that is a Michigan problem there's no state lines on this this
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.280]  these waterway feeds over half the United States being a bet I can see the
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.480]  strategic battleground what they have done in a strategic battleground
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.240]  what have the traders done they gave them the Panama Canal they gave tax
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.280]  incentives to ship our jobs to China and when they couldn't kill GM that way
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.880]  they took it over and paid billions to ship the factories to China foreign
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:04.720]  enemies couldn't do this good no no the Lord told us it was coming hey this but
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.480]  we have to stop state lines country lines everything this is a worldwide
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.720]  problem we need to get together this is going to be one big fight let's get
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.760]  ready for it the other thing is as I see people with a lot of problems I'm
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.520]  trying to get the word out to people if we just stop and listen guy God will
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:27.320]  guide us into what these people's tyranny is really hitting them hard like my
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.680]  neighbors they I mean I have never seen depression so bad as what it is here in
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.560]  the state of Michigan after they stole their jobs feeding everybody now and
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:41.560]  everything else and when when you look at the what you can research which we
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.640]  are if you're an info warrior you are a researcher if you listen to these people's
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.800]  problems you know where to go research and help these people once you get these
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.400]  people hooked and you can show them that change in their diet and stuff like
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.240]  this the little thing that they can do now you got them hooked the fight isn't
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:04.000]  a lot easier than well I agree the public's drunk on fluoride drunk on GMO
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.160]  if you can just get people off that and stop watching as much television and
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:14.320]  explain to them why things are falling apart this is a designed depression they
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.400]  paid to ship the vault and Cadillac factories out of Michigan and to move
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:27.280]  them to China you paid paid in the 20-plus billion to General Motors to
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.920]  ship it to Brazil China Eastern Europe and Mexico on record you cannot get more
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.280]  traderist than that and you pay for the drones you pay for the SWAT teams you pay
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:43.040]  for the armored vehicles you pay to be squeezed and that's where we're going a
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.880]  collapse by design and people are finally gonna wake up when it comes to
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.000]  their area but California Michigan other areas the globalists have just done
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.480]  everything they can to destroy you the California was taken because all the
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.120]  food that's being grown there I mean either they cut off the water they go
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.720]  oh there's a sucker fish that didn't even from this country we're gonna just cut
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.120]  off these big mountain legs you can't have the water they're like but we've
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.960]  owned this ranch for a hundred years and they go shut up you can sell it to us
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.880]  for pennies on the dollar because they're gonna build on it later and then
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.800]  people are finally after five years at six years having their water turned off
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.000]  it's been going longer than that they're selling out and now they're gonna turn
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.120]  that water back on it's how these agenda 21 crooks work can you believe how
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.240]  criminal this scum is I'll watch them do it right here in Austin right I've seen

[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.440]  there for 14 years I came back home because this is where I'm from I know
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.520]  that it take an animal out of its natural territory doesn't survive very
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.800]  long so I had to come home anybody anybody that thinks their ranch or
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.640]  farm is safe if development comes your way they will discover a cave bug they
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.880]  will take it they'll turn around and build on it you don't like it a SWAT team

[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:07.200]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:15.160]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we are continuing with
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:19.960]  your phone calls if you just joined us at the end of the last hour for some
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.240]  reason my line was breaking up but listeners were able to hear it and
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.040]  Aaron Dyches was able to hear it as I was asking what the last thing the caller
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.920]  said was I heard the first part Aaron says I heard the caller fine he
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.920]  suggested that something would happen at the Olympics and or Chicago NATO
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:44.080]  Summit a possible trifecta with the bad economy yeah a lot of people are
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.960]  calling us including police officers on air and saying nuclear power plants are
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:57.680]  on alert during the summit the NATO summit in Chicago coming up we're
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.160]  getting reports they're going to be on alert at Camp David on the east coast
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.800]  and police we're talking to are being told that they're being told look for
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.360]  something big to happen this goes on all the time just because they're on alert
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.280]  doesn't mean something's going to happen the prime suspects will be the
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.960]  globalist funding a group or staging something on their own that's why the
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.480]  minute something happens in your area you've got to be there with cameras
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.760]  immediately getting what really happens we've had so many cases now where our
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:37.000]  listeners end up exposing that the globalist staged events one of the most
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:46.040]  famous examples of this or best known is the example of what happened with
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.280]  Kurt Haskell and his wife seeing the government get the underwear bomber on
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.800]  the plane in Amsterdam and of course there was no other source of that until
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.320]  a month and a half later the government admitted it in congressional
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:03.880]  testimony just incredible information speaking of drones chief drones
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:10.400]  certainly coming to skies over Beltway WTOP radio is reporting look up
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.200]  drones are certainly coming to the skies over the Beltway the next few years
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.400]  one area police chief said yeah all over the country the drones are coming
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.240]  you're gonna pay for them doesn't matter if you go bankrupt that's the plan more
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.440]  police more checkpoints more tyranny but all over the country the police are
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.600]  announcing they're only gonna revenue generate now in some areas sheriff's
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:35.840]  departments are saying we will only revenue generate we will not respond
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.520]  buy a gun some have been truthful but the good news that I mentioned at the end
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.280]  of the last hour dovetails of what the last caller was saying about how the
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.840]  Great Lakes are under a UN treaty and foreign countries just come and take
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:56.240]  whatever they want of one of the biggest supplies and reservoirs of clean
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:05.600]  water fresh water on terra firma 75% roughly of the world is salt water on
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:12.640]  the surface and a little over 1% is fresh water and that's the fresh water
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.720]  that's on the surface they estimate there's another one or two percent I
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.320]  mean if you were were to bring to the surface that is fresh in aquifers but
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.040]  the point is is that this is a big deal here it is agenda 21 this is MSNBC
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.240]  they're very upset Arizona close to passing anti-UN sustainability bill
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:36.560]  Arizona lawmakers appear to pass a tea party back bill that proponents say
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.560]  would stop UN takeover conspiracy but the critics claim could end the states
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.640]  cities pollute pollution fighting efforts and even dismantle state
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:53.560]  unemployment office folks we're under agenda 21 they Bush senior couldn't get
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.160]  us to sign on to it but they had the bureaucracy adopted that's why it's
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:03.000]  standardized the same police state environmental stuff that they have in
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.080]  Germany that they have in Brazil that they have in Canada that they have in
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:15.160]  Australia is agenda 21 from the UN and it has nothing to do with the
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.240]  environment it means you've got to get permission to do anything and they can
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.520]  shut down anybody they want and it goes on the bill is designed to protect the
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.520]  rights of Arizona citizens and prevent encroachment on those rights by
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.800]  international institutions it goes on and and they try to say oh it's a
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:38.840]  conspiracy theory no agenda 21 is real that's why city councils and states are
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.760]  passing laws against it and counties okay you just saying it doesn't exist and
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.840]  we're crazy doesn't work anymore by the way do a plug right here for everybody

[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.200]  real sustainability this is about shutting you down making you dependent
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.280]  all available at info wars.com okay enough from me the point is there's
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:33.160]  some really good news Matt in Germany thanks for holding her on the air hello
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:40.560]  yes sir hi Alex long-time listener I'm currently in Frankfurt right now I'm
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:45.360]  from Minnesota and I will be back there in about a month and I just wanted to
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.520]  call I make YouTube videos all the time supporting Ron Paul and actually my
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.120]  videos have been featured on your info or site about three times now and it's
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:59.800]  just been a great help to reach a larger audience I made a video today talking
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:06.440]  about this really key topic about Ron Paul there's a debate going on right now
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:12.320]  on how we can make sure Mitt Romney does not win on the first round ballot and
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.840]  what I've come up with is that if you are a Ron Paul supporter but a Mitt Romney
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:23.520]  delegate you could actually abstain through the first ballot and then move
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.760]  on to the second and you are actually unbound and then you can choose to vote
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.480]  for Ron Paul there's some conflicting reports out there saying that if you
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:40.600]  abstain you actually give up your right to vote but the RNC is under the House
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:46.760]  of Representatives the law on the floor it's not Robert's order so could you
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:51.680]  actually vote to present like Obama did on many key issues when he was in the
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.320]  House of Representatives he voted present to not actually have to give a yes
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.920]  or no on a bill could we do that but let's stop right there I mean I don't
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.120]  mind plugging your video because we're actually preparing a report on the
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.680]  delegate strategy but the media is going to try to frame as a stratagem which
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:17.600]  means a deceptive tool of war or a or a manipulation Ron Paul I don't think and
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.600]  it's okay to give suggestions folks that's not attacking Ron Paul hasn't
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.720]  given a clear strategy of what he plans to do when he does get the majority of
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.200]  the delegates which he's moving towards because he is capturing through the
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.600]  electoral process in most these states the majority of delegates what he's
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.160]  going to do when the media spins it and says he's trying to block the popular
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.000]  vote which has always been honored he's not explaining that and he's not even
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  really clearly saying once we get there I'm going to ask for this or I'm going
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.720]  to ask to be in the cabinet or I'm going to ask I mean I know there's some talk
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.600]  about trying to block and contest Romney at the convention and if that's the case
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.320]  I think that's great because Romney's not going to be his friend Romney's not
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.080]  going to help him if he did put him on the cabinet he would be ignored and
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.800]  discredited I don't think Ron Paul is going to do that yeah I am for a big
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:19.480]  fracas I am for Ron Paul getting in to the convention and absolutely taking it
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:25.080]  over and turning it into a ten ring circus my only issue is I haven't seen
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.720]  Ron Paul I'm not criticizing him he's done a great job overall supporting
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.920]  they'll love the work he's doing I'm glad he ran and you can't beg somebody to
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.240]  run and then sit there and get mad at him when they don't do everything you do
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.800]  but I'd be up there saying impeach Obama for war crimes impeach Obama for
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.920]  violating the articles of the Constitution where Congress has to
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.740]  authorize war treason for saying the UN's his authority I mean Ron Paul if I
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.560]  was Ron Paul I'd be saying that I'd be calling for a for an abolishment of the
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.200]  Fed now I while he's at the pinnacle of the attention he'll ever get I would be
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.800]  like a bull in the china shop now he is doing that he talked about false flags
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.640]  in Austin and admitted the government can stage terror attacks unprecedented
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.960]  he's talking about the CIA coup over America and government drug dealing so
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.320]  he is so so I'm not watching all the speeches and all fairness the media may
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.720]  just be ignoring him now the point is is that it's time for him to really at least
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.960]  one of these national shows cause a bigger fracas and and fricassee the new
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.680]  world order to continue with that nomenclature and so I mean what do you
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:35.680]  get what do you think the main strategy is with the delegates well honestly what
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.600]  I think a lot has happened I believe that there has been a ton of Ron Paul
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.640]  supporters that have actually became stealth Romney delgast and Torm delgast
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.040]  or gingrich delgast I believe that we have the most dedicated most just
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.920]  persistent people out there no I agree I love the fact that nobody's giving up
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.760]  like four years ago and they get now that we win by resisting we will get in
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.480]  the middle of everything I think that's wonderful then I'm gonna fully get
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.040]  behind the delegate process I agree I think that's what's happening we should
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:11.200]  just absolutely turn that attempt by a bunch of blue blood country club new
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.880]  world order Rockefeller Republicans we should turn it into an absolute route
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.120]  and and just explode their propaganda function in their face with
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:30.720]  constitutional libertarian volcanic explosions of fire politically if we do
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.080]  have that many stealth delegates in there and we have the majority we then
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.600]  can take a vote and make it so we unbound all of the delegates before the
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.360]  first ballot so you can vote on your conscience you can vote for who you
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.720]  actually want by the way the founders did that in case when you get to the
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.600]  convention you find out the guy's a stinker they put all sorts of sabotages
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.720]  in there in the system to empower the people and the founders thought if they
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.920]  want to be delegates they were involved they trusted the will of hundreds and
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.040]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who are delegates over the will
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.360]  the party insiders so they built all these booby traps in there weren't they
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:16.280]  geniuses oh for sure I mean they just made sure that there was a back door
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.240]  right there so there's a way out if something bad would happen but you know
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.120]  what a booby trap is a booby is a pirate it means a pirate trap I'm sorry go
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:31.840]  ahead tell us the name of your video tell us the name of your video well the
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.440]  name of the video my channel let's be in yeah you might want to give that out to
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.720]  be effective just just come on okay my channel name is Matt Larson 10 it's just
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:48.320]  one T Matt Larson 10 and the title to the video is the key to getting Ron Paul
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.280]  elected abstained from first ballot voting now okay I gotta check into that
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.600]  I'm not I don't understand that enough but I'm I'm not saying you're wrong but

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:39.840]  of death Breitbart corner turns up dead arsenic poisoning but the police are
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.680]  saying he was poisoned but they're saying maybe it was an accident you know
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:48.160]  it's no big deal everything's fine also authorities refuse to disclose the
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:52.800]  tales of Chicago evacuation plan Paul Joseph Watson I'm getting calls about
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.200]  this going where are you getting this is this is this real yeah it's CBS news is
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:02.960]  where it first came from we're just reporting on it does that mean they're
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.520]  gonna evacuate Chicago no but they're saying it's unprecedented and we've had
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.080]  police contact it's not just the ones on air you've heard but others saying
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.960]  they're getting told look for something to happen and I've always said with
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.040]  preconditioning propaganda I've seen it looks like the establishment may be
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:24.720]  looking at hitting Chicago I've always said that the last five years or so also
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.360]  told you TSA start being in highway checkpoints they have armored pill boxes
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:35.000]  those have all been ordered and purchased now how'd I know sometimes it takes
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.640]  them a lot longer to get things done but Bill Clinton said in 1998 and I have
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.640]  the article in my film police day 2000 that they would have armored checkpoints
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.520]  and internal passports in America and then I saw Homeland Security say it in
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:54.960]  2002 so it's not people are like how does he know he he's got to be CIA no I've
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.960]  got to watch c-span and read books and read documents that's the thing they
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.680]  just hope you're ignorant and call anybody who's informed a conspiracy
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:09.320]  theorist and so what if MSNBC with a half million viewers maximum starts
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.200]  making fun of the legislature of Arizona and other legislatures that are
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:21.480]  passing laws against agenda 21 it doesn't matter it's real we're this UN
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:27.080]  takeover is real the UN agenda 21 is real the biospheres are real the power
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:33.600]  grabbing is real it's real so they just keep using this this this old trick of
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.960]  conspiracy theory be like if you walked up to your house and somebody was
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.320]  walking out with your computer your laptop your jewelry you know your wife's
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:47.640]  jewelry and you looked at them you said hey man what are you doing my house they
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:50.840]  said conspiracy theory I don't exist you're like yeah you do that's my
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.720]  computer conspiracy theory you're seeing things this isn't real you'd be like
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.200]  listen pal I'm calling 911 right now of course if you were coming in your house
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:05.040]  with a gun you'd just say hands up didn't have a gun so what it'd be
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.680]  clobbered in time about the third time they said quit being a conspiracy
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:16.520]  theorist it'd be put my stuff down I'm gonna break your nose right now I mean
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.920]  how long will we put up with them treating us like we're idiots oh there's
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.400]  no drones over the US I remember in the last decade with drones all over the
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.760]  place and and blamps and all this other crud and spy satellites admittedly
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.520]  watching us illegally because it's illegal to have spy satellites watching
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.840]  the American people it's illegal to have the UN operating domestically it's
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.520]  illegal to have the president serving as the head of the UN Security Council
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.520]  it's it's illegal to have him launch wars without congressional approval it's
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.840]  illegal to have torture it's illegal for the government to ship drugs in it's
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.800]  illegal for them to lie and tell you it's the law you got to take shots but
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.120]  they do it it's illegal that all over this country they take 10 11 12 year olds
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:00.520]  and give them abortions and never tell mommy it happened then the kids get sick
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:06.920]  and get infections and die so it ends up in the news I've seen cases of public
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.360]  schools government training camps aborting girls that have you know a
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.560]  love who are 11 and they get an infection and get sick and then the
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.080]  parents go you gave my kid an abortion you told them not to tell me when I said
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.880]  no and you took them and did a medical procedure they can't take your child to

[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.600]  billboard right there he'll handle it he'll handle it for you i mean this is
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.960]  show elementary we've got this report at info wars.com
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.240]  cbs runs defense for everyone's a terrorist
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.920]  fbi flyers i'm going to play that when bruce finds on we have a little clip
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.200]  from the news because it's not enough to have the name of the peace be
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:28.520]  are you a terrorist i want you to hear cbs news say are you a terrorist
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.280]  wearing blue jeans taking photos talking on a cell phone
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.480]  it's reasonable actually to believe everyone's a terrorist they're telling
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.720]  us but it's not al-qaeda though it's the new domestic groups and in all the
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.320]  homeland security promo videos it's only white people that are
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:47.000]  terrorists you know Arabs and Muslims complain that when
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.600]  terrorism was talked about it was it was always only them shown
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.440]  and we're in the official narrative it it is the Muslims you know supposedly
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.440]  involved in all the terrorism or most of it this narrative it's completely made
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.520]  up they go oh oklahoma city oh yes uh and i guess that was white
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:07.560]  terrorist i mean i guess the fbi guys we know we're
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.240]  involved in the atf guys i guess pretty much all of them were
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.600]  were white well the attorney the deputy attorney general
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.560]  i mean is he really black
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:23.400]  eric holder i guess it was mainly white people involved in that so okay
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.560]  interesting uh so we've got that report coming up right now let's just rush
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.680]  through calls that means probably one call the next 30 minutes but let's rush

[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.560]  go ahead you're on the air hey everybody thanks for having me on
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.320]  i appreciate it a real quick in the interest of time if i could just go over a
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.000]  couple points and ask you a question sure uh first of all you uh the blanket
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.760]  statement that the minister that called here recently he was concerned about
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.000]  with the clergy response team i can tell you how to blanket
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.920]  all of those people really easily anyone any organization that's
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:26.680]  501 c3 tax extort tax exempt non-profit organization you can
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:32.600]  bet they're the clergy response team um also st peters cathedral indulgences
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.720]  two of those if you do not if you do a little bit of digging
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.320]  two of those were for a few dollars you could rape a virgin sometime in the
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.920]  future and for a little more than double that you can murder someone in the
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:46.040]  future and get away with it that's how st peters cathedral
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.560]  was built wow i didn't know that i'll have to look into that but that's wild
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.560]  so you're saying it was actually a license to do bad stuff
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:58.280]  yes yeah exactly that that is exactly i wonder if we can start paying al gore
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.320]  like like like because we pay him carbon indulgences
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.320]  could we pay al gore to rob a bank like he says it's okay i mean i guess that's
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.440]  what it means when you give the government campaign contributions they
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.240]  let you commit crimes i mean congress got caught insider
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:14.520]  trading so they just said oh we're allowed to of course they're not allowed
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.040]  to it's against the law but they just say it's okay so it must be
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:23.880]  kind of like tortures okay yeah yeah exactly exactly this is a new united
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.880]  states yeah tortures fine al qaeda's in the cheese don't worry about it
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:33.880]  um anyway sorry about that i like that al qaeda's in the cheese
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:40.120]  what does that mean but uh anyway one more thing to um
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:43.640]  you said uh you was talking about uh i want to go real quick with the ties
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.480]  thing the tax for the church is real quick yes if you look into that the
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.480]  ties are our responsibility to give to the poor the widows and the orphans
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.560]  to divvy out uh the whole thing of giving your ties to the church
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.000]  was a whole ordeal of you're too stupid to know
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.320]  what to do with your 10 give it to us we'll spend it correctly for you
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:08.280]  so that's how by the way that makes sense if citizens gave 10 it would lift
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.680]  up the whole economy around them if you help the orphans the needy
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:15.560]  and then you wouldn't need government and that's how it was always done
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.320]  they told my dad when he went to dental school they said about a third of what
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.640]  you do should be basically free uh lab work and things like that
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.160]  they're gonna have to pay for or you should work with a charity to do that
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.240]  but about a third of the work you do should be free
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.640]  ron paul would go volunteer a third of the time at charity hospitals
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:37.720]  and do work for free and and people run tv ads about it and say what an angel he
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.920]  was and but the point is that that was standard
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.080]  that's what we have dr blalock on he says it's a lot that people don't get
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:48.440]  healthcare sure do you get some you know thousand
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.840]  dollar a shot remicade for your crone's disease uh if you don't have
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:55.480]  insurance maybe not but it doesn't help you anyways
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.360]  you know i mean there's examples like that i happen to know about the medical
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.920]  system i've talked to countless doctors i've researched it
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:04.120]  it's all a hoax but once there's government healthcare
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:10.200]  like in england other places they actually take brock lesnar the the uh
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.480]  you know cage fighter guy the mlm whatever you call it fighter i'm
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.000]  i'm having one of those mind mind uh well they call it mindfarts what do you
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.640]  call it whenever you can't i'm having an early onset of
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:30.120]  alzheimer's moment here ufc fighter there we go thank you the ufc
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.720]  fighter he had a stomach perforation or gut perforation
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:37.560]  up in canada and almost died he said because he couldn't get healthcare
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.320]  they wouldn't get in for the surgery they just told him oh you're fine go home
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.720]  that's what they do in england watchin was sick for a month with a chest cold
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.160]  and they just gave him a little pack with some bandages and some Tylenol and
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.640]  said go home you're fine without even looking at him
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.080]  and he said i want to go see a private doctor no we're not authorizing that
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:01.000]  that's what this is it's eugenics people have no idea that they're about to wreck
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.440]  our healthcare system people say oh the healthcare system's going bankrupt
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.040]  because the country's dying because people are diseased
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:12.680]  because people are unhealthy they're being killed okay and then even heroic
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.880]  healthcare can't save them i'm sorry go ahead sir
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.720]  oh you're fine you're fine i agree with you 100 on all those

[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:47.400]  well that's big news i mean i know that obama said you're going to have

[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.160]  even longer and then intensify the brainwashing

[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:18.760]  to nearby uh indiana but that's been part of a plan
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:22.440]  they use any globalist meeting to practice taking over the city and
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.640]  setting up martial law this is done everywhere

[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.000]  and to hide their identity when they're committing crimes
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.280]  and look at the look on this guy's face getting off on it
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.720]  acting tough stomping around wanting to scare people

[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.240]  and the only reason we're not in full martial law is because the military is

[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:39.240]  something and you actually wear it for that but i've seen the police chiefs
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:42.920]  admit it's for intimidation when they pull up big black tanks and get out in

[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:02.040]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:05.480]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:09.640]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:15.480]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:19.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:23.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.160]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:50.120]  go ahead you're on the air hey alex uh full from
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:53.640]  kemer region nine from in california uh wanted to call
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:58.600]  and discuss two things one is um with the bill de berg meeting that's coming up
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.480]  uh seems to me that the best thing we could do is emulate what we know has
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:05.800]  worked in the past um with the success of of stifling the bill de berg
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.840]  meeting in switzerland um i think it would be a fantastic
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.280]  opportunity for us to take uh the network of people that are
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.880]  celebrities um as well as won paul et cetera and
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:20.040]  try and form a group to um arrest and campaign against the uh
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:24.200]  the people that we know are perpetrating um the you know the atrocities
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:29.400]  and and the uh the agenda um i think alex you know you're obviously a
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.960]  person who has a network of those people so i i'm personally more than happy to
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.480]  as i'm sure all the listeners to try and um help execute that as much as
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:41.240]  possible but the problem is is we need people who have the the network of
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:44.520]  making pull together those individuals and someone like you could
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:48.200]  obviously be the you know kind of a help uh be the ringleader for that
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:53.000]  be a ringleader for specifically what organize people to infiltrate things
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.560]  uh well to to create the um basically having the the network to pull together
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:01.480]  ron paul let's say uh you know the different celebrities and people who
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:05.640]  are um uh highly visible with regards to uh to
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.240]  different movements and and pull them together so that way we can we can go
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:14.120]  to i thought you were talking at first about
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:19.080]  sneaking into bohemian grove and stuff like that no i'm saying specifically
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.680]  the builder group meeting that's coming up
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.520]  the end of this month um we know how the swiss basically they said senators
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:27.880]  uh or their their equivalent i should say went to the to the builder group
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:30.680]  meeting and tried to arrest individuals and said hey
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:34.200]  you know not in our country um we should be doing the same thing here
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:38.040]  basically creating a list of what the uh the crime against humanity are that
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:41.640]  i'll be honest with you i want to i want to totally confirm they're going to be
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.960]  there first we we we we think that's well i'd say i'm 95 percent
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:50.280]  sure tuckers 99 so he's probably right but i don't want well now we're just
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:53.800]  giving it away here i don't want to specifically
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.200]  rattle their cage too much or they'll move it or cancel it or have 500 cops
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:01.480]  out there and yes if we could get a member of
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:05.800]  congress to go in there and and demand to be let in that would be the moral
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.720]  authority i'm not looking for a confrontation
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.800]  with the plain clothes marines uh that are going to be there and that's who's
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.840]  going to be there and state department protective detail
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:20.440]  don't worry they'll be trying to set people up and stuff it it's it's real
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.680]  is what i'm telling you uh and uh i'm going to be there to try
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.600]  to draw attention to them you know the the stuff of trying to arrest carl
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:33.720]  rove or or things like that i'd rather get the shadowy
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:37.800]  group exposed so that in the future we know who to arrest
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:41.720]  and we're getting to that level and i think it's great
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:45.800]  i mean once we confirm it is going to be there in virginia
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.080]  i was planning in the next week or two to start organizing
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.840]  not only uh thousands of people to be there to protest
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:57.640]  but also a rally against them and i also plan to stop at a few places along
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:00.680]  the way i was thinking about noxville tennessee one of our
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.960]  affiliates there and you have a speech before i got there uh so yes i just
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:08.280]  didn't exactly want to tell bill de berg
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:11.800]  uh what i was planning until they got a little bit closer to it but i guess we
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:17.400]  are about a month out right now uh but i'm not planning uh
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.200]  you know to try to have them arrested or anything because i think that would
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:25.480]  result that would result um result in something the
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:28.840]  other way around i would rather just absolutely ruin
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:33.160]  their event and draw attention to it and show how the corporate whore
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:40.760]  well keep calling them names they're the sympathizer collaborator media
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:45.240]  they're the banker sympathizer media they're the foreign banker occupation
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.200]  enemies and and i do think when we take the country back
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.320]  there needs to be criminal charges for all of them this is aiding and abetting
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:54.600]  the overthrow of our free sovereign republic i mean i think
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:58.360]  christ matthew's all of them should go to prison i'll say it right now
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:00.920]  well they're right back

[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:33.480]  campaign we're always very thankful that he takes out time
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.920]  on his busy schedule he's also been a constitutional advisor
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:42.760]  uh to congress and members of congress and is a best-selling author
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.120]  he's also been special assistant to the attorney general for the office of
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:50.040]  legal counsel and the assistant attorney general for antitrust
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:53.000]  a general counsel the federal communications commission counseled to

[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.360]  visiting fellow for the constitutional studies at the heritage foundation adjunct
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.680]  scholar the american enterprise institute guest
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.960]  lecture at the brookings institute just to name a few
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:09.000]  of his laurels just an amazing constitutional
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.160]  mind and we'll tell you about some of his books as well including the latest
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:16.200]  one but uh he also graduated with honors from
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:22.520]  harvard law school in 1972 where he went on to clark for prestigious federal court
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:25.480]  but the reason i wanted to get him on was to talk about a host of issues the
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.520]  ron paul campaign uh so we can understand some of the
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:33.320]  strategies that are taking place right now where he sees that going
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:38.360]  but also i want to get into this legislation that may pass the house
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:44.840]  it's passed the senate for the irs to strip a right of the passport
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.040]  because a citizen can't give up their i mean government can't take your
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:51.960]  citizenship you have to give it up yourself uh for my uh constitutional
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.400]  understanding so to say they're going to strip it extra judicially
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:59.800]  can you even take a passport of a felon no i mean this is really dangerous and
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:04.760]  this tsa on the streets checkpoints searching bags in dallas and houston
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:09.880]  and now i've been told they're coming to austin i mean i that's illegal i'm
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:15.160]  going to resist feds out of their jurisdiction randomly
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:19.000]  in some cases with the army just setting up checkpoints and searching people i'm
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.360]  not doing it this is lawlessness so i want to get his
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.800]  take on that and obama and the wars and telling congress he
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:33.800]  can take a hike in fact uh a mr fine we haven't had
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.400]  you on in the last month or so since that incredible video that i know you and
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:40.600]  congressman ron paul spoke about because i've seen your comments but i'd like to
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:44.040]  hear him hear let's start there before we get into ron paul
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:46.920]  and then uh there's some points you want to go over
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.840]  what do you make of the joint chiefs of staff chairman
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:57.320]  the secretary of defense panetta going before the senate
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.640]  arm service committee and saying we don't come to you to launch wars now
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.720]  we get it from the un so it's bad enough of the president like caesar said
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:09.160]  i'm in control the military the senate can take a hike you know that that's
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:12.680]  rubicon behavior but but imagine if caesar said
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:16.120]  i work for the galls or i work for the vizagoths now or
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:19.080]  or or or i work for the persians that would be
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.080]  high treason would it not be i mean this is beyond
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:28.200]  uh caesar type activity as bad as hitler was absolutely terrible uh hitler
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:32.760]  uh was the german dictator but but imagine if he would have been
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.200]  saying i have the authority from stalling that would have even been
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.960]  another level or am i incorrect in common law
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:43.640]  common sense constitutional law what do you call it
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:47.240]  when the president sends letters last year and says i'll launch wars when i
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.080]  feel like it how dare you criticize me i have you an authority and now
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:56.440]  the military belligerently tells congress uh that they can basically go
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:00.200]  jump in the lake what what are you advising congress on right now
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.640]  well that's in fact one of the things that i've done in the interim
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:08.520]  i've drafted a house concurrent resolution it's 107 for your
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.120]  audience introduced by uh walter jones that
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:15.320]  at least has congress stating quite unequivocally
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:19.080]  it is an impeachable offense a high crime and misdemeanor under article
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:23.400]  two sections for the constitution for the president unilaterally
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:28.440]  to initiate the military uh in an offensive warfare
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:32.120]  so we have a clear declaration you have now
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.720]  basically violated your oath of office and need to be removed
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:40.280]  uh if he ever acted he's already done he's already acted on that way in libya
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.520]  and most recently now he's he's he's what we would call
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:50.840]  unrestricted predator drone warfare in yemen against even unnamed targets
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.080]  that we reassured are high-level high-level officials like the 16-year-old
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.840]  son of alaki uh without any congressional authority
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.320]  whatsoever and notice also alex when we were reading
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.040]  in the last week about the proposed 10-year extension of the united states
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.400]  military and economic aid to afghanistan running from
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:17.160]  20,014 to 2024 there we have the headlines the parties that
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:19.960]  have to ratify the agreement that still has details
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:23.960]  it's listed as president hamlet cars they have afghanistan
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:27.560]  the afghanistan parliament and president obama
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:30.840]  congress doesn't even make a cameo appearance you know it's like
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:34.760]  they have been reduced to an implant and the constitutional system when they're
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:38.280]  supposed to be the the the check on abuses and
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:42.200]  and uh empire mentality that causes the budget to skyrocket and
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.040]  and engage in these uh fools errands that make us less safe
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:50.680]  and create enemies uh and i mean it's it's really almost
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:56.120]  it makes me speechless uh to know how clear the founding fathers were
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.440]  on entrusting these national security responsibilities to congress because
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:05.000]  they distrusted the executives inclination there to go to war to
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.560]  concott conflict because the executive gets all the power the secrecy the money
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:13.560]  the spending the jingoism and whatever to see that intent
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:18.120]  turned on its head and then when the what's even more stunning than your
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:22.440]  chronicling of what the the military and the chief's pastal congress says
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:26.120]  someone's standing up and said sir because you can impeach members of the
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.000]  military and you also have official uh duet and and and as well as the
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.480]  president you have now announced that you are not
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:36.920]  loyal to the constitution we're going to impeach and remove you from office
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:42.440]  you'd expect at least some murmur of that kind of nothing i mean isn't it
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:46.200]  stunning alex that no one in congress entrusted with the
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:51.080]  responsibility to remove these people listed a finger said anything at all
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.640]  adverse in in in line with the user patient constitutional constitutional
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:59.800]  law expert advisor to congress advisor to ron paul as chief policy advisor
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:03.800]  bruce fine uh constitutional lawyer joins us well that was my point i should
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:07.960]  have said that in the uh introduction i was aware that you authored
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:12.840]  uh the uh piece of legislation for walter jones we had him on
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.160]  and in fact that's why i wanted to get you on uh to to discuss that because
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.400]  there's no one better at the center of this
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:22.680]  actually resisting it i know ron paul has criticized it
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.200]  and he said there are many impeachable offenses but this is one of them
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:30.760]  uh but uh absolutely in fact that was my next question to you but you just asked
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:36.040]  me what has happened to congress uh mr fine that
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:40.440]  that the joint chiefs were belligerent i would say panetta's
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:44.280]  uh attitude was arrogant and belligerent we're watching
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:48.600]  treason we're watching the overthrow of our constitutional system
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:53.160]  in front of us basically the equivalent of a dog hiking its leg on us
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:57.880]  you know marking its territory and nothing ever came of it except for your
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:01.160]  resolution and a few house members signing on to it
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.440]  when this should be one of the biggest issues of our time and it's part of a
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:10.040]  long train of these lawyers uh in dc who are clearly trying to set the
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:13.720]  precedent that the war powers uh no longer resides
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:17.480]  in congress no no it's that and it is worse than
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:21.080]  than just the presidential user patient you're right
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:23.880]  at least then we still have the president who at least
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.200]  nominally is at oath to have his allegiance to own the united state
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  but then this concoction that the united nations and the security council
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:35.960]  united nations can authorize and tell the president what it can do
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:39.640]  i mean the supreme court is quite clear in a case called read versus covert in
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:45.240]  1954 the supreme court held a treaty cannot trump the constitutional
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:48.440]  rights and checks and balances in the american system
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:53.080]  meaning that a treaty cannot override the exclusive power of congress to decide
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.920]  to go to war and i don't care how many well whether there's a un treaty so
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:00.600]  what the constitution trumps the treaty but the treaty must be
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:03.720]  subordinate to the constitution you know otherwise you know you can you
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:06.520]  imagine that's signing a treaty that says all the
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:10.840]  signatories agree that no one shall have freedom to criticize any
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.280]  government that's ruling it off you know there goes our first amendment
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:18.520]  right well you know but the but it's the the un has agreed to it yeah
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:21.480]  then you can't do that i mean the treaty then could be used to destroy the
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:24.600]  entire constitutional framework well look at the unidire treaty that
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:27.880]  countries have signed on to it says i've read the quote
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:32.600]  it says civilian ownership of firearms will be abolished
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:35.800]  to defend the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:39.320]  they're saying the state needs a power monopoly and that that's
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.720]  legitimate when that's the opposite of what our system set up on
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.640]  yeah exactly and they say that those those treaties are subordinate to the
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:51.000]  constitution if there's a conflict the treaty has to yield not the other way
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  around and now when we're on this war issues and others oh no you just have
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.640]  to you know get a treaty and and and ratify it and then the the constitution
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:03.320]  out the window and then the loyalty of the the president is to some
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.720]  international body that we have no control over it has no loyalty to us it
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:10.840]  doesn't pay us any taxes doesn't obey our laws which is
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.000]  okay well we're going to break in a moment i want to come back and get into
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.160]  other issues sir but what do we what do you recommend we do get behind the
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:22.920]  legislation you wrote that yeah this is really
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:27.080]  the instruments are there the instruments to redress this are there
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:30.120]  it's just there's no political will so what do you do
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:33.560]  you're right into your member of congress that you support house resolution
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:37.560]  how can it 107 and you better impeach it if obama
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.240]  goes to well he already has he's gone to war against libya without congressional
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:45.000]  legislation and if he does it he'll threaten if he does it in iran he
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.560]  he's gonna be impeached you know and it says well but that doesn't bring jobs
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:53.400]  well you know it's an i'm in favor of of economic prosperity
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.480]  but some things are more worth you know are worth more than just dollars
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:01.560]  and it's our own dignity only right to govern ourselves it's checks and balances
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:04.520]  you know if we don't have that all the money in the world you can't take with
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.640]  you you know your dignity once you have your epitaph there
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:11.480]  well as you know sir it is sure it is liberty though
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:14.680]  that that brings the prosperity every time you get rid of liberty the
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.920]  prosperity disappears no absolutely or where it goes is to
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:22.120]  those with the crony capitalism is where it goes you're exactly right
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.360]  yeah it's some some prosper but not because of their their industry and
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:29.880]  an ambition and creativity but because they manipulate the political system in
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:33.240]  their favor you know that's the tart money that's the entitlement programs
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:36.840]  that's all these military no boondoggles out there spending
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.920]  trillions of dollars you know i'm trying to defend against an asteroid that might
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.320]  hit the next time hell it comes around
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.280]  american that's not live liberty is there working

[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:20.600]  his latest book american empire before the fall
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:24.600]  is joining us this is a short segment with bruce long segment coming up and
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:27.480]  we'll get into the whole iris domestic checkpoints
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:30.840]  government building up for war with the people question and then your calls but
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:34.120]  your letter to the new york times got published i'm
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:38.440]  i'm surprised they did that but but they also had an article about
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:43.560]  the fbi creating fake terror threats and and basically false flags so i guess
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.360]  i guess the new york times understands that they don't start telling the truth
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:49.400]  some they're going to lose all their readers i guess the market
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:52.600]  is having an effect i notice congress is talking about
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:58.280]  a contempt citation against holder over fast and furious now we learn it's
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.080]  hand grenades being shipped down there to blame the second amendment
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:05.160]  now just a lot of things happening but i tell folks about your letter because it
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:09.000]  breaks down this chain of events that we seem to be going in
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:14.840]  that that empires uh like elephants go to a certain place to die
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.320]  yeah well they mean the letter really pivoted off of a really good article by
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:22.680]  friend charlie savage reported in york times pointing out how
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:26.600]  obama was unilaterally circumventing congress and domestic issues
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:30.360]  you know whether it's the student loan program or a whole host of things that
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.760]  he does through the epa or otherwise because he can't get them through
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:37.320]  congress and i pointed out in the letter well that
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.680]  that's one thing but he he doesn't even make you know an attempt even a shadow
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:46.760]  of an effort to consult congress uh with regards to national security matters
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.520]  and the point of the letter was to show this isn't about a unique phenomenon
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:53.720]  with obama although he's sort of reached the high water mark that
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.560]  everson's world war two beginning with harry truman's unilateral war against
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:02.280]  north korea eisenhower had unilateral defense treaties or executive
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:06.440]  agreements with spain we had the the uh the gulf atonement resolution with
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:10.840]  johnson and we had with regard to you know president clinton you couldn't get
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:14.280]  the war resolution against bosnia so he did it unilaterally and we have
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:19.240]  bushworth waterboarding in the iraq war and now we have obama with libya and
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.080]  claiming he can go anywhere in the world and kill any american citizen he wants
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:26.600]  for the predator drone if he thinks that they're an imminent threat
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.680]  and that this is a very grave threat to who we are as a country i'd say
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.520]  the glory of the republic and the words of john quinti Adams was liberty we
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:37.960]  didn't go abroad in search of monsters to destroy our influence abroad
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:42.200]  was the influence of example and having a a true dedication to due process and
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:46.840]  liberty at home and now we've swapped that american republic where liberty
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:50.520]  is our glory to one where empire and the glorious domination and
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.520]  permanent warfare uh and that's where we are you know today and just
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:57.640]  just think about it you read the newspapers we got troops
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:01.960]  they were chasing the lord's resistance army in african you know they're in
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:04.440]  central african republic and we're thinking about invading
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:08.920]  exterior dropping bombs there and then we have a new escalation of predator
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:13.080]  drones in yemen you know and we're still have troops here in afghanistan
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.080]  they're launching drones all over the us did you see where they're ordering
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:23.320]  hundreds of armored mobile pillboxes for the highways and 450 million
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:29.480]  40 caliber bullets and uh they've got tsa now at checkpoints just everywhere
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:33.960]  i mean what's going on you know it's that you know it's a brilliant
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:37.560]  observation you may because it shows how pressure changed medicine one way
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:41.320]  instead you know all history teaches that the instruments that are developed
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:45.160]  to fight danger from abroad are invariably employed at home to crush
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:49.240]  domestic liberty and that's exactly what we're seeing all these things that all
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:53.320]  we we have to develop all these weapons because we need to keep the battlefield
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:57.880]  you know 9 000 miles away but now you're making the battlefield america
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:01.960]  and indeed that is what lindsay senator lindsay grand when he voted in support
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.120]  of this national defense authorization act that entrusted the president with
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.960]  the authority to use the military to take any of us at any time to go on
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:15.000]  tombo and say hey we're we're providing some material support to a coalition
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.360]  uh a member of al-qaeda is that lindsay grand said oh the battlefield used to
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:23.800]  be abroad but we're bringing the battlefield here to the united state
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:28.360]  which is extensive hey we got marshal on here and that's that's what invariably
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:33.560]  happens you think that you can keep these foreign instruments in foreign lands
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:37.000]  but if that's not how the law works and the president works it comes back to
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.680]  haunt us right here you're like predator drones surveillance drones
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:43.880]  checkpoint everything is subordinated to safety
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:47.240]  that's one of the important things that we need to remember that this
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:50.040]  oftentimes problems that you can never be too safe
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:53.880]  yeah you can be too safe if the reason why you're safe is you blocked everybody
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:57.480]  up you know destroyed the whole purpose of having your country you've
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:01.400]  destroyed liberty you know i don't want that safety you have to take
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:06.200]  some risk in life or liberty to have any oxygen well sure and and any government
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:08.680]  that can totally surveil to quote keep you safe
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:12.600]  historically it always becomes the ultimate destroyer i mean look at
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:17.080]  government killing major universities the university of hawaii did a study on
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:20.760]  democide government killing its citizens non-military deaths
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:25.800]  20th century 262 million people governments killed
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:28.760]  with the communists and hitler and pole pod
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:32.440]  i mean government is the biggest unnatural killer
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:37.720]  and the biggest wrecker that of anything out there it's the dangerous thing
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:42.360]  as our forebearer said it's what you want to keep locked up it's the danger
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:45.320]  stay there so we're gonna come right back long segment coming up
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:50.440]  we'll get into the rest of what you see happening and ron paul stay with us

[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:01.560]  they're a big part of that international scientific order needed
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.080]  to facilitate the big die-off that's a quote top
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.840]  you an advisor by the way that's in Reuters
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:12.040]  they're saying the collectivists are saying shut off the economy
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:17.080]  bankrupt things as humans are bad post industrial world you cannot make up this
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:23.080]  magnitude of craziness nsi instructional videos says public
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:27.800]  photography is terrorism cbs runs defense for everyone's a terrorist
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:32.680]  fbi flyers this is the twilight zoning of america and also
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:38.040]  trail of death bright bark coroner turns up dead arsenic poisoning but the
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:41.720]  police are saying that they don't think it committed
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:45.640]  suicide so they are looking at foul play and by the way it turns out it is the
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:50.360]  coroner that did bright bark so wow the twilight zone
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:54.120]  indeed and we've got some other crazy
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:59.000]  news up there you know when they passed the ndaa and obama signed it
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.520]  when he said he wouldn't sign it and then he then we learned he demanded
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:06.600]  the provisions be there still even i was pinching myself
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:12.520]  but we ask ourselves why is the elite able to do this and i think it's the
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:17.080]  dependency they know if they get a giant dependent class
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:19.800]  the american people one way or the other around half are dependent on a
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.800]  government contract government welfare something
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.080]  how do we ever extricate ourselves from this
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.200]  when around half the people out there are dependent and i understand they
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:35.720]  took your money blew it and then keep you dependent
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:39.560]  because the social security i mean i understand they forced you into it but
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:43.480]  the point is how do we ever get out of it do things collapse
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.240]  or in the process of collapsing do we go through an authoritarian nightmare
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:51.320]  as they try to keep it going bruce fine constitutional law scholar best-selling
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:55.000]  author top policy advisor to ron paul is our guest
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.320]  what do we do about this dependency i mean close to 50 million on food stamps
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:04.280]  uh they're talking about the new bailout being a student loan bailout
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:09.240]  sure i mean we're gonna go bankrupt how much money
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.880]  can we spend now you know entitlement programs over two trillion dollars
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.640]  you know a year and and that's just it's not sustainable
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:22.760]  and everybody's got to you know everyone's got to live in a much more austere
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:26.200]  um passion and just remember if we cut back for
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.640]  everybody that means you gotta pay less taxes so
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:33.560]  you have more of your own money you have to spend now we do as any
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.320]  any nation would have a safety net but the safety net ought to be
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:41.880]  really the bare necessities but otherwise and and i say this with all
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:45.000]  sincerity alex you know in some sense the government
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.120]  deprives you of your own dignity by making you depend
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:52.360]  because your real character your real metal your real self-esteem comes
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:56.360]  from struggle from making it on your own from overcoming
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:01.320]  difficulties uh that at birds or otherwise and if you've never faced
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:05.080]  those challenges you can never develop true character you're in some sense you
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:08.840]  become stunted and so it's really in in my view sort of a
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:13.000]  disability to be born you know a a a a son or child of a
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.840]  bloomberg you never have any stresses you're gonna be a very soft person
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.520]  and what gives you the strength to go through the peaks and valleys of life
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:24.520]  and and stay you know afloat and and and demonstrate your character is
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:27.640]  precisely the ability you know to overcome struggle
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:31.080]  and the government deprives you they make you into a dwarf
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:34.440]  when they just say oh don't worry you're not accountable for anything
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:38.360]  we understand how soft and weak you are so here's the money here just that
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:42.520]  that makes it it makes it all right for you i know that's that's that's
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:46.280]  that's poison you know to individual dignity
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.760]  well i agree with you it's poison and dovetailing with that is the report
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:54.440]  last week where the labor department was going to ban
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:59.800]  and i read the regulations on air any basic farm work with quote raw materials
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:05.560]  grass hay seeds eggs i mean that is the family farm and i've
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:08.600]  worked on a family farm i've been sent to our family farm on summers
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:12.360]  one time for a whole year of school i worked on ranches for a large animal
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:15.560]  vet all of the youth work you have a good time
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:19.960]  doing it you end up making money as well and that's how you learn the next
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:23.880]  generation that shows this dangerous collectivism
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:28.520]  where the government was going to ban farm chores i mean this is incredible
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:32.440]  you know it was i think if you if you had any electricity even on the drill you
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:34.840]  know you couldn't you couldn't keep doing it on the farm
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:37.800]  and then they said well they were worried because it wasn't just always on
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:40.760]  your own family because i have relatives out in the bar color
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:44.200]  at or two and so i grew up there rowing hoses
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:47.880]  of corn and and and weed and whatever getting all these tickets in your
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:52.360]  ankles and but you learned and you you you learned to discipline and you got
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:55.960]  some money to go buy a ketchy cobra at the time and sometimes it was your
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:58.680]  family sometimes it was an uncle sometimes it was
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:01.640]  it was an aunt or something more distant relative
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:04.920]  uh but the idea that you want to make daddy a legal one we're trying to
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:08.040]  cultivate the opposite which is good work habits
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:11.800]  yeah it's a you know it's got the world upside down here
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.200]  uh and again it's this other it's this idea that everything in life has to be
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:20.200]  absolutely fake you never do anything that's a tiny degree of risk
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:24.200]  i say that's the first that's the formula for decadence that's the formula
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:27.080]  for eating it that's the formula for stalking you
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:30.520]  you don't do things that are crazy but you know you got to take some risk and
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.960]  prevent risk in you you have to be accountable for your acts well look at
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:38.840]  photographs bruce look at photographs of any race creed religion
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:43.560]  you look at photographs of americans across the board from a hundred years
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.440]  ago even 60 70 years ago people had more electricity in their eyes they
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:52.440]  looked dignified they dressed nicer even though they were poor
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:55.000]  they wouldn't put up with being pushed around
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.200]  and now you look at people i go out in public myself included
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:03.320]  i'm a slob compared to my grandfathers i'm weak i don't know how to fix things
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:07.720]  like they did i don't have that joy of cleaning
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:11.640]  things and doing things that even my dad who really grew up on a farm
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:16.040]  has and i just see people degenerating
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:19.640]  yeah i think that's right he is like american gothic you know where's that
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:23.560]  where's that picture you know a small but but dignified
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:28.440]  you know not ornate but but quite uh tidy and and disciplined and
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:31.960]  that's exactly what you know our cultures say it's
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:35.480]  it's becoming a decadent and it isn't just
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:40.360]  i don't know how many um uh facebook pages you've got and how much twitter you
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:42.280]  can do it's your own character and your own
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:46.920]  discipline that's at stake here and and again we we go back to this idea that
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:50.120]  we need to make everybody safe from themselves
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:54.520]  can you imagine you know our regulations that would exist if we go back to
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:57.320]  columbia times are going back past the appellation
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.080]  mountains no you know you can't go on a stagecoach unless it's been
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:03.560]  cleared by the transportation department to be
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:06.760]  safe and effective going across the Missouri River
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.080]  you know lewis and park less than ever even got close to the west coast
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:15.000]  and other and then the same and no one reads history books and finds that
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.800]  they're all sorts of dead bodies on the on the the trails out there because they
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:22.600]  didn't know how to they drive a kind of stoke away
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.880]  and or things of that sort i'm sure that there were accidents but there are
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:30.440]  accidents all the time no contrary people were a lot tougher and and
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:33.880]  wilyer and that's what built this country shifting gears before we go to
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:37.800]  some phone calls uh here bruce but it's in a similar area
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.160]  government is moving towards capital controls
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:44.600]  yeah you know about the legislation where the irs will take your passport no
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.720]  judge no jury now as a constitutional lawyer
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:53.000]  i would like you to speak to that i know i've seen some supreme court rulings
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.920]  saying you can't take somebody's passport that's something
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:00.920]  that you have to basically give up yourself unless you're out on bond or
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:04.760]  something so break that down and how does that tie into
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.680]  tenth amendment ninth amendment fourth amendment out of their jurisdiction
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:12.120]  now tsa is all over the highways where i live
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:15.560]  searching people randomly can you speak to that
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:19.160]  yeah well first with regard to the passport
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:22.120]  we need to distinguish the passport from citizenship here
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:26.760]  that's where you write uh alex that the u.s supreme court held in a case called
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:31.720]  the ployam against rusk in 1967 that the government is powerless
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:35.640]  distribute you of your citizenship you know it can do a lot of things to you
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:38.840]  but unless you voluntarily renounce we're actually
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:42.600]  signed a paper saying renounce my citizenship the government cannot
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:46.040]  strip you of citizenship but a passport is different than
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:49.800]  citizens uh and but the supreme court has said you can't deny
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:53.800]  passports based upon your your political beliefs is case called
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:57.320]  sammel versus rusk because the government cannot be arbitrary in
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:00.200]  deciding whether you and i have a passport that enables or
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:05.080]  serving facilitates your travel and now you want to say well if the irs says you
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:07.640]  owe them five dollars in taxes then they want to
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:10.920]  prevent you from getting a passport i mean that's something of course that
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:14.440]  congress could could stop in in a in a moment
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.880]  uh and they should stop in a moment the iris is
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:22.040]  just considering that it's just a way of leverage for the iris to try to
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:25.800]  claim taxes that have not been adjudicated that they've just levy
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:31.320]  and then decided upon unilaterally it's not like so it's an extrajudicial
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:34.440]  stylistic power grab from my view is that correct
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:37.960]  yeah and in some sense alex it's unfortunately not
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:43.640]  limited just to passports the irs laws really authorize them in the case they
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:47.560]  call jeopardy assessments if they make up their own mind to think they need to
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:51.720]  levy you know a huge tax on you without informing you because
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:55.400]  they think you'll make an escape they do that and it's with no due
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:44:00.200]  process at all you're you can be shut down overnight with an irs left now
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.240]  and then that's something to me that's quite dangerous to
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:06.840]  us supreme court is upheld it in special circumstances where
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:10.920]  somebody was trying to free a jurisdiction but i think that it's
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:15.160]  vastly too great a power to entrust well it just shows government authority
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.400]  sure let me ask this way why are we saying and tell us if you agree
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:25.080]  just a wild dash to power grab on every front
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:29.160]  dwarfing anything i've ever seen why is it moving so fast
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:33.480]  it's it's i think it's alexa d seated in in the change
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:38.120]  of our culture to one where liberty is the primary year max
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:40.760]  your mark and the value in society to one where
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:45.160]  ought to be we automatically because of 9-11 and the government making
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:48.760]  us think that we're about ready to be overtaken every five seconds
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:53.400]  the government's making us fearful that our whole culture has accepted
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:57.640]  rather like a docile cow if you will all these claims
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:00.680]  intrusion in order to make us safe and you know
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:05.480]  you just if you i would wager alex if you took the political dialogue today
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:09.640]  and counted how many times the word safe was used as opposed to liberty
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:12.840]  now safe without number liberty probably 10 to 1
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:17.480]  to say and this is the earmark of what i call a a psychology of empire
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:21.000]  where everything is instantly subordinated to oh but it'll make you
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:24.520]  safer oh it'll make you safer and therefore you just stop it
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:28.040]  and spend it and and we don't have any leaders who'll stand up and wait a
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:31.240]  minute we can't make you absolutely safe without
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:34.680]  this right your delivery sure and who keeps me safe from
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:39.000]  from the big government yeah exactly you need to be safe from government
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.120]  because you're absolutely right all the greatest tourists in the world are
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:45.000]  always perpetrated by government because they do generally have
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.080]  monopoly of the power of the taxes the courts and the courts the military
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:53.000]  so in between the possible danger of a private organization or private
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.200]  individuals the government the government is always the one
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:01.080]  you've got to have special uh safeguards and suspension against
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:04.200]  because all history shows how much more potent it is and
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:07.720]  and extinguishing and extinguishing liberty sure
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:11.160]  i want to spend some time on ron paul but we're almost out of time we'll do that
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:14.920]  right at the end to get your take on uh the fact that in my view the campaign
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:18.280]  is already won by injecting real ideas and what's going to happen with all
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:21.160]  those delegates and if you've gotten the inside baseball on
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.880]  how they plan on using them or where all that's going to go bruce fine chief
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:29.400]  policy advisor to congressman ron paul is our guest
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:33.960]  but right now let's go to some phone calls dr b sandy chris and others
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:42.120]  800 2599231 for bruce fine dr b in georgia you're on the air go ahead
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.400]  yes sir gentlemen it's a pleasure to speak to both of you
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:50.840]  uh you've been on a national level i'd like to bring it down to a local level
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:55.800]  as it relates to agenda 21 and i i've heard i've heard alex you speak
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:59.400]  about agenda 21 i've i've read rosa quarry's book
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:03.400]  but they're missing part of a puzzle how are they
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:08.280]  advancing agenda 21 on the local level they're doing that through what are
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:12.440]  called regional commissions or regional development commissions
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:15.720]  this law that you mentioned that they're passing in arizona
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:19.400]  uh to stop you in agenda 21 it's basically worthless
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:21.960]  because their version of the regional commissions
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:26.920]  are called the council of governments and that law addresses nothing
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.480]  these groups get 45 percent of their money
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:32.920]  through the feds through block grants the granddaddy
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:37.960]  you've mentioned uh dhs and dod but the granddaddy is hood
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:41.320]  no no i agree with you this federal planning federal
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:45.400]  following international treaties the point is their stating language
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:49.640]  to block the implementation of the of the different
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:52.760]  sets of the treaty and it's a beginning
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:55.960]  as in in in houston they're trying to take people's property
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:59.560]  for environmental reasons and the city council has a member trying to block it
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:04.280]  my point is at least people are waking up at least we're seeing a movement
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.160]  towards recognizing the un is trying to circumvent congress like obama is
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:12.280]  circumventing congress with these regulations
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:15.560]  just like the regulation to stop chores
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:19.000]  i mean i i understand that things aren't perfect but
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:22.120]  at least it's a step in the right direction what bruce what's your take
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:25.480]  on all these un treaties they're trying to get cities
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:31.240]  to implement just by fiat i think that we need congress and has this
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:36.280]  authority to say that no treaty of the united state shall have any
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:39.800]  um effect inside the united states unless
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:43.720]  congress authorizes the thing that is treaties do not need to be
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:47.640]  self executing and that's what the u.s supreme court has held in a
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:52.120]  different circumstance relating to an effort by the then president bush to
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:56.280]  force texas to abandon the death penalty as applied to a
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:00.440]  mexican who wasn't told of his right to have access to a consular authority
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:04.360]  once he was arrested says no this treaty the international world
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  in the world court didn't its judgment sure not self executing and congress had
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:12.680]  an authorized it and again so we can trace back all these abuses
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:16.680]  to be what i call the virtual in-earthness of congress do something
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:21.480]  they can make it clear no treaty has any impact on the internal regulation
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:24.280]  in the united states exactly but it's worse authorize
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:28.840]  sure just to be clear though with copenhagen we didn't even ratify it
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:34.600]  and obama is implementing provisions of it through the executive uh it's
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:37.160]  outrageous what do you do about that
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:40.920]  well let's say it's just the congress can do to use the appropriations power
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:43.960]  and split putting no money to the united states shall be
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:47.320]  expended in order to implement anything with regard to
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:50.440]  the very coyote treaties or international treaties or whatever so
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:53.320]  there's no money to do it sure cut it off sure let me tell
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:56.840]  listen i and alexis i've gone up there i you give me
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.880]  one minute i can draft a statute that'll do the work
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:03.240]  it's just that kindness right now it doesn't have the political will and we
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:05.560]  need the american people to write into those
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:09.400]  members obviously i'm not going for you unless you do this and you gotta make it
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:12.920]  almost a witness death i agree with you listen dr b

[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.600]  congress briefly do that because it is important and i want to jam in a few
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:28.440]  more calls for you please sir our our ailments with regards to big
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:32.360]  government and the invasion of our privacy and our liberty
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:36.280]  can all be traced back to what i call the inertness of congress
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:39.240]  it has all of the constitutional authority needed
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:42.680]  in order to restore the republic from the grasp of empire
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:47.160]  and big government and all this bad spending and we focus so much upon the
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:50.760]  president and the fact is the remedy is right in our hand
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:54.840]  post the people out who continue to vote for these huge amounts of budget
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:58.440]  permit the president to use their constitutional powers
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:02.200]  to claim the right to assassinate us and do all sorts of other things
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:06.280]  that the founding fathers would have been shocked at uh and and once we change
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:09.240]  the complexion of congress and once we have an impeachment
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:13.400]  that we're president will never do that again uh and that's that's what that's
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:16.520]  what happens and don't get our eyes off the ball
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:20.200]  and that means here you focus on your congressman you have witness
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:23.960]  death and say we want you to act you need to be and that's up to us i mean we
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:27.320]  saw with the tea party before it got taken over by the neoconson people
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:32.360]  we were having a real effect at these town halls and things it's up to us
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:36.200]  the people to take our congress back uh let's jam in a call
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:40.760]  sandy in wisconsin you're on the air go ahead two quick questions okay when
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.600]  obama took the oath to protect and serve or protect
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:49.080]  our constitution and defend it along with all the others that are trying to
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:52.920]  break it apart with him aren't they just as guilty
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:57.800]  as he is and number two if our votes this november are taken from this country
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.240]  into spain by another company or something to be counted
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:05.240]  doesn't that make votes void yeah there is a lot of
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:08.920]  manipulation going on the vote it's not total but it's it's it's certainly
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:11.800]  there i appreciate your call what about those points brisk
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:14.760]  well of course the adults who are helping the president are committing
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.360]  impeachable offenses to i mean i served in the government i don't uphold and
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.640]  defend the constitution to be the one that i was speaking
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:25.000]  the impeachment and then removal of my president
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.960]  richard nixon for the watergate crimes and so
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:32.600]  and and and that's why the constitution empowers congress to impeach and remove
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.680]  not just the president but any other officer of the united states whether it's
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:40.280]  the pen department or an any other and the military has an oath to the
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:43.240]  bill of rights and constitution declaration of independence
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.040]  uh they need to understand that as well and know what lawful orders are
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:51.640]  absolutely in fact the military it's a time-honored rule
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:55.560]  a a knowing unlawful order must be disobey
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:59.480]  uh and that's that that's part of military if they order you to torture
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:02.520]  you must do it if they order you to torture you better say no because those
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:05.160]  that did it they ended up being sent to prison
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:08.280]  and then bush wrote a book admitting he ordered it incredible
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.040]  yeah yeah yeah and the fact is this is not novel
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:16.840]  that we in the aftermath of world war two we tried lawyers we tried it
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:20.440]  justice because they they did not disobey clearly
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:24.600]  illegally or illegal orders from atoll filter and we sentenced them we said
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:29.560]  that they were committing war crimes uh so we have our own precedent number
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:33.320]  that shouldn't guide ourselves and restrain ourselves from ending up
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:38.040]  emulating all these other people are waking up but i i think this is going
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:42.680]  to end badly i mean in the final equation uh the the power
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:46.120]  structure is mad dog i always thought that it was more
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:49.800]  structure to the corruption and there certainly are some structures but
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:53.800]  overall it's a bunch of people out of control power grabbing
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:57.400]  and maybe that's our salvation is that the elites are fighting with each other
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:00.760]  and it'll be so badly organized they won't be able to carry it through but
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:03.960]  i think in the process it's going to be pretty nasty what do you say
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:07.720]  well yes but remember this alex you know there in some sense is no end
[02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:11.480]  you know the the the world isn't going to stop
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:15.080]  because peaks and valleys and this is what needs to be remembered that
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:18.680]  every generation has to win liberty for themselves you can't just sort of
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:23.640]  inherit it like you can inherit money and once you laugh at will as a people
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:26.920]  to defend courageously liberty and to stand up
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:29.960]  to the efforts of those that you described the elite that wants to use
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:34.920]  their power now it's all over and and you can't you can't give that you can't
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:39.320]  can't give it like you can give a house you can't bruce fine thank you so much
[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:45.880]  freedom isn't free
