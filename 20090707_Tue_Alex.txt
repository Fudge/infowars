[00:26.360 --> 00:33.680]  important broadcast transmission today a lot of just amazingly huge things are
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.840]  developing and unfolding worldwide right now and of course none of that's really
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.320]  on the news it's all Michael Jackson coverage at the Staples Center is in
[00:42.320 --> 00:48.560]  Los Angeles they're just covering every facet of the black limousines and
[00:48.560 --> 00:55.960]  Bentley's and his father is smiling and looking like like Dr. Faust it is
[00:55.960 --> 01:01.160]  certainly a spectacle but I'm sorry if you tuned in for Michael Jackson
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.600]  coverage you are not going to get it here today though I am going to talk
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.480]  about the pathetic spectacle an example of controlled media hype being used as
[01:10.480 --> 01:18.400]  a distraction and as a diversion so that is coming up in the next segment but
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.040]  here is some of what I will be covering today bill gives attorney general power

[02:08.280 --> 02:12.000]  just gonna stage terror attacks and say look you're a terrorist if you're against
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.320]  the EU dictatorship oh well then we better be for it yes if you're against it

[10:26.240 --> 10:30.440]  that's taking place how can I talk about all the serious issues I have here in
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.840]  front of me when when we have Michael Jackson
[10:35.840 --> 10:47.160]  to discuss isn't that what's really important his scary-looking family
[10:47.160 --> 10:54.720]  corrupt decadent weirdos his vampiric dad I was watching CNN this morning while
[10:54.720 --> 11:02.720]  I was jogging on the treadmill and it showed his father getting in the Bentley
[11:02.720 --> 11:09.920]  to drive to the Staples Center and he had a big smile and a look of pleasure and
[11:09.920 --> 11:18.400]  a look of extreme satisfaction on his face and he had his jaw jutting out
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.760]  pridefully and I mean he's one of the most evil-looking people I've ever
[11:22.760 --> 11:30.360]  seen and I've seen a lot of evil people and it actually him looking into the
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.800]  camera my heart kind of jumped I was like man that guy looks like the devil
[11:35.800 --> 11:41.120]  and I know what evil looks like folks and I'm telling you that's an evil man
[11:41.120 --> 11:49.680]  and the whole thing is an evil spectacle and then I was surfing around
[11:49.680 --> 11:53.840]  the other night printing news stories and I saw a clip of never before released
[11:53.840 --> 12:00.920]  deposition of Michael Jackson from all of his escapades with the Jesus juice
[12:00.920 --> 12:09.200]  little kids locked up in the maximum security bedroom and just that fake a
[12:09.200 --> 12:14.440]  feminine evil I don't want to say women are evil because it's it's it's when a
[12:14.440 --> 12:20.120]  man acts like a woman it's and then this morning I was watching two CNN
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.120]  reporters knitting back and forth about Michael Jackson and Twittering and
[12:25.120 --> 12:33.320]  getting all exciting it was it was just oh what is it about a society going into
[12:33.320 --> 12:41.960]  really hardcore tyranny that it always is manned by these very weird knitting
[12:41.960 --> 12:49.800]  men but I was really just revolted watching Michael Jackson and me and
[12:49.800 --> 12:54.880]  having my psyche assaulted and I try to look away but just the few glimpses the
[12:54.880 --> 12:59.040]  few times I've looked back from the mountaintop I almost turned into a
[12:59.040 --> 13:06.720]  pillar of salt they were saying and did you do this to the little boy and he's
[13:06.720 --> 13:16.120]  like no putting his hands over his weird eyes and really it's a tragedy at the
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.920]  end of the day that is the type of creature that his father produced and
[13:21.920 --> 13:30.520]  that the whole Hollywood system I guess produced in the Jackson five and I guess
[13:30.520 --> 13:36.080]  it is fitting that as the United States collapses into third world
[13:36.080 --> 13:41.920]  despotism and as the once great republic does sink beneath the waves and
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.400]  there's no doubt that's happening right now you're you're seeing and I'm seeing
[13:45.400 --> 13:55.200]  it we're witnessing it it's burning as it goes under the last light is
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.280]  twinkling off in the distance as the main body of the ship goes under now
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.960]  only the mast are still burning but there's only seconds in the scale of
[14:05.960 --> 14:11.600]  societies and civilizations time before those sink beneath the waves and the
[14:11.600 --> 14:21.040]  dark cold night sits in but they feed the public on an endless diet of Michael
[14:21.040 --> 14:31.000]  Jackson and Anna Nicole Smith and it's a psychic weapon to blind people from all
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.600]  the majesty and beauty that is creation and to blind people from their families
[14:36.600 --> 14:48.680]  and their children and just the amazing life force that's all around us I mean
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.280]  how could somebody not sit there looking out their breakfast window at a
[14:52.280 --> 14:59.160]  bird's nest on the ledge with swallows feeding their babies that is just so
[14:59.160 --> 15:05.960]  magic so incredible so interesting and all the parallels to human life and our
[15:05.960 --> 15:12.480]  life cycle and our children and what our species is I can stare at a trumpet vine
[15:12.480 --> 15:17.840]  for hours out my back window growing on the fence in the backyard that beautiful
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.600]  orange yellow pink mixture of colors and hummingbirds buzzing around drinking
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.640]  nectar and instead the general public is mesmerized they're not looking at
[15:28.640 --> 15:34.240]  trumpet vines out their back window on average they're not marvelling at the
[15:34.240 --> 15:40.600]  moon shining in a blue sky at midday
[15:42.280 --> 15:51.520]  they're busy in awe at the spectacle of this freak Michael Jackson while the
[15:51.520 --> 15:58.760]  controlled corporate press psychically assaults everyone telling the public
[15:58.760 --> 16:02.680]  that this is something we should all be interested in and and every nuance
[16:02.680 --> 16:08.280]  everything you know hyped up to the thousandth degree oh look the Jackson
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.760]  family's coming out of their home and 50 plus black limos lined up in Bentley's
[16:13.760 --> 16:16.800]  and Mercedes and
[16:17.800 --> 16:26.560]  decadent and gorged women and men swollen like self-propelled stomachs who
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.600]  look nothing like the pitiful drug addict Wraith creature that was their
[16:32.600 --> 16:41.680]  family Michael Jackson and in the middle of it the demonic father enjoying just
[16:41.680 --> 16:49.280]  at a petty dominance level just enjoying basking in the media spotlight of
[16:49.280 --> 16:58.720]  his dead son soaking it up like a blood and gorge tick having its last meal as
[16:58.720 --> 17:08.200]  it sucks in this the last juices out of his son oh it was horrible and then
[17:08.200 --> 17:14.280]  cutting to the CNN anchor talking in hush tones I'm here in staple center the
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.400]  lucky people that got the golden tickets the eight thousand tickets and
[17:20.400 --> 17:23.640]  there's people of course outside to get to be part of this historic event

[18:16.240 --> 18:26.000]  burning sun firing off in the sky here we are looking at all these different
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.200]  lifeforms around us in our own lifeform and our own history of struggle just to
[18:30.200 --> 18:35.160]  survive and carve out a place on this planet and we're busy watching the every
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.120]  move of people playing juvenile dress up like five-year-old girls dressed up

[25:10.680 --> 25:14.640]  Hollywood Hills to the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles something that
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.640]  quite frankly none of us it was expecting until this morning and we got
[25:18.640 --> 25:24.080]  word that Michael Jackson's body would be at the ceremony exactly we had of
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.760]  course Michael Jackson I said of course his body's gonna lie in state they
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.360]  announced that it was gonna lie in state four days ago I've been announcing that
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.640]  seeing it in just said oh my gosh we just found out we're gonna get to see it
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.960]  we're gonna get to see the drug addict oh my gosh he gave Jesus choose to the
[25:41.960 --> 25:48.520]  children let's worship him oh my gosh go ahead and cut back Jackson will be
[25:48.520 --> 25:53.560]  buried no that's been a question that has been up in the air ever since we
[25:53.560 --> 25:57.520]  learned of his death and certainly we heard from Jermaine Jackson talking to
[25:57.520 --> 26:02.560]  Larry well they give the children Jesus juice at the event is everything Jesus
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.680]  just came back to earth with that of course was that in this is like a little
[26:06.680 --> 26:13.920]  state if space aliens landed in Central Park in less attention
[26:13.920 --> 26:21.360]  now on Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Cemetery wait we just oh my gosh this
[26:21.360 --> 26:26.200]  is incredible Michael Jackson right now just to having a glimpse at some live
[26:26.200 --> 26:33.200]  shots of having a glimpse at live shots of him it's Michael Michael
[26:33.200 --> 26:40.440]  flowers and balloons have been that looks you think I'm joking the fans have
[26:40.440 --> 26:44.320]  been the fans out there for them if they don't have a ticket to the Staples
[26:44.320 --> 26:47.600]  Center to know where to go and every one of these reporters talks like this guy
[26:47.600 --> 26:55.720]  my gosh it's yeah this is my call my gosh he gave him Jesus choose we love
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.600]  him even if you don't have admission so you see the people outside of Neverland
[26:59.600 --> 27:03.920]  come here kid drink this wine trying to get near the cemetery as well turn it
[27:03.920 --> 27:10.440]  off I can't look at it I'm gonna break down after the break the sickening
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.240]  this seat see this is a weapon against black people they make it oh the black
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.880]  stars of the golf players or the football players not the scientists not the
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.760]  lawyers or it's these music icons and then it becomes this sick thing where
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.400]  black people it's been so destructive and a lot of black writers have written
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.000]  about it but I want to discuss it and go over it but but see it's the prototype
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.360]  for everybody else but you know it is the African-American community on average
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.960]  that is the most sucked in to identity race identity and a lot of that's because
[27:40.960 --> 27:44.680]  of racism and how they were put on reservations you know the inner cities
[27:44.680 --> 27:49.040]  and so it was a source of pride but the system manipulated that and I want to
[27:49.040 --> 27:52.640]  break that down but if you think I'm joking about these Michael Jackson fans
[27:52.640 --> 27:58.080]  this is a singing in report from two days ago and I'm gonna read these text
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.400]  messages from Twitter they call them tweets see I always talk about ninnies
[28:03.400 --> 28:06.320]  twittering around but now when I say Twitter people think I mean twittering
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.200]  you know that these ninnies the term twittering that pull up the definition
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.600]  of twittering twittering means I kind of gibbering around and like a bunch of
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.160]  women at a sewing circle kind of buzzing around just gibbering mindlessly it
[28:20.160 --> 28:26.600]  doesn't you're not really discussing anything lucky fans get news on Jackson
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.560]  Memorial tickets now imagine these young people and older folks and Michael

[28:33.520 --> 28:37.360]  freedoms right now we're going into bondage but this is was the top story

[33:17.120 --> 33:21.760]  live to the coverage the only thing more exciting than one shot of the Hearst
[33:21.760 --> 33:26.560]  was a double shot they just took the same shot from the helicopter and had two
[33:26.560 --> 33:32.480]  shots it's just it's like a spinal tap when they have the have the volume on
[33:32.480 --> 33:36.080]  the EQ goes up to 11 they say why not just have it be 10 but be higher and
[33:36.080 --> 33:40.920]  because it goes to 11 it's like having two shots of the same video of Michael
[33:40.920 --> 33:45.400]  Jackson kind of takes it to the level of infinity I mean here is this family
[33:45.400 --> 33:50.720]  geeking you know what a geek is people call somebody who's a nerd or a twit a
[33:50.720 --> 33:55.800]  geek you know kind of a spectacle and the meaning of that word has semantically
[33:55.800 --> 33:59.600]  changed over the centuries but before a hundred years ago a geek was somebody
[33:59.600 --> 34:08.120]  who bit the heads off of pigeons and chickens and rats at a carnival at a
[34:08.120 --> 34:13.160]  circus it was kind of a back alley act kind of the you'd go in the freak tent
[34:13.160 --> 34:18.960]  to see the bearded lady and the snake lady and the thousand-pound man and
[34:18.960 --> 34:26.440]  then you'd go see a geek biting the heads off of chickens or a geek might you
[34:26.440 --> 34:30.840]  know have things attached to his chest and pick up large weights with it
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.840]  swallowing swords is a form of geeking and here is Michael Jackson's abusive
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.720]  degenerate corrupt sickeningly worldly I think of no one more shallow and
[34:40.720 --> 34:47.480]  worldly and just absolute trash in the Jackson family on record on record and
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.840]  here they are pimping his dead body out you know now carrying it to the staple
[34:52.840 --> 34:56.200]  centers for everybody to gawk at it of course they were gonna have it lie in
[34:56.200 --> 35:01.040]  state they said they were you days ago CNN though just told you it was breaking
[35:01.040 --> 35:04.760]  they're just now telling you this they're just now letting you know about it
[35:04.760 --> 35:09.040]  oh my gosh come back to Michael cut to him
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.160]  some of these live images of the casket being transported to the staples center
[35:13.160 --> 35:19.480]  you can see people lining up oh wow along the highways oh wow oh my gosh at
[35:19.480 --> 35:27.680]  this at this processional you might be able to get of those that's right we
[35:27.680 --> 35:32.240]  won't tell them about HR 1207 getting shot down in the sun breaking
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.720]  dictatorship being set up let's talk about Michael talking about how much it
[35:36.720 --> 35:40.800]  meant to them that Michael Jackson's how much it meant to them how they're
[35:40.800 --> 35:45.800]  living through Michael right now this is showing all these people that none of us
[35:45.800 --> 35:52.400]  live forever a sense of our own humanity through America and be here at the
[35:52.400 --> 35:58.640]  Staples Center not to see his casket and I think that's the sense that a lot of
[35:58.640 --> 36:03.360]  people are actually able to look at them they're up on the other day hours of the
[36:03.360 --> 36:10.760]  morning and legacy of Michael Jackson but actually being able to
[36:10.760 --> 36:16.440]  see the body is something they weren't expecting but are certainly excited by
[36:16.440 --> 36:26.400]  the news and there are a lot of people dressed up in Michael Jackson
[36:26.400 --> 36:40.360]  they're dressed up could it be any earlier that the likes of children giving
[36:40.360 --> 36:50.840]  Jesus Jesus who put together the London concert tour so they are trying to run
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.880]  it in the same sense of a concert but after all you know oh my gosh there he's
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.920]  the center of everything America the world don't don't look at the world
[37:00.920 --> 37:04.560]  banking dictatorship being set up right now what is the distance do you know
[37:04.560 --> 37:10.760]  between just look at that highway on that first you want to know why you're
[37:10.760 --> 37:13.920]  bankrupt while you're living in squalor America traffic you want to know how the
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.360]  paints peeling everything's falling apart and the bridges are collapsing
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.800]  because you have been turned into creatures that think this is important
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.800]  a lot of roads that are blocked out remember this is a Tuesday as well and

[40:08.160 --> 40:13.680]  history piece that doesn't actually show you that's like a rundown of what's
[40:13.680 --> 40:24.240]  going to happen at the run down it has some words from Jermaine Jackson Jermaine

[41:14.840 --> 41:21.160]  I'm like they have the pre-shocks it was kind of an aftershock I don't know I
[41:21.160 --> 41:23.840]  can't pull myself away from the helicopter shot of that hearse right now
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.680]  that's so important not my family's future not the toxic waste not the
[41:27.680 --> 41:31.440]  genetic engineering not the global system not the military converting over
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.280]  to drones so the globalist can control things through a new AI system even the
[41:35.280 --> 41:38.800]  military doesn't serve them doesn't matter that we're racing against trying to
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.280]  shut down the new world order Skynet system that's actually real that they
[41:43.280 --> 41:47.280]  base the film upon doesn't matter if you Genesis to running everything and
[41:47.280 --> 41:51.520]  running chemical biological or a lot radiological attacks on us no none of
[41:51.520 --> 41:58.000]  that matters all that matters is Michael Jackson and I apologize that I've talked
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.640]  about him in fact I'm gonna just go back to coverage I can't pull myself away I
[42:02.640 --> 42:06.720]  mesmerized right now I admit I'm wrong Michael's great his father's great the
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.200]  Jesus juice is great it's all normal this is not sick what's happening on TV
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.000]  right now Arnold Schwarzenegger having some weird bodybuilder who posed in
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.800]  porno mags for men is completely normal running around singing loves Hitler is
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.080]  completely normal having him rob everybody having him involved with
[42:24.080 --> 42:27.840]  Enron scamming everyone and then running on stopping Enron that's completely
[42:27.840 --> 42:31.680]  normal that was another spectacle that everybody got caught up in it's good
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.600]  it's healthy we got caught up in the spectacle of Barack Obama all these
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.480]  stunts are good that go back to it I'm giving in to it I'm going with it
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.560]  oh here it is
[42:44.400 --> 42:50.720]  oh yeah oh love yes sir yes Michael Jackson store yes they met him or they
[42:50.720 --> 42:58.000]  didn't what is yours oh what is yours my story and my story I report is when I
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.760]  was seven years old the day thriller came out I waited in line with my
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.640]  grandmother to get it and waited seems like for hours and when I got it I took
[43:06.640 --> 43:11.440]  a picture with it and I just went with it and no one could tell me that that
[43:11.440 --> 43:15.040]  wasn't really Michael with me in the picture
[43:15.040 --> 43:22.400]  oh delusion oh yeah I was seven years old it was mass delusion oh it's like
[43:22.400 --> 43:26.560]  believing in Santa Claus believing in Michael Jackson you know he's real
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.080]  but believing in it he's just like believing in nothing yes it is that's
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.320]  turn this poor woman off I can't handle it this is a demonic assault on
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.880]  humanity
[43:38.720 --> 43:43.840]  you see I'm in love with putting on flippers in a mask
[43:43.840 --> 43:47.760]  and swimming down 30 feet to the bottom of the ocean skin diving and seeing all
[43:47.760 --> 43:51.440]  those big fish swarm around me and knowing I'm alive only once in this
[43:51.440 --> 43:55.600]  gorgeous wondrous universe of miracles all around us the miracle of life the
[43:55.600 --> 43:59.760]  miracle of reproduction the miracle of the eye the miracle of the cell and
[43:59.760 --> 44:03.840]  instead everyone is worshiping this is an idol
[44:03.840 --> 44:07.920]  people you can laugh at the Bible when it says put no other gods before me
[44:07.920 --> 44:11.760]  people would worship some golden calf instead of
[44:11.760 --> 44:14.880]  worshiping god the creator of the universe they would worship some
[44:14.880 --> 44:18.560]  image it's a it's a delusion it's make believe
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.680]  it's a freak show
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.280]  and so here are these people in a collapsing nation oh here they are
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.560]  showing off the tickets put it on
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.120]  I congregate it's a very big crowd waiting for the family to come in everyone's
[44:33.120 --> 44:36.640]  here trying to look and and see the family come in just to give their
[44:36.640 --> 44:40.080]  condolences oh yes that's my inauguration it's the
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.400]  same feeling everybody is just full of love and just happy
[44:44.400 --> 44:49.200]  all right sherry we appreciate you loving happy oh it's so good
[44:49.200 --> 44:54.080]  it's so everything that you've wanted the freak show family the freak show
[44:54.080 --> 44:58.080]  michael jackson this is so sick this is why your
[44:58.080 --> 45:01.440]  slaves this is why the nation's going into bondage
[45:01.440 --> 45:05.120]  this could turn it back on just oh I can't even talk I'm beside myself
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.400]  with disgust and of course we're not sherry and
[45:08.400 --> 45:12.720]  the other nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninety nine people who will be
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.920]  in attendance at the staples center uh once they get in place and the public
[45:17.920 --> 45:23.280]  memorial begins they are going to be able to view a stage
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.120]  which is set up as you can see on the other side of your screen there
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.480]  a bit like a church would be set up there are
[45:30.480 --> 45:34.480]  small floral arrangements they have worship and it is a church
[45:34.480 --> 45:38.080]  the morning but the worship of the freak against a drug addict and a
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.560]  wheelchair that can't even physically go after kids anymore
[45:42.560 --> 45:47.360]  thank god and it's like oh my god she's so beautiful
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.880]  oh this is so wonderful which we are expecting
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.200]  those featured singers mariah carrey usher
[45:57.200 --> 46:03.440]  stevie wonder but that's just a and of course they're all just vampires
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.160]  yeah showing up to feed off the death of michael jackson nine thousand they're all
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.240]  a bunch of friends and grave robbing that's goons
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.560]  who are uh they're just a bask in this sickening glory and sell some more
[46:16.560 --> 46:20.800]  dvds and cds all right let's stop right there
[46:20.800 --> 46:26.080]  let me try to very simply explain why this is sickening and disgusting
[46:26.080 --> 46:31.440]  number one it's a distraction into diversion from major events happening
[46:31.440 --> 46:36.160]  that are just as big and important as 1776 i mean the country is going into full
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.720]  corporate bondage to foreign offshore banks
[46:40.720 --> 46:45.200]  and secondarily it's a distraction from the rest of our culture collapsing it's
[46:45.200 --> 46:48.160]  not just the financial takeover it's not just that we're being
[46:48.160 --> 46:51.040]  conquered we're being conquered because we are
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.160]  sickeningly selfish and sickeningly obsessed with image and sickeningly
[46:56.160 --> 47:02.240]  obsessed with pop mindless media
[47:02.240 --> 47:05.600]  and the best analogy for this is how hype
[47:05.600 --> 47:13.200]  and how fake culture and how garbage culture and how fads and how styles
[47:13.200 --> 47:20.560]  have been used to enslave cultures now i had already innately figured this out
[47:20.560 --> 47:23.760]  for myself by college but then i read edwin bernay's
[47:23.760 --> 47:27.840]  books propaganda and several others he wrote
[47:28.400 --> 47:31.680]  and he pointed out writings of other sociologists that i looked into where
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.200]  they detailed the chin dynasty and other
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.680]  dynasties in china that's why you call it china the chin
[47:39.680 --> 47:43.920]  the chin you know what does the chin
[47:43.920 --> 47:53.920]  have to do with this and the chain and other dynasties
[47:53.920 --> 47:57.520]  what does that have to do with this everything
[47:57.520 --> 48:02.480]  going back at least 4 000 years ago they began to figure out that
[48:02.480 --> 48:08.480]  the small inner court the kind of specialized government bureaucrats who
[48:08.480 --> 48:11.680]  would serve the imperial elite they would say oh you're so important
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.120]  you're so elite you're so gorgeous you're so godlike
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.680]  no one must be able to look at you and you must
[48:17.680 --> 48:21.360]  you know be awe-inspiring and wear fancy headdresses
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.880]  to make the local natives bow down to you and think you're special
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.640]  and the witch doctors would throw some gunpowder
[48:28.640 --> 48:32.800]  into a burning cauldron it would explode in front of the villagers and
[48:32.800 --> 48:36.240]  they would go ahead and bow down to the chin leader because he had the power of
[48:36.240 --> 48:43.360]  booga-hooga literally boom ha ha
[48:46.880 --> 48:50.720]  and they would all bow down and then they said look we're not just going to scan
[48:50.720 --> 48:54.720]  the natives and have you follow them chief chin or chief chang
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.120]  we need you to wear a special headdress and we need the women in order to show
[48:59.120 --> 49:02.000]  that they haven't been out in the sun working so you got to stay indoors you
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.120]  have white skin that's the style showing that
[49:05.120 --> 49:08.560]  you know that you are gloves that you're that you're so important and so
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.040]  mighty that you didn't you know nothing is done
[49:11.040 --> 49:14.800]  by yourself everything is done for you
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.440]  when they said oh your women are so important they must not be able to walk
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.320]  and the men at first said yeah that way they can't cheat on me and
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.000]  i've got control of them and so oh you're so beautiful man you must have tiny
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.880]  feet we're going to put them in these little shoes
[49:28.880 --> 49:31.520]  at birth and so your feet are going to be so small you're not going to be able
[49:31.520 --> 49:34.080]  to walk but you're going to be so beautiful
[49:34.080 --> 49:37.360]  and everyone will will wish they had little feet
[49:37.360 --> 49:40.880]  and so 200 years ago they figured this out in the west and women got deformed
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.720]  feet and couldn't walk by the time they were 30 or 40
[49:44.720 --> 49:47.520]  and a rich woman had to be rich because she had to be able to not be able to
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.640]  walk and they you know they would have corn so big on their feet
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.760]  in france and the united states and in england that they couldn't walk
[49:55.760 --> 49:59.840]  and my very intelligent wonderful great grandmother couldn't walk the last 15
[49:59.840 --> 50:02.000]  years of her life even though her brain was there
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.240]  because she had worn the little shoes see and edward bernays and others laughed
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.080]  and they said we'll mutate the women we'll run black ops
[50:12.080 --> 50:16.320]  we've got you now you'll cut your faces up and inject your faces
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.200]  and feel insecure your whole life and wear tiny shoes
[50:19.200 --> 50:23.920]  and we'll slaughter you with pleasure and see that's what michael jackson is
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.080]  that's what all this sickeningness is it's black ops
[50:28.080 --> 50:33.120]  it's psychological 4 000 year old chinese warfare
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.000]  hell released upon you and when we come back i will continue to break down

[54:29.040 --> 54:31.280]  idiots and not be involved in real issues i'm
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.080]  watching lockheed martin tv commercials about their drone attack aircraft
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.000]  and how the robotic fleet will keep you safe
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.120]  so humans are even being cut out of the mixer right now and the elite all brag
[54:43.120 --> 54:45.840]  about it and how because of robotics and
[54:45.840 --> 54:49.760]  mechanization they don't need masses of people anymore so instead of life being
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.160]  cheap life is a negative they want you dead
[54:54.160 --> 54:59.360]  but you know who cares about that you know women just want to go chop their
[54:59.360 --> 55:03.920]  noses off and have liposuction and starve themselves and be insecure and
[55:03.920 --> 55:06.960]  men pick up kind of on the fake manliness where you never stand up for
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.120]  your nation or liberty or freedom you just strut around and act tough so you
[55:11.120 --> 55:14.080]  know i mean there's lots of different systems but
[55:14.080 --> 55:19.280]  the effeminate fake nanny archetype is kind of what michael jackson is
[55:19.280 --> 55:25.120]  kind of the metrosexual idea and so all his activities all the bad things he
[55:25.120 --> 55:30.000]  did all the weirdness that's okay now because he's our god
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.120]  and you go back to the chinese 4000 years ago or even further
[55:35.120 --> 55:39.200]  go read it and then they said oh women it's not just that the women can't walk
[55:39.200 --> 55:42.320]  we want to shrink them the the the feet of the men
[55:42.320 --> 55:46.240]  who were in the ruling class so it was really the power behind the throne
[55:46.240 --> 55:49.760]  the government bureaucrats who became the real power
[55:49.760 --> 55:53.120]  but you can't convince americans that presidents are puppets today
[55:53.120 --> 55:56.560]  when empires from their start were generally run
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.960]  by puppets and when you did get a real leader like
[56:00.960 --> 56:04.880]  Julius Caesar the shadow government the senators would normally
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.560]  kill him quickly because they didn't like one guy having the
[56:08.560 --> 56:11.760]  power they liked it being shared amongst themselves and also the people
[56:11.760 --> 56:17.040]  could never remove them because there was no one had to go after
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.360]  but see who cares how the world actually works who cares how the planet
[56:21.360 --> 56:24.640]  really operates who wants to know those secrets and mysteries
[56:24.640 --> 56:31.040]  instead let's just gawk at michael jackson the freak show the geek
[56:31.040 --> 56:35.920]  with his sickening abusive father now basking in glory and making tons of
[56:35.920 --> 56:39.680]  money as the country completely collapses
[56:39.680 --> 56:43.040]  and it's fitting this is happening as the complete takeover happens
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.400]  literally right now that's coming up with mike revero
[56:48.400 --> 56:56.400]  but the issue is then the chin said look emperor you can't just
[56:56.400 --> 56:59.760]  have your feet shrunken from birth so you can't walk to prove you're so powerful
[56:59.760 --> 57:02.960]  and then you have to be fed and then someone has to put you on the toilet
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.000]  and wipe you you know british royalty just picked that up from the france you
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.960]  got it from the chinese
[57:10.240 --> 57:13.840]  we now want you to grow your fingernails out and so they would have two three
[57:13.840 --> 57:17.040]  four-foot long fingernails because you're so imperial
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.320]  you've got to have long fingernails because that shows you don't feed yourself
[57:20.320 --> 57:23.840]  either and so now they've taken that
[57:23.840 --> 57:28.640]  imperial model of control over the royalty and they've superimposed it
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.080]  with the general public now oh you've got a snake in your
[57:32.080 --> 57:35.440]  backyard you've got to call the government to come remove it
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.000]  or if you've got a tree limb you better not know how to cut it you better call
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.640]  somebody to do it or um
[57:42.640 --> 57:45.680]  you know they're on the news saying how do you stay hydrated and they have the
[57:45.680 --> 57:48.880]  expert on the news this morning going it's very hard

[58:17.280 --> 58:22.160]  i mean you got this scary freakoid man with a freakoid family
[58:22.160 --> 58:27.120]  that is really bone-chillingly wicked and then and now they got to be assaulted
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.960]  by them and the public will buy it they want to be slaves
[58:30.960 --> 58:36.720]  they'll buy into it they'll but but i want to explain coming up

[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:33.440]  in loving memory of michael jackson the king of pop
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:39.200]  1958 to 2009 he looks like the picture they've got of him looking up it looks
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:41.840]  like photos i've seen of a snapping turtle
[1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:45.120]  when it's right up out of the water and it's a shot from underwater and the
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.880]  snapping turtle just sticks its little pointed nose up out of the water to get
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:52.080]  air and it's waiting for a fish or a baby duck to come along
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:54.960]  and that's michael jackson he's waiting for a little kid to come along
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:01:00.320]  and he's right up there like a snapping turtle he wants a baby duck to come by
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:04.480]  but later the snapping turtle found an opium type drugs and so got so drugged
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:09.280]  out it just sat on the bottom till it died
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:13.440]  i mean a demonic snapping turtle
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:19.440]  it's it's so sick it's such a psychic assault on all of humanity i you know
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:23.040]  what i will not play along with jacko the
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:26.880]  guy that dangles babies off of uh
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:30.240]  five-story windows threatening to drop him with a demonic look on his face the
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:33.760]  guy is obviously a raving pit demon of hell
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.320]  who didn't fall too far from his daddy's tree
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.760]  i mean few people can send a chill through me and they had up close video
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:46.480]  his dad with pleasure getting off on all the attention squeezing that much more
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:50.080]  petty energy out of his dead son that he's been
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:54.000]  parasiting off of for 50 years
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:57.920]  and i actually kind of had a tremor
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:02.160]  just looking at him it was it was just like uh quiver

[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:25.680]  look i tried to explain this earlier and i may just you like a 10 minute youtube
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:30.560]  video later today to post to really make it concise and focused
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:33.600]  or i may do a rant near the end of the show though i got a bunch of big guests
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:36.240]  coming up today
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.080]  trying to explain this look this is weaponized culture
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:45.920]  is what this is this is weaponized culture
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:49.600]  we have weaponized food with the gmo we have weaponized
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:52.960]  education to dumb the kids down we have the war on drugs the war on terror
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:56.560]  which they now admit is for the american people this entire apparatus of
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:00.640]  secret police and spies and warrantless wiretapping
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:04.400]  and it's weaponized culture 4 000 years ago the chinese are the first i know of
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:08.240]  that really got this together well so did the egyptians saying we're
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:10.560]  the gods and so the slaves wouldn't even question
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:13.760]  serving the gods because the people up on top the pyramids
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:16.720]  and the and the and the temples they were gods they wore fancy
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:20.160]  headdresses of gold they stood up in front of huge buildings
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:23.600]  this is the that's what the new order symbol is a pyramid it's a symbol of
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:27.600]  scamming and manipulating and and compartmentalizing the idiot
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:31.120]  population it's about dumbing down the massive
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:35.920]  humanity not building it up it's it's a crime against our species
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:40.160]  by these control freaks the psychopaths that run the system
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:43.920]  when i want to unlock minds and empower humanity i have a love affair with our
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:46.160]  species i know the heights we can go to the
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:49.680]  heights we've been to but also know the depths we tend to sink to
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:55.840]  and this stuff is like a cultural soul destroying bomb
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:59.520]  to have michael jackson thrown on his fate forced on his crammed out our
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:06.000]  throat the wicked snapping turtle up there looking for a baby duck to eat
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.360]  looking at his picture again to make us petty to make us insecure just like
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:17.600]  they had the elites with two foot long fingernails and feet they couldn't
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:20.880]  walk on with bound feet and every culture you discover does this to their
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:24.080]  royalty that's the scam artist behind the throne
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:27.840]  bureaucrats do that but now they're doing it with carbon tax now they're
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:31.200]  binding the feet of humanity now they're going to shut down our very
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:34.240]  energy sources now they're going to control us through feudalism a
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:38.640]  merger of this system of control now i promise to get into how
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:43.840]  this particular mutation of devil culture has been used as a particular
[1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:47.920]  weapon against blacks and how his disadvantaged people
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:51.280]  they were the testing ground for all of this briefly when we get back
[1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:55.680]  then to micro vero with his take on jacko maybe i'm wrong
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:58.560]  maybe it's okay to hang babies over buildings maybe it's okay to give

[1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:28.240]  and now live from austin texas alex jones

[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:38.000]  try to hunt down big stars we'll be on the show
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.480]  jessey vatera fell right in our lap we got contacted by willy nelson
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:47.040]  charlie sheen same thing with the tommy chong situation
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:56.880]  they ended up reaching out to us and uh we've got a big guest who i'm a fan of
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:02.640]  coming up in the final hour today because
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:08.880]  the film that he's in is about the ancient right to arm yourself and
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:13.200]  protect yourself reclaiming the blade
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:18.960]  and so we got john ray davies joining us
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:24.400]  coming up in the last hour of the show today
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.720]  and by the way we are simulcasting live at prism planet dot tv and about to go
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:36.080]  to micro vero but in this over saturated
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:42.800]  pop driven celebrity driven culture celebrities can be used as a life raft
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:46.400]  to the public that's kind of caught in the matrix
[1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:50.800]  who's still on the blue pill and that's why charlie sheen goes public that's
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.280]  why willy nelson speaks out because when you meet these people in person
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:58.960]  they're hiding out they're not trying to be in the media spotlight
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:04.320]  they're artists who are really prisoners of their fame in a lot of
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.160]  respects and they'll tell you they're no big deal
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:11.680]  they're not on a power trip and they're trying to reach out
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:16.240]  and do something viable in the culture in the society
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:20.320]  because some people say well here you are bashing michael jackson and all this
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:24.480]  pop and all this hype well yeah because the mainstream media is making it
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:29.600]  a big diversion a big distraction with all these big issues that are happening
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:35.040]  and michael jackson has a horrible sorted bizarre past
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:37.440]  and
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:41.760]  just the way the media is openly jumping into this to use it as a
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:45.840]  distraction is horrible michael jackson is bringing people deeper
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:52.480]  in to the kind of media malaise instead of using big media figures
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:56.480]  to bring people out of the matrix like system look briefly i'll get more into
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:59.280]  this next hour
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:03.200]  because dr francis boils only on with us for 30 minutes so uh at
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:06.560]  130 central or in the middle of the third hour i'm going to get into this
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:10.320]  kind of in a focused fashion and kind of everything i've talked about the last
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:13.440]  hour just recap it in a focused fashion because it's
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.680]  important i'm going to post it up on youtube
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:22.080]  from prisonplanet.tv but i specifically said the hollywood
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.320]  slash sports culture has been particularly destructive
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:30.400]  uh black americans and i'm not the only person saying that a lot of
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:34.240]  black folks uh have said that like mr cosby
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:38.560]  and then he gets criticized look at how oprah wimfrey brought us obama
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:42.480]  and said he was the one look at how she calls for global government and this
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.320]  new gaio religion with the united nations building
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:50.880]  strange churches internationally i mean this is a lady who wants power and
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:53.680]  she knows she needs a religion to do that it happens to be the one world
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:57.680]  government religion very creepy person i'm not here trying to pick a fight
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:00.640]  oprah wimfrey
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:04.720]  the issue is she's the most powerful person in media and she helped build up
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:08.080]  michael jackson as well so anything coming out of her
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:13.840]  barack obama michael jackson any of this stuff is bad news it's hype
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:18.080]  and anytime the world the establishment the beast system is pushing
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.760]  something anytime they're pushing big mega cheats uh
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.560]  big mega church leaders on national television on larry king live
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.720]  you better watch out
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:35.760]  anytime it's about looking just right and wearing the right suit and being
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.360]  all into image that's meant to make everybody else insecure
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:44.080]  just like four thousand years ago in egypt and in china
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:48.480]  corrupt priest class learned how through ritual
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:52.800]  to enslave the elites and the people
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:56.480]  they trained women to have feet so small binding their feet they couldn't
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:12:59.520]  walk and fingering else so long they couldn't eat they trained the men
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:03.040]  similarly they were god no one could look at them nobody could talk to them
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:06.480]  they had to be prisoners in their little palace and only be talked to by the
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:10.000]  high priest they've done that with national
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.240]  security oh the high priest of national security the nsa the cia
[1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:18.560]  you know all they'll they'll take care of you you know they'll run the nation
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:21.360]  they'll steal all the money they'll ship in the drugs
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:24.560]  they're the new high priest and then they get the
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:28.400]  slaves down the steps of the big pyramids to look up
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:32.960]  and to think of the high priest and the emperor as gods in their big fancy
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:36.800]  headdress their costumes that's why police wear costumes
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:39.840]  it's coloration
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.320]  you know humans like costumes they like regalia
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:52.560]  they like signets of power and so you had black culture a hundred years ago
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:56.480]  segregated locked down in their own areas the whore houses could only be
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:00.480]  located in the black part of town that the the when drugs were
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:03.440]  made illegal by the drugs syndicate so they could make larger profits and
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:07.280]  control it with the police in the 1920s it could only be sold in the black
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:10.240]  communities the gambling can only be in the black
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:13.920]  communities and it was done to break down their society
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:17.600]  but so when white guys blue collar white collar rich
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.800]  wanted to go in and visit whores black white it didn't matter
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:26.400]  it can only be done in the black area and craftily the big psych warfare
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.400]  experts and margaret sanger wrote about this craftily they use they use black
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:34.480]  entertainers to tell blacks to get on birth control and to tell blacks
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:38.160]  to kick your man out of the house get on welfare in the 50s and 60s
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:41.360]  margaret sanger wrote about how they hired blacks
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:46.080]  entertainers and doctors and other people to go pimp out their own people
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:49.280]  and now they have the chicano leaders matcha and loraza
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:54.400]  fully funded by the big fortune 500 to give the people a fake chicano
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:15:00.640]  oslan you know uh machismo
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:08.240]  macho attitude but it's only a front to then have eugenics planned parenthood
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:11.920]  take the vaccines be slaves no real chicano community
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:17.040]  to stop the hispanic kids being cps to stop their people being put in prison
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.200]  and the media makes the the drug gangs the heroes they
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:25.040]  they build them up and then they push in the black culture and the white
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:27.360]  culture and then that becomes the entire culture
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:30.800]  bling and just total pettiness and brand names
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:36.800]  and just boiling it down to the most destructive culture you can imagine
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:41.680]  that was done because beta testing it was done to blacks first
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:45.440]  and then the mtv summoner redstone culture makes it
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:53.200]  nationwide worldwide in moscow in tokyo in johannesburg south africa
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:58.320]  in every major city of the planet it is the gangster culture
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:01.840]  not you don't care about women get them pregnant leave them that's perfect for
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:04.240]  the state to then get the kids and break up the family
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:07.680]  you'll steal rob whatever good sling the cia crack
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:13.360]  good enforcers then when we're done with you we're going to put you in the slam
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:16.320]  see it's all scientifically weaponized culture
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:21.120]  and michael jackson was the gateway to the latest phase launched in the early
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:25.600]  1980s he was the gateway to bring and this is
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:29.360]  all scientifically gridded out in predictive programming this is
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.280]  weaponized culture and so they don't build up black
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:36.880]  lawyers or black doctors or black scientists or any of this they build
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:39.920]  up the football player the basketball player the tiger
[1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:43.280]  woods and the kids all want to be there but there's not
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.520]  one one hundredth of the slots to be filled
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:50.480]  and then white kids suddenly don't want to be a doctor or a lawyer they're going
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:54.080]  to be a gangster they're going to sling cia dope
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:57.680]  they're going to be a big ricky ross but you're not going to be a ricky ross
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:02.480]  you're meant to go to a prison owned a slam owned by the big drug dealing
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.160]  cartels that are scientific with eggheaded scientists mechanized force
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.880]  you know deliver systems overall aggregate ai computer
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:12.240]  delivery system program launch these programs i mean it's all just mechanized
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:15.280]  scientific the whole military is converting to drones and attack
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:18.000]  aircraft how long until we don't even need the military
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.360]  how long until we have refurbishing robot factories to
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:25.200]  run the systems our estimates are within eight years will be ready to launch the
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:28.560]  attack sir good i want race specific weapons tested
[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:32.880]  and continual fields then they test the soft kill how are they covering up the
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:35.280]  soft kill how does the media make that a fan
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:38.480]  oh all the kids are dying of cancer now we wear little
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:42.400]  little ribbons and oh you're dying too you're in the club
[1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:45.920]  no why is everybody dying of cancer why is it exploding thousands of percent
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:49.520]  why is everybody getting diabetes why are they putting mercury on purpose
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:53.680]  in most of food products mainstream news why are they saying melamine that kills
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:57.760]  babies is good now oh thousands dying in china
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:01.280]  of melamine our news just says it's good in fact pull up mercury good for it and
[1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:04.160]  play that last week when i said i would pull up melamine good for you
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.200]  fda says melamine good for you led good for you msnbc i'm gonna go to
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:12.080]  micro vero and i appreciate him joining us
[1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:16.800]  this is death this culture is death this media is death it's all death i'm
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:20.960]  breaking in on the enemy transmission system
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:24.640]  they are so arrogant and so confident that you're going to get sucked into the
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:27.680]  media in the first phase of the internet that they're willing to even let me
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:31.680]  be on air folks they think so little of you they think you don't even listen or
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:33.840]  even care and that you can't even understand me
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:36.560]  and so now they're going into phase two to start restricting and shutting down
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:40.960]  the web and putting gatekeepers in and that's now happening
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:44.000]  coming up probably in a few years it's gonna be harder and harder to find me
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.040]  harder and harder to see what i'm saying you better save these recordings now
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:50.480]  you better give them to people because i'm not perfect folks and it isn't about
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:54.240]  alex jones but i know what i'm talking about i know who these people are i've
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:57.920]  studied history i've studied their programs i've studied how they operate
[1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:01.520]  and i know how to beat them and you beat them by having a huge
[1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:05.040]  awakening you beat them by totally jolting out of the
[1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:08.720]  fad driven society they know your tribal they know your
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:12.000]  fad driven they know your peer pressure driven like a dog
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.560]  it looks up to the alpha and they put fake alphas on tv and they say alphas
[1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:20.400]  are clowns that are drugged out and cut in their face up
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:24.720]  alphas are lindsay lowhand drunk on the side of the road
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:28.160]  they show you art types in all the dramas and tv shows that the guy that gets
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:33.280]  the girls is an idiot and is stupid and can't keep a job
[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:36.880]  it's all meant to destroy you and make you weak look what they've done
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:39.920]  to the african-american community they have destroyed
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:44.560]  90 plus percent illegitimacy 20 30 percent other people in prison
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:48.080]  they're gonna do that to everybody they're now done kind of eating the black
[1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:51.680]  people and they're moving on to everybody else and michael jackson
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:55.120]  is just one more salvo in this culture war micro vero what really happened

[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:29.040]  they've done spoofs on the web with ayatollahs in
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:35.280]  in iran dubbed over saying the cia killed michael jackson
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:39.440]  you know my gut probably says they did i mean this is perfect timing when he died
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:42.720]  perfect distraction we know they killed princess diana that's on record we know
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:45.360]  they killed jfk they're comparing into those people
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:47.760]  what a diversion what a distraction for the rest of the hour
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:51.680]  mike revero joins us once a month and i appreciate mike coming on the show today
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:55.760]  he joins us via video cam from the big island out in hawaii
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:58.880]  up at prism planet dot tv as we somal castle radio show
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:02.480]  mike i want to get into michael jackson but then stop there in the next segment
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:06.000]  and get into all the real issues that people aren't focused on
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.640]  while they're busy watching the spectacle of the snapping turtle
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.320]  well what's rather amazing is not that many people are watching and i know
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:17.840]  going around the channels on the tv said it looks like you know the big huge
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:21.120]  presentation and a lot of corporate media coverage
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:26.000]  but cnn's own online poll is showing that only about 20 percent of america are
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.560]  tuning in right now everybody else is fed up with it
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:32.080]  they've they've got michael jackson burnout there they're actually this is
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  good for us more and more people are coming to the blogs and the alternative
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:40.000]  media because they don't want to be inundated and saturated with michael
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.960]  jackson memorial and funeral and everything they see it as
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:46.640]  kind of a big joke i mean given the way that he lived his life
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:51.920]  and now they're honoring him like he's he's a deity incarnate as you said
[1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:53.840]  they're they're trying to make him into this
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:58.720]  pseudo royalty uh... but he was he was an entertainer and i liked his music
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:02.000]  and i got to work with him on a couple of occasions but he's he's just a
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.080]  an entertainer a musician and he died of a drug overdose this hardly anything
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:10.240]  newsworthy in that and they're trying to turn it into this big huge media issue
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:14.080]  and the public isn't buying it well mike i didn't know you worked with a
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:18.400]  snapping turtle i worked on a couple of his uh... early
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:22.240]  rock videos in fact the first one was all the way back when he was still with
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:27.280]  the jackson five and even then i could see all the handlers surrounding him and
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:30.080]  all the agents and promoters and protectors and everything
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:33.520]  and it was obvious then this was somebody who was never going to have a
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:37.600]  normal childhood it's probably the reason for neverland and all the rest of it
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:41.440]  that he's he was trying to recapture the childhood he was never allowed to have
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:45.040]  growing up but it was pretty obvious that he was in for a very rough ride
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:49.200]  uh... even all the way back then trying to capture recapture the childhood
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:53.680]  operative capture child uh... in the uh... spider web there
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:56.160]  i mean his father is admittedly an abuser
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:26:58.720]  i mean that they admit that on the mainstream news
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:01.840]  have you seen the video of him vampirically driving in the car
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:06.400]  with a look of pleasure just mindlessly basking in petty fame
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:10.400]  oh yeah well everybody in the family they're all hanging on here they're all
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:13.600]  they're all trying to capitalize and exploit this uh... for their own
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:18.080]  promotion uh... and and yeah it's it's amazing there are so many
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:21.600]  people trying to make money and trying to uh... improve their own
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:25.520]  reputations off of this uh... but as i said before cnn's own
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:29.200]  online poll is showing only about twenty percent of the people are tuning in
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:33.440]  my guess is sense a lot of people who are not watching are not even bothering to
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:37.680]  log into the cnn poll that the numbers may actually be uh... a lot worse i'm
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:41.760]  going to be taking a look at the actual uh... industry numbers after this is
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:45.120]  all over and look back on it but i don't think this is capturing the
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:47.200]  major piece of the audience that they were hoping
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:51.120]  but this has happened over and over again they will continue to assault us
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:55.520]  with oj or anna kohler whatever the new distraction is this week
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:59.600]  even as the poll numbers dropped to keep all the real issues out of the news
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:02.240]  and so when you're in a coffee shop you gotta hear people talking about michael
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:06.000]  jackson next to you this is the establishment trying to set the
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.120]  agenda they don't want to talk about auditing the federal reserve they don't
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:11.680]  want to talk about uh... wars in it
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:16.640]  pakistan and and and stage revolution iran they don't talk about cia coups
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:20.640]  uh... in honduras they don't want to talk about twenty percent and growing
[1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:24.080]  unemployment they don't talk about the dollar in freefall right now
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:27.840]  they want us to talk about the king of the snapping turtles
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:31.040]  that's absolutely correct and what's rather amazing we've had some of our
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:34.400]  readers from our website who've been following the situation with sythia
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:38.880]  mckinney and the hijacking by israel they're calling tv stations like wabc
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:43.040]  tv and they're being told by the newsroom no no no that is not news
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:46.000]  michael jackson is the news that is what we are covering
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.160]  and they're they're literally with were were fusing to acknowledge that there
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:54.240]  was this situation going on so we never see sythia mckinney again
[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:58.080]  or maybe they'll firing squadron and that won't even be news
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:02.000]  well supposedly she's on her way back to the united states and fox news finally
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.360]  did run a story saying she'd been released uh... which was immediately
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:08.000]  followed up with a whole bunch of posters and shills
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:11.840]  badmouthing sythia mckinney but during the whole situation i mean if you
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:15.520]  contrast this with two thousand and seven and the british sailors who wanted
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:20.080]  into iranian waters and it was headline news are they okay will iran mistreat
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:25.360]  them how dare iran are they torturing them you know we're against torture here
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:28.880]  we don't torture unless we torture and i was joking about firing squad folks
[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:32.720]  that's a joke for any emails about it i mean it was a joke might stay there let's
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:36.800]  uh... let's talk about the alternative media more and more punching through the
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:40.800]  mainstream media more more we're setting the agenda
[1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:43.680]  and so they're declaring us all terrorists big new developments on that
[1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:48.160]  front but attorney general i want your guns holder

[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:42.880]  i want people to see this while they're busy with some weird church set
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:47.120]  and i was during the break seeing him was saying the chosen one
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:51.440]  michael jackson the chosen one you know there are people there to see the
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:55.040]  chosen one the people that were chosen the chosen ones to
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:59.760]  be part of this i mean this is really disgusting
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:02.880]  and i guess they're going to start displaying his body or something
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:06.800]  coming up mike any final comments on jackson before we get into some of the
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:11.120]  real news that uh this has been serving as a distraction for
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:14.400]  well every time i look at these festivities i i flash back
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:19.120]  uh to the movie of tommy and the scene where they had the church that was
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:22.400]  based on maryland munro and i'm sort of wondering if it might
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:26.160]  actually happen with michael jackson where somebody literally starts a church
[1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:30.160]  to worship his memory and he's gone up to heaven to play the eternal guitar some
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:34.720]  such nonsense is that probably give the Scientologists a run for their money
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:37.840]  yeah they could start a new michael jackson cult
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:42.880]  and and and looking at all these people that are there around the body buzzing
[1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:47.120]  around like flies uh it's just disgusting i mean the
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:50.560]  whole thing is just a disgusting spectacle
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:56.080]  and here he is hanging the baby out over the balcony i mean this is a
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:00.480]  demon with a with a hood over its head can you imagine the fun he's having
[1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:05.280]  with those kids in there but it's okay this is a beautiful time
[1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:10.560]  this is so wonderful something wonderful is happening right now
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:13.840]  you say you worked with uh lord jackson i know you did a lot of work and still
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:16.960]  do in hollywood i actually somebody in my office
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:21.680]  worked at the hit factory which was a big recording studio
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:25.600]  in new york i guess about 10 years ago and he remembers jackson coming there
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.360]  to record stuff but he's signing on disclosures he won't
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:32.720]  tell the stories but it's basically what everybody's already heard about jackson
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:35.760]  when you worked with him i mean was it overtly freakish or was he just
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:40.640]  surrounded by all of his uh entourage now i when i worked with him was really
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.240]  early early on before the paranoia set in and they were making everybody signed
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:49.040]  on disclosures and like i said when i first met him he was a
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:52.240]  still a very small boy he was still with the jackson five
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:55.760]  uh but it was very obvious that he was being so groomed and so
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.320]  pushed to be this big star and i just my gut was saying this was somebody who's
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:03.840]  going to grow really messed up because he was never he was not allowed to be
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:08.320]  just a regular little boy and uh sadly of course this is what
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:13.120]  turned out to be the case now while we're talking about this they've passed the
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:15.840]  global carbon tax in the house it's probably going to pass the senate the
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:19.040]  hate crimes bill is supposedly going to be voted on as
[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:24.080]  early as thursday we've got reverend ted pike on tomorrow about that
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:27.600]  we have the fellow reserve has come out and announced
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:31.680]  they won a second bailout they were already given unlimited funds in the
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:35.520]  first one so that really it's on a bailout it's new powers over the entire
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:38.880]  economy uh we have them trying to pass a federalization
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:42.160]  of the entire united states under the guise of water above ground and below
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:45.680]  ground there i mean there's a bunch of other takeovers happening
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:49.760]  homeland securities announcing that their number one mission
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:54.000]  is engaging the american people and that white al qaeda is now the number one
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.640]  threat the british government's announcing that so basically
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:59.440]  anybody who criticizes the federal reserve and the corrupt bankers they're
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:03.840]  saying that is the terrorist they've got a bill
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:09.440]  on the verge of passing the house no fly no buy with over a million plus people
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.280]  are on this list they put you on the list whenever they feel like it
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:16.400]  but now the attorney general they're trying to pass a bill can ban any gun he
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:20.960]  wants x catheter like the pope who makes canon law
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:25.040]  by uttering it he just bans whatever guns he wants it says including all guns of
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.600]  he wishes bill gives attorney general power to
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:31.120]  designate gun owners tax protesters as terrorists a new bill
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:34.560]  where he'll without even letting you know he puts you on it says you can't find
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:37.920]  out he he puts you on the list but i guess it was really already like that
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:40.560]  they're just trying to get legal power now
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:43.920]  for the no fly no buy no live no have a job
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:47.520]  homeland security says if you're on that list or even if you have bad credit
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:50.800]  you're going to be on a no list no fly no buy no travel
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:54.640]  no have a job i mean this is literally putting the yellow stars on people and
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:59.040]  saying you can't have a job i mean it's now happening mike i mean they
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:02.080]  i'm even blown away that is actually all happening
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:06.080]  your comments on that well it does seem like the government is in a panic and
[1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:09.280]  they're trying to just get as many dictatorial powers passed as they
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:12.560]  possibly can the situation of putting people on
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:14.880]  terror watch list because their credit is bad
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:18.400]  that's extremely dangerous right now because under the current economy
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:21.840]  more and more people are seeing their credit ratings decline we're looking at
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:25.840]  record delinquencies on home equity loans and home mortgages
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.520]  we're looking at record defaults on credit cards we're seeing all these
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:31.680]  problems all of these are going to impact
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:34.640]  people's credit ratings and if you've got a bad credit rating and you're being
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:38.240]  declared a potential terrorist then obviously all of these other problems
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:41.840]  are are going to be multiplied by the actions of the federal government
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:44.720]  uh... as you were saying there's this amendment to the twenty ten uh...
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:48.240]  military appropriations bill that's going to give the attorney general the
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:51.760]  authority to declare tax protesters uh... as
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:55.440]  potential terrorists and terror suspects and the and the problem is
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.560]  the u.s. government got everybody to say okay torture is okay if you're
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:01.920]  torturing the terrorists now that they've got that they got their foot in the
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:05.600]  door they're lowering the bar for what constitutes a terrorist
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:08.000]  so that more and more people can be put in there
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.480]  and the government is going to say well you said it was okay to suspend the
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:14.480]  bill of rights for terrorists and now you're all terrorists so here we are
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:18.080]  and uh... it does feel like they're pushing as hard and as fast as they can
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:23.200]  it feels more like panic than planned to me
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:27.040]  well that's a really good point and if people think i'm joking
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:31.920]  about bad credit you're put on the terror list they made it secret
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:34.960]  six months ago seven months ago in january
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:37.680]  hardly we're already into the seventh month of 2009
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:42.160]  so seven months ago they made it secret and it had a million
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:47.360]  two hundred plus thousand on it then and they were adding twenty four thousand
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:51.920]  on average a month and federal marshals were in the denver post
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:55.280]  saying we're just ordered if somebody takes a picture of their kid on the
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:58.640]  plane to go ahead and put them in a terror database for the rest of their life
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:02.000]  uh... if you have bad credit people are on it
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.760]  and they're admitting you can't get off of it they won't tell you how they put you
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:08.880]  on it so that's being litigated so just like when
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:12.560]  wiretapping came out and it came out they were warrantlessly wiretapping the
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:16.080]  american people in non-terror related cases even
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:20.000]  they just went retroactively passed a law just like retroactively passing a
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.880]  torture law now they're just trying to retroactively
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:26.960]  say the attorney general's god no judge no jerry
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:29.680]  you don't know why you're on the list you don't know you're on a list
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:33.600]  till you try to fly now they're saying can't go in national parks can't have a
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.360]  job under the real id act if you're on that list can't have a job
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:41.920]  they're pushing people underground but then they're gonna offer the solution
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:45.600]  oh you can go to a government program and get on the trusted traveler
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:50.160]  will then do paperwork with you and let you put yourself into a type of
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:54.160]  probation with the government to work in government programs and
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:41:00.720]  to work in uh oh what's the term they use community service no judge no jury
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:05.280]  no arrest no indictment just oh you come serve us for a while
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:08.880]  so see people have to go serve in compulsory service
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:13.040]  just to get off the list and they're now saying oh that's how we'll get you off
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:16.720]  the list i mean this is this is so orwellian this is
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:20.800]  so cough to ask uh mike well it's very much like the old
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:24.560]  soviet union the soviet union went out of its way to find some reason to
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:28.080]  criminalize everybody so that they could just do what they wanted with them
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.080]  whenever they wanted and uh basically it's this kind of we're
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:37.200]  seeing the same creeping uh tyranny here in the united states
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:40.960]  and uh you know when when you have the idea that tax protesters are now
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.040]  considered terrorists protesting against taxes is why this country exists in the
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:48.080]  first place and is not still a part of great britain
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:52.400]  protesting is protected under the first amendment and protesting against taxes
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:56.640]  is the very kind of political speech the first amendment exists to protect
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:00.080]  and so all of this is very unconstitutional it's very blatant
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:03.200]  i'm wondering where's the united states supreme court on all of this
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:06.720]  and ultimately if the supreme court fails and the legislature fails to hold
[1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:10.240]  this executive in check you know we're looking at a crisis that's looming on
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:14.000]  the horizon for the american people and this is starting to get into that area
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.920]  of uh saying that we have around here on our coffee cups the fastest way to bring
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:20.400]  down a dictatorship is to force them to act like one
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:25.360]  where everybody can see it now the people are starting to see it
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:28.720]  well mike when you say the bell of rights and constitution
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:34.240]  is terrorism that's declaring war on america this is openly anti-liberty
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:39.440]  it's openly illegal that the federal government sees gm and then sell the
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:43.600]  dealerships off to donors at discounted prices and then to
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:47.440]  now have a bill where the federal reserve will control every
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:50.560]  facet of the economy this is openly been announced
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.400]  this is now admitted but it's not being debated
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:57.120]  and it looks like that's going to pass because they say look we won't turn the
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:00.960]  economy on to give us this new power and then there'll be a year later
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:07.040]  even more uh speak to that that and the direct carbon tax
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:12.160]  that's now past the house okay well first of all we're in a fascist economy
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:16.400]  right now in terms of of the reason things are the way they are musolini
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:21.760]  said that fascism should more properly be called corporatism and that is when
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:25.200]  corporations and the government are in league together
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:29.440]  to basically exploit the common people to extract wealth from them
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:32.720]  uh to basically grind them down into poverty and grab all the goodies for
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:35.680]  themselves that's why we're seeing this as far as the federal reserve is
[1:43:35.680 --> 1:43:38.400]  concerned we had bernanke just last week
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:42.880]  implying that the federal reserve will crash the economy before they allow
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:46.560]  themselves to be audited so that they're trying to play the doomsday card on
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:50.720]  that um uh so really we're a country that can't
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:55.200]  earn the money anymore so the people in power are simply using any means they
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:59.600]  can to grab what is left and pull it to themselves by the way he didn't imply he
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:03.120]  said it is basically a dictatorship if congress
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:06.960]  tries article one section eight is congress express power
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:11.600]  to control the money supply or economic policy that that is an undue seizure of
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:14.720]  power that's congress seizing power is this quote
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:20.000]  and that the economy would go into depression implode so he's openly saying
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:25.200]  look i got a gun to your country's head i run things sit down and shut up
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:28.720]  well the federal reserve or the central banks because we've had central banks
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:32.000]  before the federal reserve but if you look at this lineup of history
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:36.320]  where andrew jackson revoked the charter of an earlier central bank because it
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:39.440]  was doing to the united states exactly what the federal reserve is doing
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:43.360]  today it was impoverishing the the ordinary working people it was pulling
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:46.080]  all the money to itself it was above any control
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:50.640]  andrew jackson revoked the charter uh he survived an assassination attempt then
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:53.360]  you had abraham lincoln who issued his greenbacks
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:57.040]  so he wouldn't plunge the country into debt to the central bank that was in
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:00.160]  existence then he was assassinated and his greenbacks
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:03.920]  destroyed immediately john f kennedy signed executive order one one one one
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:07.280]  zero issuing a new form of silver certificate a
[1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:10.240]  debt-free currency for the american people to use
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:14.320]  five months later he was assassinated and the the u.s notes
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:16.960]  that kennedy created were pulled out of circulation
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:23.200]  so there's an ongoing pattern here of a war going on between the bankers
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:26.640]  and the civilian government and right now our congress
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:30.240]  appears to have changed sides and is working with the banks
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:34.720]  against the people and that is fascism
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.000]  well it certainly is and i'm gonna go to some calls but i wanted to bring this
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:41.920]  up to you senate blocks bill to audit the fed
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:45.200]  as government prepares for a second round of looting
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:49.280]  paul joseph watson july 7th prison planet dot com it's up there right now
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:53.360]  and he has links to all their statements and the vice president
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:57.760]  is saying we need a second round they're gonna bill in the media a second round
[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:01.120]  of stimulus all the economy was worse than we thought
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:06.080]  we need more money but wait the actual banker bailout as it was called
[1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:10.640]  we truly named it the properly named it the banker takeover
[1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:15.840]  it said unlimited money no oversight the private fellow reserve could steal as
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:19.680]  much money as it wanted now they won't say where the money went
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:24.800]  but they at the same time publicly give it to golden sacks and aig and others
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:29.360]  so they're taking it in private bonuses record bonuses
[1:46:29.360 --> 1:46:35.120]  so to simplify it they got all the money in power earlier now they want the power
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:40.080]  to forcibly pirate and commandeer the rest of industry in the economy
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:44.000]  that was a beta test gm and chrysler to see if they get away with that
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.320]  and then now the senate's saying there'll be no vote in the senate
[1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:53.360]  on hr 1207 to audit the private fed instead
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:56.960]  we're going to build this is stimulus to
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:00.800]  and give them the dictatorial power in the fall right when they're going to be
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:04.480]  fear-mongering about the bird flu and staging attacks on god knows what
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:07.280]  country might yeah absolutely there's a lot of
[1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:10.320]  fear-mongering there's a lot of distractions michael jackson's obviously
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:13.920]  one of them the government and the bankers are terrified that the american
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:17.040]  people may be waking up a little bit faster than they were hoping
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:21.200]  and the bottom line is and and i hate to be the one to say this because
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:25.040]  a major reason i've worked at what really happened for all these years
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:29.120]  was to avoid any kind of a violent revolution coming to this united states
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:31.760]  by encouraging our government and our industry
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:35.760]  to act a little bit more responsibly sadly i i don't think that's worked out
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.040]  i think we are coming up on a point where we're going to see violence in the
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:42.320]  streets of america and i don't like it but i don't see any way to avoid it at
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:44.640]  this point and that's why the attorney general's
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:49.040]  out giving speeches saying we're going to put you without judge without jury
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:51.600]  without charges without arrest on list
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:54.960]  and you're going to be homeless and if you get up at it we're going to send a
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:57.840]  SWAT team to kill you i mean that's and and they're
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:01.600]  federalizing everywhere and openly saying forget al-qaeda
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:05.680]  we're not worried about them now it's you it's conservatives it's gun owners
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:08.640]  libertarians the army's coming after you now
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:11.760]  and the army suddenly is in all the major police departments
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:17.760]  cia local offices i mean it's it hell is being released but mike
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:21.520]  they're just going to keep pushing and pushing they want a conflict see
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:24.400]  why do they want a conflict or do you disagree you think they just don't
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:26.960]  understand what they're about to do clearly they know what they're doing
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:31.200]  they're gearing up for it well i think they're gearing up against a possible
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:35.040]  revolt but i'm pretty sure they're they're their ideal would be that we the
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:38.480]  american people will just knuckle under and surrender completely and they
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:40.800]  won't have to go to that open force in the streets
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:44.560]  because the instant the guns start firing in the streets of america
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:47.840]  uh... the rest of the country is definitely going to wake up remember
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:51.040]  what kent state did to the consciousness of america
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:53.600]  uh... the government does not want a new kent state
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:57.520]  they're preparing for a worst-case scenario of a mass public uprising
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:00.720]  i think they're still convinced that they can complete the encirclement and
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:05.360]  enslavement of america without having to fire a shot and that that is their ideal
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:09.920]  because once the shooting starts then all the pretext and all the illusion
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:12.640]  is gone completely but here's the problem
[1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:18.480]  here's the problem the king ace the ace of spades in the hole
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:21.920]  and i predicted this years ago because i know the enemy's mind i thought the
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:26.080]  most dastardly wicked deceptive things and then that's always what they
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:28.880]  actually do and i've said they're going to have
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:34.960]  supposed militias attack schools and attack aid food convoys as
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:40.800]  things break down they're going to have militias attack convoys
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:44.560]  and they'll even put out fake videos oh look the militia film this themselves
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:47.920]  it'll really be black ops doing it and then they're going to say oh look
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:50.800]  here's the militia killing the veteran trying to deliver food to the
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:54.480]  children since i predicted that i've seen them do
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:58.240]  drills on attacking schools unannounced saying we're homeschoolers here
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:02.240]  kill you freaking the kids out you know the police with under federal grants
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:06.800]  i've seen the army in missouri doing drills of militias attacking
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:10.880]  medical convoys in the u.s so they're drilling the cops
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:14.560]  and doing ied training that the veterans and gun owners are going to attack them
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:17.680]  and they're going to go and then the feds are going to go out or black ops
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:20.720]  mercs they've already been caught in iraq doing this in afghanistan and they're
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:23.920]  going to kill our own troops and i think the troops are going to buy it i think
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:26.480]  they're going to go ahead and just start killing us
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:30.240]  i don't think so and the reason is because the government has been caught
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:33.600]  lying so many times i mean right now anytime somebody sees something on the
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:37.920]  news um like the violence in iran that that was a coup d'etat that just fell
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:41.280]  flat on its face because the people who were watching the fake videos and
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:44.560]  everything were saying why would these people do something
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:47.920]  so obviously intended to create hostility and resistance to our
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:51.360]  i hope you're right policy listen i agree with you that it's not going to go
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:54.880]  well for him but the michael jackson fans the idiots are going to buy the
[1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:58.080]  people that don't know what country this is and just go
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:00.960]  they're gonna believe anything they're told so i'm just gonna get ready for it

[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:43.680]  people have been killed in rioting in china's northwestern
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:47.360]  region the government blaming exiled separatists for the additionally muslim
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:51.120]  areas worst case of unrest in years hundreds of people have been arrested
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:55.120]  the official news agency said after protesters from
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:01:02.080]  the uger minority took the streets of the regional capital on sunday
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:06.080]  burning and smashing vehicles and shops and clashing with
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:10.880]  anti-riot police in terms of china's domestic economy
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:14.880]  it is a remote place and it doesn't have a big impact china said
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:18.000]  folks this is happening all over china every day
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.440]  their people are sick of the corruption it's always over
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.200]  some communist party chief owning half the town and his son
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:29.200]  raping women and you know i mean or robbing people it's always
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:33.520]  the spoiled rotten kids of boss hog doing this and we're getting sick of the
[2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:37.280]  boss hogs here too micro vero what's going to happen to the boss hog i mean
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:42.320]  is is this the age of boss hog with high technology is boss hog going to rule
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:45.600]  and and and openly we're going to carry him carry him around with their pot
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:49.600]  bellies and we're going to worship them or we're going to defeat the boss hogs
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:53.280]  well i always think back to a statement that gandhi used to make which is that
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:56.640]  tyrants and dictators have always been around in history
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:02.480]  and for a time they can seem to be you know almighty and all powerful but
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:07.360]  eventually they always fall and sometimes just through their own
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:12.000]  incompetence and corruption and rot because when you rise to power you draw
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:15.280]  around you all kinds of people who want power and want wealth
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:18.800]  and eventually that structure almost becomes too heavy to sustain
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:21.360]  no matter how powerful the central ruler is
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:26.320]  and uh... in that lies the fall of basically every empire
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:29.600]  but the average american doesn't even know what an empire is they think that's
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:34.080]  a conspiracy term i mean i literally talk to newspaper reporters now
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:37.200]  and it's like their mind control drones or something
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:40.960]  mike i mean i i i i'm not even that smart and it's like i'm like
[2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:44.000]  some genius creature above all these children now
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.680]  and they're just running around guzzling fluoride giggling i mean
[2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:50.800]  well it's amazing but you know i actually taught out here at the university
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:55.200]  of hawai for a while in and i got to see the media department up close and it
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:02:58.400]  is certainly changing because i took journalism when i was in college many
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:01.040]  many many years ago and it was about going out and get the story and get the
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:03.360]  facts make sure you've got everything accurate
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:05.840]  uh... today it's they're teaching them how to
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:09.840]  do their hair and and put on the makeup and where the lighting should be and
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:12.800]  how to look really good on the camera and we've certainly seen it in the
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:16.000]  country government how to read a government press release
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.520]  the reality is basically what comes through that computer on their desk
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:23.200]  a while ago uh... one of the network affiliates i tried to give them one of
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:26.880]  the deception dollars at the height of the the bush regime
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:29.680]  and absolutely wouldn't touch it wasn't interested
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:33.600]  and said if i touch that it's my job so the people working in the corporate
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:35.920]  media they they know where the line is
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:39.680]  and they know what they want to be slaves they want to pimp us out
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:43.520]  but then pimp themselves out the problem in its fame
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:47.520]  the problem is that when you just have a sellout attitude the wolves come
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:51.040]  don't they understand that when you don't stand for anything you get run over
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:54.880]  big time they they don't see what's coming at
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:58.080]  the end they don't understand what Stalin meant by the useful idiots they
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:01.600]  figure it's a good ride now i've got money now i've got fame now
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:05.120]  i'm going to be a big huge star they look at people like dan rather who
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:09.280]  basically rose to fame uh... lying about the headshot to john f
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:11.600]  kennedy and he had this wonderful career
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:15.280]  that's what they want and they've made the decision they will do as they are
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:18.960]  told in order to get that wealth and fame
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:22.160]  well they're definitely getting desperate when the attorney general comes
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:25.360]  out and says i'm just going to ban conservative zoning guns and basically
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:29.120]  that's what they're doing we're going to selectively extraditionally ban you
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:32.560]  owning guns i mean this is going to blow up
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:36.640]  in their face this is not going to work and but i mean to see
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:39.840]  him trying to have a soviet style takeover of the u.s
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:43.680]  or a fascist takeover whatever you want to call it to see a real attempted
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:47.520]  takeover is something to behold mike revero what really happened dot com

[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:17.760]  caught shipping in wahhabist terrorist uh now into iraq to attack our
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:21.040]  trips and the magnitude of this is so huge
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:24.240]  so i want to talk about that with him just the overall geopolitical
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:28.240]  situation what he thinks of obama better than bush
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:32.560]  worse than bush uh dr francis boil thank you for joining us
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:37.760]  well alec thank you very much for having me on in my best realistic audience
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:40.480]  okay you heard me throw out all those points where should we start let's talk
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:44.400]  about obama right what we're seeing here um
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:49.040]  is continuity in the policy across the board uh
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:57.360]  with bush uh they're obviously they're smoother in terms of uh public relations
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:04.080]  um and media which is why obama won the democratic primary and and the election
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:10.160]  but in terms of uh policies not really uh much change here in the united states
[2:11:10.160 --> 2:11:15.360]  domestically uh most important for us all all the key
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:20.800]  elements of the uh bush police state that we have discussed before
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:28.720]  uh remain in place and in fact uh obama who is a lawyer uh used to teach a
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:32.960]  constitutional law although at the university of chicago which is the home
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:37.840]  for the neocons uh and where he drives drives many of his advisors
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:44.000]  in economics and things of this nature uh ordered his uh lawyers to uh go into
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:51.040]  court and instead of abandoning uh or reversing the bush positions
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:58.400]  uh continue to uh ratify them uh in uh federal courts all over the country
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:04.480]  indeed his uh solicitor general um alayna kagan from harvard law school the
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:09.040]  former dean there is a uh lackey for uh mary
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:14.640]  summers uh that when summers was president of harvard uh he put her in power
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:19.040]  uh she immediately turned around and hired one of these uh torture lawyers
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:22.000]  out of the bush administration a guy named goldsmith
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.200]  but many of us in the profession believe is the war criminal
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:28.400]  uh i tried to stop it she hired him anyway
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:32.480]  because uh both larry summers and kagan
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:39.520]  uh even as of today fully support the uh bogus bush war on terrorism and in
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:45.600]  her capacity then as solicitor general uh she works with the uh attorney general
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:48.800]  but basically is in charge of litigation strategy
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:53.680]  um throughout united states federal courts especially at the supreme court
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:58.560]  and the uh court of appeals and if you follow all the cases since they came to
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:03.360]  power uh there had been no change no no breakthroughs no nothing
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:10.400]  uh they're going to reconstitute the uh the kangaroo courts uh in guantanamo
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:14.640]  uh in addition obama is worse than bush
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:18.400]  in that now he and his administration have publicly
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:22.720]  raised uh instituting preventive detention
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:27.360]  here in the united states of america to the best of my knowledge the bush
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:31.360]  administration has not yet gone uh that far
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:35.200]  so in other words they're going to be importing
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:41.920]  the kangaroo court system uh on guantanamo which so far we have only
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:46.320]  applied to aliens moving it in here to the uh
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:51.280]  territory of the united states of america and potentially applying it to uh
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:55.040]  united states citizens and you know obama as i said
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:59.680]  dot com lump at the university of chicago that law school is completely
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:03.040]  right wing uh i went there as an undergrad actually i was
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:06.800]  accepted there uh to law school thank heaven i got a tough
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:10.000]  harvard law school which is a bit more uh progressive
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:15.120]  uh than that place so he knows exactly what he's doing
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:22.640]  and he's continuing to construct uh the the architecture of a police state
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:28.560]  here uh in america um as for a broad uh again
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:33.840]  continuity of policy uh more threats provocation uh
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:40.400]  intimidation destabilization of iran uh this was uh orchestrated as we know
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:43.760]  out of the white house uh where he had this fellow jerry
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.600]  cone who worked for the uh policy planning
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:54.240]  division uh ordered uh twitter to remain open uh so it could be used as a
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:58.720]  tool to uh destabilize iran uh the policy planning
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:03.680]  bureau is headed by uh anmarie slaughter uh behind me at harvard law
[2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:08.560]  school uh another neil con uh while she was uh dean at the
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:12.480]  woodrow wilson school uh she openly and publicly
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:17.680]  mongered for war uh against iraq did everything she could in her capacity
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:20.880]  using the name of that of her of her deanship
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:24.800]  and also as president of the american society of international law
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:30.000]  to support a war of aggression against iraq uh up to and including uh
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:36.160]  assassinating uh saddam Hussein uh murdering ahead of state which is uh
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:42.320]  an international crime condi rice uh put her on uh i believe it was one of
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:46.160]  her uh democracy uh promotion committee and we all
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:51.280]  know that means regime change so she's now there uh at the state department
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:54.800]  at the state department for the destabilization of iran was
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:59.360]  of course denis ross uh a long time uh neil con
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:05.040]  uh agent for the uh israeli government uh i was up against him at the uh
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:11.600]  middle east peace negotiations from 1991 to 93 uh ross is more loyal to israel
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:17.360]  uh than he is to the united states uh he did such a wonderful job of
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:22.240]  starting this destabilization uh against iran over the election
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:25.440]  that he has now been moved to the white house
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:32.400]  and promoted and he is uh obama's right-hand man now orchestrating
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:38.880]  uh u.s policy toward this entire region it's not just iran but the gulf
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:44.640]  and uh central asia okay dr boil dr boil yeah i mean this is all
[2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:47.360]  incredible info you're laying out and you've worked in and around all these
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:51.520]  people so you're the expert to have on but our limited time i want to digress
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:56.000]  back sure and then continue forward
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:59.440]  i mean you were hopeful with obama dr paul craig robert's a conservative was
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:02.000]  hopeful many people were because bush had been so
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:06.160]  so horrid are you saying though from your educated perspective
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:10.240]  in so many of these fields that clearly i mean to me
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:14.000]  he is the ultimate left cover closer to kind of
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:17.120]  keep the empire going and expanding and really
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:22.480]  cement the horrible police state measures here in the united states the
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:26.080]  wiretapping the secret arrest the north com the
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:29.680]  military openly announcing local cia offices
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:33.600]  opening up i mean i feel like i've entered some alternate dimension of
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:37.120]  police state uh so i'd like you to specifically
[2:17:37.120 --> 2:17:41.360]  speak to that and then suddenly the left that decried bush is in love
[2:17:41.360 --> 2:17:47.520]  with the jack boot right well um i think you are right about uh obama if you
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:51.360]  you saw the uh summit there uh in mosco
[2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:56.080]  obama is kind of like medvedev who's a who's a figurehead
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:01.120]  uh for the people who uh put him in power we know in russia the real power
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:05.600]  is putin and the kgb uh putin used to be head of the kgb
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:09.600]  once kgb always uh kgb so it was a puppet meeting
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:12.960]  i mean that's what i thought this morning watching and i said look the two
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:18.320]  bookends the two puppets are together and uh he is the top advisor on russia
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:23.360]  is a neocon named mcfall from the hoover institute
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:27.280]  where kondi rice came from and has now returned
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:33.760]  to so it's a revolving door of the neocon so where is all this going we know we
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:36.160]  kept gates we know it's neocon you're right there
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:40.480]  where does this go now who are they gonna attack next
[2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:46.080]  well i regret to say it if you listen to uh vice president uh
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:51.040]  biden statement it looks like uh it's going to be a rant
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:56.240]  uh you know he basically said gave a green light
[2:18:56.240 --> 2:19:01.520]  uh for israel uh to attack rand
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:04.880]  today the speaker of the iranian parliament said well
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:08.720]  uh we will treat any attack upon us by israel
[2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:15.840]  uh as an attack by the united states interestingly enough during the cuban
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:20.560]  missile crisis the kennedy administration took the position
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:27.520]  that any attack upon the united states or its allies uh by cuba will be treated
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:31.200]  uh as an attack by the soviet union
[2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:35.120]  and there will be retaliation by this against the soviet union
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:40.640]  um so you know this this is very uh dangerous what is going on right now
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:44.800]  uh hit a ramp and then obama may not even have to stage terror attacks there
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:48.400]  might actually be some real ones then he can use that to clamp down on us
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:51.680]  final segment with dr frances boil which we had him for longer but he's about to
[2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:55.600]  go out of town uh just amazing info here but none of this

[2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:58.800]  reserve dictatorship with the quote second bailout where they can
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:02.080]  seize any business they want they're taking over the water supply they're
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:05.360]  taking over free speech the hate crime bill passed the house
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:08.560]  it says if you hurt someone's feelings the feds can arrest you
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:13.280]  i mean it it it seems like as bad as bush was
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:17.440]  it's 10 times worse under obama from your perspective is that an accurate
[2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:20.160]  statement i wouldn't say it's 10 times worse what i would
[2:25:20.160 --> 2:25:25.840]  say alex is that they're just continuing and compounding the
[2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:29.680]  trends that we saw under bush we have to understand who
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:35.840]  who is behind obama um obama studied uh for two years at columbia
[2:25:35.840 --> 2:25:41.520]  university where his mentor was big this big nephew jinsky
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:46.080]  all right and uh behind virgin ski is of course
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:51.680]  david rockefeller okay uh it was david rockefeller who set up the trilateral
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:56.400]  commission and appointed uh virgin ski as the executive
[2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:01.120]  director and they then co-opted the georgia governor jimmy
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:05.440]  carter and turned him into being president
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:08.960]  uh well where do you think obama came from it it's
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:13.360]  it's the same um thing all over again
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:19.120]  uh likewise uh kissinger general jones the national security advisor has
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:23.120]  stated that he takes directions from kissinger
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:31.440]  uh every day who is behind kissinger uh two forces primary sources behind
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:37.360]  kissinger one he was in uh army carler intelligence in world war two
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:42.320]  so effectively he's a spook two david rockefeller
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:46.480]  um and kissinger is an alleged uh republican
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:49.920]  uh although he also worked for nelson rockefeller he
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:53.200]  you know he he he he was a switch hitter between the
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:56.400]  wasn't a republican wasn't david rockefeller also in
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:00.080]  intelligence evidence shows i i do not know if david
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:04.720]  rockefeller himself was or or was not but kissinger
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:09.680]  uh was denied tenure at harvard originally and he went to work for david
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:13.440]  rockefeller and he was put on the rockefeller family
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:18.960]  payroll and he is still uh advising uh the obama
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:24.240]  administration we also know from bob woodward's book uh that
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:30.240]  president bush jr uh was being advised by kissinger uh as
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:36.320]  well indeed was probably uh his most important and influential advisor uh
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:39.760]  we also know that uh a matter of public record
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:43.360]  uh kissinger is advising the uh german pope
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:50.320]  uh so uh you tie all the uh uh dots together here and you know what do you
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:56.320]  come up with as i said you know you come up with a continuity of you know the
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:01.840]  plutocracy uh running the show like like the rockefellers
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:08.880]  and then uh having the money to pay for the brain power uh like kissinger
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:15.120]  and burjinsky uh and their protege to do the dirty work for them and that's
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:19.600]  pretty much what's going on in obama you know he he fits right there just like
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:23.600]  jimmy carter was a new face uh a clean man
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:28.080]  uh et cetera you know about his uh reputation when he ran for president
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.480]  and then uh what happened but you really have to look at at the people
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:35.600]  behind uh obama you know it it's a bit like the
[2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:39.760]  wizard of odd here you know who's pulling the string
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:43.520]  well exactly you say it much better than i did
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:46.480]  and that's what it is it's just a little hand uh
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:50.960]  uh alex but um you know you just have to look at the same cast of characters
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:55.200]  you know kissinger and burjinsky have effectively been running
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:00.560]  uh either south uh madeline albright for example was uh a burjinsky
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:04.960]  uh protege when you know she you're familiar with madeline albright
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:10.160]  sure former senator is burjinsky is rockefeller burjinsky has no money no
[2:29:10.160 --> 2:29:14.800]  power kissinger has no money no power uh but they were
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:18.800]  co-opted by intelligence agencies and
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:23.600]  plutocracy plutocrats like rockefeller to run the empire
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:28.400]  and the police state uh uh for them and so the reason
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:31.440]  we've got a break in a final segment with you dr boil the reason it's getting
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:35.280]  so bad is that's just the program we're just marching deeper
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:38.960]  deeper down but but clearly they're accelerating the whole program so we'll
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:42.400]  ask you what the end game what the great game is
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:45.360]  when we get back and about government sponsored terror
[2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:49.280]  and what will this look like if they do hit iran what's some of the possible
[2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:52.720]  outcomes of that are with our guests we're on the march
[2:29:52.720 --> 2:30:01.120]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:01.120 --> 2:30:04.400]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider

[2:30:14.880 --> 2:30:18.400]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:22.240]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three

[2:33:14.640 --> 2:33:20.160]  all right final segment Dr. Francis Boyle his new book is out
[2:33:20.160 --> 2:33:23.600]  tackling America's toughest questions alternative media interviews
[2:33:23.600 --> 2:33:27.120]  him to briefly tell you about that in a few minutes before he goes
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:33.440]  but um on the subject of the chicago business school where all these people
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:35.600]  come from and you went to school with all these
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:38.080]  individuals you were telling me during the break
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:41.120]  about how this really all goes back to the Rockefellers then i briefly wanted
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:43.680]  to talk about government sponsored terror
[2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:47.680]  i ran on record having the united states states terror attacks inside of it
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:51.360]  and i guess the american people are ignorant of that are comfortable with it
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:58.400]  uh and what an attack on iran will cause yeah well if the united states
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:05.360]  either itself or with israel or israel unilaterally attacks iran
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:09.360]  um you'll see the entire middle east blow up
[2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:15.760]  everywhere from um uh gaza and by the way a good deal the middle east is
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:20.800]  already in plane now uh iraq uh afghanistan and pakistan
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:26.720]  and notice um obama uh put the well-known neocon
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:32.320]  uh richard holbrook in charge of uh afghanistan and pakistan
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:39.040]  and holbrook has now spread the um afghanistan war into pakistan
[2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:44.640]  deliberately and on purpose uh has created a total humanitarian catastrophe
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:51.760]  for two million completely innocent uh pakistani and is destabilizing
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:55.760]  uh pakistan very much like what was done
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:35:00.160]  uh with iraq uh iraq has been destabilized
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:05.120]  effectively carved up into three pieces uh and neutralized
[2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:12.160]  um so you have a war in iraq afghanistan um pakistan already
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:16.640]  uh if iran is attacked the entire persian gulf everywhere
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:20.800]  will blow up uh at least from egypt over to india
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:28.080]  this whole area will become a war zone and you will call when um
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:35.120]  president bush was in power at that time president putin the kgb agent
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:41.680]  uh went over to iran and said uh he did not believe iran was developing
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:46.560]  nuclear weapons where upon president bush got up
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:50.960]  and publicly threatened world war three
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:56.880]  uh over iran nuclear program that everyone agrees they're not
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:01.280]  not developing nuclear weapons but he threatened world war three
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:08.480]  now clearly uh iran uh it is not capable of waging world war three
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:13.360]  that threat was directed at then president putin
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:16.640]  and then we saw 888 we saw that sneak attack
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:20.160]  saying right that we uh we the united states
[2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:27.200]  uh are prepared to take over iran and risk uh world war three
[2:36:27.200 --> 2:36:34.480]  uh with you russia and you better understand that uh just soon
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:40.880]  thereafter then um president putin gave a press conference
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:46.400]  responding to the proposal to deploy these abm systems in europe
[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:53.280]  which by the way uh yesterday obama indicated under mcphol's influence
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:59.040]  they still were not going to give up um president putin said you know if you
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:02.880]  keep these things in europe you are risking another cuban
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:05.680]  missile crisis and you know i live through the cuban
[2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:10.320]  missile crisis i remember it uh quite well uh the world came
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:14.880]  you know within a hair breadth of of destruction
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:22.400]  so that is what we right now are facing uh under obama
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:29.680]  with these characters that uh he has uh in power uh surrounding him
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:34.080]  and of course if the whole middle east blows up and they're also
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:36.960]  uh you know terrorist attacks launched by iran
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:43.600]  um uh in europe um you'll have the immediate imposition of
[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:47.120]  of a de jure police state here in america remember
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:49.920]  and i guarantee you they're probably gonna try to come arrest you right
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:51.920]  they're i mean they're gonna try to come arrest you
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.240]  yeah i'm on the terrorist watch list that's correct i'm on a list of uh
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:03.920]  four thousand uh select people uh at the top of the cia fbi
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:10.000]  uh terrorist watch list and yes the cia has set off officers all over the
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:14.800]  country they've come in here me to interrogate me
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:19.120]  and try to get me to become an informant on my era of the muslim clients
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:24.000]  which i refuse to do uh it would have violated my ethical obligations as an
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:27.040]  attorney and their constitutional right
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.200]  so they put me on this uh terrorist watch list and the cia is not supposed
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:35.200]  to be operating domestically and they're putting local army in every
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:38.880]  major police department now and putting it in the news
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:42.320]  i mean they are really getting ready they're brazen
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:46.880]  uh about this and then you've already mentioned uh coordinating this with
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:51.120]  north cop so what and i believe it was cheney who
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:54.080]  said that you know if there's a terrorist attack he'll
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:59.280]  he'll blame it on a ramp um and uh you know it was tomie
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:05.520]  franks uh who said uh after 9 11 uh general tomie frank
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:09.440]  america is just one terrorist attack away uh
[2:39:09.440 --> 2:39:13.600]  from uh a military state you know he said that i think he knew
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:18.560]  what he was talking about uh a military takeover the country he said
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:26.320]  the american people uh will demand it so it would be you know even worse than
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:32.160]  say what we saw in world war two uh internment of uh japanese american
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:37.280]  citizens and things of that nature um you know it it would be very
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:40.960]  serious so it's the perfect takeover they get to
[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:44.240]  move their chess pieces around the world destabilize the planet
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:49.520]  use proxy states kamikaze's uh bombard other nations from the air
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:54.000]  and have domestic police state crackdowns in airstrip one england
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:59.440]  and the united states and put out dhs lists leaking liberals conservatives
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:03.680]  gun owners openly say homeland brigade openly turning
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:08.480]  united states into a total police state my god they are really doing it do you
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:10.560]  think they'll get away with it i mean are these guys
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:16.560]  so bold is there no end is the public mesmerized by michael jackson will
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:21.520]  america completely descend into total military rule
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:25.200]  well i'm afraid they've been mesmerized by uh barack obama
[2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:29.440]  um you know you have to look at what obama and his henchmen and his hench
[2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:33.280]  women are doing here and not what obama is saying
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:39.600]  he's uh a far smoother uh political character than uh bush
[2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:43.120]  with you know at least bush uh you know pretty much
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:47.280]  said what he meant met what he said and you know you could you could really see
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:51.920]  it whereas with obama uh the rhetoric the propaganda the
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:58.000]  press conferences very smooth very reassuring uh but the policies as you
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:02.800]  point out are just continuing and in some extent uh accelerating even
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:07.200]  senator mccain in the campaign when obama
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:12.400]  said that he would he was going to launch a tax on pakistan
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:17.520]  senator mccain to his credit criticized obama and said he he was not going to
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:22.240]  do that um and you have this massive escalation
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:27.120]  in afghanistan now no authorization for the one security council
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:31.440]  no authorization for the united states congress is required by the
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:37.360]  uh war powers revolution and then expanding the war uh into pakistan
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:43.760]  very reminiscent of um uh the uh massive escalation into vietnam
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:47.120]  indeed uh today they you know they admitted well yeah we really need about
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.360]  at least a hundred thousand uh american troops in afghanistan
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:54.960]  well the soviets had a hundred thousand troops uh in afghanistan and they
[2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:59.440]  still lost um so um you know this is very dangerous
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:03.280]  and then like nixon then spreading the um
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:08.480]  uh vietnam war to cambodia uh setting off a coup d'etat there
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:12.400]  uh resulting in the kimera rouge coming to power and genocide
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:17.200]  uh which brazinski brags he supported and then that goes back to the rocker
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:22.960]  fellers again in closing then dr boil does it look 60 40 60 chance
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:26.240]  they're going to go ahead and launch world war three i mean what do we do to
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:29.120]  put pressure on them is there any hope or is it just all
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:33.200]  the fad of obama and that's the end of it and
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:36.640]  that's the end of the republic well i think you know it really is up
[2:42:36.640 --> 2:42:40.560]  up to you and me and the american citizens most american people here
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:45.600]  don't want war against toran we don't want a world war three
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:49.120]  um and we're going to have to get organized and uh
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:53.760]  uh stop these people i also noticed uh even in the pentagon there the
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:58.160]  admiral uh mullen in response to the bite and threat
[2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:03.680]  uh against toran uh said that you know an attack on iran would be a bad idea
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:06.960]  so i you know i think you know in their heart of heart the professional
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:10.320]  military people well life this would be insane but hey
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:14.880]  the war against iran was insane too well that goes back to fox fowlin
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:17.760]  coming and that goes back to fox fowlin the phalan
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:20.880]  he didn't want to attack iran and resigned over that so
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:25.040]  so bush fired him that's pretty clear first got rid of him and forced
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.840]  forced uh admiral fallen out because he was going public
[2:43:29.840 --> 2:43:36.400]  uh with the bush neocon plans to uh attack iran and admiral phalan did the
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:40.480]  best he could to blow the whistle and stop it too i think is great credit
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:44.560]  so that's the silver lining admiral phalan so so that's the silver lining
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.560]  in this cloud is that the neocons one and now the
[2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:52.640]  neocons two reincarnated with the slicker kind of new older closer barack
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:57.840]  obama they're almost giving orders like hitler to armies that don't exist
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:02.000]  or will they just go ahead and give the order and it's going to be followed
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:05.120]  i really don't know i don't even know if they know
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:08.880]  you know if uh the pentagon order to attack
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:12.400]  iran would they carry out that order clearly phalan made it clear he wasn't
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:18.240]  going to do it the problem there however is the neocon connection with israel
[2:44:18.240 --> 2:44:23.280]  which is why byton's threat is so dangerous that if if the neocons
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:27.920]  uh and bite is one of them uh conclude that the uh pentagon
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:31.840]  uh would not attack uh iran and resist the orders
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:35.920]  they'll just have israel do and then you know iran will
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:40.880]  retaliate against us and the world be off well i mean i'm no geopolitical whiz
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:45.360]  kid but this is in sheer insanity to attack iran especially if you even
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:49.120]  believe the cia's assessment there's seven years from a primitive nuke and
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:52.720]  then you find out the west help give north korea its nukes
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:56.800]  with the same old suspects donald rumsfeld on the board of abb
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:00.080]  they're out there throwing down guns to these third world countries
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:03.840]  like an old western villain and then saying pick up the gun kid
[2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:09.360]  so they can shoot them and it's just it's it's obvious the real target is
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:13.840]  having a war so they can domestically loot us but have the rally around the
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:19.600]  flag effect i'm afraid you're right yeah as bush
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:24.640]  uh said it you know a dictatorship is a lot easier as long as these dictators
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:28.800]  sure now now those the people are waking up to obama though
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:31.760]  i mean his polls are dropping a lot of people are figuring out
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:36.880]  that the cult of obama is a fraud is a scam uh but then that almost encourages
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:42.080]  him to go ahead and launch a war doesn't it i really don't know i i think you
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:47.040]  know the signs are not very good especially the uh
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:50.800]  uh biden threat okay we're just reprehensible
[2:45:50.800 --> 2:45:56.000]  and i think um you know for the good of our republic
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:00.560]  and for the good of humanity we're going to have to go all out and
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:04.880]  and stop the uh this neocon agenda for
[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:11.200]  uh war against rand and the uh destabilization and crack up of
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:16.560]  pakistan understand pakistan has no um who knows what will happen if it's
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:21.120]  pakistan were to crack up all right well we appreciate uh
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:24.960]  dr francis a boil joining us briefly tell us about the new book
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:28.400]  tackling america's toughest questions alternative media interviews
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:35.040]  right uh this book tries to uh go back uh to
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:41.840]  september 11th it starts there and deals with all the
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:46.560]  atrocities that the bush administration and his neocon
[2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:52.000]  inflicted on the united states constitution the bill of rights
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:58.800]  international law uh and human rights uh and and world order uh literally
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:03.680]  until they walked out of office by giving israel the green light to blow up
[2:47:03.680 --> 2:47:10.720]  gaza and literally exterminate 1400 gaza or nothing at all
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:17.360]  um and then you know there's a brief conclusion you know where i say
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:24.160]  you know that unfortunately it looks like under obama
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:31.520]  we're going to have a continuation of many of the bush policies
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:35.280]  sort of flavored by a lot of the clinton people
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:39.680]  and remember the clinton people all the clinton foreign affairs people
[2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:44.800]  these are the sons and the daughters of the best and the brightest
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:50.240]  that gave us the vietnam war uh as documented by david halberstead remember
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:53.840]  mac the marriage has died yesterday i'd encourage you to read
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:58.240]  the best of the brightest uh john kennedy was elected president
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:02.160]  recruited the best and the brightest from harvard and they gave us the vietnam
[2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:05.440]  war they gave us the cuban missile crisis
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:12.480]  they gave us icbm and flbm uh etc so this is the next generation of
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:17.280]  of these leaders and obama is one of them you know a bright young man
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:21.040]  from harvard law school uh a charming wife you know
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:26.080]  oh i forget jackie went to bassard uh well michelle you know went to
[2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:30.800]  princeton harvard law school and you know it looks like a bit of
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:35.200]  history all over again god help us well i hope to
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:37.520]  talk to you again in the near future take care doctor
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:40.880]  all right thanks a lot alex again by best to your uh
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:44.000]  listening or needs but look you know let's get out there and get organized
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  that's what we have to do we have to stop these people
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:52.160]  absolutely take care okay bye yeah that's what they do they wrap themselves in
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:55.600]  the flag and then just engage in every treason you can imagine while looting
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:48:58.720]  and robbing the public
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:03.360]  and they say hey look the iranians look different from us let's kill them
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:07.280]  and the average american says okay let's murder them yeah it feels
[2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:12.560]  that sounds powerful that sounds manly and they can't even find iran on a map
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:17.760]  so the cia stages some shootings and you know stay out of their business leave
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:22.400]  them alone the the the criminals that run our country
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:25.920]  are running around handing weapons out to anybody that will take them
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:30.320]  so they have an excuse to then go later have a war with them
[2:49:30.320 --> 2:49:34.320]  so they can sell weapons systems i mean god help us
[2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:40.560]  you know the cia was founded by all of the people from yale
[2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:43.920]  and the rest of the governments run by all these people from harvard
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:46.720]  and they just think they're god's gift they're going to shoot us up with their
[2:49:46.720 --> 2:49:49.200]  vaccines they're going to put the fluoride no water they're going to start
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:53.840]  their wars they're going to just arrogantly stomp all over us

[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:37.840]  it's a nice clear evening a bit of cloud in the sky but it's a warm and

[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:46.080]  you here i mean you don't really need any introduction
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:49.680]  but but tell us how did you get involved in this
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:56.880]  documentary film reclaiming the blade well i get sent a number of scripts
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:00.720]  some of which are very good some of which are pretty mediocre
[3:02:00.720 --> 3:02:05.200]  this one really stuck out like a sore thumb when i say a sore thumb i mean a
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:09.680]  very golden thumb it was on a subject that i've
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:14.320]  not seen covered before and it had a lot of material in it
[3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:18.160]  that i thought was unique and fascinating
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:25.440]  anyone who's interested in in history at all will be interested in this
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:32.080]  extraordinary documentary um the sword is such an elegant symbol of so much
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:37.680]  isn't it uh the sword uh is a symbol of the cross the
[3:02:37.680 --> 3:02:44.720]  sword is man's means of protecting himself the sword is uh it's a symbol
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:48.320]  of justice uh if the sword is generally double
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:55.120]  edged um the sword may it would be the state
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:59.760]  of the art of metallurgy in in in any
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:05.280]  its civilization i mean there was a fascinating story the other day
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:09.840]  there's a very great um uh viking
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:15.600]  sword maker and he saw me he signed some of his pieces
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:20.400]  um but some of them were puzzling to archaeologists because there were
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:24.880]  fragments of them and they did some metallurgical analysis
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:29.200]  and they discovered that somebody somewhere had been forging
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:35.760]  this swordsmith's work and they had produced a marvelous cutting
[3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:39.440]  edge with their with the the steel that they'd
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:44.880]  produce but it was just too hard the real stuff was forged from
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:49.760]  from from um the right sort of war brought all the way from Afghanistan
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:54.960]  would you believe the local stuff uh that'll be passed off by this
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:04:02.800]  swordsmith was indeed very pure iron and very pure steel but it was fragile so
[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:09.280]  imagine you spend a fortune buying this legendary swordsmith's work and the
[3:04:09.280 --> 3:04:13.760]  first time you're in battle and you smite your enemy's sword
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:19.840]  your axe shrivels up into a pile of little shards and you think oh dear
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:28.480]  and the other guy looked at you and smiled and comes towards you
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:34.960]  man i was almost taken away there i was i was imaging all of this and forgot i
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:41.440]  was on the radio it's great stuff um in a way
[3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:45.760]  technology is always at the cutting edge of a civilization
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:51.680]  and sadly of course much of that technology is war inspired
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:56.800]  um but the sword was created on mr davies we've got a break

[3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:44.560]  solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to
[3:07:44.560 --> 3:07:48.800]  wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever

[3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:04.480]  before you lose your power he's the t-rex of political talk
[3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:09.200]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:08:09.760 --> 3:08:15.440]  well he played solemn in the first big mega hit
[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:20.720]  redder's the lost arc and of course he was dimly the dwarf
[3:08:20.720 --> 3:08:24.720]  in lord of the rings and so many other huge movies and
[3:08:24.720 --> 3:08:28.880]  a lot of other productions as well and he's in this new film reclaiming
[3:08:28.880 --> 3:08:34.480]  the blade reclaimingtheblade.com and we have a daniel mcnickle coming on a
[3:08:34.480 --> 3:08:38.000]  little bit later to join both of us here in the shower
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:45.120]  he joins us of course from the isle of man and it's a great to have john
[3:08:45.120 --> 3:08:48.320]  reese davies on with us who needs no introduction but for folks
[3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:51.360]  watching us as we stream over the web we'll put his picture up
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:56.560]  on screen i've got so many questions during the
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:00.480]  break i was bringing up the fact that mr mcnickle told me
[3:09:00.480 --> 3:09:05.680]  that that this does have somewhat not even of a political message but of a
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:10.640]  liberty message a freedom message you know with this reclaiming the blade
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:13.920]  and about how this was something to fight back against corruption
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:18.720]  oppression how that freedom that skill was lost i guess the whole history of
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:20.960]  the blade and the sword and how important it is and
[3:09:20.960 --> 3:09:24.400]  people fighting for the right to own a sword has been lost and i was asking
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:28.640]  you what your whole view on the on the world is
[3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:30.880]  well
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:38.080]  you're right and daniel is right the sword is a symbol of liberty
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:41.680]  and liberty is something that's very challenged these days i mean there are
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:45.120]  things that overtly challenge our civilization
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:51.440]  and because we tend to be rather modest um and rather
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:56.560]  uh we don't want to politically upset people aren't needlessly
[3:09:56.560 --> 3:10:00.240]  um or we tend to to stand back a little bit
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:04.720]  but look western european christian civilization
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:09.280]  is very important it has produced art
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:17.920]  music drama theater dance beyond the imagining of any other culture
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:23.440]  it stands for the liberty of the individual the right of the individual
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:27.360]  to think and to the extent that he doesn't affect others
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:32.560]  practice virtually anything he believes it's it celebrates democracy it
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:36.400]  celebrates the the the the the the right of
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:40.320]  democracy over theocracy or any other uh is
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:45.600] ocracy it it it's about the equality of men in
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:49.600]  before the law it's also about the equality of women
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:54.640]  with men in front of the law it doesn't assume that women are third-class
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:11:00.880]  citizens it has abolished slavery you must understand i this is a slavery is
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:04.000]  an issue that particularly resonates with me when i was a little boy my father
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:07.360]  was a policeman in africa he took me down to the dock side in dar es Salaam
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:11.200]  harbour in 1955 he said you see that dial there
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:15.120]  twice a year it comes down from Saudi Arabia it stops in aid and comes down
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:18.400]  the coast goes here goes to bayre in portuguese
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:22.240]  mozambique on the way down it's got machine tools
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:25.920]  and machine parts on the way back up it's always got two or three little
[3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:29.120]  black boys and these are slaves going back to
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:33.840]  Saudi Arabia and the united nations will not allow me to do anything about it
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:39.360]  Saudi Arabia Arabia only abolished slavery in 1965
[3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:43.760]  um you know he did and there's still slavery
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:47.520]  president in south of Saudi Arabia i will wait up
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:57.200]  um but here you know these are huge huge gains for mankind that our
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:01.520]  civilization has made and and you've got to understand
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:06.160]  that certain religions certain faith certain things they have their strengths
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:09.520]  but in a way the way we engage in our civilization
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:14.240]  and within our faith is the way that we turn out as people
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:18.000]  and our civilization allows us to become rubbish
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:23.040]  or it allows us to do almost anything other religions are more straight
[3:12:23.040 --> 3:12:27.680]  jacket in their intellectual approach to education and
[3:12:27.680 --> 3:12:33.920]  theocracy and things like that but ours gives us an unassailable liberty
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:38.320]  and we must always be prepared to defend it
[3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:44.000]  um you know i'm proud to belong to western european christians of
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:47.520]  civilization it's a it's a glorious tradition
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:52.000]  and and and and we must speak out firmly and fairly for it
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:56.800]  well that's what i was gonna ask you it it's fashionable for 50 years to
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:13:00.720]  demonize the west to attack anything that has to do with western culture
[3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:04.720]  and act like slavery was invented by the west when it was actually the west that
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:10.400]  began to end slavery why do the modern uh so many
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:13.920]  modern thinkers individuals love to paint the west
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:17.760]  as the progenitor of slavery when really it was the west that began to end
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:20.480]  slavery and many forms of slavery as you said
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:24.960]  still go on around the world but but but that's okay we only see endless films
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:28.640]  and productions about how the west is bad the west is bad and that's because
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:32.000]  liberty and freedom and the magna carta and so much more
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:35.040]  springs from the west it is the enemy of the
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:42.880]  high-tech technocrats i believe well uh uh there are a number of reasons why uh
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:46.800]  for some reason about 20 percent of the british population i can't speak for
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:50.080]  the american population but from about 20 percent of the british
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:56.480]  population really hate britain and all it stands for now these are
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:14:02.000]  white liberals they're often well educated but they really
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:06.640]  they haven't they have no real understanding or caring for history
[3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:10.480]  and they would obliterate history if they could they would forget about magna
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:14.400]  carta the bill of rights you know um uh
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:20.400]  and and and that they wouldn't they would say that they embrace a greater
[3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:25.200]  freedom but in fact when they're in government what they do is subtract
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:28.640]  all the freedoms that they can possibly get their hands on
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:32.480]  from the society that they're in i don't know what you do about those 20 percent i
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:36.480]  think they're just uh you know the bottom they say the treason of the
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:39.920]  clerics uh what they seem to always be in control we
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:43.360]  have the same types here uh who claim they want all this
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:46.080]  liberty but really they come to control like they're
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:49.680]  it's past the house here to restrict free speech
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:53.760]  and have speech laws where if something you say hurts someone's feelings
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:57.280]  you get arrested i mean how can that be happening in the united states
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:01.280]  how can that be happening in europe how can this be going on
[3:15:01.280 --> 3:15:06.000]  well europe has a tradition of autocracy and intolerance
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.920]  america is still the last best hope of mankind
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:14.720]  um and i hope that you will learn from our lessons but i mean i think in in
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:18.560]  in europe and particularly in my country uh
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:26.080]  the the liberal point of view is is absolutely without question
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:29.920]  in in public office you dare not raise a question
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:35.520]  um because if you do you will be literally branded a fascist
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:39.600]  um no no matter that you sort of say well look these are the things i believe
[3:15:39.600 --> 3:15:43.920]  inequality democracy these are but that doesn't matter
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:49.280]  and there are certain there are certain things that are that are
[3:15:49.280 --> 3:15:53.280]  by words for for for liberalism if you don't endorse them then
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:15:57.040]  really you're a fascist so what do we do get outside the comfort zone and stop
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:15:59.280]  caring if they brand us and point out they
[3:15:59.280 --> 3:16:02.480]  are the ones behaving like fascists with the new global
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:06.880]  carbon tax i don't want to get you involved here in in a heresy
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:09.920]  i don't want to get you burned at the stake here there it is there is you're
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:14.880]  a fascist you see because you you are a high detect from your tone that you are
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:18.720]  a global warming skeptic how did you know that i should be
[3:16:18.720 --> 3:16:23.600]  honest or is it a climate change skeptic because i think the i think the
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:27.920]  thing has moved on slightly from global warming now to climate change
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:33.280]  um yes well it is true climate changes that's one of the nature of the nature
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:36.320]  of being a sort of dynamic living planet you know i mean
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:39.920]  i don't suppose the climate's changing too much on venus right at the moment
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:44.000]  you know because the bit that may have the sun is melting
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:47.920]  um but anyway uh yeah that would be one of the
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:52.160]  the real reason why
[3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:57.280]  the the the the liberals i i'm only using that in the most
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:01.040]  pejorative way um there is a something else called a liberal
[3:17:01.040 --> 3:17:03.760]  traditional which people calling themselves liberals
[3:17:03.760 --> 3:17:06.960]  you would call yourself or i would call myself a classical liberal
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:10.320]  i want the classical real freedoms not their fake
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:13.680]  straightjacket and and and you're being careful not to commit thought crime
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:16.320]  because you some european countries do want to arrest people
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:20.160]  don't listen it's they're now teaching that summer is abnormal
[3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:23.280]  and some kids don't think you're supposed to have seasons like you said it's
[3:17:23.280 --> 3:17:27.120]  first it's global warming now it's climate change but but but go ahead sir
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:32.240]  no no i i mean the real reason the real reason they're getting away with it
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:37.200]  is that people like me and people like you have more interesting to things to do
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:40.960]  with our lives than to stand up and i'm engaged in political
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:44.880]  activity um but our situation is so dire here that i'm
[3:17:44.880 --> 3:17:47.920]  actually seriously thinking of our standing for the
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:50.960]  british parliament of the next election unfortunately
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:55.040]  i've not lived my life you know in in that politically correct way that one
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:59.680]  should it one's going to be a politician um and uh you know i have
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:04.640]  far too many scarecrows and skeletons rather in my in my closet
[3:18:04.640 --> 3:18:11.520]  and i will be ripped to shreds if i do but you know the fault is ours
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:17.920]  because we were too busy too self-important and too absorbed with
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:20.800]  the wonderful and immediate things that we can do with her
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:24.320]  with our lives in this glorious civilization we live in
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:30.880]  to actually stop the the cockroaches from running and now i was about to say
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:35.120]  that we've got to climb in and remove the parasites that are now
[3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:38.720]  arming themselves against us oh that's right that's right
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:42.720]  i mean i spoke to a senior civil servant about two years ago
[3:18:42.720 --> 3:18:46.240]  and i said well you know what what do you see happening
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:50.320]  he said well we will be a small part of the european union we will be ruled
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:55.040]  from brussels uh we will get rid of the monarchy and we will be a small and
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:59.920]  peaceful part of europe and i said well i mean didn't you
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:04.720]  take an oath of allegiance as a part of your thing to to serve the crown in
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:08.320]  parliament and things like that he said well i mean i think i think we can we
[3:19:08.320 --> 3:19:13.360]  all we can dispose of that into the dust in a history uh i said you know in my
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:16.320]  eyes sir you're just a traitor you're just a
[3:19:16.320 --> 3:19:20.080]  quizzing and a traitor and you smiled at me and said well
[3:19:20.080 --> 3:19:22.560]  fortunately you can't do anything about it
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:27.120]  hahaha incredible arrogance i've run into similar things this is an amazing
[3:19:27.120 --> 3:19:30.240]  interview sir we're about to break and come back with another
[3:19:30.240 --> 3:19:34.240]  segment but but to continue this in fact i would like to get some into the film
[3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:38.160]  reclaiming the blade which really does have contained in it
[3:19:38.160 --> 3:19:41.520]  a great portion of the spirit of liberty and we're just honored that you're
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:44.960]  spending time with us today here to fight for what's left
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:49.200]  of western civilization which is being pulled down under assault
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:54.720]  because those very ideals threaten the parasites that are now infested our
[3:19:54.720 --> 3:19:57.760]  society but i think the sleeping giant that is
[3:19:57.760 --> 3:20:01.840]  those that love liberty is beginning to rise stay with us
[3:20:01.840 --> 3:20:05.280]  silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic

[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:16.480]  going to get the maker of the film reclaiming the blade on with us for
[3:24:16.480 --> 3:24:20.080]  the balance of the time i'm sorry we're not covering michael jackson in his
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:24.400]  funeral but i think there's been enough coverage of that today
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:27.440]  but but mr. davies it intrigues me we'll talk some in the final segment about
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:30.800]  the film reclaiming the blade about more of your political ideas because i
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:35.520]  sense that you're almost exploding with the desire to speak up and say no to
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:38.960]  what's happening are you concerned about the european union trying to force
[3:24:38.960 --> 3:24:43.280]  the lisbon treaty on countries that have voted it down time and time again
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:47.440]  and and and the the labor party said that they wouldn't
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:52.560]  go along with it without a vote but now they're covertly using the bureaucracy
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:56.880]  to bring uh britannia under the yoke of europe or
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:00.640]  what are some of your other concerns that would make you run for parliament
[3:25:00.640 --> 3:25:05.360]  well uh certainly that would be one um we were promised a referendum we
[3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:10.960]  we we we had a referendum many years ago and i think about 1976 or something
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:14.960]  like that um to uh
[3:25:14.960 --> 3:25:21.200]  uh to to enter the EU to enter the common market and the common market is
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:24.960]  what most of us want frankly it's what most europeans want
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:28.960]  but not many people other than the paid bureaucrats
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:35.680]  want a close political union uh you know cooperation between states is
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:40.080]  is admirable and wonderful but really i don't want to make a
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:45.680]  political statement here and and be arrested and summarily uh
[3:25:45.680 --> 3:25:50.880]  extradited to Greece to stand up because it comes to means greek law
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:54.960]  uh we are trading our liberties at an alarming rate
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:59.280]  and the only reason that this government is still in power
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:04.320]  is because brown has been told by the EU stay there until the irish can have
[3:26:04.320 --> 3:26:08.080]  their third referendum and this time we'll make them
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:11.920]  we'll shake the pips and make it clear that they'll be bankrupt if they don't
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:15.520]  vote for an EU reunion and then of course it
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:22.400]  becomes automatic uh and theoretically irreversible
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:26.480]  and brown of course will end up for um
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:33.680]  getting a senior job in in the EU um it is straightforward political
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:39.840]  corruption it's corruption and treason at the at the highest level
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:42.560]  and of course the first thing this government did of course were when they
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:46.800]  got into power was to remove the penalties for treason
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:51.680]  you can no longer hang a man for treason um oh no no no that's too
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:57.040]  that's too unkind to him um maybe maybe send him to prison for
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:27:01.760]  three years if he has to well it is treason to have
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:05.920]  now Blair about to be EU head for his treason
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:09.360]  and they've got millions of surveillance cameras and secret police
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:12.080]  everywhere and they're going to have climate cops
[3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:15.040]  with climate rationing i mean this is just a way
[3:27:15.040 --> 3:27:19.120]  for the government control freaks to literally enslave everybody
[3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:23.280]  and you look at the polls the brits the french the irish none of them want this
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:27.760]  but it continues to steamroller forward uh just thank god you're speaking up and
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:32.240]  i hope any others will start speaking up there is a huge
[3:27:32.240 --> 3:27:36.320]  there is a huge groundswell of resentment
[3:27:36.320 --> 3:27:43.520]  um and it really only needs um a trigger um
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:47.920]  for this to to become really very unpleasant and very
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:52.960]  socially explosive and divisive very unpleasant i like the way you put that
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:56.720]  absolutely everybody worldwide wants liberty they don't want tyranny
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:01.280]  speaking of the blade you know that's not you see that's a sad thing
[3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:05.680]  that's that's the saddest thing of all not everybody wants freedom
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:09.040]  yes you're right some people want their decisions make
[3:28:09.040 --> 3:28:13.520]  made for them well it seems like i want freedom so i think everybody else
[3:28:13.520 --> 3:28:15.920]  wants it but i guess you're right a lot of people do want to live
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:19.360]  under a nanny state control freak system but but speaking of the blade
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:22.880]  as i'm sure you know in england they're trying to make you have a license now
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:27.040]  for a butcher knife like in china and so i guess for people to defend
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:30.000]  themselves some people have been using swords and knives
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:33.200]  in their own homes and when they get attacked and defend themselves the
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:37.680]  police go persecute them is that because the state wants a monopoly of force
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:41.360]  and doesn't want citizens defending themselves
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:47.280]  it must be something like that i mean the police are very conscious of of
[3:28:47.280 --> 3:28:51.360]  people taking the law into their own hands and and we understand that that
[3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:54.880]  you we can't do that we don't want to lynch mob certain things like that
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:58.480]  defending yourself well yes but defending ourselves
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:02.640]  um you're allowed to use reasonable force however if you haven't have a
[3:29:02.640 --> 3:29:06.080]  particularly liberal a liberal judge who's be a liberal
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:10.320]  employer appointee or something like that he may well he very well decide that
[3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:14.560]  you know when you when you took that big heavy
[3:29:14.560 --> 3:29:20.160]  walking stick and club this loud to death with one hefty blow
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:23.520]  that you were in fact infringing his right right the fact that he had no
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:26.240]  right to be in your bedroom at two o'clock in the morning when you and
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:30.320]  your child and wife was sleeping in the house
[3:29:30.320 --> 3:29:33.920]  it's got nothing to do with it you know you you you shouldn't really have done
[3:29:33.920 --> 3:29:37.440]  that you should have used a more reasonable force no yes when you're
[3:29:37.440 --> 3:29:39.520]  getting attacked in the middle of the night you're supposed to control
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:42.320]  yourself amazing and that's what reclaiming the blades all
[3:29:42.320 --> 3:29:45.120]  about we'll talk about the film in our final segment

[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:07.760]  he's he's the best i mean uh as men who he's just about the best
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:12.720]  they were on a grand bunch assisting me in the recovery of that ring i must say
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:15.280]  they all did them they all did very well but it is
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:19.200]  essentially a dwarf story you know about the recovery of the ring
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:24.320]  with the help of hobbits or others yes well the ring did come from below the
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:27.360]  ground and that's the that's the realm of dwarves
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:31.040]  that's right that's right it was our goal originally i
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:36.480]  fear but you've got to be careful of the concentration of power you see
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:42.320]  power does corrupt and and and absolute power does corrupt absolutely
[3:35:42.320 --> 3:35:45.920]  one ring to roll them all and in the darkness bind them
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:52.880]  one to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
[3:35:52.880 --> 3:36:00.320]  in the land of mordor where the hadu was lie oh my god
[3:36:00.320 --> 3:36:03.920]  you know what they're i really want to get you back on sometime because this
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:08.240]  has been an amazing interview you're even got more energy in person
[3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:12.720]  and it's just a a lot of fun because i'm a big fan of those movies as well and
[3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:15.680]  then to find out you're a lover of liberty and a patriot before we go to
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:18.720]  the director uh and you've been gracious to stay
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:22.320]  with us while the director's on with us we were kind of ranting during the
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:25.280]  breaks talking and and you were bringing up some of the other
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:29.840]  tyrannies that europe and england are coming under that we're outraging you
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:32.720]  and that have the rest of the citizenry outraged what are
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:36.960]  what are some of the other beefs that you have uh with what's happening right
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:41.200]  now in europe and england well in britain in particular
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:45.920]  our our chancellor who is a man who is our ex chancellor who's now prime minister
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:50.320]  is a man of extraordinary self-illusion i mean he really did believe that his
[3:36:50.320 --> 3:36:56.000]  activity saved the world during the banking crisis
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:59.680]  um he is confidently saying that you know he will not
[3:36:59.680 --> 3:37:06.960]  have public services uh you know at a time when for instance 100 000
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:12.080]  private sector jobs were lost he managed to add 30 000 public sector
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:17.040]  employees in the end you cannot spend your way out of
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:22.080]  debt in the end everyone in the private sector
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:25.760]  supports all the people in the public sector
[3:37:25.760 --> 3:37:31.840]  in the end government works for us not for us working for the government
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:38.800]  these are just inalienable truths but somehow they seem to be forgotten
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:45.200]  so easily by every damn common political jack sorry
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:49.120]  no no you're right but it's it's a vertically integrated economy
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:52.880]  and it's same here in the united states everything's collapsing
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:57.520]  we're losing 640 plus thousand jobs a month and they're expanding
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:01.840]  the size of government and they're increasing all the taxes
[3:38:01.840 --> 3:38:05.840]  and the shops are starting to all close and the government says we're gonna
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:09.280]  hold you by your legs and like the sheriff of nottingham
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:13.760]  and shake the shillings out of your pockets i mean
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:17.120]  it's almost like they want us to have a revolution it's like they want to force
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:20.880]  us into confrontation well i don't think it's that
[3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:24.800]  if there is a belief that if you give if you give
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:30.320]  if you hold circuses and give bread and just give and give and give
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:36.160]  then you will create an an electric that's that's wholly obligated to you
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:39.680]  um unfortunately in the end the buck has to stop somewhere
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:42.880]  and the only way out of it is that government will have to start
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:47.520]  printing paper you know and and i have lived in it in in
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:52.400]  society is where inflation has gone to three percent four percent five
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:56.320]  percent a day imagine having ten savings they save up
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:39:00.720]  your life savings is ten thousand dollars it's it's a good little
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:03.600]  hunk with ten that ten thousand dollars you can
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:07.600]  actually do something and in the space of one year
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:12.480]  that ten thousand dollars isn't worth enough to buy your family a meal
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:16.960]  you imagine how mad you'd be and that was Yugoslavia
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:22.240]  of just what 15 18 years ago 20 years ago
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:25.120]  uh look at zimbabwe look at other i mean look
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:28.160]  in fact all this money they've spent is guaranteed to start coming back in we're
[3:39:28.160 --> 3:39:31.600]  already seeing inflation and mirroring areas go up even though
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:34.400]  housing's going down it's kind of a nightmare
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:38.560]  stag inflation it's starting to set in yes indeed
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:44.480]  and and uh the damnable thing is you see in a way spending your way out of
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:49.520]  inflation out of depression is is a theoretically
[3:39:49.520 --> 3:39:53.920]  interesting way of doing it um
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:57.440]  but you have to really have you have to really have to have
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:01.760]  growth in place or the seeds of growth in place that will
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:06.400]  will match the investment uh that you're putting into things
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:09.760]  you just instead it all goes for bonuses to offshore banks
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:12.480]  and the carbon tax is a wet blanket on that economy
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:16.480]  the carbon tax is just a load of fossil it's just it's just an extra way of
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:19.920]  taxing people at all and i'm sorry for interrupting when you were getting into
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:23.120]  no no no it's matching matching actual development
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:27.200]  i guess like monorail trains better roads instead more and more just goes for
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:31.360]  debt servicing the debt like we are zimbabwe is everything collapses
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:34.320]  i don't know about england i was just over there a few years ago but we have
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:37.600]  bridges collapsing every week the roads are rotting
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:42.400]  i mean you go to stores now and then the carpet's peeling up
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:47.440]  well we're now paying i think more for our to serve with our debt than we spend
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:50.000]  on defense and i've got an idea it must be
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:54.160]  rapidly approaching what we spend on in our on our education
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:57.840]  amazing well john it is terrifying
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:00.960]  john reese davies is our guest he doesn't need any introduction you know
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  salah from of course uh the writers of lost ark and other
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:08.720]  uh indiana jones films the harrison ford calls a huge star
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:13.200]  uh in the lord of the rings trilogy and so many other huge films before we get
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:17.920]  in the remaining minutes with the director uh into reclaiming the blade
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:20.640]  you're just a very interesting man obviously but i mean seriously you really
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:23.760]  are what are some of your other interests what else is on your mind
[3:41:23.760 --> 3:41:29.840]  what else are you working on right now um well um i i i just did a little radio
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:34.640]  uh thing today um which is why i was a little bit late coming back
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:39.280]  um but but my private passions well i have a three-year-old daughter who is
[3:41:39.280 --> 3:41:44.560]  the love of my life i'm extraordinarily happy uh at this
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:47.440]  this moment in time and in my life the last four
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:50.880]  four and a half years uh have been extremely happy
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:56.480]  i i i play with cars i have a disgraceful collection of wonderful cars
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:42:00.000]  but i really should send down but it's rather like sort of
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:04.880]  working you know it and i don't want to use the word mocking me but it's a
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:08.240]  sort of sophie's choice that you have to make when you try to get rid of one
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:12.240]  i mean you can't possibly let that one go because well you know all that one
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:15.760]  all that so you end up keeping keeping the ball really
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:22.960]  um but i like engineering um i i like i like getting up in the morning and
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:28.000]  getting my hands dirty um all writing or something like that
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:33.120]  um and you're also into swords you i mean you're someone of a swordsman yourself
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:36.880]  i used to be unfortunately i broke my back and my arm on a
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:40.240]  on a film set about six years ago and oh i didn't know that
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:46.240]  i i i i i i i i moved from being a fairly hard old man really to
[3:42:46.240 --> 3:42:51.120]  being an old whip um but i have to confess that even before
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:57.200]  um uh daniel's thinking i do sleep with a samurai sword beside
[3:42:57.200 --> 3:43:01.680]  my bed um and it is sharp
[3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:07.440]  uh burglars should be aware of this i i tend to swing rather heavily
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:11.680]  um just in case we get a visitor
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:15.760]  incredible absolutely incredible so wow i didn't know you'd broken your back in
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:21.120]  your arm what film was that oh the piece of rubbish really called
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:26.240]  um uh the farm musketeer but it had some nice people
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:29.840]  admitted to michael yorkan the great depa dear
[3:43:29.840 --> 3:43:33.680]  and um a few others but you're doing better now i mean you certainly sound
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:36.640]  good i am good if it wasn't for that rigid
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:41.360]  back of mine i would be in extraordinary good health um
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:46.000]  and every time i start feeling for me for me i suddenly start thinking you know
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:49.600]  you could be a quadriplegic or you could be dead
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:53.440]  think about that old man and yes suddenly my eight campaigns don't
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:57.200]  seem to matter incredible um
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:44:01.760]  i live on the aisle of man you live on the aisle of man
[3:44:01.760 --> 3:44:05.600]  i i yes i have a place here i've had a place here for about 20 odd years
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:10.640]  more than 22 years i think it's um it has been described as 70 000
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:15.360]  alcoholics clinging to a rock in the ivy
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:18.880]  but it is a little bit better than that
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:24.080]  oh my god all right let's uh if you're a motorbike man it is it is it is heaven
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:28.160]  itself it is valhalla it is where where the greatest
[3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:32.960]  street racing no uh it takes place valhalla
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:35.600]  yeah rick linklater was over there making a movie about orson welles he told me
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:37.760]  it was really neat place i want to visit it sometime
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:41.200]  johnry stavies is our guest let's go to the director reclaiming the blade
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:45.040]  dot com and here is the film they actually gave me
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:48.880]  some free copies to to give out his prizes
[3:44:48.880 --> 3:44:53.360]  so i will just say this that at the end of the show i am going to give you an
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:57.520]  email address and the first 10 emails that come in

[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:04.640]  the blade uh and i i guess we should spend a few minutes with the director
[3:45:04.640 --> 3:45:07.760]  himself uh daniel mcnickle talking about what is
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:12.000]  in this great film that got vego in it and you got john and you got
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:15.600]  so many other of the sword master the top guy in hollywood who
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:18.880]  trained all the folks for star wars and so many other films i mean this is a
[3:45:18.880 --> 3:45:23.120]  who's who but it's also pro self-defense pro liberty what a
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:26.880]  message wow what a conversation you guys have
[3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:30.960]  been having i i uh i feel unworthy to chime in
[3:45:30.960 --> 3:45:36.560]  uh you've always got great guests so um and uh john's absolutely one of them
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:41.600]  um but yeah the the film is is out now it's it's available
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:45.040]  uh going to be soon be available at barns and obelisle you can kind of walk in
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:48.240]  the store and pick those up and hastings a couple
[3:45:48.240 --> 3:45:51.760]  of their brick and mortar type stores and of course it's on our website and
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:56.480]  apple itunes is going to soon have it as well for digital download and all that
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:46:00.240]  good stuff but um but no it was it was a lot of fun to make and
[3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:03.520]  and um you know working with people like jonary stavey's
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:08.800]  legendary actors of uh of the screen and stage it's just
[3:46:08.800 --> 3:46:13.760]  i'm honored you know to uh to to have had the opportunity to work with uh
[3:46:13.760 --> 3:46:16.400]  these guys and just bring this story out there
[3:46:16.400 --> 3:46:20.160]  well i know you'd made some other you know uh pretty big films but
[3:46:20.160 --> 3:46:23.280]  i mean even for a huge director or somebody's already had a you know a
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:26.240]  bunch of big films it's hard to get all these actors and all these
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:31.360]  i've done nothing uh it's so far this is this is uh this is my first film
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:35.200]  uh but uh but i've i've seen you've been involved in you know in
[3:46:35.200 --> 3:46:37.520]  quite a few other big productions i guess this is your first film that
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:41.760]  shares so so so that's my question how did you get all these great people
[3:46:41.760 --> 3:46:45.200]  together well you know it starts one at a time
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:49.520]  and um you know it it always helps to have somebody like like jonary stavey's
[3:46:49.520 --> 3:46:55.280]  early on uh believing in the script and and uh his name is is is you know not
[3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:59.360]  only legendary among the fans but legendary among other actors and and
[3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:03.120]  filmmakers so you know having having somebody like him on board uh that's
[3:47:03.120 --> 3:47:06.960]  right i should add it's narrated by jonary stavey's right and he's also in
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:11.360]  the film and then there's a extra dvd that comes with it correct
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:15.040]  yeah yeah actually that's where our interview with with john is and and of
[3:47:15.040 --> 3:47:18.480]  course he narrates the film so he's uh performing
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:22.560]  and then the other fellows vego and carler ben and bob anderson who was
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:25.760]  darth vader we did interviews with them of course so
[3:47:25.760 --> 3:47:31.440]  darth vader and by the way i promise you the lightsabers are on the way so
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:34.720]  hey you don't have to play me with loot i'm just happy to get the lightsabers to
[3:47:34.720 --> 3:47:38.640]  have more battles but i know the guys there
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:42.160]  probably love them and they're just a lot of fun so i tell you my children
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:45.520]  murder me every day with those lightsabers so i'll be glad to get some more
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:50.160]  going back to jonary stavey's you know i should have made that point early on
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:53.920]  because i was aware of it you were instrumental in in getting uh this made
[3:47:53.920 --> 3:47:57.280]  and were really the first big name to come on board
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:02.320]  uh was that because you're just so into the history of the blade and and and
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:05.600]  reclaiming it i thought it was a very interesting
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:11.680]  idea i was uh i i'm quite well read and it's not
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:15.520]  often that i read a script that actually informs me
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:18.880]  so much about areas that i had no idea existed
[3:48:18.880 --> 3:48:25.040]  um and and i thought that the i thought it was really
[3:48:25.040 --> 3:48:29.760]  really deserving of attention and uh i'm glad that i was in some
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:35.200]  very slight way um useful in in in getting the thing made and put
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:39.600]  together but please do not overestimate my
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:44.240]  powers or or or contribution this is daniel's project
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:48.720]  it was well thought well saw a resource um
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:53.680]  well serviced he's on a grand job and it's a it's an interesting it's an
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:57.680]  interesting subject and no matter how well you know it
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:02.160]  um there will be there'll be detail and information there that makes you go
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:06.000]  wow i never understood that now that whole area
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:10.000]  is now illuminated for me well i'm just gonna agree with you
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:13.120]  that that that i'm somewhat well read about history just because it's
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:16.080]  interesting and about chivalry and and you know
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:19.280]  different wars that happen in the middle ages and then even in some of the more
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:22.720]  modern wars and i learned a lot watching the film
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:25.760]  and of course the extras that are in it so folks should go to reclaiming the
[3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:29.920]  blade dot com and get the film with the extras reclaiming the blade
[3:49:29.920 --> 3:49:33.600]  with john risa davies featuring a vego mortison
[3:49:33.600 --> 3:49:37.280]  and many many others bob anderson and carl urban
[3:49:37.280 --> 3:49:41.440]  but but in in closing uh mr davies i hope that we can sometime
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:45.280]  off in the future have you back on we appreciate you giving us your precious
[3:49:45.280 --> 3:49:48.640]  time i'm going to come back in the final segment and talk with the director
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:52.480]  um about the film a little bit more uh but
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:59.200]  uh i wanted to ask you specifically about kind of the arc type of
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:02.720]  mordor that wants this global domination this total control
[3:50:02.720 --> 3:50:06.560]  over middle earth have in your research have you ever studied the globalist in
[3:50:06.560 --> 3:50:10.160]  the new world order and this whole technocratic world government
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:13.840]  that's being set up and if so what's your view on that
[3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:20.720]  well uh yes indeed if if all our princes were true philosophers
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:24.480]  what a wonderful world it would be but since they're not
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:28.960]  since they're nasty venal and corrupt most of them
[3:50:28.960 --> 3:50:34.720]  and some are just misguided idealists out to do the best thing and making a
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:40.080]  terrible hash of the whole thing uh
[3:50:40.080 --> 3:50:44.160]  in the end liberty is down to individuals and and and
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:48.880]  groups of individuals sometimes it can be expressed as a nation
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:52.480]  the united states is still the most
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:50:56.000]  liberally um and i mean that in the finest way
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:50:59.280]  it is still the country with with the greatest level of
[3:50:59.280 --> 3:51:06.160]  of liberty and and and a personal sense of self-worth and
[3:51:06.160 --> 3:51:10.000]  self-liberty it is the great defier of tyranny
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:14.000]  and i think that europe may well be sinking into
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:20.480]  an into an awful period of darkness and centralization and monopoly
[3:51:20.480 --> 3:51:25.360]  don't let your company do it country do it uh and and and frankly it won't
[3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:28.720]  so the united states is mightest here and it needs to stand with liberty and
[3:51:28.720 --> 3:51:32.720]  freedom but we need europe as well and we've got to stop
[3:51:32.720 --> 3:51:35.520]  these powerful forces that want to loot and rob us and thanks to people like
[3:51:35.520 --> 3:51:38.960]  you speaking up and standing up we may be able to do that
[3:51:38.960 --> 3:51:44.160]  john reese davies uh again thank you so much for joining us from the isle of man
[3:51:44.160 --> 3:51:47.760]  and god bless the united states sir good night you too sir god bless
[3:51:47.760 --> 3:51:50.800]  anglin over there take care all right that was an amazing
[3:51:50.800 --> 3:51:54.240]  interview with john reese davies i want to head and skip that final break because
[3:51:54.240 --> 3:51:56.720]  i mean i was excited to have him on because i like the movies he's in and
[3:51:56.720 --> 3:52:00.240]  now we'll talk about swords and the history of self-defense but that was a
[3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:02.960]  blow me away interview plus some of the behind the scenes
[3:52:02.960 --> 3:52:07.200]  discussions going back to daniel mcnickle uh daniel man when you told me he
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:10.560]  was into liberty and freedom uh he certainly is
[3:52:10.560 --> 3:52:14.080]  well you know it's a symbol of the fluid and and you know
[3:52:14.080 --> 3:52:18.160]  like john reese davies and i mean this in the kindest way i'm a foolish dreamer
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:22.000]  and i think i think we need to keep the faith i think we need to start believing
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:26.320]  and i think you know the road to destruction is wide
[3:52:26.320 --> 3:52:30.800]  and the path to truth is very narrow and i think history
[3:52:30.800 --> 3:52:35.200]  will be made by foolish dreamers like yourself and and and john reese davies
[3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:39.680]  and people that aren't afraid to to take a chance and and and dream of what the
[3:52:39.680 --> 3:52:42.720]  future could be and and uh that's the exciting thing
[3:52:42.720 --> 3:52:47.040]  about it you know and and ultimately i think um
[3:52:47.040 --> 3:52:50.240]  the strongman will be defeated by the weak and the humble you know that's the
[3:52:50.240 --> 3:52:54.800]  interesting thing about it is we've got a lot of you know huff and puff
[3:52:54.800 --> 3:52:58.160]  characters out there and they're just going to be deflated someday and that's
[3:52:58.160 --> 3:53:01.360]  that's exciting to me you know well i think you've hit the nail in the head i
[3:53:01.360 --> 3:53:06.320]  think the the key to saving the world and and and really letting humanity
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:11.840]  achieve its destiny is in the heart of a child a dreamer the imagination the
[3:53:11.840 --> 3:53:16.240]  things we lose in the supposed worldly establishment person
[3:53:16.240 --> 3:53:21.040]  has no belief in themselves they just go with the fad
[3:53:21.040 --> 3:53:24.640]  they go with what the system says is popular they
[3:53:24.640 --> 3:53:28.320]  they just simply regurgitate on the test what they're told to say
[3:53:28.320 --> 3:53:31.280]  and so they don't believe that we have any power to affect change because they
[3:53:31.280 --> 3:53:35.200]  don't believe in themselves yeah and and i look for all my problems i'm not
[3:53:35.200 --> 3:53:38.320]  perfect at the success i've had literally reaching
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:41.920]  probably 100 million people worldwide i mean i mean i mean my films
[3:53:41.920 --> 3:53:45.200]  you know online 10 15 20 million views they're not perfect
[3:53:45.200 --> 3:53:48.560]  and i mean it's nothing like the quality of your film but the issue is we're
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:52.560]  reaching people and it's another testament another example to what you can
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:56.240]  do and so to dream is destiny and to take action is
[3:53:56.240 --> 3:54:00.240]  destiny and the establishment knows that they have a very wicked dark dream
[3:54:00.240 --> 3:54:03.600]  and so they're moving forward with their plan and they want us to feel like we
[3:54:03.600 --> 3:54:06.480]  don't have power they want us to feel like we can't control our destiny
[3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:09.040]  but i'm here to tell people if they'll just i mean look at you like you said
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:13.040]  you've been in a few films worked on some films but this was your first big film
[3:54:13.040 --> 3:54:16.560]  your first film period and you went out and got some of the biggest names out
[3:54:16.560 --> 3:54:19.920]  there and i've seen the film it's it you know just
[3:54:19.920 --> 3:54:24.160]  shot with incredible cinematography it's very diverse film
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:27.680]  and you just did such a great job another testament
[3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:31.760]  to simply taking action and instead of talking about it getting it done so your
[3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:34.720]  comments on that well you know there's there's an old
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:38.640]  slogan that the marines used to say when i was growing up as a kid it was part
[3:54:38.640 --> 3:54:42.320]  of their advertising and it said we're looking for a few good men
[3:54:42.320 --> 3:54:47.920]  and honestly i think the marines today are are taking whatever they're kind of
[3:54:47.920 --> 3:54:51.200]  going getting their mitts on anything they can get
[3:54:51.200 --> 3:54:55.840]  uh you know never mind the few good men but but the expression of the slogan is
[3:54:55.840 --> 3:55:00.400]  is to me uh very interesting you know we're looking for a few good men and
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:04.080]  interestingly in in that can't ad campaign they use the sword
[3:55:04.080 --> 3:55:07.680]  you know i think in the pageantry and the ceremony of the marines
[3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:12.320]  they actually use uh the sword well the establishment knows they know the
[3:55:12.320 --> 3:55:16.000]  archetype they know what it's really about to be alive and they manipulate
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:19.520]  that for their own aim we have to forget about
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:22.640]  barack obama george bush and michael jackson these fake
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:26.560]  demonic weak things they project on our minds and we've got to really get back
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:30.240]  to what it's all about standing for something and putting your life on the
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:33.680]  line yeah the right path is is you know it's the zombies you know we're looking
[3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:39.360]  for men of honor men of bravery men are shivery and ultimately men of truth
[3:55:39.360 --> 3:55:43.280]  well i hope people will go and get the film and i want to thank you for getting
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:46.640]  mr davies on the show you said you were gonna do it set him up for us and

[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:41.680]  imploding i've actually haven't pitched me
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:44.640]  yeah but they're hoping it'll pick back up and they're going to make start buying
[3:56:44.640 --> 3:56:47.760]  stuff in the fall because they're not buying anything it's ridiculous
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:51.920]  so the history channel of course is an obvious uh and the history channel in
