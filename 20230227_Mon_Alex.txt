[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:22.000 --> 00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a loaded Monday transmission for you. Owen Troyer here in the driver's seat. Alex Jones is going to be joining me today with the latest breaking news.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  Now, all sorts of important topics that we're going to be covering today.
[00:45.000 --> 00:55.000]  But I want to just focus on one quickly, and the story's been slowly developing. I've got other headlines about this.
[00:55.000 --> 01:08.000]  But it's the new Republican leadership of Kevin McCarthy, the House Speaker, promising he was going to release the January 6 footage to the public.
[01:08.000 --> 01:21.000]  That has not happened. And despite some murmurings and clamorings about Tucker Carlson's crew getting access to some of it, it was very restricted.
[01:21.000 --> 01:30.000]  But not even to get into the hairs of that, Kevin McCarthy, as of right now, you are a liar.
[01:30.000 --> 01:40.000]  You have not released the January 6 footage to the public like you promised you would so that you could become Speaker of the House. So you're a liar.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  Now, you could make right on that. You could still release it.
[01:46.000 --> 02:03.000]  But aside from that, what have we seen in response to the idea of the January 6 footage being released? Well, from Stephen Colbert and his late night talk show, which is just a Democrat Party propaganda machine.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  That's it. He just takes his talking points from the Democrat Party propaganda. It's not even late night TV. It's not even comedy.
[02:09.000 --> 02:20.000]  It's not too hard to figure that out from pushing your pushing you a vaccine that's going to poison you for a year to going on air this week saying we can't release the January 6 footage.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  Like literally he's reading off a Democrat teleprompter. We can't release the footage. It will release national security secrets.
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  It'll show people where the cameras are at. It's too dangerous. Representative Benny Thompson, Democrat, warns release of January 6 video could compromise capital security.
[02:37.000 --> 02:46.000]  Chuck Schumer coming out saying the same thing. We can't release this. What are you nuts? What are you crazy?
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  Well, you know, I bet if it was showing something Trump did, they'd want you to release. They'd want it released.
[02:50.000 --> 03:03.000]  I bet if it showed their narrative of what happened on January 6 to be true, a bunch of Trump supporters going in there trying to insurrect, then they'd want you to see it, but they don't.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  So here's a journalist, Dana Milbank, saying you can't see it in clip three.
[03:08.000 --> 03:20.000]  Speaker Kevin McCarthy is under fire for sharing about 44,000 hours of surveillance camera footage from January 6 with Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  Other media organizations, including NBC News, have demanded access to the tapes as well.
[03:27.000 --> 03:38.000]  The Speaker is more than just a political leader. They also oversee the day-to-day administration of the Capitol, including security.
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  Is there something unprecedented about what McCarthy has done here, Dana?
[03:44.000 --> 03:58.000]  Yeah, I mean, day after day, it seems that he breaks precedent after precedent. This is another one of the promises he made to the holdouts to give him the speakership, according to Matt Gaetz himself.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  This is one of the things that Kevin McCarthy promised to release all of this footage.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  And now he's doing your job.
[04:05.000 --> 04:15.000]  Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank about to tell you you can't see the footage. So he's working for you then because you don't want us to see the footage and he hasn't followed through.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  He hasn't made good on his promise to release the footage.
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.000]  See, it's never enough with these tyrants. They want full control of Kevin McCarthy. They don't even like him releasing it to Fox News crews.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  But think about it like this. Why don't the Democrats want you to see that footage?
[04:30.000 --> 04:37.000]  Why are the January 6th defendants in court fighting to have that footage released, but not the people claiming that they're guilty of an insurrection?
[04:37.000 --> 04:46.000]  And the same question you could apply to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. All these European countries are demanding an investigation into the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  You know who's shutting that down? Joe Biden. Why don't they want you to see the January 6th footage? Why don't they want you to know who did the Nord Stream 2 pipeline?
[04:54.000 --> 05:01.000]  The truth is because the Democrats did both of those events.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  So get your copy of the Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowarshore.com.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[05:48.000 --> 05:58.000]  I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go to the library or give them to the local school.
[05:58.000 --> 06:20.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[06:20.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's the final countdown alright. It's the final countdown for freedom for humans on planet earth or even humanity on planet earth.
[06:32.000 --> 06:46.000]  Or it's the final countdown for global government tyranny, medical tyranny, weaponized government against the people of this planet stopping us from controlling our destiny.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  This is the Alex Jones show live here on this Monday, February 27, 2023.
[06:51.000 --> 06:59.000]  Billing in for Alex Owen Schreuer. Today Alex is joining me in the second hour with big breaking news.
[06:59.000 --> 07:08.000]  And I'm also hoping we're efforting to get Jim Hoft on or somebody from the Gateway Pundit to cover a lot of the election news that's breaking.
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  Where just wild stuff coming out of Arizona, wild stuff coming out of Houston, wild stuff coming out of Los Angeles.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  And it's the stuff you would expect but we're talking about millions of illegal votes.
[07:20.000 --> 07:30.000]  We're talking about voter fraud that can obviously overturn true election results and a lot of criminal activity that's being exposed.
[07:30.000 --> 07:39.000]  But there's an old headline that's another headline from today, from this weekend.
[07:39.000 --> 07:49.000]  And that is legal walls close in on Trump. Walls close in on Trump.
[07:49.000 --> 07:57.000]  And this is their big syndicated article bashing Trump from over the weekend.
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  You can go on a Google search and plug in walls close in on Trump.
[08:04.000 --> 08:13.000]  And since 2016, 2015, probably even, you'll find all kinds of stories, news reports, walls close in.
[08:13.000 --> 08:29.000]  There's entire video compilations, probably at Gravian, but they're out there, entire media compilations, and it's just one talking head after the other.
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  Like they're reading off the same script like we've seen before.
[08:33.000 --> 08:41.000]  And they all say, the walls are closing in on Trump. The walls are closing in. The walls are closing in. The walls are closing in.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  Look at that. There it is right there.
[08:44.000 --> 08:55.000]  So are the walls closing in on Trump? Have they been closing in on Trump for, what, seven years now? They're closing in.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  The walls are closing in. They've been saying it for seven years, but that's not even the point.
[09:02.000 --> 09:14.000]  The point is that the walls are closing in on the globalists. The walls are closing in on the Biden administration.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  Why doesn't the Biden administration want to investigate the Nord Stream 2 pipeline explosion?
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Because they did it.
[09:24.000 --> 09:39.000]  And guess what? The rest of the world is figuring that out, including the European countries that are having meetings, leaving the United States out, leaving the Biden administration out, trying to decide how they're going to deal with this madness.
[09:39.000 --> 09:48.000]  They don't want war with Russia. They don't want World War III. NATO does not want Ukraine, and Ukraine is not in the NATO alliance.
[09:48.000 --> 10:03.000]  And it was the Biden administration that blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a false flag event to try to get Europe more invested into the war against Russia in Ukraine, and it didn't take.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  It didn't take.
[10:06.000 --> 10:26.000]  So our leaders are basically mad villains, psychotic, mad, but really even more psychotic than mad. They're just incompetent. They're defunct. They're not in their prime. They're not sending their best.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  So the walls are actually closing in on Joe Biden.
[10:32.000 --> 10:47.000]  But that's just half the story. The walls are closing in on the idea of global government, because people are starting to realize what it really means, what it really represents, what stopping man-made climate change really is about.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  Remove climate change from that, and you've got it.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  Well, that's just stopping man. Bingo. Bingo.
[10:57.000 --> 11:06.000]  But no, the walls are closing in on Pete Booty, judge. You know, they tried to blame Trump for the whole train derailment, and there's a bunch of news on that today.
[11:06.000 --> 11:20.000]  Well, it actually turns out, no, no, it wasn't the regulations cut by Trump. It was a demand that the unions made after Trump to the Biden administration and Pete Booty, judge.
[11:20.000 --> 11:33.000]  And the union said, we don't need to have all of these crew members on, like Trump wanted, plus the automated system.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  And so the story was that, oh, there was only one crew member on the train, and they were trying to blame that on Trump.
[11:39.000 --> 11:50.000]  Well, actually, it was the union request to do that, but it turns out there were actually three people on the train. They were crew members during the derailment.
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  So again, they lied. They were wrong. But isn't that so typical? Blame Trump for what you've done.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  Trump stole the election. No, you guys steal elections.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  The walls are closing in on Joe Biden. The walls are closing in on the military-industrial complex.
[12:08.000 --> 12:21.000]  Now, that's dangerous because it's the whole flip over the board, turn over the table moment of desperation that we could be facing.
[12:21.000 --> 12:30.000]  But it's the same why. Why don't the Democrats and their friends in the media want you to see the January 6th footage?
[12:30.000 --> 12:38.000]  Because it shows everything they've told you about January 6th is a lie, and it will show you that it was indeed Democrats.
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.000]  I mean, I don't know if they would call themselves Democrats, but Antifa types, leftist types, maybe FBI provocateurs with their face masks on,
[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  with their black hoodies and black pants and black Antifa gear breaking in, busting through, tearing down the barriers.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  And then when the Trump supporters get in there with, you know, their American flags and their Trump hats,
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  they're just kind of walking through the velvet robes like, oh, well, this is kind of cool, like it's a tourism event.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  So they lied about that. They sent in their provocateurs and false flagged it and lied about it.
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  And now they don't want you to see the evidence. Isn't it so obvious?
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  January 6th defendants, like myself, begging for the footage to be released.
[13:20.000 --> 13:31.000]  Why would I want that footage to be released? Because it'll show the entire event that they are claiming it was, is a lie.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  Same with the other defendants, the ones rotting in jail cells.
[13:35.000 --> 13:43.000]  You know, the doctors, the military veterans, the moms, the dads, rotting in jail cells for years, they want the footage released.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  Why? Because it'll prove their innocence.
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.000]  So why don't the Democrats want the footage released? Why don't their friends and their propaganda agents in the American media,
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  in the mainstream media, why don't they want the footage released?
[13:58.000 --> 14:07.000]  Well, it's the exact same why they don't want you to know who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, because they did it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  The Democrats did January 6th. They stood down the National Guard.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  They stood down the DC police. They sent in their provocateurs.
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.000]  They had a film crew, a documentary film crew, ready to go, because they knew they were staging this false flat.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  And even Nancy Pelosi's daughter, who was shooting the documentary, how convenient that day, has come out and said,
[14:32.000 --> 14:41.000]  in a hot mic, hot camera, she didn't know she was on, saying, yeah, there was no insurrection on January 6th, the whole thing is a lie.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  So why don't the Democrats and their friends in the mainstream media want you to see the January 6th footage?
[14:46.000 --> 14:53.000]  The same reason they don't want you to know who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, because they did it.
[14:53.000 --> 15:02.000]  They did it. They are the bad guys. They are the crooks. They are the criminals. They are the liars.
[15:02.000 --> 15:08.000]  And the minute you realize that, the entire gig is up.
[15:08.000 --> 15:19.000]  The minute you realize these are the most coordinated, conscious, lying, conniving, deceiving people on Earth,
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  why would you trust anything else they're selling you?
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  You're not going to trust their global government. You're not going to trust their medical tyranny.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  You're not going to trust their stop man made climate change agenda.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  You're not going to trust anything they sell you anymore, and you shouldn't, and you never should.
[15:37.000 --> 15:44.000]  But that's why they're in a circle the wagons technique right now, saying, you can't see the January 6th footage.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  It's dangerous, and we can't know who blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It's dangerous. Really?
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  Well, yeah, I guess it is dangerous for the criminals that did it.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  In other words, it's dangerous for you, the Democrats.
[15:57.000 --> 16:07.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTour.com
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.

[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion, it just can't end.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  We need to go into the capital, that is the...
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories, they are nothing but distract.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  You guys censored Harvard Educated Dockers, you silenced those voices.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but...
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[20:19.000 --> 20:26.000]  You know, I don't want to spend all day on this.
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.000]  I've got some news I'll cover right now and we'll move on for the time being.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  I will tell you that reporter for the Gateway Pundit, Kara Kasternova,
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  is going to be joining me on the war room later today
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  to discuss some of the latest January 6 developments with those cases that are ongoing.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  But the question that needs to be asked,
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  why is the same media and the same Democrat Party that told you January 6
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  was the worst event in American history, worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11?
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  And if you're listening to me and you think that I'm exaggerating or being sensational,
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  no, they literally did that.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  That's not me dramatizing the situation, that's them.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  They compared it and said it was worse on national television,
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  saying January 6 was worse than 9-11 in Pearl Harbor.
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  Some of them saying combined.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  That's how deranged these lunatics are.
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  But I mean, anybody that would want a global government is clearly a little deranged.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  But no, they told you it was the worst thing ever.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  They told you you need to be concerned.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  They told you it was a terror attack.
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  And now they're telling you you can't see the footage from that day.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  I mean, that should give away the entire operation right there.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  Worst attack on the U.S. Capitol ever.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  Worst terror attack in U.S. history.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Insurrection.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  Wow, that sounds bad.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  I'd like to see some of that footage.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  No, you can't see the footage.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Oh, why not?
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  Oh, why not?
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.000]  You build it up.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  You say how bad it is.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  You sell us on this event.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  And now we can't even see the evidence?
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  Hmm.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  Pretty obvious what's going on there, isn't it?
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  And then there's Kevin McCarthy.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  Boy, oh boy.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  I had hope.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  I thought he would come through.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  And he promised us he'd release the footage.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  Kevin.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  Oh, Kevin.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  Where's the footage, buddy?
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  It's been over a month now.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  We'd like that footage.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  And Kevin, in case you haven't noticed,
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  that footage has the Democrat Party absolutely panicked.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  And the mainstream media absolutely panicked.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  Hmm.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  And don't tell me it's about national security.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  Don't tell me it's about security or safety concerns.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  These people have the southern border wide open
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  with rapists and murderers and drug dealers
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  and human traffickers pouring in,
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  making billions of dollars every day.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Don't tell me about national security.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  You don't want me to see what really happened on January 6th.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  Bull crap.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  So Kevin McCarthy, hi.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Hi, Kevin.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  Where's that footage you promised us?
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  Kevin.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  Kevin, you promised us some footage.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  The Democrats are absolutely panicked over it.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  You think we could get that footage, huh?
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  You think you could maybe come through with that promise?
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Oh, Kevin.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  Or are you the stinker?
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  Are you the swamp creature that we thought you were?
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  I gave him a chance.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  I've given him the benefit of the doubt in the month
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  since he was confirmed as the House Speaker.
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  But looking for something here, Kevin,
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  we ain't got all day.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  But you see, it's the same reason they don't want you talking
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  And I'm going to move on, but it needs to be well understood
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  by the American people.
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  And now Donald Trump went on Glenn Beck's radio show this morning.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  Trump to Glenn Beck, Nord Stream Attack, could have been us.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  The one group it wasn't was Russia.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  That was actually over the weekend.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  Trump said that with Glenn Beck.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  And that's just the truth.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  I mean, you have Victoria Newland, who's just,
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  she's elbow deep in all the Ukrainian corruption with the
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  Biolabs and Rosemont Seneca and Hunter Biden.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  She's been over there for years.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  She's been over there for decades.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  She knows what's going on.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  And you have Joe Biden, you have Victoria Newland.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  You have all these members of the Biden administration coming out
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  and saying, we're going to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  We're going to blow up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  And then it happens.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  And you say, wow, it must have been those guys that said
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  they were going to do it.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  And they say, oh, no, I'm not.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Oh, oops.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  We bragged about committing a war crime.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  Oh, oops.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  We bragged about wanting to commit a terror attack.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  And then we did it.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  And we bragged about it.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  And now we're caught.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  It's like Joe Biden in front of the council on foreign relations.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  I mean, Ukraine has been stealing billions of dollars
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  from the United States for years.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  And Biden loves it.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  Biden loves it because it's 10% for the big guy.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  So what's 10% of a billion?
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  $100 million?
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  Did Joe Biden get $100 million when he released the $1 billion for Ukraine
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.000]  so that they would fire a prosecutor that wasn't investigating his son?
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  Did Biden get 10% of that money too?
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  See, this is why our politicians love all this foreign money
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  that we give away because they can use it as bribe and leverage material.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  You better not investigate my son's criminal activity in Ukraine
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  or we're not going to send you a billion dollars.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  And he brags about it in front of the council on foreign relations.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  And then the guy gets fired and his son Hunter Biden makes millions of dollars
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  working for a gas company.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  He has no experience in the oil field, in the oil industry.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  They're criminals, they're crooks, and they've been caught
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  and they brag about it on national television.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  We're going to blow up the pipeline. We didn't blow up the pipeline.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  So Trump telling the truth on Glunbeck and everybody knows it.
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  Russia knows they blew it up.
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  Switzerland knows they blew it up.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  Norway was apparently involved.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  Germany knows the United States blew it up.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  Everybody knows it.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  And so there's a real standoff going on as far as how involved NATO
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  and these other European allies want to get involved in Ukraine
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  to back Biden's war against Russia to protect their criminal vassal state of Ukraine,
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  their money laundering, their asset laundering operation.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  Hungary demands UN investigation in a scandalous attack on Nord Stream 2 pipelines.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  Again, though, you don't hear United States demands investigation.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  You don't hear Joe Biden demands investigation.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  You don't hear Vladimir Zelensky demands investigation.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  No, you don't, do you?
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  You hear about these European countries demanding an investigation,
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  but you get crickets.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  You get silence from the Biden administration.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  They don't want it to be investigated because they did it.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  Remember when liberals were anti-war, this is going to be a nice little thorn in your side.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  This is going to be a nice little dagger into you fake anti-war liberals.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  President George W. Bush supports U.S. involvement in Ukraine.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  There you go, folks.
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  There you go.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  So now Bush supports the war in Ukraine.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  You live still going to like that?
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  You Obama voters, the anti-war Democrats.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  You hated George Bush.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  He was a war criminal.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  He killed millions of people in Iraq, right?
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Afghanistan, right?
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  He's so bad, right?
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  Oh, but the war in Ukraine, though, you guys agree with that, don't you?
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  Don't you?
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  His cognitive decline is going to get people killed.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  Former White House physician says Joe Biden is leading U.S. into war.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  Yeah, actually, people already died in Afghanistan.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  People have already died in Ukraine, so it's already caused people to die.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic book
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  that documents the globalists and their own words, planned for our future.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  That is the hellish future.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores,
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Amazon, or m4chore.com.
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World, a signed copy at m4chore.com.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  You'll also know that you help keep m4chores on the air.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to m4chore.com and get a signed copy
[29:52.000 --> 29:57.000]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give them to the local school.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  I've got some good news.
[30:02.000 --> 30:09.000]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  That's the good news. They're amazing.

[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  ever go to m4chore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to m4chore.com
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  and got some of these amazing products.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation

[30:56.000 --> 31:00.000]  and help us defeat the new ruler together infowarstore.com.

[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support while selling you great products at the same time.

[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  and have never actually gone to infowarstore.com to go there
[31:27.000 --> 31:32.000]  and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  that won't just empower you and enrich your life but again will keep this broadcast transmitting.

[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  We can't stay on air without your help and I want to thank you all for your past support

[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books we didn't have for sale,
[32:54.000 --> 33:09.000]  but now I sign the last books and get them right down.
[33:24.000 --> 33:33.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  And as always, an honor and a privilege to be with you here today.
[33:38.000 --> 33:44.000]  The emergency transmissions are still blasting out internationally.
[33:44.000 --> 33:54.000]  Despite the globalists, the global criminal cabal, secret societies agenda to have us removed.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  And you know, I have to tell you, I brought in today.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  I haven't taken my morning supplements.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  I was running around all morning and I didn't have time,
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  but I did put them in a little baggie here.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  And so these are my morning supplements.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  Let's see how many we got in here.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  I think we got exactly 10 different pills in here.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  I think six or seven of them are right from infowarstore.com.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  And so I still need to take those.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  I just need to get a cup of water, but I really do take the products from infowarstore.com.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  I really am a product of the products from infowarstore.com.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  So I'm not just up here selling you something, talking about something that I don't take and use myself.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  We really do have the best supplements.
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  And when you realize how depleted our diets are of basic nutrition,
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  you realize this is why the supplement industry has taken off throughout the years.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  But considering what a large industry it's become,
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  obviously the people come in bringing you low quality supplements at the highest price.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  We do the opposite.
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  We bring you the highest quality supplements at the lowest price.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  And then use that to fund ourselves at infowarstore.com.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  So that's what we do to stay on air.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  We don't take money from big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  so that we can't warn you about the deadly side effects of their vaccine.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  Unlike the mainstream news outlets that are beholden to their corporate sponsors,
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  whether it's Big Hollywood or Big Pharma or Big Agra,
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  and then they can't talk about it.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  You know, it's funny enough, but that was kind of the plot line for Anchorman 2,
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  which is actually a really underrated movie.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  Usually those follow-ups aren't as good, but Anchorman 2 was really good.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  But that was the whole plot line.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  It's like, oh, they can't talk about the real news because it hurts their corporate sponsors.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  Well, we don't have the corporate sponsors.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  We have you, the sponsors, shopping at infowarstore.com.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  And so we appreciate that.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  We do still have the prebiotic fiber 40% off right now
[36:01.000 --> 36:09.000]  and all of the InfoWars MD line supplements at a discount as well at infowarstore.com.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  And of course, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  But there's supplements there at infowarstore.com.
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  I will not go a day without taking like DNA Force Plus for one and so much more.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  And of course, you know, I won't go on air without Brain Force Plus or Brain Force Ultra.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  So when I've got a long day of double duty like today, Brain Force Plus,
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  Brain Force Ultra, my go-to also on sale exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  Wow.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  It was like we planned that out, guys.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  That's synergy here on a Monday.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  All right.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  The walls are closing in on the deep state.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  The walls are closing in on the globalist.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  The walls are closing in on Big Pharma.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  Woody Harrelson is an American hero.
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.000]  After what he did on Saturday Night Live.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  Now, there's an older video that's kind of resurfaced.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  Second video of Woody Harrelson blasting Big Pharma appears online.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  This time with Bill Maher agreeing.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  Yeah, Bill Maher's an actual liberal.
[37:15.000 --> 37:24.000]  And while he has a lot of differences in ideologies from, let's say, right-wingers or conservatives,
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  he's not a psychotic big government control freak authoritarian.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  And so he sees that stuff and calls it out.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  And with the vaccines, that has been an obvious one.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  But I'm not going to play the clip.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  The whole monologue is about six minutes.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  They have it on the screen here.
[37:42.000 --> 37:50.000]  But Woody Harrelson just so perfectly breaks down the madness of COVID and the vaccines.
[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  But in a humorous way, that's like he's telling you what happened,
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  but saying that's impossible because nobody would believe that,
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  except that's exactly what happened, ironically enough.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  And so it goes totally viral.
[38:05.000 --> 38:13.000]  And sadly, sadly, a lot of people are waking up now to the truth about the vaccines
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  and the side effects and this died suddenly situation.
[38:19.000 --> 38:26.000]  The good news is because of this realization and because of this awakening,
[38:26.000 --> 38:33.000]  I mean, you realize their entire plan was probably have you on about your fourth or fifth vaccine by now.
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  And that's why they gave you that certification card.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  And remember, it had like five boxes in it.
[38:44.000 --> 38:53.000]  So the plan really from Pfizer and the big pharma companies that own our government and own our media,
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.000]  the plan was really to have you on about your fourth or fifth shot by now or dead.
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  But not just info wars, but because of all the other news outlets out there pushing back against it.
[39:07.000 --> 39:18.000]  The whole vaccine pass failed this whole booster, get your boosters and get your third booster and fourth booster has just completely collapsed.
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.000]  And so the good news is that you got one of these vaccines.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.000]  The odds of you having a life altering side effect are pretty low, pretty low.
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  You have two, three, four, they exponentially increase with each shot, obviously.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  But everybody's sadly learning about this now.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  FDA reveals rare, possibly fatal neurological disorder is a potential risk with new Pfizer vaccine.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  And now they're investigating another professional athlete's death.
[39:53.000 --> 40:02.000]  42 year old former U.S. swimming champ dies in Virgin Islands found on the floor. Police are investigating.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  So we don't know the story there, but it's another die suddenly phenomenon either way.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  But it's every day.
[40:08.000 --> 40:19.000]  And I have from all over the country, just just friends and audience members from all over the country.
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  And it's local news stories. 12 year old basketball player dies cardiac arrest.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  14 year old football player dies on the field cardiac arrest.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  Cross country runner dies cardiac arrest.
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  Like this has never happened before. This is odd.
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  Yeah, well, the number one side effect for the vaccine is the heart problems.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  And they just want to normalize it and you can go find all these different stories now.
[40:49.000 --> 40:59.000]  And they run television ads about how it's normal for 12 year old boys and girls to have heart attacks.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  That's normal now. Nothing to see there. Don't worry about that.
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.000]  Well, that wasn't normal. Why is it normal now?
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  What has changed?
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Okay, this story just broke. I even see this just broke.
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.000]  31 year old former Mets minor league pitcher Matt Poboreko dies suddenly of a heart attack.
[41:26.000 --> 41:33.000]  31 years old professional athlete dies suddenly heart attack.
[41:33.000 --> 41:42.000]  So boy, oh boy, I'll tell you trying to pace myself today.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  I've got a long day and I'm trying to pace myself.
[41:45.000 --> 41:53.000]  But but you know, I got to tell you, you know, I've got I've got friends.
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.000]  I've got family and I meet people that are now friends and they took the vaccine and they.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  And they, you know, they didn't know any better.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  They don't even watch news. They don't even care.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  They just were told it was safe and effective. They were told they needed to go to work.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  They were told they needed to travel. They were told they need it to fight against a COVID infection.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  Just all lies. Just all lies.
[42:22.000 --> 42:40.000]  And maybe you experienced this too. I mean, it's such a difficult subject to breach because I'm not trying to put people I know and care about into this state of fear irrationally.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  But it's just like, man.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  So all I say is, oh, okay, hey, make sure you don't get another. Make sure you don't get another.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  Okay, there's a lot of bad side effects. They're killing people. Make sure you do not get another.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  And the good news is most of them never did go back to get the booster, but man, it makes me so mad.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  They got tricked into taking it right now.
[43:01.000 --> 43:12.000]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[43:12.000 --> 43:20.000]  I am humbly had in hand talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to info or store.com.
[43:20.000 --> 43:29.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to info or store.com and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show. That's great. I thank you.
[43:34.000 --> 43:44.000]  But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real red pill.
[43:44.000 --> 44:06.000]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out on these products. So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infoorstore.com right now and get these great info or products at infoorstore.com.
[44:06.000 --> 44:18.000]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[44:18.000 --> 44:24.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed.
[44:24.000 --> 44:38.000]  Autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[44:38.000 --> 44:46.000]  We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[44:46.000 --> 45:00.000]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[45:00.000 --> 45:19.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[45:19.000 --> 45:31.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[45:31.000 --> 45:40.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. And that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[45:40.000 --> 45:49.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air.
[45:49.000 --> 45:59.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go by products info wars.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to info wars.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[45:59.000 --> 46:18.000]  I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers. That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to info wars store.com and ever actually buy the products.
[46:18.000 --> 46:34.000]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products. Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to info wars store.com and got some of these amazing products.
[46:34.000 --> 46:51.000]  I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is. Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[46:51.000 --> 47:05.000]  Or real Red Bull Plus. Just go try the product, fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler together infowarstore.com.
[47:21.000 --> 47:35.000]  Last night I was discussing with Alex Jones who joins us coming up in the next hour.
[47:35.000 --> 47:58.000]  Part of the story when it comes to the 15 minute city idea that is now being talked about. And there's already some examples of this. Like, they want to build this wall city in Saudi Arabia which I'm actually not even that opposed to as much as other commentators have been.
[47:58.000 --> 48:09.000]  If you want to go live in some wall facility or commune like that, I have no problem with that. You can't force people into doing it and maybe the thing ends up working out.
[48:09.000 --> 48:28.000]  More realistically, it's not just an infrastructure built where you just have your whole life there in this hub, but it's the tyranny and the surveillance and the social credit system and everything that comes along with it which is really right out of China.
[48:28.000 --> 48:44.000]  And so the best way to describe a 15 minute city would basically to say you're in an open air prison camp and you can't, I mean ultimately they like the situation if they can control all the resources.
[48:44.000 --> 48:55.000]  This is why they have to destroy the Amish and other such people so that you can't live outside the city. They control the water, they control the food and you just literally can't even exist.
[48:55.000 --> 49:02.000]  You can't live. They want to make it impossible to farm. Bill Gates buying up all the farmland. They want to make being Amish illegal.
[49:02.000 --> 49:11.000]  They want to make just having natural organic food that you can just grow right there on your land, have animals and plants and everything to be self-sustainable.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  They want to shut all that down.
[49:15.000 --> 49:26.000]  And so imagine an open air prison and yes, there will be bars around the city for your protection, of course, for your protection.
[49:26.000 --> 49:34.000]  Of course, they're built to keep you in. They're built to keep you in.
[49:34.000 --> 49:49.000]  And imagine like I had a ball game and this is what I was talking about with Alex is what I saw at this ball game over the weekend. But imagine you've got the reverse turnstile when you leave the stadium and I don't know if they really make these anymore but
[49:49.000 --> 49:57.000]  where you can only walk out and you can't get back in except it's the opposite.
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  You can't leave once you're in. You're in the open air prison facility.
[50:05.000 --> 50:15.000]  And having the cashless society is one of the big parts. Now apparently Cleveland is already doing this. So Hillary Clinton says we need to have a cashless society to stop climate change.
[50:15.000 --> 50:25.000]  And the manmade climate change myth is the foundational lie that all of this next level tyranny is going to be built upon.
[50:25.000 --> 50:35.000]  But here's a report. Cleveland, Ohio apparently wants to become the first 15 minute city in the United States.
[50:35.000 --> 50:56.000]  Bibb introduced the idea of being the first 15 minute city in the United States. He did this in his state of the city address last night.
[50:56.000 --> 51:07.000]  Imagine a Cleveland where everything you need is less than 15 minutes away. It's this ideal planning framework where human needs and desires are accessible within a 15 minute walk, bicycle ride or transit trip.
[51:07.000 --> 51:18.000]  And that's really what we're striving for in this new planning model. City planner Matt Moss says it doesn't have to be a dream instead of a concrete jungle where people work and separate places where people live.
[51:18.000 --> 51:33.000]  In a 15 minute city, everything is closer. It's starting out with the city we have now and then asking residents how they might want their community to grow or change in ways that again make things more accessible or provide them with more opportunities to access the things they want to get to in the day to day lives.
[51:33.000 --> 52:02.000]  So this has failure written all over it for multiple reasons. The entire concept is impossible, first of all. This idea, I mean you're literally talking about a judge dread style mega city or you're talking about like a scene from the fifth element with 500 story sky scrapers
[52:02.000 --> 52:19.000]  and everything's in your building like in judge dread. And you can't leave, you can't get in. But this whole concept is ludicrous and if you want to live in a 15 minute city lifestyle, you can already do that.
[52:19.000 --> 52:38.000]  You can already, I've had it before, maybe not a 15 minute city is the best way to put it, but I mean I've strategically located myself before where I'm right next to a bus stop or right next to a train stop so I can utilize that public transit.
[52:38.000 --> 52:50.000]  Or better yet, I'll find somewhere to live that's a mile or two from where I work. I walk to work, I bike to work for about five years of my life when I was living in St. Louis.
[52:50.000 --> 52:57.000]  So you can already choose that lifestyle if you want it. This is about removing the element of choice.
[52:57.000 --> 53:18.000]  Selling it to you like it's this great idea. Tell me how, okay, I'll tell you what, you want to build a 15 minute city? Okay, I'm all for it. We just spent $150 billion in Ukraine. Do you think we could have built a 15 minute city with that?
[53:18.000 --> 53:37.000]  Look at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium, AT&T Stadium, Jerry World. Look at that construction. Look at that monstrosity of a building. That was a billion dollars. You could have built 150 of those.
[53:37.000 --> 53:50.000]  Hell, one Dallas Cowboys Stadium is like a city. You could have built 150 of those and you gave the money to Ukraine for what?
[53:50.000 --> 54:01.000]  You want to build a 15 minute city? Fine. Stop giving our money to other countries.
[54:01.000 --> 54:12.000]  Go ahead, build your 15 minute city. Go ahead, build your little organic, self-sustainable 15 minute city infrastructure. I'm for it. Let's see it. Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't. Let's give it a try.
[54:12.000 --> 54:27.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no. You're going to have a bunch. I mean, look, I don't know anything about that guy that we just played in the Cleveland news report there, but I don't think I'd want him running my life.
[54:27.000 --> 54:40.000]  I'll put it like that. Okay. I don't want him running my life. So all these people are going to do now is they're going to destroy, you watch, if they actually implement this in Cleveland, Cleveland is going to be worse to live in now.
[54:40.000 --> 54:53.000]  And they're going to destroy your infrastructure and they're going to destroy your normal commute and everything you're used to. And it's going to be a complete bungled mess and nobody's going to even buy into this idea of a 15 minute city.
[54:53.000 --> 55:05.000]  So what? You can only work at the local fast food place or you can only work at the local grocery store? What if you want to work somewhere else? What if you got a job somewhere out of town? What if you need to drive far to work?
[55:05.000 --> 55:13.000]  What if you want to live outside of the city? See, this is all about removing choice. And the cashless society has everything to do with it.
[55:13.000 --> 55:29.000]  And Alex may want to talk about this when he comes back. I know he's got news he wants to break, but I'm at the Austin FC football club soccer game over the weekend.
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  And they've already got all the venues here in Austin that are cash free. Every venue here in Austin is cash free.
[55:35.000 --> 55:44.000]  I mean, there's local venues and stuff and bars, but I mean, if you want to go to a big concert, if you want to go to a big sporting event, all the venues are cash free. You can only use your card.
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.000]  And I always complain and the workers are always like, yeah, it's bull crap. We don't like it either. And then someone else will over here and say, yeah, this is BS.
[55:51.000 --> 56:00.000]  So nobody even wants this crap. It just gets forced on us by the big corporations that own everything. And they have all the money.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  So yeah, I mean, I get it. You're a ball stadium. You're a venue or whatever. You're trying to make money. You're trying to cut costs.
[56:07.000 --> 56:18.000]  And you get told by the payment processors and the cards processors and all your different corporate sponsors, you got to do the cashless stuff. So they do it.
[56:18.000 --> 56:29.000]  But there's this new thing. I don't know if this is unique to Austin or if others have experienced this. I don't even know how it works. This is crazy.
[56:29.000 --> 56:38.000]  You walk in to they have this it's like a tiny little marketplace like a bodega type of situation at the at the ball games.
[56:38.000 --> 56:47.000]  Well, they'll just have 20 refrigerators lined up and a little, you know, display things of popcorn and chips and peanuts and stuff.
[56:47.000 --> 56:54.000]  And it's got an arm like a subway and you flash your subway ticket and the arm lifts up and you go ride the subway.
[56:54.000 --> 57:02.000]  Well, this is like a little market that they have at the stadium and you flash your card. You have to have your chip on your card to get in.
[57:02.000 --> 57:11.000]  And you put your chip in front of the reader on your debit card and the arm lifts up and you can go in.
[57:11.000 --> 57:28.000]  And somehow somehow the technology, the surveillance technology, they have watches what you grab and charges you when you walk out and you don't have to swipe it or anything else.
[57:28.000 --> 57:45.000]  Well, yeah, and eventually they want that to be in your wrist and eventually they want it to be mandatory in order for you to get access to the 15 minute cities where they're going to have all the food, all the water, all the resources.
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  This is their plan for tyranny over you.
[57:49.000 --> 57:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the Globals and their own words, plan for our future that is the hellish future.
[57:59.000 --> 58:09.000]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarestore.com.
[58:09.000 --> 58:17.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowarestore.com.
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[58:26.000 --> 58:32.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep infowares on the air.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[58:36.000 --> 58:46.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarestore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go to the library or give them to the local school.
[58:46.000 --> 58:50.000]  This is an info war I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[58:54.000 --> 59:00.000]  And info wars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  We can't stay on air without your help and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[59:04.000 --> 59:12.000]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at infowarestore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  Ultimate bone broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  Real red pill plus, simply amazing.
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  Nitric boosts what it does for your heart.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  All these products like ultimate krill oil, ultimate fish oil, super melt, vitality.
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  They're all available at in stock, ready to ship to you right down infowarstore.com.
[59:31.000 --> 59:40.000]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books. We didn't have them for sale.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  But now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[59:46.000 --> 59:53.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations such as red states.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Second smartest guy in the world on Substack also reported on it and has recently published an update,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  writing that now we have a more robust and far more damning view of this carefully distributed depopulation scheme.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Back in Ohio of 2021, the expose publishes a report on data found in the USA's VAERS vaccine adverse event reporting system,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  which reveals that 100% of COVID-19 vaccine deaths had been caused by just 5% of the batches.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  Batches that can be identified and these deadly batches were not distributed evenly.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  The top 8 states with the highest vaccination death rate, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming and Tennessee are all red states.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  19 of the top 24 on the list are red states and California has been the least affected by the deadly lots of COVID vaccine.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  The numbers show that Kentucky has a 1,900% worse vaccination death rate than California,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  suggesting that Kentucky received 20 times the amount of deadly batches than California did.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Florida, number 20 on the list of most vaccine deaths per vaccination, received 3 times the amount of deadly batches than California.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  With its vaccination death rate at 200% higher than California's.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  The author points out that these deadly batches would be better classified as rapid kill lots and slow kill lots,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  as we are now seeing more evidence that they kill over time.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And the evidence shows that red states were targeted with the rapid kill shots.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  This would go along with the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  which seeks to move the entire population into crowded cities and federalize all of flyover country in the name of climate change.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  They have less than 7 years to accomplish this and they are deadly serious about it.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  The US government is in lockstep with the United Nations and they will resort to murder and democide to accomplish their goals of total control.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Many are suggesting that this is what is happening in East Palestine, Ohio right now.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  The people of America are under attack by their own government,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  who is never going to quit until they accomplish their goals or unless they are stopped.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that is really, really an awful situation.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people. We love the American people.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  This is CNN.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Right now, I am not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfowarsTour.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to InfowarsTour.com.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfowarsTour.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show. That's great and I thank you.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out on these products. So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfowarsTour.com right now and get these great Infowars products at InfowarsTour.com.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  Great Owen Troyer until 3 p.m. today when he returns to the war room. Thank you again so much for joining us.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  Last night, I spent most of the two hours getting into the fact on the Sunday broadcast that the Great Awakening is here and the Chain Reaction is now accelerating.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  We have successfully triggered a global awakening chain reaction. That means I have, Owen has, the crew has, the audience of activists and people spread the word. You've done it.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  That's why the enemy has abject explosive lying hatred for the Infowars operation, our family of prohumans.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  We stand against their eugenics depopulation plans. We stand against their nuclear wars. We stand against their great resets, their 15 minute cities.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  Agenda 2030 and the whole entire project of the transhumanist mad scientist death cult.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  So I want to thank all of you who joined us in the first hour and I'll be back tomorrow hosting the first and the second hour as well.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  I was working on some very important projects and also spending some time with family before I plunge back into all this news and all the huge developments that are taking place.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Listers have noticed that I've been taking off four or five, six days a month the last three months. People are like, what's going on? Alex Jones never takes off more than maybe two weeks a year maximum and usually works from the road.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  And it's very, very simple but also very, very profound.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  And I explained this again just a few weeks ago.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  My primary mission of 28 years on air, 30 plus years politically active was to ignite a global awakening to the new world order.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  And now I've said this for years that I ever see our deep knowledge of how this really works spreading to a lot of other pundits and talk show host.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  And they really have the multi dimensional 3D chess understanding that I don't have to maximum pedal the metal basically killing myself working 15 to 20 hours a day.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  When Trump was in, I knew we had a shot at really turning things around then and devastating the globalist, but he got so infiltrated and his ego got in the way and a lot of other things.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Trump is a perfect nobody is that we damaged the globalist but didn't fully get the chain reaction going really because it was too much about Trump.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  And so I would work 15 hours a day on average, six days a week and about four, five, six hours on Saturdays. And my children are 20 and they are 19 and 15 and five and a half, three with my first wife, one with my second one.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  And I know that I need to get my head in the game and really cogitate and think about the new world order and have time to really process what's going on to talk about what the next major leg of my mission is going to be.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  And I've got a lot of ideas but it's still percolating through my mind. And so that's what I've been doing is taking off an unprecedented six, seven days a month and still working part time just because it's beyond recharging my batteries.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  And so we used to when I take off even a day or two people got pissed off and I understand why there's important stuff to cover and you're dedicated to listening and giving us information and sharing information with us and spreading the word and I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  But with all the attacks and all the demonization, all things going on and also having to go to court all the time and behind the scenes things.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  I was getting to where I was not looking over the horizon on what was coming next and how to stop the enemy's next move. I was spending too much time in the present.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  But again, just in the last six months or so, I can confirm this with deep analysis. We can also just see it everywhere that humanity really has turned a corner here.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Now the globalists had to really push and lock things down and kill millions of people and ship out specially directed poison injections in certain deep red areas of the US and other populist conservative areas of Europe and Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  So we're in the middle of a bio weapon attack. We're in the middle of a total Hitlerian 2.0 system and also going through three years of that really changed me a lot.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  And there's a lot to describe here and we have a lot of news to cover but people asked me this question a lot so I was just going to get it out here on air.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  That I've gone in the last few years from really hating the New World Order to being very, very sad about the whole situation.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Now I always did what I do for love of my family, love of your family because our children have grown up with the world together.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  So if you don't have empathy and love others, you don't love yourself.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  So I don't even see that as some wonderful attribute that I really do care about people and really do love people and really try to be the most genuine person I can be and really focus on am I being genuine and not rationalizing things and I'm certainly not perfect.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  But I did have an impetus to go after the enemy of my extreme hatred of them.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And a lot of people have noticed I'm not as hateful as I am or really vicious which people are like whoa this dude really comes off mean as hell and people can tell it's real, it's real legitimate hatred, grind my teeth hatred, bug my eyes out hatred.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  And I just got closer to God in the last few years and I just knew that I'm not going to be able to continue on and I'm not going to be as effective power in this operation on hate.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  And again, 30% of it was powered on hate for the new order and 70% for love of humanity.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Now it's 100% love.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  I mean I really do not hate Prince Charles or Bill Gates or any of these people.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  I just know what horrible, fallen, truly occupied satanic husks they are and that they're not even humans and they really are interdimensionally turned themselves over to this satanic transmission.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  That's what it is, it's energy and the science even shows that.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  And so I realized that staring into the abyss and opposing them from a position of hate was turning me in some ways into them.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  And it's good to be able to become your enemy, at least in the military.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  In a war games, you can think ahead of them and how they're going to operate.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  But at the same time, this has really been me going through some big changes that are much, much stronger than other kind of Paul The Road to Damascus moments I've had two other times in my life.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  And instead of it being a boom big event where I just get hit and get this big download, it's a constant download now.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  And so a lot of really important analysis, a lot of really important over the horizon information that deep research and commitment, but also focusing more on God, focusing more on love, focusing more on the good in the world.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  That's how we're going to save the good is by celebrating and pointing out what it is.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  And then just going, yeah, that's the disease, that's the evil, that's the Satanism, that's the enemy.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  And we have to oppose them very strongly and with total will, but it's more of a just continued strength, just a wall of resistance.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  And my will has become much, much stronger because I in the past believed in God, loved God and would use some of God's energy, but I was deeply, I guess, prideful.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And I believed and I have a very strong will that I could set my will against the enemy and break them and set your will against the enemy and break them.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  No, God has to put it in our heart and then God's will flows through us.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  And that is the quiet place, the most high that I've been praying a lot, trying to get in a place that King David talked about, because I've been in that place since I was a child many times.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And it was like an aura on the enemy when I was growing up, knew it, and that's why I had so many attacks and so many things that happened.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  I looked back on it and I was like, God's like a science fiction movie.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  It was like Agent Smith's, you know, the system was jumping into these people and coming up against me.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And then in those cases, it wasn't me that was winning those fights and doing those things, it was God protecting me.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  And so that's where I am now is trying to empty out the sin, trying to become purified, trying to become sanctified.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  And more and more, just getting into that quiet place, the most high, we're in God's presence and there's total confidence and completion and understanding.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  But then it's so hard to articulate something so good and something so holy and then you get in that presence and you don't even care about the world anymore.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  It's just you're like sad for the evil people.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  You're just like, oh my God, but oh my, that's how it all works.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  It's like, ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the World of the World is a historic book that documents the globalists and their own words planned for our future that is a hellish future.

[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  World War III has already started.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  There's mass censorship.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  It's away.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.

[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  And we are back on this live Monday broadcast. Oh, and it's going to be coming in and out with great stories and analysis that is commentary with me here.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  I'll be hosting the rest of this hour into the next hour.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Then I'll be back at the kickoff of the broadcast tomorrow morning.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Then I'll be back in Austin on Friday.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  We'll be doing a Saturday show and a Sunday show.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Then of course, as well, thank you again for tuning in to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  Remember, the enemies of freedom literally hate this broadcast more than anything else in the world.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  Why is that?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  Because we know what we're talking about.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  If you go back to shows I did 25 years ago, or 10 years ago, and you watch them, you go, my gosh, it all came true.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  Now, nobody else has that record.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  Nobody else has that information.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  Nobody else has that much full spectrum analysis of the New World Order.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  And it's because I have totally immersed myself with all the other top experts and in the field and studying history
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  and focusing for discernment and praying at least 10 times a day sometimes using three or four times for discernment.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  I don't ask God for things.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  I say, God, show me what you want.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  Lead me, guide me, direct me.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  Please control the evil nature in my fallen self.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  And I know that's why God lifted me up for this is because I had a real capacity to be a general of Satan.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  But I did not go down the path.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  I never went down the path.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  I certainly skated around the edge of the path and have channeled, when I was younger, Satanic Luciferian inspiration.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  I never worshipped it.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  I never was taken over by it, but I have definitely been experienced it and been tempted by it.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  That is not what the average Satanist ever has access to.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  It's a totally different kind of transmission they pick up.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  But in the Satanic seduction, it's next level.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  And you can tell the people that have that Satanic inspiration, Luciferian inspiration, you see who's operating.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  It's a very small percentage of Satan's army.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  Most of them are just hateful, vicious, backstabbing worms that are manipulated and controlled by their master.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  But I understand all of this has been part of God's process.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  So I'm done talking about myself.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  I just want listeners and viewers to understand something.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  I want you to know where we're coming from and what I stand for and what our team stands for.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  And you're part of that team.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  And it's a pro-human future.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  It's justice and it's honor and it's freedom.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  And it is standing up for our innocent children, number one, first and foremost, some of the little ones under me.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  So I want to talk about a concept here and play a clip that illustrates all of this.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  And it's a big New York Times top analyst with Fareed Zartaria, the Bilderberg group member last night on their Sunday special on these CIA network, CNN, the Globalist Network.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  And we're going to play the clip in a moment.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  And she says, no one would have thought this.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  It's incredible.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  But we've done polling and we've done research and the 200 plus thousand dead Russian troops.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  That's what NATO estimates.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  I would say at least $100,000 for more information.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  But it's probably 200,000.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  The report is it's 250,000 dead Ukrainians.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  But she says, we found and no one can believe it.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  But we found that it's making Putin stronger and making the Russians want more war.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Whereas at first, most of them didn't want war. Now most of them do want war.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  And it's stealing their resolve.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  Well, anybody knows that.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  And again, I don't say that.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  Everybody knows that.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  I'm smart.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  Don't you know that?
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  They know that too.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  They're just now letting you know, okay, it's going to be a long war.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  It's going to be hard.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  And the Russians are going to get stronger or not weaker the more we kill.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  That's something that happens with most groups of people, but particularly people like the Russians, okay, or the Germans.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  I mean, it's just very pigheaded groups and, you know, tough.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  And once they start getting a war, it doesn't go away till most people are dead.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  Okay.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  So if you think the Russians care about 200,000 dead when they lost 22 million in World War II,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  that's about a third of their population.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  Again, you've heard me say this a hundred times since this started brewing the last eight, nine years.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  The civil war, Slavic civil war, but the less is stirring up.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  But it's the same thing that globalists do when they release a virus and then bring a poison shot in.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  They are using the virus as an outside threat to get Americans and everybody else in line with their tearing.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  Of course, that's a no-brainer.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  Everybody knows that too.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  Well, they knew that about Russia.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  They knew that if there is a real outside threat and the Russians start getting their ass kicked in a full fight with NATO, which this is,
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  the Russians are going to double down and double down and double down and double down and double down and double down.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  And it's going to continue to destroy Western economies.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  It's going to hurt the Russian economy.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  But it's going to make Vladimir Putin stronger.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  And Vladimir Putin made no mistake unless he gets assassinated or unless he has thyroid cancer,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  which you can't believe anything the media says.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  He doesn't look like he's very sick for 70 years old.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  Regardless, ladies and gentlemen, if Putin goes, everybody behind him and the hardliners that make him look like a cream puff are going to get even more war like.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  So getting rid of Vladimir Putin could be probably the worst thing NATO and the globalists could do unless they want to go to full nuclear war.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  And there's a lot of analysis, a lot of history, a lot of study goes into that.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  And we see the leaders of the West saying, let's kill Putin, which is the absolute worst thing to do.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  It's like killing Joe Biden.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  People say, oh, somebody ought to assassinate Joe Biden.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  He's hated. He's horrible. He's a puppet.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Only way they can grab victory from the jaws of defeat in the deep state is killing Joe Biden.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  And I think it's something they might do.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  They won't want Kamala Harris.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  They'll have a scandal to get rid of her as well.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  In fact, if you see a scandal come up with Kamala Harris here pretty soon, they're talking about removing her.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  You know, they're getting ready to kill Biden.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  So we do not want Biden killed.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  We do not want to hair on his pedophile head harmed.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  And we do not want Vladimir Putin killed because there are much hardcore hardliners that make him again look like a choir boy ready to come into the situation.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  So let's go ahead.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  Do I have time to get this flip, guys?
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Have I gone too long here?
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the New York Times on CNN discussing it's incredible.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  Killing all these Russians only makes them more angry. Here it is.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  President Biden has said a couple of times, I think, once the body bags start coming back, the Russian people will stop supporting this war or words to that effect.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  And what you found is that the body bags are coming back, but it is actually increasing the support for the war.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Explain what's going on.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Well, thank you very much, Farid, for having me.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  And I wish I didn't have to talk about this with you today, but it's true.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  In my reporting across Russia, what I found when talking to people, mothers of those who have been lost or relatives, people are finding that their losses are actually making them support the war even more.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  They're starting to feel it even more.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  And of course, the Kremlin has refused to actually release the full statistical data of how many people have been killed, how many soldiers have died in this war.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  They've only released them intermittently, and I believe the last full count was in September at 6,000, while Western intelligence estimates that there have been 200,000 killed and wounded in this war, Russians only.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  So, of course, many Russians, most Russians don't know the full extent to this.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  But my reporting and reporting by other colleagues who remain in Russia and who have spoken to the mothers and relatives of these dead soldiers find that this makes them support it even more because they feel a concrete sense of loss.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  They do believe.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Okay, so that's enough.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Now, again, the globalists know all this, they understand this.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  That's why they're saying they're going to build all these factories in Poland and other areas for munitions, and that the war could go two to five years.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Two to five years.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  And then it just keeps escalating.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  Now China is getting involved, and now they're going to send U.S. troops, and now we see how this works.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTour.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTour.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Here you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  That's great, and I thank you.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real red pill.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTour.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals and their own words playing for our future.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  That is the hellish future.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  Bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  You'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTour.com and get a signed copy,
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go into the library or give them to the local school.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  This is an Info War. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication. It takes commitment.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to InfoWarsTour.com and buy great products
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on the air at the very same time.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  To get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset the War for the World.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  Ultimate bone broth, back at stock, nitric boost, the amazing CBD oil we have
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  It's all available at InfoWarsTour.com, some of the very best products.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTour.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years,
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTour.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on the air.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  So again, please take action, go to InfoWarsTour.com today and I thank you.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  and under the InfoWars team and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know,
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was, you know,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  and helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for, you know,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  I'm going to lie from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  All right, Owen Shroyer's right and shot gun, Alex Jones here.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  Let me finish up this point on Russia because this is an example of philosophy
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  and how the world works, something the anthropologists and sociologists and psychologists
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  that the West uses to destabilize the planet.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  No, full well, forwards and backwards.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  So now, first they lure us into an incremental war in the last nine years in a proxy war.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Then about a year and a half ago it goes into a hybrid war
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  and then now they're telling you, okay, this is a long-term full war
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  and China's openly lining up with Russia and Iran
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  and all the ramifications and implications that come from that
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  and the clear threat escalation ladder that leads to nuclear war in almost every scenario.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  So again, we're driving over the cliff, we can turn the car
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  but right now we're going straight for the cliff and down this road leads to destruction.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  It's like telling somebody, you drink three bottles of whiskey a day,
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  you're going to get liver failure.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  It might not be this year, it might not be in five years,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  but you're going to kill yourself and then the person's dead in two years
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  or somebody that's on heroin or cocaine.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  Hey, I don't know if you have a heart attack today,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  so aren't all that cocaine, but it's going to get you
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  and we're going over the edge of this cliff
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  and they know full well would make Putin stronger,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  they knew full well it would put him more in charge,
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  they knew full well on the Russian psychology,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  especially after World War II that they are now getting completely behind the war.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  The British lost millions of troops in World War I,
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  that's why they were 95% major polls against the start of World War II
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  and they knew that World War I had been started basically by the British
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  backhand and the British OSS.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  So the Brits understood that,
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  understood their size treaty and really screwed over the Germans
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  and put them into a huge depression with people starving to death everywhere.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  So folks felt sorry for the Germans and then Hitler came along
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  and we started bombing England, military targets,
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  still the Brits didn't want to go to war.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  As soon as he started bombing civilian targets,
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  as soon as that happened, it went to 98% or so for the war.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Now the British government and Winston Churchill knew that.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  We talk about Winston Churchill being a good guy
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  in many ways he was a great writer, great philosopher, really smart,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  I've read all three of his books, the three-part series,
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  the history of the English-speaking peoples,
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  I've read about him all the way back to the Boer War that he was in,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  he's a very interesting fellow but also very cold-blooded folks
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  and you know Winston Churchill when the Germans were targeting only military targets
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  at the start of World War II in England for about a year into it
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  that the British started flying big Lancaster bombers
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  over Berlin and over other German cities
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  and specifically targeted civilian targets or apartment blocks
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  and there's famous cases I think they said something like
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  200-something thousand people died in one night
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  the British were way too high winds, 50 mile an hour winds,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  it was really dry, they'd wait for the weather
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  and it was equivalent of atomic bombs
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  and they would then drop incendiary bombs on German cities
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  and Hitler took the bait
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  and then started bombing with incendiary bombs
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  the civilian targets as well and you know the rest of the history
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  so this is a psychology that goes on in these things
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  that's why Putin's not been trying to hit civilian targets
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  it's why he's been only trying to hit military targets
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  because he wants the Ukrainians to sue for peace
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  and give Russia about a third of Ukraine
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  because he knows Ukraine's going to NATO
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  and he needs that river there
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  for the name of it that travels down
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  about a third of the way into Ukraine through the east
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  and down over around Crimea
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  and Putin's made what he wants 100% clear
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  stop overthrowing the government, stop attacking Russians
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  and Ukraine can sit there
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  if you keep doing it, I'm going to invade and take part of the country
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  and that's exactly what he did
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  and now the Russians are starting to threaten Poland
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Poland's becoming a big NATO base and going along with it
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  the Poles are great people, they got screwed over by Hitler
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  who attacked them for absolutely no reason
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  and just blew their country up
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  they valiantly fought with their World War I army
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  against a World War II army
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  but the Poles are all wound up
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  have ancestral problems with the Russians
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  and I get it, the Russians have picked on them a lot
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  and so they're all foaming at the mouth
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  to go to war with Russia
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  I mean this is just bad, bad, bad folks
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  very, very, very bad stuff
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  no bueno as they say
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  you don't want this, not a good deal
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  and so when you pull back from all of that
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  it's the same thing here
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  the Globalists want us to have war over what color we are
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  or war over our sexual preference
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  or war over what part of the country we live from
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  and while they divide us all
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  the Globalists are
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  attacking us all with 5G
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  with the
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  chemical spraying that they now admit is going on
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  that we told you about 20 plus years ago
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  and they are
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  destroying our borders and deindustrializing our country
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  and shipping the fentanyl into doing all the horrible things
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  that we know are happening, we know we're going on
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Americans need to understand
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  that the Globalists, the big corporations
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  created the casual society
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  Chinese
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  model of the social credit score
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  isn't coming, it's here being implemented by corporations
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Owen did a great job
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  last hour, half the hour
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  spent on that and he doesn't have to
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  read about it online
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  he can go to an Austin soccer game
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  with their new professional soccer team
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  and
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  he goes through the biometrics and all the scanning
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  and the rest of it
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  he can try to go to Whole Foods now
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  where they put in hand scanners to buy and sell
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  this is the system
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  all the other businesses that don't use this
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  in the future
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  to control where you go and what you do
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  and to shut down the real economy
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  that's their admitted plan goal
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  it is a direct attack on you
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  again I keep harping on this because nobody else's
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  87,000 IRS agents to target people making
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  $40,000 a year or less
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  to target hard working people
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  blue collar people and below them
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  of the working poor
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  to arrest them over $600 cash
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  they got paid for something they sold on eBay
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  when they got to have the money to pay for medical bills
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  you don't target the poor people
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  with taxes in fact when they first brought in
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  the income tax in 1913 it was still evil
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  and goes to the private federal reserve
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  did you know that working class
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  people paid zero income tax
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  it was the millionaires
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  back then it was like being a billionaire that paid the tax
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  if you really
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  want to tax it you do tax the rich
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  and that still messes up the economy as well
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  the point is this is a direct
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  assault on you and I know our audience
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  knows this but new listeners that are liberals
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  or leftists that tend to hear what it's all about
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  you know taxing people making
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  $40,000 a year is wrong
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  you know that shouldn't be happening
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  you know there shouldn't be basically
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  any taxes on people
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  making $40,000 a year with disinflation
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  the way it is you can't live on that
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  one person can live okay on that
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  but you can't have a single
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  breadwinner with that and have any children
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  and again that's the plan I played the clips from the global
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  saying we're gonna
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  have so much inflation
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  and we're gonna do all these things and have so many taxes
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  you can't afford to have children
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  Paul Ehrlich I played it a month ago
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  he said we're gonna put stuff all over TV
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  making the family look bad that was 1970
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  turn on the TV that's all you see
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  these are cold blooded people that are going
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  against our biology that are going against common sense
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  that are going against everything that makes us
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  successful and safe and prosperous
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  and happy they're bad
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  and you have to admit that there's a war
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  against you you've got to admit
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  all the other stuff is a fake war
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  all the other stuff is a distraction
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  the cops maybe kill 25 black men
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  a year in
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  shootings but they show them to you
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  you think there's an epidemic of it
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  it's not true and a lot of
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  blacks got mad at me about that well
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  now a lot of blacks aren't mad at me because I'm saying look
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  blacks are killing in cold blood
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  about 10,000 white people a year look it up
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  and it's really racially motivated it's horrible and it's wrong
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  but why is it suddenly
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  everywhere viral
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  21 is killing each other more
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  but I mean the cops
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  literally it's like
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  20 something black people a year they kill
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  I mean think about that
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  but again Stalin said
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  one man dies it's
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  a tragedy 10,000 died it's a statistic
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  200,000 dead Russians
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  who cares oh 21 black men
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  22 black men got killed wrongfully by cops
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  let's burn the country down we'll show you
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  meanwhile thousands of black
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  people get killed by black people a year in Chicago
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  doesn't even hit the news because again
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  they don't want to stop the real crime
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  they don't want to go after the real criminals they want to keep it going
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  so you need
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  their later police state once the globalists do
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  fully take over the police and then nobody
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  will have guns except them
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  so that's the plan
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  I want to bring Owen in here to talk
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  about a lot of these issues in 15 minute cities
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  and so much more
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  I want to talk about the chain reaction
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  that's taking place
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  that's so huge also Zelensky threatening
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  the American people
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  we've got so much to cover here today

[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  so yeah you say why doesn't Biden address
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  the disasters in the United States
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  he doesn't care that's not
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  his job he's not the president of the
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  United States he's a puppet
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  operating for the globalists
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  appetites of the autocrat
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  cannot be appeased
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  they must be opposed
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  autocrats only
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  understand one word
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  no no
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  no exactly and that's
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  why we say no to your
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  vaccines we say
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  no to you shutting down our businesses

[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  to you selling us out to the world health
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  organization we say no to
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  you getting us into world war three you're right
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  we stand against autocrats like
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  you Joe Biden and we say
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  no and we say no to
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  your war
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  they took the babies out of 80 bears
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  and left the children to die on a cold spot
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  it was almost as if it were a plan
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  in both India and Pakistan
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  we need to go into the capital
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  that's that's that
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  you will always have conspiracy theories
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  they are nothing but distract
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  you guys censored harvard educated
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  doctors you silenced those voices
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  what we want to do in Davos
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  is push to reset but
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  as soon as we start exposing
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  the great reset the sooner
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  the flow will start going
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  to prison
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  there is a war for the future
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  happening right now there is a war
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  that will control my destiny

[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  and that war is something that we can win
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  but it takes dedication
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  it takes commitment that's why I ask

[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  and it's this
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  the deep state knows
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  the globalists know that when they start killing a bunch of Russians
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  and the Russians walked into an ATO trap
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  that the Russians aren't going to give up
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  okay just because you kill a bunch of Russians
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  doesn't mean you won because they don't give up
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  and that's actually a well-known
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  Russian trait is
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  they're pretty much sluggish at first and don't want to fight
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  and then once you start killing them
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  then the complete opposite happens
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  and so
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  Putin has to put Russia through a war
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  to get it on a war footing the US
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  has been in dozens of wars
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  all over the world since World War II
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  and has the military
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  that knows how to do the killing
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  you got a bunch of people that you know sound of the military
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  that they have working in offices
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  and you know stacking ammunition
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  but you mean
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  you've got a lot of people that are very very smart
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  and you've got a lot of AI weapons
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  that advance robotic platforms
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  that we need to get into
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  so
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  Russia to scale itself up into that
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Putin is sticking the Russians into a meat grinder
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  as I said is Putin dumb
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  marching into this trap? No, I think Putin's pretty smart
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  and he knows the Russians
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  and he's now escalating into a war economy
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  he tried to not have a war economy
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  he tried to be the big exporter of fuel
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  and the big exporter of organic food
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  and tried to get tourism going
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  but the West wouldn't let him
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  he cut military spending
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  in the last decade
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  and I'm not here lionizing Vladimir Putin
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  I'm talking about the facts
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  but now the West is successfully
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  driven Russia against the West
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  when the smart move according to
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  patriots and the smart people in the government
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  like General Flynn would have been to
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  work with Russia
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  and have corporate deals
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  with Russia and they have more oil
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  more gold, more minerals, more everything
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  more timber
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  Russia is three times the size of the US
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  it's got more resources than Africa
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Russia is the richest
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  country in the world
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  it is gigantic
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  90% of their population lives in the West
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  just in a little sliver
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  right by Europe
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  it's just as gigantic
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  people want to go to the moon or Mars to get resources
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  or mine asteroids
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  and we're not even getting in there
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  we're not even doing that
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  we should be trying to democratize China
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  and working with them as well
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  but the globalists don't want that
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  they want different authoritarian models
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  and so they've pushed Russia
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  into going authoritarian
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  and now the West can become more authoritarian
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  in the name of countering Russia and China
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  the best enemies money can buy
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  and that's what the
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  famous senate historian
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  head historian at the senate
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  they got more than 20 of them
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  it's a big office there
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  and the senate historian Anthony Sutton was given access
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  to all the behind the scenes secret meetings
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  in the 50's and 60's and 70's
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  and in the 80's he started writing
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  America's secret establishment
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  he was the senate historian
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  I started talking to Sutton about 2 years before he died
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  his brain was all there
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  but he had several diseases
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  and was in a nursing home
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  I almost got him on the show but he wouldn't come on
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  but really honored that
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  his father was sculling bones
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  put me in contact with Sutton
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  he was a real giant
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  it's information
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  it's people like Sutton that was advising
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  senator Frank Church
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  but I digress here
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  here's what I want to get at
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  okay
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  the new world order is at war with all of us
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  they're at war against our biology
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  they're at war against our future
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  and a lot of their arguments on the surface
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  look like they make sense
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  I'll be honest about that
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  if you go to Calcutta that's 20 million people
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  and you see feces all over the ground
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  you say man somebody ought to hand some birth control out here
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  but there's an article up
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  on info wars.com that I'm springing on the crew
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  I have a senator this morning that I'm springing in on him
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  showing the graph
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  of
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  India
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  that has had a 80%
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  fertility reduction
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  in just the last decade
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  now
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Indians are great people they love America
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  they're really smart I love Indians
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  those are so successful
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  you know okay
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  that's a sign of biology success is a lot of it
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  wow this thing's working there's a lot of them
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  but a lot of them are following the cracks
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  but we should have a discussion about
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  what are they doing to the Indians
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  that's sterilizing them
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  well they're putting stuff in the shocks
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  and the food and everything else we know that
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  same things happen here in the United States same thing in Europe
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  so you could say well there's too many Africans
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  there's too many Indians
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  there's too many Chinese
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  and you could argue that the Chinese can't sustain
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  the people in the land they've got and what they've got
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  and what you do when you have too big a population
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  you expand you have a war
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  so the globalists say we've got to stop war
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  while they're starting all the wars
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  and they're not doing this birth control thing
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  in a very humanitarian way are they
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  and they're targeting the highest IQ
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  people
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  for sterilization
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  the main sterilization
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  operations are in China
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  India and Europe
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  and the United States
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  people in the third world
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Africa and Latin America aren't smart
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  but with the food they get
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  the education, nature and nurture
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  those populations are not where we're seeing
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  the main spring of liberty coming from
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  you got elites in Africa that have as high IQs
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  as anybody
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  smart as anybody or smarter
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  but they're still feudal states
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  they're still very corrupt systems
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  the globalists can work with that
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  but if you could dynamite the republic
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  dynamite the idea of aspiring
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  civilization and a great awakening
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  and a renaissance and a great enlightenment
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  2.0 you've won
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  and you can create your new globalist system
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  so the globalists were honest
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  and paid people to get sterilized
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  or whatever that would be one thing
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  but say they want to make you poor
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  so then you'll have to accept the money to be sterilized
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  and they're targeting
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  the smartest populations
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  my good friend Mike Judge
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  does an illustration of this with real science
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  at the start of his incredibly funny
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  hit movie Idiocracy
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  in fact it's got cuss words in it
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  but what you have do or McGreen or somebody
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  grab the intro to Idiocracy
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  for the end of the next hour it's like three minutes long
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  and I think there's a few cuss words in there
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  so we can air that
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  where it shows how
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  it shows the statistics that the highest IQ people
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  the highest IQ blacks
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  the highest IQ Asians
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  the highest IQ whites Hispanics
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  had the least children
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  so in this model we're in
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  the more globalists are pushing that
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  the more highly educated you are
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  the more you don't want to have kids
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  then the dumber we get
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  so this is not the way civilization
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  this is not the way
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  even their own Darwinism is supposed to work
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  which I don't even buy into its totality
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  what the claim it is
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  more sophisticated
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  so what I'm getting at is
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  the globalist plan is anti-human period
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  they don't want to just get rid of poor people
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  they want to get rid of everybody
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  they want to lift up poor and try to help them
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  at the end of the day really doesn't like anybody
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  okay
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  so that's what I'm getting at is
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  what's being done to the Indians
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  is being done to all of us
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  right now
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  sperm counts in Europe are down
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  92% from 1950
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  sperm counts are down almost 90%
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  in the United States from 1950
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  now why is there not a discussion
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  of why we don't have sperm
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  why most men are sterile
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  why are we having a discussion
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  they know the GMO crops they produce
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  in studies are reducing fertility
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  so they hit you with chemicals that reduce your fertility
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  GMO that reduces your fertility
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  5G reduces your fertility
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  the injections reduce your fertility
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  and you can't ever say it's one of them that did it
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  because one thing reduces it this much
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  and the next one reduces it this much
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  each one reduces it 25, 15, 10%
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  depending on how much you get who you are
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  and by the end of the day you're swimming
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  in a toxic stew
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  you know people in the 1950s
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  on average in the U.S.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  their studies ate more caloric content
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  and more calories than we do
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  but they weren't
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  as docile
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  they were moving around
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  they were working they were moving their bodies
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  they didn't even work out as much as we do
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  but they were not sitting around
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  they were not
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  couch potatoes
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  but they didn't have chemicals
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  and hormones in the food
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  they all know about this
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  but the point is stop lying to yourself
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  and saying
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  oh
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  globalism so many leftists know what's going on
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  they're like oh well they're deploying it
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  to make the world utopia they know
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  that's no you're targeted too
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  and so stop acting like this isn't happening
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  and stop acting like it's not wrong
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  and stop acting like it's not a giant evil power grab
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  a very selfish people that want to have giant
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  estates and jumbo jets
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  and 10 kids and do whatever they want
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  and that's where obsolete
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  and tell us we've got to get rid of the middle class
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  and tell us we can't have a farmer ranch
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  or tell us we can't have three kids
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  BS and that's what I'm saying
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  is signing on to the new world order is a death cult
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  and signing on to your own destruction
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  and you can dilute yourself
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  and decide you want to be part of it
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  but as for me I want to reach out to people that have been asleep
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  and get them to understand they're under attack
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  and that's what's happened with the poison shots
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  and the crime and the fentanyl
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  and the open borders and the 5G
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  they're sick, they know something's wrong
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  they know the globalists are out to get them
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  and as soon as the majority of people know that
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  it's game over, a shot doesn't have to be fired
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  we just withdraw our political support
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  our corporate support
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  our monetary support from all the globalist systems
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  and they end overnight
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  that's why they're bringing in 15 minute cities
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  that's why they're coming after your cars
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  that's why they lock down the small shops and businesses
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  but not the box stores
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  it's a war of vertical integration
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  to control the whole economy
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  and the universal basic income
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  because you don't have a job
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  and even if you work it won't pay your bills
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  all right, Owen's been really nice sitting there
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  I love Owen to death, I'm going to host the next hour
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  with the great Owen Schreuer
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  we're going to get into this with Owen
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  and a bunch of other clips and a bunch of other news when we come back

[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  left of them right now

[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  and the good news is
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  around 1% or a little less
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  of our actual viewers and listeners

[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  if those of you on the fence
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  actually went to infowars.com

[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  infowars.com
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  you're getting your ass kicked
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  you're getting attacked
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  you can't get out of this
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  it's like you're sitting there and a mugger comes up
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  and punches you in the face
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  you didn't want to get punched in the face
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  but you notice anybody's ever been mugged
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  or in a fight like that
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  all of a sudden you're not scared
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  you're fighting back
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  you're designed to do that folks
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  and so stop being a jellyfish
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  and I know most of you aren't
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  you're not scared
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  stop being a jellyfish and I know most of you aren't
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  but oh and you sat there patiently
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  and I really appreciate you doing a great job the first hour
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  while I was talking about those issues
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  what's your take away from what
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  I was just getting into and what some of the news were going to be breaking
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  when we come back
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  well I'm looking at the Russia angle today Alex
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  and it has me extremely concerned
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  what the deep state
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  media complex is up to
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  and then what the liberal leftist media
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  complex is up to as well
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  because they kind of have different approaches
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  I mean the deep state has an agenda
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  and then the liberal left
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  has kind of become this mouthpiece of the state
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  so when you kind of
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  analyze and look at the approach that each one
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  has taken it gives you an idea of what might be coming next
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  and so when I see stories like this
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  Russia
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  braces for civil war
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  and breakups
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  as rebels vote for
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  revolution
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  and other such headlines we get into
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  this tells me they're about to start launching
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  operations in Russia
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  this tells me that Soros type groups
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  or money is about to be doing
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  uprisings in Russia like they did in Ukraine
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  in 2014
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  to try to destabilize that
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  and go after Putin
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  and so
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  what's sad is
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  nobody wants this war Alex
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  I can go anywhere and it's just like
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  sure you might see the leftist put up the Ukraine flag
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  virtue signaling
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  at their house on their social media
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  page you see the people on
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  television telling you how necessary
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  the war in Ukraine is
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  but you go out you ask the average person
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  they're not interested in war they don't care what goes on
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  in Ukraine whether you're in Germany
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  whether you're in France whether in the United States
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  they don't want anything to do with this
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  and that's why the globalists were so smart
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  that's why they were so smart
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  to just start it as a civil war nine years
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  ago and just suddenly ease us into it
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  and then now all of a sudden we're in a full war war
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  exactly well and imagine
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  now like you're saying I mean the Russians
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  are at the point where
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  since when is
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  since when is the U.S. deep state
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  military industrial complex looked at as the good guy
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  I mean since when has that been the case
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  I'm still
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  I'm still at a loss watching Obama
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  voting progressive liberal Democrats
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  support this war in Ukraine
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  even though
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  the whole reason they voted for Obama's because they were sick of the wars
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  in the Middle East
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  during the Bush years by the way that's a great
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  point Condoleezza Rice was praising
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  Joe Biden but saying he's not hard
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  core enough he's not attacking
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  Russia enough and it's like oh the
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  neocons people that
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  ran the Iraq war
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  based on total lies WMD's
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  the left just loves them now it's so
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  cute and the left loves George W. Bush
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  they have oh they were so sad
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  when his dad died these are
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  these are codlers of the
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  deep state establishment pimps
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  also they get promoted more
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  on social media they are
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  disgusting people on their
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  high horses lecturing us how we're bad
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  because we question mass shootings
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  it's the mass mental illness it's
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  Stockholm syndrome and
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  when it comes to this idea of 15
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  minute cities I'm extremely against it for obvious reasons
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  but Alex you know I'd be
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  more open minded I want
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  small government I don't want government run healthcare
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  I don't want government run anything but I mean
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  I'd at least be open minded to have a rational
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  conversation and say hey here's
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  150 billion dollars
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  what do you want to do with it
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  okay well we just gave 150 billion dollars
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  to Ukraine they're still clamoring for more
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  money Zelensky is still begging and demanding
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  more money 150
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  billion dollars Alex I could have built
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  I could have built 150 Dallas
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  Cowboys stadiums
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  I mean so it's like oh you want to talk about
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  healthcare you want to talk about reparations
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  for black people and all this other nonsense
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  that we're all gonna have to pay for and you send
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  150 billion dollars to Ukraine
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  in 12 months shut up
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  quit telling me about anything
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  I totally agree
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  in fact since you mentioned that I have Zelensky
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  berating Americans yesterday
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  we're not wanting to pay more money and then
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  I also have the Congress arise
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  quote I mentioned we'll play that
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  because this is really really an important
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  point to understand that
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  money put into a war gets lost
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  money put into infrastructure empowers
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  the people so they're cutting off our infrastructure
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  and they're shipping our money overseas
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  meat grinder will be
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  right now
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  I'm not talking to the viewers
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  and listeners that have gone

[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  of the information war
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  it's Alex Jones
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  Alex Jones
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  again thank you for joining us
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  on this live Monday broadcast
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  we're into the third hour I'm Alex Jones
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  your host writing shot number the
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  destroyer and we're talking about
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  world war three and how we were
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  basically eased into this nightmare
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000]  slept walk into it
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  overthrow the government nine years ago
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  tens of billions western money to
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  destabilize the country
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  US special ops and NATO ops fighting
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  and Russia started losing about a year
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  and a half ago just a few areas they had
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  the east so the Russians poured in
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  they went into the full meat grinder
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  of NATO
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  but they're showing they're just going to keep putting more
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  in so they will win in the end
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000]  which means NATO will then give nukes
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  or other illegal weapons
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  you know I mean illegal you violate
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  treaties that they'll probably
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  use against the Russians the Russians have left
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  the treaty saying they'll use them
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  this is a nightmare escalation I want to play
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  a couple of Zelensky clips here
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  but first I want to get to Condoleezza
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  rice so this is one of the main architects
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  of the second Iraq war the first
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  Iraq war was a fraud
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  Saddam Hussein was a CIA asset told to
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  invade Kuwait
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  the ambassador at the time
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  she admitted it on 60 minutes
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  he fought the Iranians for
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  seven years for us
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  then they pulled in his loans 34
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  billion dollars it was like a hundred
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  billion a day and tried to
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  depose him tried to assassinate him
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  so he said screw the west
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  his whole army was trained by the CIA so it was
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000]  easy when we rolled in in 91
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000]  to basically defeat them in just a couple
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  days then they put massive
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  sanctions on them
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000]  and under
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  the Clintons they tripled the sanctions that
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  George Robert Walker Bush did
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  and that kills about three million Iraqis
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  half a million of them under the age
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  of ten children imagine no penicillin
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  know nothing when your child's sick
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  I mean they died in mass
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  and they said that's a good price to pay
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  we're glad to kill 500,000 kids we're the good guys
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  we're the liberals well that continued in George W. Bush
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  and all the rest of it with the fake
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  anthrax in
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  Colin Powell's hand and all the rest of it
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  and so here's Connelly Sirice
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  now being worshipped by liberals
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  on one of the big Sunday shows
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  saying well Biden's pretty
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  good actually he's just not doing
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  enough war wise here it is
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  what do you make of
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  the Biden administration's policy
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  the choices it's making
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  and how they're using the CIA director as kind of
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  the tip of the spear here
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  well I think in general in total
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  the policies in the right direction you have to support Ukraine
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  you have to do it as
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  much as you can as a part of a coalition
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  it's really important that the Europeans
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  are on board and I've been impressed with what they've been able
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  to achieve with the Europeans
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  in creating that that unity
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  and since NATO's never been
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  in better shape
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  I do think and look it's a lot easier
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  out here than it is in there
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  but I do think we sometimes seem to be a little
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  bit behind in what we provide
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  to the Ukrainians so we
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  were not going to provide air defenses
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  than we did tanks
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  and armor and now we have
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  and so if I could say one thing
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  perhaps just to anticipate a little bit better
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  what the Ukrainians are going to need
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  okay so you understand folks
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  that I'm all for women being in positions of power
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  the type of women that want to do that
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  most women don't but
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  epigenetically
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  we all see a woman in a nice little
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  business suit up there talking about war
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  in World War 3 like she's talking about
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  taking the kids to school or she's talking
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  about you know being a doctor
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  she's talking about being a nurse it's just kind of well
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  we took cookies out of the neighbor's house
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  oh they're not giving them weapons quick enough
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  they're not escalating fast enough
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  they're not easing us into World War 3
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  quick enough they're not putting us in the deep fryer
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  fast enough now
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  here's Zelensky over the weekend
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  ask about
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  Americans that are concerned about it
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  it's more like 200 billion now it's not 116
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  like Trump said last week
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  119 that's like
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  4 months old number
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  it's almost 200 billion that we know
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  from the US alone tens of billions from Europe
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  and others and this is just
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  an absolute out of control escalating bloodbath
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  here's Zelensky
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  he says I want to thank the American people
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  but he says you'll lose your standing
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  what are the war mongers in the world
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  it's being run by a deep state that says
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  the American people are the main terror threat
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  what a pedophile promoters in the world
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  we'll lose our standing in the world
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  if we
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  don't escalate the war
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  this is a guy three months ago let's not
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  forget this
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  that shot missiles
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  into
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  Poland and instantly land Russia
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  and even when they was on the missile
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  parts because one of the missiles didn't fully explode
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  they had the tail fit and then it was
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  Ukrainian
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  they have the motive they got caught
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  doing it they did it on purpose folks
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  he said use nukes
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  Sean Penn oh my god
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  a libtard can't even wipe his ass
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  he wants us to use nukes
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  yes sir Mr. Liberal
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  see you don't expect a liberal to call for war
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  you don't expect a woman to call for World War 3
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  so it's all like well actors
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  and you know men in drag
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  are the generals and you know
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  I'm in a twilight zone episode
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  this is clown world folks to distract you
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  it's not men in dresses
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  running this this is all
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  just to demoralize us because the globalist
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  aren't just attacking Russia they're attacking
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  America and I'm gonna air the report again
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  I don't normally air a report rarely maybe
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  once every two weeks and twice the same day
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  but Gregory said a part two that I asked
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  him to do with the major insurance
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  actuaries and numbers coming out
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  confirming
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  that they sent the deadly
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  doses of the covid
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  shot in certain lots 5%
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  of them to key areas
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  where all the deaths happened in the most red areas
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  of the country
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  yeah man literally the deep state democrats
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  are bombing the American
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  people
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  and bombing police and firefighters
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  and medical workers in red states who were made to take it
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  and military people
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  now they hit our military with the hot loads too
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  they're the enemy they're the globalists they're using us
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  to destroy their enemy while they destroy us
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  member the intro
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  to from Russia with love in fact
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  find that clip too we got the idiocracy as well
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  with the sigmes fighting fish
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  and there's two fish
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  the head of
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  specter opens
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  the
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  enclosure and the two fish
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  start killing each other one fish
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  kills the other but he's almost dead
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  and then specter comes in
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  out of the third door and kills the fish
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  that's weak
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  you've got to start thinking and by the way
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  the guy that wrote those books
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  was the deputy head of OSS
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  and an MI6
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  guess what they're not just rewriting the guy that wrote
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  charlie the chocolate factory
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  they're now rewriting all of
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  e-inflemmings books
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  stealing his identity lying in the public
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  saying it's e-inflemming this is
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  total police state
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  1984 on steroids
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  they're like it's no big deal it's liberal
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  and now it's going to move with the digital age it's so corrupt
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  so here's Zelensky
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  polls in the United States are suggesting
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  that a growing number of Americans
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  believe that the US is giving too much
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  support to Ukraine
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  what would your message be on the anniversary to those Americans
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  thank you
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  I
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  I would like to thank
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  the American people
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000]  I would like to thank
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  all of the American people that are
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  supporting Ukraine the congress
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  the president
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  the tv
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  channels the journalists
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  and everyone
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  that has been supporting us
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  and that
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  percentage of Americans
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  as you've mentioned
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  is increasing
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  I can tell them only one thing
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  if they do not change their opinion
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  if they
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  do not understand us
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  if they do not support Ukraine
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  they will
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  lose NATO
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  they will lose
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  the cloud of the United States
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  they will lose the leadership position
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  that they are enjoying in the world
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  that they are enjoying
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  for a very fair reason
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  and they will lose the support of the country
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  with 40 millions
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  of population
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  with millions of children
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  are American children any different
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  don't Americans
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  enjoy the same things
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  as we do
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  I don't think we're that different
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  well Zelensky is a liar
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  the fact the numbers were 75 percent
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  against the war
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  a year ago
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  now it's more like 85 in most of the polls
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  81 is the average now
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  Owen I've got a really important Zelensky clip
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  we're going to play next time
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  this is a real clip
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  Joe Rogan sent it to me last night
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  but Owen stay there
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  we're going to get his take on this

[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  that's right, that's a tool of war
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  we'll explain all that straight ahead
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  I didn't plug last time, I didn't plug this hour

[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  as soon as we start exposing the great
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  reset the sooner
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  these globalists start going to prison

[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  we want to do it
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  we want to do it
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  we want to do it
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  the globalists start going to prison
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  the globalists start going to prison
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  the globalists start going to prison
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  the globalists start going to prison
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  the world is an insane place
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  the world war three has already started
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  Biden is a puppet

[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  there is mass censorship

[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:57.000]  signed the last books and get them right now.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:09.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:21.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm a shorter riding shotgun with me. He's in the ATX
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.960]  studios. I'm on the road back Friday but I'll be hosting the show throughout the
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:30.800]  week with Owen. I wanted to finish up on World War three that we're already in
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:34.000]  the beginning stages of and quickly in the mid stages of you know the final
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:42.160]  stages in a nuclear war with a clip from Biden's visit last week that was put
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:48.720]  out over international television and Joe sent me to this and I went and looked
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:56.800]  it up and it's a real clip and it is Zelensky marching up the stairs about
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:21:01.160]  to do a public event with Biden and behind him is a guy dressed basically in
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:06.200]  the same little outfit he wears and it looks just like Zelensky. People say is
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:10.400]  that a body double? Absolutely. This has been done a lot. A lot of presidents had
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:14.280]  body doubles. A lot of other foreign leaders have them when they think there's
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:18.760]  an assassination attempt or a threat they'll have one limo go one way with the
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:21.960]  body double and then when that drives down everybody follows it the other one
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:26.240]  goes another way sometimes even in a van or a pickup truck or something else
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:31.320]  where no one even knows the president is there but the reason I show this is the
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:34.360]  public's so shocked by this like what's a body double? Let even know that's part
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:38.720]  of statecraft going back thousands of years. Different leaders use body doubles
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.200]  to distract and divert. Sometimes they'd have a body double back before there was
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:47.320]  TV and print. People really had good images of folks. They would send fake
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:53.920]  leaders, fake caesars or emperors or other groups to go give a speech. So again
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:58.120]  it's a way to understand how manipulated things are and with Zelensky it's beyond
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:07.480]  that because Zelensky is an actor and he's not just an actor he was put in
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:10.080]  there like Reagan was an actor but he got into politics was a governor and then
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:15.360]  no Zelensky is put in there purely as an actor and because he's compromised for
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:19.800]  doing you know gay porn and the rest of it they can control him but we're rolling
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:23.560]  the b-roll right now of this but let's go ahead and roll the first clip and we've
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:41.680]  augmented it and slowed it down with audio so folks can see this for themselves.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:46.200]  So that was at full speed this is at half speed and we slowed down even more and you can sit
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:50.680]  there and see that for yourself. Oh and this just shows that this is a stage like
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:54.240]  Shakespeare said the whole world's a stage each of us players upon it your
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:58.520]  your take on Zelensky demanding Americans give more money or will quote lose
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:02.080]  our power I don't want to be the Empire I don't want to run the world I don't want
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.040]  to pay for I don't want World War three and and and now Janet Yellen made a
[02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:12.520]  surprise visit gave 1.3 whatever billion dollars to Zelensky today I mean they all
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:16.400]  look like they're so happy because this is the new Oscars people don't watch the
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:19.760]  Oscars they don't like Hollywood anymore they admit Hollywood's dead well the new
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:23.880]  Hollywood is politicians going to a war zone and strutting around Owen Schreuer
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:29.320]  well I you know I got so much to respond here from what you've covered this hour
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:35.840]  and the hour before Alex but I will just say this and you know info wars has hit
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:40.080]  the barbed wire on a lot of issues first and so we kind of know what it's like to
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  hit it and bleed out so so others can be warned and not to hit it not bleed out or
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:49.040]  you know get over it successfully and I will just say while that video is real
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:51.800]  I'm not denying that folks just need to be careful because there's a lot of other
[02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:56.640]  videos getting shared around that it is not real like training military videos
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:59.640]  and Serbia that looks like they're staging war and I agree the war is
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.720]  totally staged but when you share fake stuff that's not actually from Ukraine
[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:07.280]  you're hurting your argument there's an AI video of Joe Biden declaring that
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:10.760]  there's gonna be a draft starting that is also fake so I'm just saying from
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:14.600]  people who have we've hit the barbed wire with this stuff we've had people try to
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:18.120]  destroy us for getting things wrong so that's just more of hey take the lessons
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:21.840]  we've learned here and be really diligent about what you're sharing even if it
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:25.120]  may confirm what you think you're seeing it might not be what you think you're
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:28.360]  seeing and there the crew has it already that's just how great our crew is but
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.200]  you know Alex as far as the Zelensky statement is concerned and I got so many
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:36.000]  other comments so listen it's fair and it looked real to me the point is they do
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.040]  use body doubles did the crew find an article saying that wasn't a body double
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:42.800]  no no that's real I'm not saying that's fake I'm just saying there's other stuff
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:52.040]  I see people sharing that isn't real and that the body I totally agree and I've
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:56.560]  also you know early on Paul Joseph Watson great guy sent me a text message
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:00.440]  that when they got part of my phone the text places were public was was Paul
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:05.600]  saying oh this is more Sandy Hook BS your you guys are reporting they have
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:09.920]  mannequins hooked up to ventilators and that nobody's on ventilators we weren't
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:15.360]  saying that the CBS News did use canned footage of mannequins in ventilator
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.080]  training to say here are people on ventilators it was fake footage it was
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.360]  true it was fake we actually weren't wrong so sometimes we're so overzealous
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:29.200]  too yeah that here's the difference we're trying to tell the truth yeah we get
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.760]  things right 95% of the time the globalists are trying to lie on purpose
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.520]  but but point taken well and here's the thing about Zelensky that is so odd to
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:42.960]  me when I hear Zelensky say that that is like I want nothing to do with you
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:47.680]  anymore jerk you sound like an ungrateful punk how about how about we cut our
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:51.160]  funding all together how about we cut arming you all together you're still
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:54.720]  gonna have that big mouth you're still gonna sit there until America that our
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:02.000]  destiny is is somehow in a bond with Ukraine's how about no that's absurd
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:09.800]  that's ludicrous I mean that'd be like if somebody on Tucker Carlson's crew said
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:14.840]  you better do this for me Tucker or I'm gonna leave and your show will be
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:19.480]  destroyed it's like no Tucker Carlson show will be just fine you'll disappear
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.480]  and nobody will know anything about you so I'm not rooting for the fall of
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.840]  Ukraine I don't want anything to do with it I'm not rooting for Ukraine to fall
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:30.600]  I'm not really exactly they're trying to marry us to Ukraine and all that comes
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:36.280]  with it and if Mexico was in a war with Guatemala and the Mexican president said
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:44.240]  the US better join us we'd say you're crazy so I'm extremely put off by what
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:47.720]  Zelensky just said I don't know how any other American could take it any other
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:53.800]  way I don't again I could sit here and watch Ukraine collapse and I could sit
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:58.240]  here and watch Russia take over Ukraine and and I mean the river you were
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:01.720]  thinking of Alex is the the Nipro River which is where Russia is gonna move up
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.280]  to probably give one last chance for Ukraine to resign or step down before
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:10.200]  they maybe even move to the west side of that river and take him out but now
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:14.320]  it's like oh really punk oh really punk you're gonna tell me that if I don't
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:18.560]  support you I'm gonna die I'm gonna go ahead and test that theory I'm gonna go
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:22.240]  ahead and test that theory then and let's see how this goes and it's not gonna
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:25.680]  go so well for you and by the way this video they have on the screen is now
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:30.960]  Serbian ammunition and weapons that are about to be sent to Ukraine as well so
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:35.640]  more arms more cash going in and Zelensky says if you don't support me
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:39.400]  you're gonna die you know what I'm gonna be willing to test that theory and I
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:43.440]  don't think that's going to be the case but I would ask you this Alex as we
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:47.160]  talk about the body double just quickly here what is with the sweatshirt why is
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.560]  I mean clearly there's some reason he's doing that he's being told to wear the
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:54.480]  sweatshirt everywhere why can't what is he like Fidel Castro is wearing a
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:59.440]  military uniform 30 years after 50 years after he took over Cuba it's it's a
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:03.800]  dictator thing it's like I'm a war leader I'm a combat soldier even though
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:09.040]  the Russians you know for six seven months haven't even targeted Kiev they
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:12.080]  only turned on the air raid sirens and Biden was there to make it look dangerous
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:16.080]  and so it's the same thing he's strutting around a military outfit so
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:20.160]  everybody can just fawn over him but when in reality he wears leather
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:24.240]  outfits and high heels and grab his men's butts on national TV and the report
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.240]  is does a lot more than that yeah it's not a bad thing I'm not judging him that
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:34.160]  he's a gay porn star the point is is that he's compromised and and you know the
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:39.560]  word is that he was basically a homosexual sex opera like Macron so these
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:43.200]  are the guys they have compromised people they control will be right back with
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:58.040]  that idiocracy clip I promise to play and more info wars.com stay with us

[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:24.800]  the hard work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really

[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:57.400]  action and went to infowarstore.com our funding process will be over please take
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:33:03.520]  action now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's
[02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:06.760]  Alex Jones
[02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:28.240]  you are listening to an info wars dot-com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:34.160]  so there are three major power blocks in the world there's the Anglo-American
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:37.760]  establishment the Chai Khoms and the Russians the power goes
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:42.280]  Anglo-American establishment the New World Order Chai Khoms system that's
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:45.720]  allied with that but that's breaking up and then the Russians because they have
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:51.080]  nuclear weapons are a distant third when it comes to real power but who wants the
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:56.360]  power the power is a millstone around your neck and so they need dumbed down
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:00.320]  people that they can control dumbed down people that don't know what's going on
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:04.360]  but if people again are aware of the globalists their plan that it's bad for
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.200]  everybody it's game over and I keep harping on that because you're seeing
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:12.800]  and I covered it last night with Owen when we co-hosted the Sunday show that
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:21.560]  there's too many people to mention here I mean you have the major South
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:27.560]  American leader in El Salvador who's only been in a year who is going out and
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.080]  arresting all the violent MS-13 gang members who are convicted already in
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:35.960]  their members of the gang they're getting them and their crime rates gone down
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:41.520]  like 95% and they're stabilizing the nation and he's been praising in full
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:44.320]  wars and he's been promoting in full wars and he's been retweeting it and
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.000]  you've got Woody Harrelson coming out and saying the vaccine you know cartel
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  took over and we're slaves to it it's a fraud on Saturday Night Live you know he
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.160]  wasn't authorized to do that it's that spirit of resistance that we're seeing
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:01.480]  everywhere that is gonna make more people come over to our side very quickly
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:04.760]  which is happening which is the chain reaction so we're in the process of
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:10.360]  winning it's going our way massively massively right now but I want to play a
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:14.880]  clip from Russia with love first second James Bond movie based on Ian Fleming
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.120]  OSS MI6 book about how there's this tiny criminal group that has Russians
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:25.240]  working for it and people in the UK and the US working for it inside the
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:29.680]  agencies that are manipulating Russia and America into a war for profit and
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:35.120]  control well that's a microcosm of what really goes on and what did Ian Fleming
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:41.200]  tell you in his books specter wants to be populated specter wants to use a
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.040]  bio weapon or a nuclear war to be populated he's telling you about the
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:49.760]  Bilderberg group he's telling you about real organizations in fact three James
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:53.040]  Bond movies ago like I don't know six seven eight years ago it's the last one
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:36:00.880]  I watched I guess I watched one about bio weapons too but the latest one but the
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:05.640]  company that specter owns is the name of George Soros's company and they admitted
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:10.440]  later that MI6 helped write the script and it's George Soros so they love
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:15.120]  telling you what they're doing and again there's two fish they release an
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:19.160]  attack to kill each other one dies the others almost dead specter comes in and
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:23.720]  takes over that's the model I know most elicitors get it but for new listers
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:28.040]  don't understand that's the first level of understanding this is levels of
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:32.040]  progression not what happens when you class two groups but what comes out of
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:35.480]  that senses there's a club
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:43.960]  Xiaomi's fighting fish fascinating creatures brave but of the whole stupid
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:54.160]  yes except for the occasional one such as we have here let's the other two fight
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:58.000]  he waits
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:08.080]  waits until the sublime is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself and then
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:16.720]  like specter he strikes I find the parallel music our organization did
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:21.320]  not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement number
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:29.960]  three come in Cronstein sit down number three while we listen to what number
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:34.760]  five is devised for us I hope Cronstein's efforts as director of planning
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:40.320]  will continue to be as successful as his chess they will be according to your
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.600]  instructions I've planned for specter to steal from the Russians their new
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:49.400]  lector decoding machine for this we need the services of a female member of the
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:55.880]  Russian cryptograph section in Turkey and the help of the British secret that's
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:59.480]  good and so it's just how they are playing the Russians in America over each
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:03.360]  other this is how it really works okay let's start thinking high-level and it's
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:06.280]  over for the new world order it's simple it's not even hard to do just get to
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.880]  their level how they're manipulating things stop looking at things two
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:11.800]  dimensionally or one dimensionally and it's game over but you got to know
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:15.000]  history you got to care you got to be engaged you got to be involved you don't
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.640]  need to know the football scores the baseball scores you didn't know this
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:24.120]  information that's what we covered so I'm talking about the fact that there's
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:27.600]  been a chain reaction it's everywhere I can't go over all the examples there's
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:33.040]  new ones every a few hours of prominent people other people are hailing Satan
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:36.480]  hailing pedophilia to say I'm with a new world order I'm against humanity others
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:39.760]  are saying I'm against the new world order and Woody Harrelson goes in there
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:44.200]  they're now admitting this just like Dave Chappelle when he talked about
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:48.320]  censorship in Hollywood and said what he wanted to he'll be banned off Saturday
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:52.040]  live now he doesn't care he went and told the truth here's part of the monologue
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:58.400]  exposing what really happened okay okay so the movie goes like this the biggest
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:03.720]  drug cartels in the world get together and buy up all the media and all the
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:08.320]  politicians and force all the people in the world to stay locked in their homes
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:14.160]  and people can only come out if they take the cartels drugs and keep taking
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:20.120]  them over and over I threw the script away I mean who is gonna believe that
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:27.520]  crazy idea yeah who would believe that but they had censorship they had control
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:30.440]  they thought to get away with it but they didn't get away with it's what I'm
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.880]  telling you is we've not won the war but we do have the momentum now how are
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.240]  they gonna shut that down war new viruses cyber attacks blowing up three
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:47.880]  Mexican oil refineries that supply up to 15% of the US's oil any given day I
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:54.040]  mean it's on folks they're killing us with a thousand a thousand cuts and and
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:40:00.600]  again hoping through the idiocracy debt with the two plus two equals five math
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:04.800]  and the fuzzy learning and and the banning of books all this we're so
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:08.400]  ignorant they can roll over us I'll enjoy your take on that before I play the
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:16.440]  city opposite you know Alex I am glad that I grew up as an athlete because it
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:20.520]  taught me a life lesson that I think people don't really understand and
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:26.280]  there's a famous song by Eminem when when you're in the moment but there's a
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:31.320]  recognition of the moment and then there's the realization that this is the
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:35.800]  only moment and so why did I stand up during the fake Trump impeachment
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:39.360]  hearing and call out the Democrats for being liars and committing treason and
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:42.800]  the whole thing was a sham because I knew this is the moment I'm never gonna
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:46.680]  be in this moment again this is my one opportunity I've got to take advantage
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:50.560]  or I'm gonna lose like in a basketball game there's two seconds left on the
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:54.800]  clock you have to shoot the ball or it's game over you lose you better shoot
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:01.800]  that ball so more Americans I think are realizing this now Alex and I think
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:06.480]  that's what I see from Woody Harrelson there is he knows I've got one moment I'm
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:10.240]  hosting Saturday Night Live millions of people are tuned into this right now I've
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.880]  got the whole crew here live audience and of course he's a acting legend he's
[02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:21.160]  got a great charisma personality and so he can use that in kind of a soft
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:25.040]  delivery of the message but then the that's a perfect that's a perfect
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:30.040]  analogy because people don't know you weren't indicted for January 6th you were
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:35.800]  indicted for being at the Capitol not in and on January 6th for violating an
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:41.440]  order that you not be in the Capitol after they deferred their charges against
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:46.640]  you for protesting Trump's wrongful first impeachment exactly I didn't tell you
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:49.720]  going there and disrupt it you didn't disrupt it it was a fraud you heard it
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:53.320]  you stood up you manned up you did a great job you pointed out this is all
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.000]  fraud because it was the right thing to do and exactly in that moment you
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:02.600]  decided to take action you didn't choke you did the right thing as the man in
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:06.040]  the arena that's why I love you on well and that's why I think what Woody
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:09.560]  Harrelson did was so important he realized you know what I may never get
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:14.320]  another chance to host SNL I may never get another opportunity for a platform
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:17.440]  like this to put out a truth that everybody knows is going on but in a
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.760]  way that is consumable and palatable so I'm gonna go ahead and do it and he did
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:25.360]  it and of course you know nobody really watches Saturday Night Live anymore
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:30.440]  Alex but I'll tell you what everybody saw that clip didn't they well I'm gonna
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.800]  be very very clear about this I've known Willie here Willie Harrelson 16 18 years
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.920]  whatever since like 2005 we're friends we find out quite a bit but my point is
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:45.160]  is that he knew all this back then why is he doing it now because he knows we're
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:48.600]  two minutes to midnight hellward 90 seconds from midnight work 10 seconds he
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:52.840]  knows this is do or die your damn right Owen we'll come right back for the
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:57.720]  idiocracy clip and more info wars.com stay with us viewers

[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:53.640]  tomorrow and I'm gonna be hosting from the start of the show tomorrow I'm gonna
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:49:00.680]  really talk about this Canada considers expanding its assistant
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:06.000]  suicide law to include minors even without parental consent now they said
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:11.960]  about a year ago they were gonna do that and and they are the test case in the
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:17.320]  hemisphere of North America or or or in you know in this area of the United
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.480]  States of Canada just like China's the test case in Asia folks they're now
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:25.040]  telling people commit suicide they're pushing it to assess suicide they'll
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:28.240]  say we'll give you money for a year to go on trips and have fun the government's
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:31.920]  gonna kill you in a year and it's happening now the same left that doesn't
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.760]  want to kill convicted murderers that murder children in Canada in the US is
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:40.920]  saying we're gonna let kids that are seven eight years old get rid of parental
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:44.520]  consent and say they're depressed and then the state's gonna kill children
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:50.240]  without parental consent I mean this is beyond evil this is beyond any social
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:55.640]  Rubicon and and it's it's Canada doing it Canada has been taken over Tara
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:59.640]  Carlson was right a month ago and he said we deliberate Canada militarily he
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:02.480]  was saying liberate Ukraine what about we liberate Canada he wasn't saying
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:06.320]  seriously go in military he was saying it should be culturally liberated
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:09.560]  Canadians have to realize they have been taken over by a real tyranny and they've
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:13.920]  rejected Rado only got 30% of the vote in last election but parliamentary system
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.920]  a minority vote can still get into the power structure by buying off the other
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:23.480]  little factions and then override the majority and the common sense speaking
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:26.920]  common sense again if we're smart if we're informed they can't win if we're
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.600]  dumbed down people can't understand what's happening so here's a clip from
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:37.440]  the film the great film with Mike judge idiocracy basically boiling us down
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:41.760]  because the globals are trying to sterilize and trying to get people with
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:44.640]  higher accused not to have kids that's the companies are targeting with the
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:53.440]  poison shots and more here it is as the 21st century began human evolution was
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:59.640]  at a turning point natural selection the process by which the strongest the
[02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:04.800]  smartest the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest a process
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:10.360]  which had once favored the noblest traits of man now began to favor different
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:15.320]  traits most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more
[02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:21.280]  civilized and more intelligent but his time went on things seem to be heading
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:27.840]  in the opposite direction a dumbing down how did this happen evolution does
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:32.480]  not necessarily reward intelligence with no natural predators to thin the
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:37.400]  herd it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most and left the
[02:51:37.400 --> 02:51:44.480]  intelligent to become an endangered species having kids is such an important
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:49.000]  decision we're just waiting for the right time it's not something you want to
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:53.240]  rush into obviously no way
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:52:10.320]  there's no way we could have a child now not with the market the way it is no
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:28.800]  that just wouldn't make any sense well we finally decided to have children and
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:35.400]  I'm not pointing fingers but it's not going well and this is helping I'm just
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:39.120]  saying that before I have in vitro maybe you should be willing to always me
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:52.400]  right now it's not my sperm count
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:56.640]  cleavon is lucky to be alive he attempted to jump a jet ski from a lake
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:53:00.840]  into a swimming pool and impaled his crotch on an iron gate but thanks to
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:04.480]  recent advances in stem cell research and the fine work of doctors crinsky and
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:09.760]  alt-schuler cleavon should regain full reproductive function
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:19.400]  unfortunately Trevor passed away from a heart attack while masturbating to
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:24.800]  produce sperm for artificial insemination but I have some eggs frozen so
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:37.400]  just as soon as the right guy comes along though few if any seem to notice
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:44.480]  but in the year 2005 in a military base just outside of Washington DC the
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:55.280]  simple army librarian was unknowingly about to change the entire course of human history
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:02.200]  well I'm glad we played that clip and I'm not an Austin so it's not their fault
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:07.600]  but I want the intro part about people got dumber and dumber and dumber it's
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:12.440]  it's it's most the clip I want maybe in post have Marcos added in so people can
[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:16.680]  get the full full body of what happened maybe comes before after I forget the
[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:22.560]  exact part of the clip but here's the deal the globalist are financing the
[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:27.880]  poorest dumbest people to live on welfare whether or black white as a
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:31.960]  matter have much kids while they target with their propaganda the smart people
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:34.640]  not their kids it's because the globalists don't want a bunch of smart
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:38.680]  people to deal with they want a bunch of dumb down people to deal with who they
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:42.760]  can then exterminate for fun so when you study their actual operations it's
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:46.840]  it's total control it's total power they're not doing the eugenics to
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:50.960]  empower us and make us better they're doing it to totally control us and then
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:54.480]  now saying they're gonna euthanize children without criminal consent I
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:55:00.240]  would shroyer this is just after birth abortion well why would they want people
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:05.000]  dumb Alex that's so they can get away with their lies or their false flags and
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:09.160]  this is something that we're gonna be monitoring very closely here because
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:14.840]  it's not a situation of if or when that there will be a false flag in Ukraine to
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:19.760]  try to go to get the war to the next level Alex it's already happened right
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:25.160]  out of the gates Zelensky was bombing eastern Ukraine blaming Russia well now
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:28.240]  everybody knows that it was no Zelensky was bombing them now they just
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:30.560]  celebrated like it's a good thing and they just say oh no it's good that
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:34.240]  Zelensky's killing Ukrainians in eastern Ukraine they first tried to blame that on
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:38.040]  Russia that false flag failed you mentioned the Poland missile earlier
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:42.600]  missile it's Poland they all blame Russia nope once again it was Ukrainian then
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.040]  you have the Nord Stream 2 pipeline they tried to blame that on Russia it
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:51.040]  didn't take and so we all know that that was Biden so this is why they need
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:55.880]  people dumbed down this is why they need info wars off the air so that they can
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:55:59.400]  run these operations run these false flags and then you have no idea what's
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:01.920]  going on the next thing you know you're getting drafted into a war you're
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:06.920]  getting told to take a vaccine you're dead and when you got Hillary Clinton on
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.500]  MSNBC this weekend you played the kind of Lisa Rice interview too but Hillary
[02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:14.200]  Clinton went on MSNBC and said we have to remove Putin he must be stopped
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:17.760]  people of Russia please remove Putin and then mainstream news articles saying
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:21.480]  civil war Russia they're gonna kill Putin he's gonna die with a bullet in his
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:26.560]  back they're mad because their propaganda is not working they're mad
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:29.840]  because we're smarter than they are escalating and that's what happens in a
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:33.920]  war both sides start escalating till it leaves the total destruction well set on
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:37.120]  and you're on fire as usual what are you gonna be covering coming up about an
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:41.160]  hour on the war room 3 p.m. Central we're gonna continue to cover the latest
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:47.760]  propaganda that's trying to lead us into war we've got sadly more bad news for the
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:52.720]  US economy and they can sit here and say greatest economy ever as much as they
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:57.520]  want Alex but people are really feeling the the pinch unfortunately and we've
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:01.200]  got new information now which we already knew this was going on but with this
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:05.280]  story Valerie Jarrett reveals Obama had Trayvon Martin question planted with

[02:59:56.720 --> 03:00:14.680]  so they are ramping up the war propaganda in this year more specifically this
[03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:20.840]  month with Biden and the air raid sirens and then the war speech in Poland
[03:00:20.840 --> 03:00:25.600]  Condoleezza right supporting the war over the weekend on news and then Hillary
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:30.760]  Clinton making this outlandish dangerous statement as well over the
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:37.200]  weekend on television. Ultimately the people closest to Putin those who have
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:42.080]  to deal with him those who he's keeping at the end of 40-foot tables while he
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:48.880]  issues bizarre orders they're the ones who need to act they need to act for the
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:56.240]  good of Russia they need to stop him whether or not this has turned into some
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:01:04.720]  kind of physical or mental problems that he either had or has in some way come
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:10.720]  down with we don't know but his behavior is dangerous and it's dangerous to the
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:17.720]  future of Russia so my hope is that the people who are watching him those who
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:24.440]  get close enough to see in person his behavior which is so erratic that they
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:31.720]  can try to prevent him from doing things that will not only be tragic for
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:38.480]  Ukraine but tragic for Russia too this should be stopped for Russia's sake oh
[03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:43.760]  Hillary Clinton calling for regime change on MSNBC this weekend wow go figure
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:49.680]  who saw that coming Hillary Clinton wanting Putin removed because she cares
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:54.400]  about Russia so much and she talks about Putin's mental state this is the woman
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:59.360]  that had to wear seizure glasses during her 2016 presidential campaign this is
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.440]  the woman who was collapsing just falling over collapsing she had to be
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:11.600]  thrown like a like a raw side of raw liver into a black van at an event
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:16.560]  because she couldn't she passed out this is the party of Joe Biden dementia ridden
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:19.880]  this is the party of John Fetterman who's still up in a hospital his wife
[03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:24.720]  takes him to the hospital and then leaves the country she really cares yes
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:30.280]  telling you about Putin's instabilities and mental problems these are whacked
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:37.560]  out psychos Hillary Clinton is a whacked out psychotic woman and for her to go on
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:41.560]  television and call for regime change and watching the American Left liberals
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:48.920]  that are anti-war just eat it up just eat that war propaganda slop right up is
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:55.440]  really really pathetic and so I just something big is building here here's
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:00.760]  some of the headlines that tell me this as well Russia braces for civil war and
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:04.600]  break up as rebels vote for revolution and then you have kind of Lisa Rice
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:07.480]  saying needs more needs to be done you have Hillary Clinton saying there needs
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:11.040]  to be regime change they're sending another 15 billion to Ukraine they're
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.840]  getting ready for something big Vladimir Putin will die in office or with
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:21.680]  bullets in his back expert predicts Russia's new offensive sends conscripts
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:26.560]  into the teeth of Ukraine's lines US Poland and Germany may hold joint
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:31.040]  maneuvers yet Germany not so excited Poland yeah they're loving it they are
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:35.680]  just I don't know what Poland's they are just war mongers for some reason really
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:41.560]  wanting war with Russia Germany not so much Germany's they got their own
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:45.720]  problems and Biden blew up the Nord Stream pipeline giving them gas so
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:50.120]  they're not too fond of us right now China hasn't yet provided weapons to
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:54.880]  Russia in Ukraine but doing so would be a real mistake says Jake Sullivan oh Jake
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:59.360]  Sullivan now threatening China as well that that little that little nincompoop
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:04.600]  that little pencil-necked freak part of the Biden clown show and awkward
[03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:09.400]  tension lies beneath the West support for Ukraine yeah nobody supports it you've
[03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:14.520]  got the war mongers like Biden and Hillary Clinton and then kind of Lisa
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:18.800]  Rice and George Bush and the Chinese and everybody they love it they love it
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:24.520]  the military industrial complex the weapons manufacturers and contractors
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:30.240]  they're all for it baby but the people we don't want it but I guess we just don't

[03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:26.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Gerald Solente
[03:20:26.280 --> 03:20:39.200]  You're listening to Owen you know waiting to go on the air and talking about the Ukraine war
[03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:50.040]  and what how disgusting it is in this country that peace is prohibited this is
[03:20:50.040 --> 03:20:55.880]  nothing new by the way I mentioned what that and they we did on Owen last week
[03:20:55.880 --> 03:21:05.560]  about how that clown on MSNBC that arrogant Rachel Maddow made fun of the
[03:21:05.560 --> 03:21:13.800]  peace rally we had they had a rally over there in Germany this past weekend
[03:21:13.800 --> 03:21:19.880]  depending on whose numbers you look at some 50,000 people showed up in Berlin
[03:21:19.880 --> 03:21:29.440]  50,000 pro-peace the media denigrated it they called it a niche and what they're
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:38.360]  doing is they're making fun of these rallies when different segments of
[03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:44.360]  society go to them so they condemn that one because quote far right we're there
[03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:51.720]  they did the same thing with the rally in DC people from all different sections
[03:21:51.720 --> 03:21:58.560]  of life were there I could care less what you who you have sex with what you eat
[03:21:58.560 --> 03:22:04.760]  what you believe in whose God is your God I could care less if you're rallying
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:12.280]  for peace that's one issue but what they're doing is rather than having agents
[03:22:12.280 --> 03:22:18.400]  provocateurs they may come later what they so that discourages the whole thing
[03:22:18.400 --> 03:22:22.560]  you know because they do is focus on that what they're doing now is saying
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:31.360]  that all weird people using Rachel Maddow's words are uniting for peace so
[03:22:31.360 --> 03:22:37.200]  they try to do the same thing in Germany and the leaders of it to women said you
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:43.160]  know don't give us that baloney this is about peace but think about it we're
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:51.200]  about 84 million people in Germany and 50,000 or so showed up for the rally you
[03:22:51.200 --> 03:23:00.360]  got 332 million in America between two to four thousand showed up at the rally
[03:23:00.360 --> 03:23:07.480]  the peace rally in DC the week ago Sunday shows you the spirit of this
[03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:10.040]  country
[03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:21.880]  332 million people if you get a million people it's a big deal I gotta tell you
[03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:28.160]  man as an older cat I'm glad I'm old this is not my kind of America and my
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:32.680]  generation what a bunch of hypocrites so many of them are you know they were
[03:23:32.680 --> 03:23:37.280]  protesting the Vietnam War because we were all getting drafted no draft no
[03:23:37.280 --> 03:23:43.440]  protest and now being that America is so blimped up you know there are enough
[03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:47.280]  soldiers to fight anymore so these are you have to have the drafted not gonna
[03:23:47.280 --> 03:23:52.360]  get enough people what a what a this country has gone down so bad so fast
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:24:03.160]  it's it's just disgusting that there's no push for peace shows you how low it's
[03:24:03.160 --> 03:24:09.480]  gone and I want to keep picking up where Owen left off in reading those
[03:24:09.480 --> 03:24:13.200]  headlines and again we didn't talk about this we didn't talk before we got on
[03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:17.760]  the air anything I just picked up from where he's going talking about how these
[03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:23.200]  headlines are denouncing Russia and Putin without providing another side of
[03:24:23.200 --> 03:24:29.640]  the story this is from February 8th Wall Street Journal Russia throws soldiers

[03:33:42.880 --> 03:33:47.640]  the cover of the Trends Journal magazine by the way a little over a year ago
[03:33:47.640 --> 03:33:56.600]  February 22nd of last year from COVID war the Ukraine war to World War and I
[03:33:56.600 --> 03:34:02.240]  was thinking of the the three things that destroyed America in my lifetime
[03:34:02.240 --> 03:34:13.000]  number one after the Vietnam War was the whole fear of AIDS I mean I grew up at
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:21.080]  the time of sex drugs and rock and roll man wild times it was loose and then
[03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:28.080]  Fauci the Fauci freak started that lie now straight people weren't dying from
[03:34:28.080 --> 03:34:34.120]  it there was a reason why yeah and drug people drugged out with getting it but
[03:34:34.120 --> 03:34:41.640]  fear changed everything changed everything number two the war on terror
[03:34:41.640 --> 03:34:48.920]  once upon a time it used to be fun to fly yeah not anymore I flew down to DC
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:52.920]  you know I guess I won't go through those electronic things I guess I get
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:58.240]  felt up you know yeah come on grow up wait what is this stuff and how many
[03:34:58.240 --> 03:35:03.080]  people having all this TSA crap how many people have they caught and then they'll
[03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:08.280]  baloney about the shoe bomber that was a hoax as well the underwear bomber you
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:13.520]  know the upper you know what bomber that was number two and then you know it
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:16.440]  once upon a time when you went as an office building just walked in you
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:21.000]  know people checking any of that stuff became a whole different world with the
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:29.520]  with the war on terror homeland security what are they secured what homeland
[03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:38.240]  security well coming over the border in droves what are you securing and then
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:48.320]  the COVID war AIDS war on terror and COVID war two of them brought to you by
[03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:54.920]  that mentally arrogant little piece of scum Fauci the COVID war and the AIDS
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:36:04.760]  war yep life has changed so dramatically with this with this COVID
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:11.840]  streets up here dead dead at night just be alive just go to Woodstock 15 minutes
[03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:18.560]  away from here but 10 30 at night dead bands used to be playing everywhere but
[03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:28.200]  gone hardly here and the music by the way today what a joke from ragtime to
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:37.280]  swing the R&B to rock and roll to Motown to no town it's just one big rap life
[03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:40.760]  liberty in a pursuit of happiness hell with you what are you talking about
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:45.280]  we're Americans we're political politicians life liberty and pursuit
[03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:51.000]  happiness isn't allowed so anyway that's what's changed my life so much in my
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:37:02.920]  lifetime that these things are terrible I was talking about the rally in Berlin
[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:10.120]  and how it was negated from the beginning Berlin readies for quote naïve
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:16.320]  Ukraine peace rally this is from DW organizers of the rebellion for peace
[03:37:16.320 --> 03:37:21.280]  protests have been criticized for playing into Russian president of Vladimir
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:26.760]  Putin's hands hey what did you what did you read the crap from Rachel Maddow she
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:30.520]  said the same thing what are you what what are the government feeding in this
[03:37:30.520 --> 03:37:38.240]  crap far-right groups have told their supporters to show up prompting a strong
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:45.920]  police presence yeah they're protesting the war how dare they how dare they how
[03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:58.600]  dare you protest war that's the new Western way yep and then
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:06.120]  Germans Chancellor Olaf Schultz told ZDF this week that he did not share the
[03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:12.800]  conviction in a peace manifesto yeah hi hello there Olaf oh yeah the Germans
[03:38:12.800 --> 03:38:19.080]  that killed 25 million Russians in World War two Operation Barbarossa oh you
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:23.200]  you're that German guy who's sending them weapons now to keep killing Russians
[03:38:23.200 --> 03:38:28.400]  leopard tanks oh yeah right okay let's see what he has to say Olaf hey Olaf
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:31.840]  why don't you go lead the charge again anybody that wants to support the
[03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:39.360]  Ukraine war get put your military drag on take your money and go fight or shut
[03:38:39.360 --> 03:38:46.080]  up the Russian president currently accepts only one form of negotiation
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:56.800]  namely unconditional surrender allowing him to push through all his goals yep so
[03:38:56.800 --> 03:39:14.280]  no need for peace and the green party yeah green what green they told ARD's
[03:39:14.280 --> 03:39:18.840]  focal point TV that the rally organizers are trying to sell something as
[03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:24.760]  peace that is quote an imperialist dictator was imposing on Europe which
[03:39:24.760 --> 03:39:29.600]  would be an invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade other
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:35.440]  countries a total lie the same lie they said with Vietnam if we don't stop those
[03:39:35.440 --> 03:39:44.560]  commies in Vietnam they'll invade other countries so shove it shove it green
[03:39:44.560 --> 03:39:54.000]  party piece of clown you ready the center left social Democrats SPD said
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:40:01.600]  FUC and the socialist left party also refused to participate is that great no
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:06.200]  peace allowed you know why because their pieces of crap the arrogant pieces of
[03:40:06.200 --> 03:40:12.800]  crap selling lies in hysteria this war would have been over eight months ago if
[03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:16.680]  the United States in Europe didn't keep bledding the killing fields with more
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:24.280]  weapons so I want to move on to the economy before we take a break the
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:28.080]  markets are up pretty strong today and last time I looked they're only up like
[03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:34.240]  30 something points this is very simple what's going to go on this thing is
[03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:41.840]  going down big it's going down hot and it's going down fast in about a month
[03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:47.000]  less than a month the Fed's going to come out again and say how much they're
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:53.160]  going to raise interest rates this is a very simple equation the higher
[03:40:53.160 --> 03:41:02.440]  interest rates go the deeper the economy falls period paragraph this
[03:41:02.440 --> 03:41:06.640]  thing's going to go down big because it was all artificially juiced up with fake
[03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:12.120]  money the trillions of unprecedented dollars pumped in to fight the COVID
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:17.640]  war the United States and the government the numbers range between six and eight
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:25.480]  trillion zero interest rate policy stay home don't go to work it's free money
[03:41:25.480 --> 03:41:32.560]  it's free money don't shut your mouth go on I want officially boosted it up
[03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:38.480]  interest rates at zero created a fake housing market where's the housing market
[03:41:38.480 --> 03:41:45.360]  going it's gonna be a lot worse in another sector than housing and we get
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:50.200]  back we're gonna talk about it but before we get back I really want to dry

[03:49:53.680 --> 03:50:02.880]  paper of record 23rd of February. Biden bolsters NATO alliances on east flank
[03:50:02.880 --> 03:50:12.120]  a number one no NATO I don't want to be a NATO ain't my trip NATO was done quote
[03:50:12.120 --> 03:50:18.440]  to fight the Soviet Union that thing is long gone I'm an American I believe in
[03:50:18.440 --> 03:50:22.040]  the founding fathers no foreign entanglements read the speeches from
[03:50:22.040 --> 03:50:30.280]  Madison and Washington as I do so save it man no need for NATO but anyway they
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:37.600]  go on to write this this piece of garbage here total lie with the anniversary
[03:50:37.600 --> 03:50:41.440]  of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine approaching this is day before Mr. Biden
[03:50:41.440 --> 03:50:46.480]  met more sore with leaders from NATO's eastern flank acknowledging that quote
[03:50:46.480 --> 03:50:51.480]  you know better than anyone what's at stake in this conflict not just for
[03:50:51.480 --> 03:50:56.680]  Ukraine but for freedom and democracies throughout Europe and around the world
[03:50:56.680 --> 03:51:02.960]  total BS the total lie selling the domino theory if we don't stop those
[03:51:02.960 --> 03:51:07.360]  commies in Vietnam before you know it those dominoes be falling all across
[03:51:07.360 --> 03:51:11.800]  Asia and they'll hit the shores of California and I'm not making that up
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:17.960]  and by the way when I was a young guy in my late teens and early 20s I believed
[03:51:17.960 --> 03:51:22.800]  in the lies that they were selling I believed in the Vietnam war I just
[03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:29.400]  wanted to go because I don't want to get shot but I believed it then they go on
[03:51:29.400 --> 03:51:40.840]  to quote the arrogant Biden quote the idea that over 100,000 forces would
[03:51:40.840 --> 03:51:49.760]  invade another country since World War two nothing like that has happened
[03:51:49.760 --> 03:51:59.760]  huh oh Biden the Joe Biden that got a three or four draft deferments in
[03:51:59.760 --> 03:52:07.760]  Vietnam nothing like that never happened how about going back to 1969 and
[03:52:07.760 --> 03:52:11.920]  maybe you're not good at math I'm not very good at it but the war ended in
[03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:22.920]  1945 1969 is after World War two and there were over 500,000 American boys
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:29.400]  that were drafted into the service that was sent into Vietnam so Biden you're
[03:52:29.400 --> 03:52:35.560]  full of baloney the idea that over 100,000 forces would invade another
[03:52:35.560 --> 03:52:42.160]  country since World War two nothing like that happened wrong it happened it
[03:52:42.160 --> 03:52:49.960]  happened in Vietnam it happened in Vietnam you got it oh and how many
[03:52:49.960 --> 03:52:56.640]  troops in America bring into Afghanistan I don't know the number of fans but I
[03:52:56.640 --> 03:53:03.120]  think it's like 135,000 but I'm out stay away from that one I stand Vietnam
[03:53:03.120 --> 03:53:09.600]  does the media say Biden's wrong nope the next line is Mr. Putin offered a
[03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:15.160]  starkly different message saying that he was restoring Russia's to its rightful
[03:53:15.160 --> 03:53:20.360]  place and reassembling territories he contends are part of the Russian
[03:53:20.360 --> 03:53:25.200]  Empire he never contended they were part of the Russian Empire he contended that
[03:53:25.200 --> 03:53:32.160]  the people in the Donbass region did not support the military coup launched by
[03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:38.520]  the United States in 2014 total propaganda and that's why you subscribe
[03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:50.040]  to the Trends Journal or and or Infowars so now you're saying Ukraine is saying
[03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:57.600]  Linske's saying that Russia is going to attack Crimea and Victoria Newland who
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:02.160]  passed out cookies and stuff cake and bread at the night and during the
[03:54:02.160 --> 03:54:12.840]  revolution going on over there she supports it yep Russia's won repeatedly
[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:19.600]  that Kiev is plotting an assault on Crimea Russian president former president
[03:54:19.600 --> 03:54:25.160]  Dmitry Medvedev who's now deputy chair of the Security Council said that an
[03:54:25.160 --> 03:54:30.600]  attack on Crimea would be interpreted as a direct attack on the country itself
[03:54:30.600 --> 03:54:40.520]  and quote would be met with inevitable retaliation using weapons of any kind
[03:54:40.520 --> 03:54:57.360]  and China is uniting with Russia and saying that clinging to the Cold War
[03:54:57.360 --> 03:55:02.200]  mentality leads to antagonism and confrontation ministry spokesman Wang
[03:55:02.200 --> 03:55:07.720]  Wanben told reporters that a briefing in Beijing the end of the Cold War more
[03:55:07.720 --> 03:55:12.040]  than three decades ago doesn't mean the end of zero-sum thinking and the Cold
[03:55:12.040 --> 03:55:17.200]  War mentality the Berlin world's torn down yet defensive ideology and
[03:55:17.200 --> 03:55:26.720]  prejudices still stand here Wang noted that NATO which was formed in 1949 to
[03:55:26.720 --> 03:55:31.160]  provide collective security against the Soviet Union continues to exist over
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:36.880]  three decades after the USSR's collapse the Western military block quote
[03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:42.800]  even constantly seeks to reach beyond its traditional defense zone and scope and
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:49.160]  stoke tensions and create troubles in the Asia-Pacific she said yep you mean
[03:55:49.160 --> 03:55:55.040]  like and how about Libya and Iraq and now the United States is opening up four
[03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:59.800]  more bases in the Philippines oh we're all so concerned I mean I don't know I
[03:55:59.800 --> 03:56:07.240]  don't think I would know what to do if China took over Taiwan again which by
[03:56:07.240 --> 03:56:14.800]  the way it's all agreed that Taiwan is a part of China and this stuff's been
[03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:21.400]  going on what since the Ming dynasty so here we are we're in a very very
[03:56:21.400 --> 03:56:29.200]  difficult situation financially morally mentally and spiritually so here's the
