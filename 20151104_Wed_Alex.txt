[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Big Show. Big Brother.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:09.000 --> 00:12.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  We've got a special report on Barack Obama we're about to air that's very important.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  And the secret bypass he's engaged in to bring in the illegals part of a larger globalist plan.
[00:33.000 --> 00:41.000]  Then when we come back, the economic news, the geopolitical news, the political news is all incredibly important.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  James O'Keefe is back with a new undercover video where the college again discovers pocket constitutions
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  and is assuring people that they'll shred the evil immediately.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  And they're so sorry for the hate crime.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  Camille Paglia says that transgender mania is a symptom of a West cultural collapse and more.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  It's all coming up. But here's John Bowne's latest report.
[01:03.000 --> 01:12.000]  Mushrooming numbers of displaced people across the globe have now reached levels higher than at any time in recorded history.
[01:12.000 --> 01:21.000]  The New York Times reports the United Nations claims that nearly 60 million people have been driven from their homes by war and persecution.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  An unprecedented global exodus that has burdened fragile countries with waves of newcomers
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  and littered deserts and seas with the bodies of those who died trying to reach safety.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  Europe is being transformed overnight by the sovereign decimating socialist policies spearheaded
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  by the EU immigration invasion leading German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  Merkel recently bent to the wave of immigration critics when she voiced support for transit zones
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  that would serve to send refugees from safe countries of origin packing.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  Of course, the damage has already been done to many parts of Europe.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  For example, the small village of Sumte, Germany, population 102 is expected to take in 750 refugees,
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  a metaphor for the transformative collision course now underway.
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.000]  Meanwhile, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbin is attributing the source of the soft invasion of cultural devastation
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  to billionaire George Soros and his circle of activists.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  Bloomberg reports Soros fired back claiming Prime Minister Orbin treats the protection of national borders as the objective
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  and the refugees as an obstacle.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  Soros said, our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.
[02:39.000 --> 02:47.000]  Back in the United States, President Obama, a key member of Soros' activist circle, has been quietly pursuing a four-option plan
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  to allow work permits to illegals.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  Regardless of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals injunction in order to review the constitutionality of Obama's DHS
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  enforcement nullification initiatives, the Hill reports a leaked memo reveals the first option as providing EADs
[03:04.000 --> 03:12.000]  or Employment Authorization Documents or work permits to all individuals living in the United States,
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  including illegal aliens, visa overstayers and H1B guest workers, while option four provides EADs only to those
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  on certain unexpired non-immigration visas.
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  Giving EADs to any of the covered individuals, however, is in direct violation of Congress's Immigration and Nationality Act
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  and works to dramatically subvert our carefully wrought visa system.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  These plans to issue work permits to DAPA and expanded DACA programs were challenged by 26 states
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  and frozen by Texas federal judge Andrew Hainan, but that isn't stopping Obama, who has a phone in a pen.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  A president held bent on awarding 12 million people that violated our immigration laws
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  and introduced waves of criminal activity into the United States, similar to the skyrocketing crime-laden hidden hell pit
[04:03.000 --> 04:10.000]  over in Europe, a carefully executed, media-biased, sovereign-shocking ocean of non-naturalized immigrants
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  with zero knowledge of the laws and culture of the new lands they are now inhabiting, demanding to be met
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  with the promise of a new life that doesn't exist.
[04:19.000 --> 04:27.000]  The cloward-piven strategy to break the back of the welfare system in turn forcing a new world-ordered-led socialist regime
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  offering a guaranteed annual income is accelerating.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  2016 is shaping up to be the year President Obama completely takes the gloves off,
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  destroying the sovereignty and ignoring the checks and balances of our government with impunity,
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  while his European counterparts lead the way.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  That's right, it's all in the article. Illinois EPA, pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels,
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.000]  and in it you could find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000]  Here's step two. Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including but not limited to owners and operators
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  of rented or leased residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes, commercial haulers,
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  and other commercial, industrial, agricultural, and government operations are entities.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  How are you going to figure that out?
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  Step nine. The transfer and ultimate disposition of pumpkins received at the collection event must comply with the agency's approval,
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  including all conditions contained in the approval. Do you have your TPS report cover sheet?
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  Did you see the memo about this?
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  If you don't, then you cannot compost pumpkins in Illinois.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Okay.
[05:56.000 --> 06:21.000]  That's all for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  Brain Force is here.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  I'm staring at the computer all day working doing good. You're still damaging your brain.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  It doesn't have stimulants. It doesn't have garbage in it.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[06:49.000 --> 06:58.000]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  I am Mark Hillby. I will reveal this line, line, line.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  Introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  and essential nutrients that taste great.
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  Obtain your child ease today at InfowarsLife.com.
[07:54.000 --> 08:10.000]  That's child ease exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[08:10.000 --> 08:20.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  I tend to say this three or four times a week when the show starts, but it's true.
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  The news just gets more intense, more revealing, more insane, more over the top,
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  and then on the streets I see a mirror of the craziness.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  So it's not just media trying to be sensational.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  So many times there'll be incredible reports of just over-the-top stuff happening,
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  but if it's what the establishment wants, they'll report it like it's a good thing.
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  Child taken from parents because parents wouldn't let seven-year-old wear a dress,
[08:56.000 --> 09:05.000]  stuff like that, or school gives children inoculations without parents' consent,
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  or school watches children at home on their laptops.
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  No one gets in trouble, and today it is just completely over-the-top.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  There's a Infowars.com story that's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  Verizon begins scanning and censoring customer emails with political correctness.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  They read your emails with computers, NSA-style keyword,
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  and then it won't let you send words that are politically incorrect
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  or things it considers to be illegal.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  This is the government systems interface with major phone company
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  controlling what you say and what you do.
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  And remember, just last week, the Chinese government Facebook and others came out and said,
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  they were looking at censoring your post in live time,
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  not even letting you post it to be removed.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  Huge news Infowars.com, and it ties in with this Forbes article.
[10:13.000 --> 10:22.000]  Microsoft admits Windows 10 automatic spying cannot be stopped,
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  and they just admit everything you do is being spied on.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  We're going to cover that.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  This is literally two articles out of more than 150 stories I have,
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  each one more insane than the next, each one more revealing than the next.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  James O'Keefe is back with the Veritas project.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  We're going to play this in just a few minutes.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  Not one, but two prestigious colleges caught seeing shred the Constitution
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  and acting like they found a 40-foot cobra in the school
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.000]  and then actually shredding the document.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  We posted this yesterday on Infowars.com.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  World End Daily's got their own article out today.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  College caught shredding Constitution and undercover video.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  And the reason O'Keefe did this is obviously all over the country.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  Libertarian conservative groups try to hand out constitutions, free ones,
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  and they get arrested in many cases.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  And we have that famous video from Squad Car in Virginia
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  from the year 2000 in my film Road to Tyranny.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  We put like six, seven minutes of it in the film, a three-hour film,
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  for context, and there's a checkpoint.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  This woman with no criminal record, Navy veteran,
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  they go, we want to search your car.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And she goes, no, you can't do that without a warrant.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  I go, are you looking for a criminal?
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  No, this is just a license check.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  So they take her out of the car, they go in the trunk,
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  and they find a Patriot games.
[11:54.000 --> 12:02.000]  I got a Steve Pacinac slash Tom Clancy movie,
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  and the two state police start hyperventilating
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  like they found a dead baby, a rotten baby.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  They did everything but throw up.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  And they go, we got a Patriot, Patriot.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  And you're watching it and it's like Monty Python, but it's real.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  Then they find one of my videos.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  Police state 2000.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  Then they find a pocket constitution.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  And they start going, it's one of them.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  It's one of them.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  She's with an extremist group.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  Is it like the Klan?
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  And then the one in charge goes,
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  that may be what she's talking about, her rights.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  That may, she might be allowed to have that.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  I mean, whoa, these guys, in my view, probably had ADIQs.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  Maybe, maybe.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  But they, and I'm serious, but they'd been brought in
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  and brainwashed to a level that was just insane.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  I mean, you show them a pocket constitution.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  It's like showing Count Dracula a giant silver cross at high noon.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  I mean, you're talking screaming with fear.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  And a normal person watches this and you're like,
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  and then you see these videos all over the country.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  And again, it's progressive police who've been put through
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  the Soviet style brainwashing.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  Most police know what's going on on this subject
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  and are not going along with it.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  But because for those that are already half awake,
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  being called into a meeting and having the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL,
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  Badmout the Founding Fathers and Badmout the Gadsden Flag
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  and Badmout God Ownership and Badmout Veterans and Christians
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  and Evangelicals, we have all the training manuals.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  We're the ones that break most of them.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  We get sent them by law enforcement, by peace officers,
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  and people didn't used to believe us when we get these documents.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  Now, of course, it's like, yeah, everybody knows that.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  And they sit there with a straight face.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Let me just cover this first for you and all the other news.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  College caught shredding constitution in undercover video.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  James O'Keeffe's latest undercover video shows professors
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  at two prestigious private universities,
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  openly disparaging and in one case, shredding the U.S. Constitution.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  Project Veritas O'Keeffe undercover journalism unit
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  sent a female journalist disguised as a student to Vassar College
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  in New York and to Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  She got comments and commitments from leadership
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  at each to shred the Constitution.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And in the case of Vassar,
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  Project Veritas undercover camera actually captured the shredding.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  Kelly Grabb, assistant director of Equal Opportunity at Vassar College,
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  was captured on video saying,
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  yes, I think we have a shredder in the front office there.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  Do you want to do it with me?
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  And the woman's very excited.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  This is a religious moment to desecrate it.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  The incident unfurls when the undercover PV journalist
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  relates her personal story of being confronted on campus
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  with someone handing out copies of the Constitution.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  Let's play about a minute and a half, the full unedited video
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  of two different colleges foaming at the mouth
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  like they again have seen.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  Well, I described it as a 14-foot cobra, 40-foot cobra.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  I mean, people like a giant snake has come into their office
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  and fanned open its head
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  and things are out dripping with neurotoxin.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  This is mass mental illness.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  This is total breakdown of society.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  But remember, it's not an accident.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Now the controlled left at the top wants to go,
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  this is really screwy.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  This is weird bullcrapness.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  Gee, we're going to try to do something about it.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Our plan is working perfectly.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  These people are total, total Soviets.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  Let's go to the club. Here it is.
[15:59.000 --> 16:08.000]  They were handing the Constitution out on campus.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  I think that this would happen,
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  but I realized that the Constitution is kind of a trigger for me.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  Overall, I see it just as a really oppressive document.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  I mean, I'm scared to walk around campus
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  and see the Constitution.
[16:22.000 --> 16:42.000]  Honestly, can we just like...
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Is there like a shredder or something?
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  I think it might be like super therapeutic to say that.
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  I think I have a shredder in my office there.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  Did you want to do it with me?
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Yeah, I could watch.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  Yeah, okay.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  The Constitution in everyday life causes people pain.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  Is there a shredder or something?
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.000]  A shredder.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  You can hear it.
[17:05.000 --> 17:19.000]  And there she is. She shreds the Constitution,
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  which obviously isn't perfect,
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  but the Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence are even better.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  And they're the best thing ever produced.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Tyrants everywhere hate it.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  That's why they attack it constantly.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  Remember, read the Atlantic article, 28 pages,
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  the coddling of the American mind,
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  they admit that liberals, this is liberals,
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  the top liberal publication probably in the country
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  after New Yorker or the New York Times,
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  this is what the elitists read,
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  admitting that their children and everyone they know
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  are now denouncing them and are control freaks
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  and basically have panic disorders when they see anything.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  Brown paper bags, complex words, any arguments,
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  all they can do is just run around screaming in fear.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  And remember, conservative governors and legislatures
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  in the South are banning the Confederate flag
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  from state houses.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  They're removing the state flags
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  and they are pulling down statues
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  and they are arresting rednecks
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  that drive around obnoxiously with rebel flags
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  and charging them with terrorism in Georgia.
[18:24.000 --> 18:29.000]  15 counts of terrorism for displaying the flag
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  with a straight face,
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  because a bunch of black people are at the park screaming,
[18:33.000 --> 18:39.000]  it's a threat, it's a threat.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  Now, meanwhile, we have a new video out of Salt Lake City,
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  the police say it could be a hate crime
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  and it's these drunk 20-somethings
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  coming out of a Garth Brooks concert
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  and a bunch of black guys come over to them
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  with their little gangster white accomplices
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  and start just beating them up
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  because they have a rebel flag.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  And A, the only people wimpier than these white guys,
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  the only people wimpier than these black guys
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  are the white guys.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  I mean, you talk about that, you talk about wimpy punches
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  and bad kicks, I mean, I don't want to get in fights,
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  but I almost dream of guys like this
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  starting to fight with me.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  I mean, it would just be,
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  I mean, it would be within 30 seconds
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  they'd be crawling for their lives
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  and I mean crawling for their lives.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  I mean, it is just unbelievable
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  to see how wimpy men are today
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  and I mean, the white guys are just the most pathetic wimps
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  I've ever seen.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  The black guys are like 2% less wimpy.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  I mean, this is truly pathetic.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  That'd have been me,
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  your head would have been grounded at concrete so fast,
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  your brains would have been all over the pavement.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  You'd be lucky if you weren't on a respirator
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  for the rest of your life.
[19:56.000 --> 20:21.000]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[20:21.000 --> 20:30.000]  How will I keep my family warm?
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Another concern?
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke,
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  like in times of war.
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  For these answers, go to fortressclothing.com.

[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on David Knight, your host on this fourth hour, November 4th, 2015.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000]  Rob Duel will be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:22.000]  We're going to talk about some of the election results.
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:25.000]  Some communities have removed fluoride from the water.
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  Imagine that.
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  But then, of course, there's some hidden carcinogens that are being put into the water in its place in other places.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  So Rob's going to break down some of those results, break down some of what is in the water still in many areas.
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  I thought it was very interesting to see today this article from Hillary Clinton that's at the top of the Drudge Report,
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:54.000]  that Hillary is stepping up her smear campaign against Bernie and using the traditional weapons of political correctness,
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  calling him essentially a sexist and now implying that he is racist.
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  Yeah, maybe this is where they jump the shark with political correctness.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  You know, this has been the McCarthyism of the left and maybe now that people on the left are seeing how this is being misused against one of their own unjustly.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  Maybe now they'll awaken up and do something about it.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  This is to just remind you of what happened back on October 23rd.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  Clinton took a phrase that Sanders has routinely used in talking about gun violence that, quote, shouting, wouldn't solve the problem.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  Suggested that he had aimed it at her because, you know, when women talk, some people think we're shouting.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  See, that's the chip on the shoulder victim attitude, trying to make yourself look like a victim,
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  trying to make somebody else look like a bully, like a sexist, like a racist.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  And now this is what she's added.
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  She says there are some who say that gun violence is an urban problem.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  Sometimes what they mean by this is a black problem.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:00.000]  No, actually, we mean what we say.
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  That's the other favorite tactic of these people is to put words into your mouth.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  So, you know, first she interprets the fact that people are shouting about that.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000]  Oh, you must mean me because I'm a woman.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  And then when he says, well, it's an urban problem.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  Maybe he said that.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  Maybe he didn't.
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  I don't know.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  Nevertheless, she says, but it's not an urban problem.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  It's not black.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  It's not urban.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  It's a deep, profound challenge to who we are.
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  So, here you go.
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:31.000]  Hillary Clinton coming after Bernie Sanders of all people.
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  You know, here's this guy.
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  I guess she's trying to get to the left of Bernie using political correctness
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  because, you know, that's the ultimate leftist tactic.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  But I think that she's going to jump the shark.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  And I think the other part of this, the other good thing that's going to come out of this presidential campaign
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  is the fact that Donald Trump is tackling this head on
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  and pointing out how stupid it is.
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  Not apologizing about political correctness charges.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  And every time he gets in their face about it, his whole numbers shoot straight up.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  So, yeah, when they come after him for Saturday Night Live,
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  and we got an article at the top of infowars.com about how they're paying people to troll him
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  at the Saturday Night Live performance.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  Yeah, you know, when they do that, that's only going to help Trump.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  So, keep on.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  Go ahead with that.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  Because what we're really seeing here, whether Trump wins or not.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000]  And I'm not a big fan of Trump.
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  I think he's got some good ideas on some issues.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  Of course, the issue is, do you really trust any of these people to follow through on what they're telling you?
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  They run focus groups.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  They run very detailed analysis.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  So, we'll talk about later if we've got time.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  An article talking about neuro politics and how they are really making this into the kind of science that they've used for marketing to us.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  And of course, he's been a very successful marketer.
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  So, don't you think that he and the rest of them know exactly what you want to hear?
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  There you go, neuro politics.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  When campaigns try to read your mind.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  Yeah, they're going to read your mind.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  They're going to tell you exactly what you want to hear.
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  But look, one good thing is, is that he knows, and the rest of us know now,
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  that we are tired of being beaten over the head with this political correctness nonsense.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  Now, I want to take a look to at China, because Alex talked about this a lot earlier in the show.
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  The one child policy of China, how that's not sustainable.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  And about the fact that China is the best example of globalist government with the Rockefellers setting up with Henry Kissinger,
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  bringing them online and the way they have treated their citizens.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  They're a great example of the kind of tyranny we're going to see from a one world government,
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  because they've essentially been put in place by a ruling corporate oligarchy.
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  And we can see how they operate.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  But we're told over and over again, that we have to have CISA.
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:56.000]  We have to have all this cyber security protection, because of threats from China.
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  Okay, yeah, they're doing espionage, so is everybody else.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  We're also told we've got to pass this secret trans-Pacific partnership as a protection against the Chinese trade dominance.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:20.000]  And yet, as Senator Sessions has pointed out, once this is passed, once TPP has passed, there is a transnational committee that can change all the aspects of it.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  They can change every one of the details, which of course, we are now more than four weeks past the point at which they have concluded this,
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  and they still won't show it to us.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  They're waiting for a holiday reveal, I imagine, when people aren't paying any attention.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  But they're telling us that they have to do this to keep China out.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  They can not only change all the terms of the agreement, but they can bring into the agreement anyone that they wish after it is passed.
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  But when we go back and look at the narrative about surveillance, about corporate espionage, about military espionage, and getting military secrets.
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  Look at this article from the New York Times that came out the end of last week.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  US tech giants may blur national security boundaries in their deals with China.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  They point out that one Chinese technology company receives crucial technical guidance from a former People's Liberation Army rear admiral.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  Another one developed the electronics on China's first atomic bomb, a third one sells technology to China's air-to-air missile research academy.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  But these guys have deep ties through these companies to American companies like IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  So they say these cross-border partnerships with American technology companies, they share, they license, they jointly develop advanced technology with Chinese counterparts.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  Then of course, all this technology is being turned over to the Chinese government and other Chinese corporations.
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  That's part of the China price.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  When people looked at China's competitiveness and trade and how they were killing everybody on trade, there's many elements of what they call the China price.
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  One of those elements is stealing technology, is ignoring trade marks, is making counterfeit technology.
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000]  That is what they have mastered there.
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  So when you talk about high-tech defense contractors making alliances with companies that are being run by Chinese military or former military,
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  of course they're transferring technology, but we're supposed to sacrifice everything in this country.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  All of our privacy, all of our money to the national security state for cybersecurity.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  That's precisely the problem.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  And then I want to take a look at this other story that comes from the Chinese radio network, this secret radio network.
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  This was exposed by Reuters towards the end of last week, picked up by multiple news outlets.
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  Beijing's covert radio network airs China-friendly news across Washington and the rest of the world.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:16:00.000]  Now of course, we have Voice of America, we have Radio for Europe, we have Radio Marty, we have all these different propaganda outlets,
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  and of course the Chinese do the same thing.
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  It's just like we have the NSA spying on everybody.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  They've got their spy organizations.
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  It's all this spy versus spy, but we're supposed to get very concerned about this and the Department of Justice as well as the FCC is moving to shut down some of these radio stations
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  because they have laws against foreign ownership.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  They say the foreign ownership has been hidden and so forth and so on.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  Why can't we have an open free competition?
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  People can get all this information on the Internet.
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  Oh, and that's one of the reasons why the FCC is trying to crack down on the Internet, isn't it?
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  They're talking about a global web of 33 stations that everybody is very concerned about.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:49.000]  You know what, I want to talk to you about a global web of a thousand schools, more than 120 of them in America,
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  and they are propagandizing your children on a daily basis.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  It's far more than you would ever get out of a radio station.
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  You can change the radio station, you may not listen to it that much.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:07.000]  Nobody's going to listen to a radio station as much as their children listen to teachers for the entire working day,
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  8 to 10 hours there in these schools.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:12.000]  That's where they're going to be formed.
[03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  That's what education is about.
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  That was the purpose of schools.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:19.000]  Governments know that's the way they can shape the culture.
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:26.000]  They can engineer socially the children, get them at an early age, keep them as long as they can.
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  Give them free college, keep them in through the graduate level so they can continue to mold them,
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  get them in debt so they have to go to work for the government, or they'll be in debt for the rest of their lives.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:42.000]  But when we look at the 33 stations here that are covertly owned by China,
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  and so they're giving information out that is friendly to China,
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  and in particular about this conflict that happened in the South China Sea last week,
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:18:01.000]  wouldn't you be interested if there was a network of 120 American charter schools being run by one secretive Imam,
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  a guy who was thrown out of Turkey in 1999,
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:12.000]  because he was trying to set up a caliphate in Islamic State, as he called it.
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  IS as in ISIS?
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:18.000]  Well now they're here in America, and I went to a documentary.
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:23.000]  We're going to have the documentary filmmaker join us next week for an interview.
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:28.000]  Mark Hall, he did a movie called Killing Ed, and they were looking at charter schools,
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:34.000]  and they took as the worst case example of the abuse of charter schools, this particular network.
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:40.000]  It's a network of Ghoulin schools run by an Islamic fatala Ghoulin.
[03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  This guy, when he was thrown out of Turkey, came to America,
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:51.000]  and he got in with letters of recommendation from the CIA, people who were former ambassadors to Turkey,
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:54.000]  people who had connections with Iran Corporation.
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  Let me read you just a little bit of an Atlantic story that came out in August of 2014.
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  They were looking at this, and again, they were looking at charter schools in general,
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  but these Ghoulin schools in particular, they say Fatala Ghoulin is not known for his openness,
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:14.000]  despite the size of his organization, which is rumored to have between 1 and 8 million adherents.
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  Still very secretive, right?
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  Known informally in Turkey as his met, or the service, they say Ghoulin schools enroll an estimated 2 million students around the globe.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  Now, in Texas for example, there's 33 schools, and they're getting close to $100 million a year.
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  This is a guy in Islamic countries, they openly operate as madrasas.
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  There's accusations and allegations that here in America, they're doing the same thing.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  They're heavily pro-Islamic, they're heavily pro-Turkey, but we're supposed to get concerned at shutdown radio stations,
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  and maybe we should, but we should be even more concerned about the Ghoulin movement of schools
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  and how they're trying to create ISIS here in America with the CIA.
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:04.000]  You lay at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:08.000]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:17.000]  Give yourself peace of mind with supernatural silver.
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:24.000]  Supernatural silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses and fungus.
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  Supernatural silver can be taken internally or used topically to help the body's own immune system fight off disease much more effectively.
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  Supernatural silver has been tested at independent universities and laboratories around the world
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  and has been proven to be safe and highly effective against some of the planet's deadliest pathogens.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:48.000]  There is no better product to have in your home for daily use or emergency preparedness.

[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:10.000]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war. Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  We typically do the same thing. We start with food storage, then we address the need for water, but have you considered heat storage?
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold. Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  How will I keep my family warm? The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:30.000]  The problem with that if you need to be on the move is, you can't take it with you.
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  Another concern, there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel. The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  For these answers, go to fortressclothing.com. Again, fortressclothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:56.000]  If you get stuck in the cold, fortressclothing.com, you'll never be cold again.
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  Before I do, I just want to let you know that at the end of this show, we have a couple of specials that are going to be ending with the show.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  The 25% off the liver cleanse pack that will be ending at the end of this show, the end of this hour.
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  That's the InfoWars Life liver cleanse pack, including the powerful oxygen, colon cleanser, oxy powder, and our liver cleansing formulation, liver shield.
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  And although there will still be a 10% discount on InfoWars Select Food, free shipping, a big savings.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  Free shipping will end today on our line of InfoWars Select Food.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  That's food that is packaged in the U.S. with all U.S.A. ingredients. It's packaged to last 25 years.
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:08.000]  And you can get that in a great deal right now just through the end of this hour.
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  This is a salesman going on for quite some time, but we are ending the free shipping with the end of this show at the end of this hour.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  Now, quickly wrapping up with what I was talking about with Fatala Gulen, this was brought up again, not only by the documentary that I was able to see in a preview a week last Saturday,
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:32.000]  but also because there were more arrests in Turkey.
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:38.000]  Erdogan, the president of Turkey, or his prime minister, I'm not really sure what the office is there.
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  Turkish police have arrested 44 people suspected of having links to an exiled Islamic cleric accused of seeking to overthrow the government.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  And again, seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate, a multinational Islamic caliphate.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:26:02.000]  And this guy, Fatala Gulen, has set up 1,000 schools around the world. He's got over 120 here in America.
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  Just in Texas alone, he's getting $100 million in taxpayer funds in some countries like Tajikistan.
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  At the beginning of the year, they threw them out of the country.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  Tajikistan's Minister of Education and Science announced that he would not extend the agreement that they'd made with the Gulen movement over permission to operate schools in the country since they consider the mission of the schools to be shadowy, shadowy.
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  For the last decade, they say the purposes of the schools have become a hot debate in the Turkish government.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  We continue to see every couple of weeks, 40, 50, 60 people arrested that are part of the government, part of the police, because Erdogan considers them being involved in trying to overthrow that government and set up an Islamic caliphate.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  And these are the people who are setting up subsidized schools in America.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  Encouraged, brought into this country by the CIA, the same people that equipped and trained ISIS in Syria are now equipping and training your children in charter schools in America.
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  That's the bottom line, folks.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  Now, they go on to say that the movement is allegedly involved in unsettling routines around the world where there's dozens of schools owned by the movement.
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  The members of the movement currently accused of attempting to oust the government in Turkey.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  And that was December of last year. Turkish officials have an ongoing struggle with a parallel structure, a term that they use for members of the Gulen movement in key government institutions.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  Let's go to politics.
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  And of course, we have the news break that we've had about Jeb Bush.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  And essentially, it seems like he's about to lose it because he is losing big time.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  Drudge had a headline this morning that Jeb had plummeted to 4% in the latest national poll.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:48.000]  And this is a one from Quinnipiac University.
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  They had essentially Carson and Trump tied.
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:56.000]  Trump had 24%, Carson at 23% tied for first place.
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  Essentially, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz essentially tied at 13 and 14%.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  All the rest of the candidates in that national poll took 3% or less.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  There was also another poll, a take that came up with about 11,000 respondents.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  I'm assuming that's a non-scientific poll, but it shows that Trump increased his lead after the debate and Carson took a huge drop after the last debate.
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  But I want to talk about an article that came out on Monday.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  Trump slams Obama's Syrian plan, but Carson is in favor of the plan because I think it tells us a lot about the American electorate.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:38.000]  Not just about these two candidates.
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  Now, what Trump said was he criticized Obama putting 50 troops in the ground.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  He says you either do it or you don't do it.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  He puts 50 people in.
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:50.000]  He's not serious about this.
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:56.000]  Okay, so Trump is taking a pragmatic approach, but he's still not looking at it constitutionally.
[03:28:56.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  Okay, but even more troubling is what Ben Carson says.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  He said the Syrian plan is a move in the right direction, but it still neglects the role that Russian President Putin is playing in the conflict.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:10.000]  And listen to what he says next.
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:18.000]  My much, much, much bigger plan involves Putin and Iran also said Carson on ABCs this week.
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  Those are the forces that are propping up the Assad regime, even though Putin came in there and said he was going to fight ISIS.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:26.000]  He says he's really fighting the anti-Assad forces.
[03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:34.000]  But look, look, here he is talking tough with Putin, throwing the gauntlet down, escalating the tensions between the two countries.
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  Does he have any concept whatsoever of what we're really going to have with increased and new Cold War?
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:45.000]  And where is the constitutional authority on any of this?
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  Everybody sees the president as a Caesar.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:49.000]  We truly have crossed the Rubicon.
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  They will also be right back.
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:06.000]  You've heard of the U.S. government wasting money on studies like mountain lions on treadmills, shrimp on treadmills, and even the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[03:30:06.000 --> 03:30:09.000]  This latest example of waste comes out of the Illinois EPA.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:15.000]  In fact, I tweeted, state government needs nine-step internal retentive plan to compost pumpkins.
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:16.000]  That's right, it's all in the article.
[03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  Illinois EPA pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels.
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:26.000]  And in it, you could find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[03:30:26.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  Here's step two.
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:34.000]  Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including but not limited to owners and operators of rented or lease residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes.
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:38.000]  Commercial haulers and other commercial, industrial, agricultural and government operations are entities.
[03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:39.000]  How are you going to figure that out?
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:46.000]  Step nine, the transfer and ultimate disposition of pumpkins received at the collection event must comply with the agency's approval, including all conditions contained in the approval.
[03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:49.000]  Do you have your TPS report cover sheet?
[03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.000]  Did you see the memo about this?
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:54.000]  If you don't, then you cannot compost pumpkins in Illinois.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:55.000]  Okay.
[03:30:55.000 --> 03:31:20.000]  Rob, you're reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:52.000]  Good, brother.
[03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:54.000]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:56.000]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:31:56.000 --> 03:32:00.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:05.000]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:17.000]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:22.000]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:34.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:40.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out.
[03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:48.000]  In my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[03:32:48.000 --> 03:32:50.000]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:57.000]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your supermail vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:22.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour of November 4th, 2015.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:30.000]  Joining me in the studio now is Rob Dew, and Rob Dew is going to have some information about the elections that really kind of affect the health of the country.
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  You know, elections really can make a difference.
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:39.000]  I think we get too caught up in the presidential elections and we don't really understand that at the local level, and I want to underscore this again,
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  at the local level, we can do things like get fluoride out of our water.
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  We're going to give you some examples of that that will really make a difference in our lives.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  I think they get us focused on the things that are the most distant, the most far away from us.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  Things that aren't going to really affect our lives, and that the presidential election is a good example of that.
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  But if we get into a war, that's going to affect all of us to a great deal.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  And I just want to go back to this and get Rob's comment on this story from Monday about Carson and Trump commenting on Obama sending 50 troops to Syria.
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  Essentially, Trump is saying, go big or go home.
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:21.000]  And then Carson says, yeah, but my much, much bigger plan.
[03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  I think that's a good idea. We need to send more troops, but I got a bigger plan that involves Putin, okay?
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  I'm going to go to war with them, and I look at that, and Rob, you know, I am just so ashamed that the person that everybody is out there
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  touting as a Christian candidate is this warmonger like this.
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  I remember when Ron Paul was in a debate, a GOP debate, and he quoted the Golden Rule when he was talking about foreign policy.
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  And I mean, he wasn't quoting founding fathers, they reject the Constitution, they reject the principles of a non-interventionist government.
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  He was quoting Jesus to these people, and the GOP, party lawyers, they booed him, they booed him and laughed at him.
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  So when I see Ben Carson, the darling of the Christian wing of the Republican Party saying, oh yeah, send more troops.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  And I got big plans for Putin. It's like, give me a break.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:21.000]  And it makes me angry because I see them envisioning this as becoming Caesar, you know, that we elect a new Caesar every four years.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:29.000]  There's no sense of either one of them saying, well, why don't we go to Congress and make sure that the representatives of the people agree with this.
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  That's the Constitution. We have an article today, America's Non-Representative War Government by Sheldon Richmond.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:43.000]  He points out that back in the 1930s, a congressman, Ludlow, tried to put through an amendment that said, we're not going to go to one, to amend the Constitution,
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:47.000]  saying we're not going to accept even a congressional declaration of war.
[03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:52.000]  We want to have a referendum because it's going to affect all the people, but we've lost the sense of that.
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  We don't think it's going to affect us. Your comments.
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:58.000]  Well, I think what Obama is doing is doing what we did in Vietnam.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  We sent some advisors in that we had to keep expanding and keep making it bigger.
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  People started dying. We got to send more troops.
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  And then all of a sudden we have 50,000 dead soldiers at the end of 10, 15 years.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  It was a long buildup to get to where the Vietnam War finally ended in 74.
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:16.000]  I think they finally pulled people out.
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:17.000]  That's what he's doing.
[03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:21.000]  And what Carson and Trump are saying, they're following the George Bush.
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:25.000]  We're going to shock and I'll go right in and we're going to take it to the evildoers.
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:27.000]  I can wage war better than Obama.
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:32.000]  And we need to be asking the question is, who gets to make that decision?
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  The Constitution says right now that it belongs to Congress.
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  I mean, maybe we shouldn't even leave it at that.
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:41.000]  Maybe it ought to be a direct referendum, but at least follow the Constitution if we're going to go to war.
[03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  Yeah, it's totally ridiculous in this stomping around saying I can outdo the war machine.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  I'm going to do it bigger and better.
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  And what the sad thing is, is that some Americans out there really do think that's the answer, more war.
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  Well, one of them who thinks that it's an answer is Paul Ryan, the guy we just did have an election.
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:02.000]  And unfortunately, we got Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House.
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  And now he's starting to make pronouncements about what he's going to do.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  And he says, I'm a defense hawk, maybe a war hawk, maybe a chicken hawk.
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:12.000]  But yeah, he calls himself a defense hawk.
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  He says that he wants to have a much bigger Navy, big time, he says.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  So yeah, he says, what matters more for defense than one or $2 billion is predictability.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  And we got that with this new raising of the debt ceiling.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  We got this predictability.
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:30.000]  And you know what?
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:35.000]  If he's going to make a much, much bigger Navy, that debt ceiling isn't going to last him for two years.
[03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  It isn't going to last for a single year.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:41.000]  We're going to have more of the same. This is what both parties want.
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:44.000]  But of course, Republicans really push that narrative.
[03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  And one more thing I want to get your reaction to, Rob, Ryan says he will not cut Planned Parenthood.
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:53.000]  He goes on and he talks about, he says, this is with CNN's Dana Bash.
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:56.000]  He says, I think we need to be very clear about what we can and cannot achieve
[03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:01.000]  and not set expectations that we know we can't reach given the constraints of the Constitution.
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  And the new American points this out and says, well, wait a minute, there's nothing in the Constitution about funding Planned Parenthood.
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  So don't talk to me about constraints of the Constitution.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  Then he goes on to say, well, he says, what I mean by this is, so you're going to cut the funding?
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  And he says, well, when I say this, I'm being an opposition party.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.000]  I'm being an effective opposition party.
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  That means that I'm being honest with people upfront about what we can and cannot achieve.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:28.000]  And of course, they're not the opposition party.
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:34.000]  They control both houses of Congress, both the Senate and the House are controlled by Republicans.
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  And they won't stand up to Obama.
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  And that's what you're going to get more of Boehner, exactly, right?
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  And this is a group that lies pretty much about everything that they do in terms of what they say they're for women's health.
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  And yet they provide very few of those women's health services except for abortion,
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  which that seems to be the majority of what they provide.
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  And they do it in low-income areas.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  So it seems to definitely be targeting a lower end of our populations to depopulate, essentially.
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:09.000]  Exactly. He won't even stand up to make that slide of a cut, something that his base desperately wants.
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:12.000]  But of course, he's going to ramp up the military big, big time.
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  You know, when he talks about, well, it's only one or two billion dollars.
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:16.000]  That's what donors like to hear.
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  Donors like to hear you're going to give me more money.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  Exactly. Only that's right.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:23.000]  The military industrial conflicts, he just made them very, very happy.
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  And of course, it was, I mean, decades ago, Senator Everett Dirksen said,
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  well, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real money.
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  And that's the mindset. That was like 50 years ago.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:36.000]  But that was the mindset even then in Washington is far, far worse now.
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  Yeah.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  So tell us about the elections.
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:41.000]  Tell us what happened with some of these, what's going on with the water.
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:44.000]  I want to get to that at the end of this whole piece.
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:47.000]  I've got a whole piece planned and it starts off with this article,
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  Sacramento residents exposed to carcinogen in their drinking water.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  And I grabbed this.
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:55.000]  I'm like, oh, they're admitting fluorides of carcinogen finally in the local media.
[03:39:55.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  No, that's not it.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  But this 10 minute report that I've pared down to just like the best stuff
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  really goes into what, how the water boards treat their citizens.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  They were doing a test with this chemical called aluminum chlorohydrate
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  to use that as a new additive to kind of get rid of particulates in water.
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  So they did a whole year long study.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:16.000]  This stuff is carcinogenic.
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  And then they have to add more chlorine because it doesn't really work well.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  So they add more chlorine to the water,
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:24.000]  which then creates this other disgusting carcinogen
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  that also causes miscarriages in women.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  So let's roll the first clip, which will kind of get us into what's going on here.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  I've got a few more and then we're going to get into the elections.
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:35.000]  Some people are kicking Florida out of their communities.
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  Some people are inviting it back in.
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  It's really disgusting.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  But here's the first clip.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  Investigation with some scary revelations about the city of Sacramento's drinking water.
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  For almost a year, the city added a new chemical to the drinking water.
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:53.000]  It started as a short term test of a water treatment chemical called aluminum chlorohydrate
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  or ACH.
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  The chemical was temporarily replacing another water treatment chemical called alum.
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  Sacramento's utility director says the test was all about one thing.
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  There was an expectation that we'd be able to save quite a bit of money.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  In a report, the city filed with state regulators.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  The city admits that the ACH chemical they were testing
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  didn't do a good enough job removing some of those impurities.
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:18.000]  To make up for the chemical's lack of effectiveness,
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:20.000]  the city had to pump in more chlorine.
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:24.000]  And when the chlorine and these organic compounds spend too much time together,
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  the chlorine can turn into disinfection byproducts,
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:31.000]  DBPs in your drinking water.
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  The chemical trial went on for an entire year.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  And during that year, according to internal tests,
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  the city was performing reading after reading
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:45.000]  when above what the EPA considers safe for long term exposure to DBPs.
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  A city chemist noticed DBP problems on the third day of testing.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  She wrote in an email to managers,
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:54.000]  I'm nervous about the distribution samples.
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  A chart that went along with that email
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  showed DBPs way above the EPA limits.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  But Sacramento officials didn't call that state agency or stop the testing.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:06.000]  Instead, they expanded it.
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  Telling the city council they needed enough money
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:13.000]  to buy a truckload of ACH every week for a year.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  1,100 tons of it.
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:19.000]  In July of 2013, BUSATH and other utility officials
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:21.000]  told the council in a staff report
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  that a one year chemical trial was mandated by the state of California.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:28.000]  That sounds like a good reason if the state mandated it,
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:30.000]  but it's also not true.
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  And when we asked the city about that discrepancy with the state,
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.000]  we got this admission.
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:38.000]  The word mandate used in the council report
[03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  was probably a poor choice of words.
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:44.000]  Every corner you turn on this particular project,
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  red flag, red flag, it's like peeling back an onion.
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  There's just another layer of stuff that,
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  the closer you get to the center, the stronger the smell.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:56.000]  Yeah, literally.
[03:42:56.000 --> 03:42:59.000]  And the guy Bob Bocock is his name.
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  He's a water specialist.
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  He works with Aaron Brockovich,
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.000]  and he was pulled into this interview.
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:07.000]  That's just part of this whole 10 minute report.
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  We've got a couple more pieces of it.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  That's a lot of red flags right there.
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  They knew the levels were high.
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  They went ahead and kept doing it.
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:17.000]  And then they said, we need a year's supply worth of this.
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  They say it's for saving money,
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  which later on it comes out, it's not for saving money.
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  So it's interesting, Rob.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  This is Sacramento, of course, in California capital there.
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  And we've had Telly Blackwood file reports with us
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:30.000]  showing how a closed Air Force base there,
[03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  they just took massive piles of radioactive soil.
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  It was left over from Radium Instruments
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  that they were working on there.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:40.000]  Just left it above the soil,
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  putting it into the water there.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  Here we've got an example of this state California
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  that is supposedly so concerned about the environment,
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:52.000]  and yet you have interests inside the government
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  that prevent them from doing anything
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:56.000]  because they have ties to corporations.
[03:43:56.000 --> 03:43:59.000]  They're just not effective stewards of the environment.
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  And who knows how this ACH, how that came up to being,
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  oh, we've got to start putting this in the water.
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  But it turns out it doesn't really work.
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  You have to add more chlorine, so you're using more chemicals,
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:11.000]  more money, plus that stuff you have to end up,
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:13.000]  you know, if you're going to filter your water,
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000]  that's going to take more filtering power,
[03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  which is why we always recommend filtering your water anyway,
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  because you never know.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000]  They didn't tell the citizens of Sacramento that they were doing this.
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  They did it for an entire year.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:24.000]  Now, what do the DBPs do?
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:26.000]  Well, this is a little bit clip two,
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  telling you what they actually do, what they can cause.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:33.000]  This community was basically looked at as a laboratory guinea pig
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  in that they were exposed for a period of up to one year
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:40.000]  without any proper notification whatsoever.
[03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  Test after test revealed numbers in excess
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:46.000]  of the EPA safe drinking water standard of 80 parts per billion.
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:52.000]  Some people were drinking water with DBP levels above 130 parts per billion.
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:55.000]  People in Sacramento were never notified about the dangers,
[03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  never given that choice to opt for bottled water,
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:00.000]  even though the city had all kinds of data
[03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  that showed they had a serious problem.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:05.000]  DBPs are nothing to mess around with.
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:11.000]  In first trimester pregnancies, there's significant rise in miscarriages.
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:14.000]  And in third trimester, there's evidence of low birth weight.
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:15.000]  Why not stop it?
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  Because these are carcinogens, and that's one thing.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:21.000]  I mean, the carcinogens, but we know that, you know,
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  for pregnant women, unborn children, this is bad stuff.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:28.000]  Because we had the anticipation of saving money with using ACH.
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  Or maybe making money.
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  Yeah, making money.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:32.000]  Because, you know, that's how fluoride started.
[03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  Right.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:36.000]  So they would have to dispose of this toxic waste and pay for it.
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  Or they could dump it into your drinking water and get you to pay for it.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  Exactly.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:42.000]  And this guy that they're interviewing, this bureaucrat,
[03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:46.000]  I mean, he needs to be immediately fired, replaced with, you know,
[03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:47.000]  replaced with somebody.
[03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:50.000]  I mean, let's put somebody else in there who can at least do a job.
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  I mean, his answers are he's very evasive.
[03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000]  It's all about we're saving money, saving money.
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  We were mandated.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:45:57.000]  They lied about that.
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  They made these tests for over a year.
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:02.000]  The levels were above what they should have been for over a year.
[03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:04.000]  But we're not even getting to the meat of the whole thing.
[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:05.000]  There's a whole cover-up that goes on.
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  They actually did the tests to send to the EPA.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:11.000]  They would shut off the water supply from that particular plant
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  that was doing the test and get it from other plants.
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  Let's roll that third clip and you can just see the cover-up intensifying.
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  Our ABC 10 investigation found that even though city officials were aware
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:26.000]  of those internally high DBP numbers, the city held the EPA tests
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:29.000]  at times when they knew DBP numbers would be lower.
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  For one test in January 2014, the Sacramento River Plant
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  where the chemical test was being performed was turned off for repairs
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  and they got water from an American River plant.
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  That drove the numbers way down, masking the DBP problem.
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  And for another of those quarterly tests,
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  emails obtained by ABC 10 reveal that the city intentionally
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:54.000]  switched water sources days before an EPA test.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:58.000]  The subject of one email request for emergency water service
[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:02.000]  from Sacramento County Water Agency to the city of Sacramento.
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  The emergency, if the city didn't get water from another source,
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:10.000]  it was certain to exceed yearly standards for its disinfection byproducts.
[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  And about the city's overall claim that they did this for cost savings,
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:16.000]  that doesn't add up either.
[03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:20.000]  We analyzed city records and not only was the original chemical safer,
[03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  it appears to us it was also cheaper.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:25.000]  We want to stress, and this is important,
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  that the drinking water the city is now pumping is by every indication
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  and measurement.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  It's very safe.
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.000]  It's very safe and effective.
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  Nothing to fear.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  They need to do an audit of the finances of those people who are making that decision
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  if they really want to answer who's paying them off.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:42.000]  When you get onto the bottom of this and they put a link to their
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  2014 water quality report, so I, of course, being my nosy little self,
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.000]  went to read that report.
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  And guys, pull that up please, because it's kind of hard to see on this printout.
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  But one, two, three, four, the fourth item down there,
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:00.000]  oh, they got fluoride in their drinking water.
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  But what, what, what do they have it at 0.8?
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  That's their range, 0.8.
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  And then between 0.7 and 0.12 is their range in the groundwater
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:09.000]  and in the surface water.
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:13.000]  And they say it's an additive for, what does it say?
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  Promote strong teeth.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:17.000]  And so they say, keep this in writing, so small.
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:19.000]  There it is, promotes strong teeth.
[03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  But look at this, back in, this was 2015, April 2015,
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  US lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for the first time in over 50 years.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  They dropped it down to 0.7, should be the maximum it should be.
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:34.000]  They're going up to 1.2.
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  So that's their minimum is 0.7.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:40.000]  Yeah, they start it where the EPA says it's a max and then they go up from there.
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  And now why is that bad?
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  Well, and you guys can roll this whenever you want.
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  It's the footage I shot whenever we went into the fluoride,
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  the water treatment plan here in Austin,
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  and shot some hidden camera footage of their fluoride processing facilities.
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:56.000]  But here we have the articles from 2013.
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  from the environmental working group.
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:04.000]  Harvard study, strong link between fluoridate water and bone cancer.
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:08.000]  So here we have a carcinogen admittedly being added to their water
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:10.000]  to promote healthy teeth, so called for that.
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:13.000]  But it says it causes bone cancer in boys.
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  And we look at those levels, is that the level for an adult male?
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  Is that the level for a year old child?
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:20.000]  Exactly, and how much water do you drink?
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  How much water do you drink, David?
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:22.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  Some people drink a lot of water, some people don't drink as much water.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:26.000]  And it's being put in the water.
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  That's why they've got a range that's nearly 2 to 1.
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  Because when you dump something in the water,
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  you have no control over the dosage that you're going to get.
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:36.000]  So they give the same dosage range to everybody,
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  regardless of how much water they drink or their age,
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  and then they don't even have any control over that.
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  Because they're just dumping the medication.
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  If you thought this was safe and effective,
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  why would you want it dumped in the water where you can't control it?
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:52.000]  Maybe you're not going to get enough if you think this is good stuff.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  They go buy your own fluoridate water once they sell,
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  and they say it's for babies.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  Or buy your own fluoride pills.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  But you don't want to medicate the population through the water supply.
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  That's absolutely insane.
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  Even if you think that fluoride is great for you.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  Go do it yourself.
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  This last clip we have, there's the MSDS of fluoride.
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  It means it's super hazardous if you touch it,
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  get it anywhere near you.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  This is some nasty stuff.
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  Hydrofluorosalic acid.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  That's what they put in our water here in Austin.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  About 9 gallons per hour they dump in there.
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  That was the statistic that really shocked me the most.
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  But there's your MSDS of 4.
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  Very important.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  I remember when you guys did that undercover video, it was really good.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  You can see the corroded pipes that fluoride was doing to the pipes.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  I don't even want to think about what it's doing to my pipe.
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  Eating out the concrete.
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  That's what it does to your bones. It eats away at them.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  We're going to break, but when we come back,
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:48.000]  I guess let's get into what people are doing to get it out of their communities.
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  We'll be right back with Rob Dew. I'm David Knight. Stay with us.

[03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:12.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in studio with Rob Dew and Jakari Jackson.
[03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  You'll be hosting the Nightly News tonight.
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  Real quickly, you've only got a few minutes to take advantage of two specials that are going to end with this show.
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  First one is free shipping and 10% off of all InfoWars Select food.
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:23.000]  You can find that at infowarselect.com.
[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:26.000]  That free shipping is going to end with the end of this show.
[03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:29.000]  Also, the 25% off the liver cleanse pack.
[03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  That's the oxy powder and liver shield together.
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:34.000]  That's 25% off of that pack.
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  That will also end with this show in just about five minutes or so.
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:44.000]  Now, let's go back to Rob and Rob, but finish up with what you're telling us about the election.
[03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:49.000]  We had some places where they put fluoride in the water, but somewhere they took it out.
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  Some good news.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  That's right.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  The city of San Marcos just south of us about 30 minutes voted at 61% to remove it from their water supply.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:00.000]  Half the city receives Florida water, half the city doesn't.
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:04.000]  I personally know a city councilman there, and I was actually educating him about fluoride.
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  I told him to read the back of his toothpaste. He had never done that before.
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  You need to do that with your friends.
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  Read the back of the toothpaste. You see the dangers there.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  You don't ingest it. Why are you putting it in your water?
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:17.000]  If you're not supposed to ingest the toothpaste coming out of your toothpaste roll.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  And then we also have Chikuro, which is north bay area, north bay city, or the city of north bay.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  They are talking about getting it out and they've said they're not going to, if they people vote to pull it out,
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  they're not going to mandate it back in, which is good.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:39.000]  Now you have on the other side an Arab, this is Arab, I think it's in, where is this at?
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  This is Alabama, Arab, Alabama.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  They are mandating it go back into the water supply after the people voted to pull it out.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  All this is done mainly for cost savings and they're not even doing it on the health issues.
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  They're saying we can save money in the short term by not putting it in our water supply.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:54.000]  But now these guys are adding it back in.
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  How do you justify that?
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  When it's something that's not expensive and the voters say they don't want it.
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  I mean, they've got to be.
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  Well, they've got program doctors that they bring in and say,
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:05.000]  look, if we don't do this, we're going to have higher rates of dental cavities.
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  When now it shows that it doesn't even help for cavities.
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  So that's another lie that they just keep pushing and pushing.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  And then when you go to the city council with the Harvey documents, the mayor gives you the finger.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  Yeah, and laughs at you.
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:17.000]  And then finally, snow mass up in Colorado.
[03:56:17.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  They are putting it back in the water supply.
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  Unfortunately, yeah, I mean, why would you add a chemical that is deadly if it comes in contact with you into your water supply?
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:26.000]  Tony is good for your teeth.
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:27.000]  I don't understand it.
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:28.000]  Yeah.
[03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  Mass medicate people through the water supply.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:30.000]  Exactly.
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:31.000]  Insane.
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  Now next Tuesday, we're going to be doing the GOP debate.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:37.000]  The next GOP debate, we're going to have live coverage and commentary as we do.
[03:56:37.000 --> 03:56:42.000]  And of course, Jakari Jackson is going to be there with us and Rob will be running the board.
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:47.000]  So they tweeted out a title Liberty Science Theater 3000 instead of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  So showing, you know, breaking down the lies in real time is what I like to say.
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  Yeah.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:54.000]  Because we really do do that.
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:57:00.000]  Yeah, kind of think of it as, you know, your DVD when you've got a commentary track there from the director and people who are in it,
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  talking about what's going on with the movie.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  So you'll be able to hear, we'll occasionally let them speak and you can hear what they say occasionally.
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  We basically are looking at the subtitles if you want to listen to it on another channel and get our commentary.
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:15.000]  You can do that as well.
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  But really, they're not going to be saying that much.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:18.000]  That's interesting.
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:23.000]  But we will comment on it when they do come up with something interesting and we'll kind of hold their feet to the fire.
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  Tell us what's on the news tonight, Jakari.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:26.000]  Well, we're going to talk about a lot of stuff.
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  We're going to re-air Wayne Madsen's report that aired today on the Alex Jones show.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  So if anybody missed that, you can see that again on the nightly news.
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  Also a record number of Americans on prescription pills.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:40.000]  And as we were talking about the debate, I believe it was Huckabee who said in the last debate,
[03:57:40.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  it really doesn't matter what we do until we change the way people put things into their body,
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:48.000]  whether that's food, whether that's medication, alcohol, any number of other things.
[03:57:48.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  And also, mindless censorship has reached a new level to where they're not even allowing people to bring lightsabers to the Star Wars movie premiere.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:57:57.000]  I know. Our paint faces are wear masks.
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  I mean, it's completely ridiculous because first you can take a warning as well.
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  We're going to have lightsaber control.
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  Is that going to be the new thing for the Democrats?
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:05.000]  You can't have that.
[03:58:05.000 --> 03:58:09.000]  You know, lightsabers would be covered under the Second Amendment, I have to say.
[03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:12.000]  That's one of the cool things about our Constitution.
[03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  All right, well, that's it for today's show.
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  Rob Dew and Jakari Jackson again tonight at the InfoWars Nightly News
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:21.000]  at 7 central, 8 p.m. Eastern with Jakari Jackson.
[03:58:21.000 --> 03:58:37.000]  Join us there.
