[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:32.320]  we're live my friends it is October 1st 2010 we've got the health ranger up here
[00:32.320 --> 00:44.160]  from war torn Ecuador expert on health issues GMO the pharmacological garbage
[00:44.160 --> 00:49.080]  being pushed on us he'll be joining us in studio today and Bob Chapman is gonna
[00:49.080 --> 00:53.760]  give us his weekly visit an hour early in the second hour he's normally on in
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.840]  the third hour obviously a lot to talk about with him boy just look at all
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.520]  these stacks of news in front of me you know I started printing these out about
[01:03.520 --> 01:07.640]  a week ago and I've never gotten to it but I do want to spend some time on this
[01:07.640 --> 01:15.560]  today this is from CNET News sci-fi wars pilots say UFOs knocked out nukes and
[01:15.560 --> 01:21.320]  they've been testifying about this working at seeker at nuke bases and
[01:21.320 --> 01:27.080]  Air Force bases and aliens turning off their nuclear weapons and then just so
[01:27.080 --> 01:32.040]  much mainstream media now saying aliens are real in fact of course you saw this
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.600]  a few months ago UFO files Winston Churchill feared panic over second
[01:36.600 --> 01:43.880]  world war RAF incident here's another one Churchill and Eisenhower agreed to
[01:43.880 --> 01:50.200]  cover up RAF planes UFO encountering world war two secret files reveal that's
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.440]  the mail here's the telegraph I mean this is mainstream news remember all
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.600]  those old-timers different people that had been in the military colonels and
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.520]  others saying that Eisenhower secretly met with space aliens yeah yeah I don't
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.160]  cover space aliens on this radio show if I can't get people to wake up to the
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.600]  fact that we have official UN and Rockefeller Foundation and other major
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.040]  Foundation documents that we show you we link to on their websites they're
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.640]  proud of it admitting they're adding different compounds to vaccines to give
[02:25.640 --> 02:32.160]  you cancer and reduce your fertility then how would I get into aliens something
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.720]  we can't prove one way or the other I mean if I can't get some people out
[02:37.720 --> 02:41.840]  there to care about depleted uranium which they're using all over the world
[02:41.840 --> 02:48.000]  now that is completely radioactive and deadly poison why talk about little
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.240]  green men and look I'm not criticizing people that do cover little green men I
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.200]  mean I understand it's very interesting and we're out here on a planet spinning
[02:58.200 --> 03:06.520]  through the galaxy but my bigger issue is why is the media after decades of
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.920]  poo-pooing all of this and making fun of people that discuss it and kind of
[03:10.920 --> 03:16.680]  shelving it you know into the absurdist realm why are they now giving it so much
[03:16.680 --> 03:19.840]  validity we've seen this drumbeat increasing in the last five six years
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.920]  you know Larry King live with giant UFOs over Dallas and ABC News pointing
[03:24.920 --> 03:28.600]  cameras at what are clearly Homeland Security blimps even have propellers on
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.880]  them saying is it aliens at a hundred thousand feet over Salt Lake City and
[03:33.880 --> 03:37.960]  we've played those videos and it's a stinkin blimp I mean the media knows
[03:37.960 --> 03:44.240]  it's not a giant alien spacecraft it's not District 9 or whatever and they're
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.120]  playing along with it well we know it's part of project Bluebeam there's a whole
[03:48.120 --> 03:52.160]  chapter on this and Paul Watson's book ordered out of chaos a least sponsored
[03:52.160 --> 03:55.720]  terror and the New World Order and a fake alien invasion that is a
[03:55.720 --> 04:00.360]  psychological form of terror so we know the government has been looking and it
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.480]  has declassified giant hologram projectors they've got for 3,000 foot
[04:04.480 --> 04:10.520]  Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad or spaceships to freak people out we know all of
[04:10.520 --> 04:17.720]  that's going on and my gut tells me that they're really considering a Steven
[04:17.720 --> 04:23.080]  Spielberg Jerry Bruckheimer type fake alien landing sometime in the future as
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.120]  a global distraction and as a way to unify the planet behind world government
[04:27.120 --> 04:32.080]  yesterday we were all nationalists we were Americans Russians Japanese
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.680]  Mexicans today we are earthlings united against the menace are the aliens
[04:38.680 --> 04:43.960]  friendly what planet do they come from tonight at 7 we'll be interviewing the
[04:43.960 --> 04:50.520]  alien ambassador come on folks come on you can see them scripting this so I'll
[04:50.520 --> 04:53.560]  talk some about that the first one again all the other news and we've got a
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.440]  bunch of guests coming up today it's gonna be very informative the economy
[04:56.440 --> 05:01.560]  obviously is falling apart in front of everyone right now you've heard Alex
[05:01.560 --> 05:05.240]  explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.080]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[05:09.080 --> 05:12.240]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[05:12.240 --> 05:17.000]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.600]  Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.720]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.560]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[05:29.560 --> 05:34.440]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the
[05:34.440 --> 05:41.040]  eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[05:41.040 --> 05:45.400]  be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at
[05:45.400 --> 05:51.520]  www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works as
[05:51.520 --> 05:59.040]  well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com
[05:59.040 --> 06:02.800]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[06:02.800 --> 06:07.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.120 --> 06:11.320]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.320 --> 06:15.320]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.320 --> 06:19.200]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.200 --> 06:23.400]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.400 --> 06:27.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.680 --> 06:31.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:31.960 --> 06:35.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:35.680 --> 06:39.880]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:39.880 --> 06:42.840]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[06:42.840 --> 06:46.880]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[06:46.880 --> 06:52.520]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[06:52.520 --> 06:58.960]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:58.960 --> 07:03.680]  listen up friends this is Alex Jones with key information the mainstream media

[08:22.960 --> 08:27.440]  economy in the next hour than the health ranger all the way from war torn coup
[08:27.440 --> 08:34.400]  torn hunter torn Ecuador will be joining us in studio today we'll probably go
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.920]  into overdrive into the fourth hour okay here are the stacks of news millions
[08:39.920 --> 08:46.640]  of computers hit by virus across China the computer worm attacking Iran's
[08:46.640 --> 08:54.400]  nuclear facilities includes biblical link to China and it's the same one now
[08:54.400 --> 09:02.240]  hitting China again millions of computers hit by virus across China that is
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.360]  the headline out of the Jakarta globe here's the mail online computer worm
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.840]  attacking Iran's nuclear facilities includes biblical link to Israel I miss
[09:11.840 --> 09:16.840]  spoken I said China it's now spread to China and is hitting China as well and
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.840]  we played clips of course earlier this week where mainstream media Bloomberg
[09:21.840 --> 09:27.080]  AP Reuters they're all just admitting it okay you know Israel designed this
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.920]  super worm to take down infrastructures and it's super high-tech and spies have
[09:32.920 --> 09:37.040]  got to go inside the facilities to load this on to the industrial computer
[09:37.040 --> 09:41.720]  systems but as we predicted it's now all over the mainstream media we're going
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.480]  to go over some of that where they're saying see we've got a past cyber
[09:46.480 --> 09:53.440]  security right now or we could be hit by something like the Stuxnet computer
[09:53.440 --> 10:00.640]  worm you got to love it a Western government clearly designs and launches
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.520]  this it's attacking the globalist enemies at least at one level the
[10:05.520 --> 10:12.000]  Iranians the Chinese the Indonesians clearly loaded onto their systems by
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.200]  spies that went in at the zero point of origin and did all of this and then
[10:18.200 --> 10:27.800]  there's no common sense there's no two plus two equals four by the general
[10:27.800 --> 10:31.320]  public or at least the government thinks that they come out in the media and say
[10:31.320 --> 10:36.040]  see we need to surveil the internet and control the internet and have more
[10:36.040 --> 10:39.480]  choke points put into the internet to be able to shut off the internet that's
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.400]  their quote Obama and Hayden and all of them are all over the news LA Times this
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.840]  week we need the power to shut the web off to protect it when they are the ones
[10:48.840 --> 10:53.480]  that will attack the internet in fact that was a Pentagon press release three
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.960]  days ago that they're running a giant drill right now of quote attacking
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.360]  their own system so they can prevent and understand attacks in the future no
[11:03.360 --> 11:08.200]  they're practicing killing parts of the internet and shutting off industrial
[11:08.200 --> 11:13.200]  systems when they want to and then blaming it on shadowy men in caves I
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.440]  mean it's always the globalist in every case that are launching the
[11:17.440 --> 11:21.920]  sophisticated physical terror attacks cyber terror attacks you name it so
[11:21.920 --> 11:27.560]  that's all in plain view we're going to be going more over that today in the
[11:27.560 --> 11:33.200]  economic stack global employment crisis will stir social unrest warrants a UN
[11:33.200 --> 11:38.120]  agency and of course we had the Pentagon come out two weeks ago and say
[11:38.120 --> 11:42.560]  that they're worried about a total collapse and society degenerating but
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.040]  they've got a solution martial law that will save you from the financial crisis
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.560]  that the banksters have engineered just like this year the Federal Reserve got
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.920]  more power over the markets and private companies and the ability to track all
[11:56.920 --> 12:02.080]  your purchases to fix the problem they admittedly engineered to enrich
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.160]  themselves you've just got to love it so unemployment exploding worldwide and
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.600]  riots all over Europe as people are having their taxes raised and part of
[12:11.600 --> 12:16.960]  their pension funds stolen but this is part of the IMF World Bank plan they
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.920]  got leaked in 2002 they talked about well we've robbed the third world the
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.400]  developing world now we're going to rob Europe the United States Australia and
[12:24.400 --> 12:28.960]  all of the supposed wealthy nations and steal their wealth and the great part is
[12:28.960 --> 12:35.360]  they call it the IMF riot when the people then riot that will drive down
[12:35.360 --> 12:41.880]  the confidence even more and it's even bigger fire sale for the banks flush
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.800]  with cash from bailouts they can now move in and buy everything up so it's
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.200]  working like a charm of course and general public still more concerned
[12:51.200 --> 12:58.600]  about survivor and you know did Jimmy Johnson get kicked off the show or does
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.360]  Howard Stern have bed bugs at his office yes that's that's what's important
[13:03.360 --> 13:08.760]  and so we're going to be enslaved but again some people are waking up but the
[13:08.760 --> 13:12.760]  problem is the neocons are now posing as patriots to be pied pipers to lead
[13:12.760 --> 13:16.840]  that movement down a rat hole but people are getting more and more wise to these
[13:16.840 --> 13:27.040]  scams flames of anger strikes fury over spending cuts sweeps Europe so flames of
[13:27.040 --> 13:34.960]  anger strike fury over spending cuts as it sweeps Europe and Bob Chapman's got a
[13:34.960 --> 13:41.080]  detailed report up at info wars calm today the risk of currency devaluation
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.720]  currency devaluation that's already begun and it's been going on for a while
[13:46.720 --> 13:52.920]  but the dollars lost 99% of its purchasing value since 1913 when the
[13:52.920 --> 13:59.000]  Federal Reserve took over and they inflate the currency for themselves at
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.320]  the top of the pyramid and buy things with it and then pass on the
[14:03.320 --> 14:09.360]  devaluation to you and make you pay it back also in taxes so we'll be talking
[14:09.360 --> 14:14.000]  to Bob Chapman about that two years and billions later bank bailout program
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.080]  finally ends that's the AP headline and Geithner says economy still needs
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.280]  reinforcement that means more money to the banksters that they then don't pass
[14:24.280 --> 14:29.880]  on in loans to the public and industry that aren't part of the that aren't part
[14:29.880 --> 14:36.680]  of the insider club but but Geithner two weeks ago your office told us that the
[14:36.680 --> 14:46.960]  recession ended 15 months ago in June of 2009 so it ended 15 months ago but you
[14:46.960 --> 14:55.280]  need more money also this has to be a joke sec is about to blame entire
[14:55.280 --> 15:03.160]  flash crash on Waddell and Reed's e-mini trades which is a very small outfit
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.600]  overall in the aggregate zero hedge Tyler Durgan reports and sure enough I
[15:08.600 --> 15:14.680]  have the Bloomberg article they're talking about report to say Waddell
[15:14.680 --> 15:20.840]  stoked flash crash that thousand-point drop in 15 minutes that happened a few
[15:20.840 --> 15:27.320]  months ago the sec that the covered up for Bernie made off and others and and
[15:27.320 --> 15:31.400]  of course Ken lay as long as they could all those insider groups they are
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.440]  telling you that some little tiny group did it isn't that just special so they
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.000]  want to restrict smaller firms from running their own computer programs so
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.440]  only the big boys like Goldman Sachs can siphon off the money also will the
[15:45.440 --> 15:49.840]  dollar rebound before dissolving into global currency excellent report from
[15:49.840 --> 15:55.800]  activist post Eric Blair up at info wars dot com and here's another one gold at
[15:55.800 --> 16:02.080]  record for six-day US policy in focus it hit one thousand three hundred and
[16:02.080 --> 16:11.960]  seventeen dollars last time I checked 17 dollars and 10 cents I should add so
[16:11.960 --> 16:21.920]  that's just some of the news on that front I want to get into this coming up
[16:21.920 --> 16:29.640]  at the bottom of the hour after I cover some other important news and that is
[16:29.640 --> 16:36.760]  Fox News boss calls for legalizing 40 million illegals and of course he also
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.920]  ordered all of his TV divisions to promote that man-made global warming is
[16:40.920 --> 16:47.000]  real and we've shown you Fox TV promos promoting the global warming's real and
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.440]  carbon taxes are good and if you criticize Rupert Murdoch so-called
[16:51.440 --> 16:55.720]  conservatives and you hate filled emails saying you're a liar okay well he's on
[16:55.720 --> 17:00.280]  TV promoting the legalization of 40 million illegal aliens and you've got
[17:00.280 --> 17:03.920]  to love this a double-speak your CNS news reporting on it
[17:03.920 --> 17:09.040]  Rupert Murdoch calls for amnesty for law-abiding illegal immigrants that's
[17:09.040 --> 17:17.760]  like Rupert Murdoch calls for law-abiding child molesters to be
[17:17.760 --> 17:20.800]  released from prison I mean what does that mean Rupert Murdoch calls for
[17:20.800 --> 17:24.840]  amnesty for law-abiding illegal immigrants so a full court press by the
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.200]  neocons on that front also Texas Sheriff Mexican bandits entered US waters
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.920]  just the latest report of piracy on lakes in Texas and it's also going on the
[17:33.920 --> 17:37.880]  Gulf of Mexico there's just a massive increase it's more than doubled we've
[17:37.880 --> 17:44.040]  had captains on to report on this and major international organizations like
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.240]  Interpol admit there's been more than a doubling exponentially in the last three
[17:47.240 --> 17:51.600]  years every year it's been exponentially doubling each year and the Gulf of
[17:51.600 --> 17:55.920]  Mexico piracy showed up but but local media doesn't tell you hey don't take
[17:55.920 --> 17:59.880]  your sailboat down into Mexican waters you're gonna get robbed by federales
[17:59.880 --> 18:02.840]  and they're gonna kill you and your wife and kids and throw you overboard then
[18:02.840 --> 18:07.520]  go sell your boat because that's who the pirates are in most cases no no no
[18:07.520 --> 18:10.920]  they're just gonna send you right on down there to get killed and then it's
[18:10.920 --> 18:16.920]  just oh where do where the Browns go or where the where the Changs go or where
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.920]  the Swartz's go oh we don't know you know their sailboat showed up six months
[18:21.920 --> 18:26.360]  later repainted with the new serial numbers but you know it got sold at an
[18:26.360 --> 18:33.360]  auction in Miami but whoop-de-do they're dead you know see the globalist ignore
[18:33.360 --> 18:40.240]  all the real carnage that's going on and then they hype up imaginary stuff like
[18:40.240 --> 18:46.360]  oh you know one guy shot himself at UT on Monday well the Texas legislature
[18:46.360 --> 18:52.360]  better not legalized concealed carry on Texas campuses which statistically all
[18:52.360 --> 18:57.560]  the evidence is shown over 20% reductions in crime on average so what so what
[18:57.560 --> 19:02.240]  of it actually makes us safer you know we better cancel the speech by Professor
[19:02.240 --> 19:07.160]  John Lott at the UT law school that night conveniently on the 28th because
[19:07.160 --> 19:12.280]  after all talking about guns could cause violence and don't even talk about guns
[19:12.280 --> 19:18.760]  in America so that's coming up now if you think that's insane tyranny and
[19:18.760 --> 19:22.000]  treason what of course he's not even an American so what do you expect from old
[19:22.000 --> 19:31.200]  from old Rupert Rupert the fake conservative Murdoch here's one feds
[19:31.200 --> 19:36.680]  use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans you know we told you about how

[19:39.160 --> 19:43.280]  email everything you do and having law enforcement seminars all over the

[19:45.880 --> 19:51.480]  million dollars down on this show that I saw that the news this morning to run
[19:51.480 --> 19:56.120]  everything you do through a database and give a local police access to it but
[19:56.120 --> 19:59.000]  they'll have fun with that and if you criticize the government well you're
[19:59.000 --> 20:05.240]  in deep trouble the economy is crumbling debt soaring and the possibility of

[24:09.880 --> 24:15.440]  here's just a quick blurb on one of the main modes of banning and restricting
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.440]  free speech in Europe and in Canada and they're trying to push this same model
[24:20.440 --> 24:25.880]  here UK government passes law where anyone who claims to have been offended
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.440]  can sue if you're just offended even if you're not talking about somebody but
[24:30.440 --> 24:34.960]  they don't like what you say and it's offensive to them they can sue you and
[24:34.960 --> 24:39.360]  we see this being introduced in public schools every day or two I see articles
[24:39.360 --> 24:46.080]  in fact I saw one last week where it's over a year later and this middle school
[24:46.080 --> 24:50.600]  student who was a A-plus student is still suspended in the school district
[24:50.600 --> 24:58.320]  expelled completely because they brought a one-inch toy gun with their G.I. Joe
[24:58.320 --> 25:04.640]  action figure to school remember that still suspended expelled a year later
[25:04.640 --> 25:11.120]  it's a thought crime it's offensive it's scary we've got to have the UT law
[25:11.120 --> 25:17.720]  school ban and cancel the speech of professor John lot talking about more
[25:17.720 --> 25:22.160]  guns less crime which is a statistical fact there it is child still expelled for
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.520]  toy gun a year later parents want their child back in school school board says
[25:27.520 --> 25:37.000]  no way Jose there is the headline on screen for prison planet dot TV viewers
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.240]  I want to get into Fox News boss murder calls for legalizing 40 million illegals
[25:42.240 --> 25:47.240]  feds use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans as we continue to just point out
[25:47.240 --> 25:52.080]  to anybody joining the military anybody in the military that you are hated and
[25:52.080 --> 25:59.640]  surveilled by this government almost all of their spying and surveillance is
[25:59.640 --> 26:05.280]  targeting gun owners landowners conservatives libertarians but of all
[26:05.280 --> 26:10.040]  those groups veterans and I want to go over Paul Watson's article on this
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.080]  because it's excellent and we want to get this story out to everyone who's in
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.280]  the military also we posted up on the YouTube Alex Jones channel the
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.120]  interview we did with Dr. Doug Rocky yesterday the former head of the Army's
[26:22.120 --> 26:29.560]  DU program about how if you ingest or breathe nano amounts just just
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.200]  microscopic amounts of DU it's going to shave many years off your life and
[26:34.200 --> 26:39.040]  debilitate you and kill you and many troops are just inhaling masses of
[26:39.040 --> 26:44.040]  this and they've gone of course from admitting it's deadly it's just saying
[26:44.040 --> 26:48.120]  it's it you know it's fine so what if there's a 15 times increase in cancers
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.680]  in Fallujah so what if there's a three to four times increase in the troops and
[26:52.680 --> 26:58.920]  their children the deformities the cancers it's no big deal we're going to
[26:58.920 --> 27:05.080]  use it and again it just shows the mindset of how we just accept this so
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.600]  that's coming up in the next segment I I've been remiss in plugging this because
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.480]  I don't have a lot of time to travel and I get constant requests to speak here
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.440]  speak there travel here travel there but I was already going to be in
[27:19.440 --> 27:24.080]  California in late October as part of an investigation I'm doing I'm just
[27:24.080 --> 27:31.760]  leaving at that and MZ as he's known the great owner of two radio stations in
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.840]  the Bay area that we're on it's had me on about a year and a half is getting a
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.240]  lot of listeners great great ratings for the stations these are big stations I
[27:41.240 --> 27:45.760]  mean they carry things like Rush Limbaugh and I'm going to be speaking Sunday

[28:04.440 --> 28:09.880]  pay for the ballroom okay they're $10.80 because I could be that's the

[29:10.280 --> 29:16.560]  the ad that MZ sent me it just makes me sound too I don't like flattering myself
[29:16.560 --> 29:21.880]  so I'm actually rewriting it but I guess this is the ad they're running on the
[29:21.880 --> 29:28.000]  stations I'll read it to you when we come back but it's like okay it's official

[33:43.760 --> 33:48.880]  worst fears and concerns it's just now all out in the open yeah we're driving

[34:14.240 --> 34:21.240]  and on and on it's now all out in the open and I just really worry about human
[34:21.240 --> 34:24.240]  society I mean where is it going from here and so many people just have this
[34:24.240 --> 34:28.680]  attitude of giving up oh good I hope we all nuke each other well you don't
[34:28.680 --> 34:34.600]  really mean that or you go kill yourself and please don't kill yourself we've
[34:34.600 --> 34:39.320]  had it so good that we basically become domesticated to the point that we don't
[34:39.320 --> 34:44.720]  know what's in our own interest and it's ridiculous but getting back to this
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.640]  event and ladies and gentlemen I mean it's probably been a year since I've
[34:50.640 --> 34:55.840]  done a speaking event and I again I get invited to speak in the Balkans and
[34:55.840 --> 35:01.680]  England and Mexico just constantly and I almost said no because when I say yes
[35:01.680 --> 35:04.640]  to one then everybody'll say oh please come to our events and it's not that I
[35:04.640 --> 35:08.520]  don't like meeting people or giving speeches and a lot of folks have pointed
[35:08.520 --> 35:12.480]  out that I am the most dynamic in person and I'm gonna give you a incredible two
[35:12.480 --> 35:19.520]  plus hour speech and then question and answer I'm thinking about the different
[35:19.520 --> 35:26.080]  subjects I want to cover I've got a good idea but the main reason I don't travel
[35:26.080 --> 35:30.800]  around and do a lot of speeches is I can sit here in this studio and do my
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.280]  radio show reaching millions of people YouTube videos reaching millions of
[35:34.280 --> 35:40.520]  people the films reaching tens upon tens of millions of people I can do radio
[35:40.520 --> 35:44.120]  interviews as many as I want to do a day I mean I turned down most of them
[35:44.120 --> 35:49.760]  because I'm busy making films and you know helping work on finishing up this
[35:49.760 --> 35:53.280]  big social network site we've been building in the last year that's about
[35:53.280 --> 35:59.240]  to launch in 14 days or less and I just don't have the time and energy but if I'm
[35:59.240 --> 36:02.520]  already going to be in California as part of an investigation on a separate
[36:02.520 --> 36:05.960]  issue and these are two great radio stations that reach hundreds of
[36:05.960 --> 36:15.120]  thousands of people and MZ is just a great guy then why not and so I'm gonna
[36:15.120 --> 36:24.840]  be speaking and again here MZ so nice here's the ad he wrote that okay it's

[36:28.320 --> 36:32.440]  the world you could probably argue that Alex Jones himself in person has

[37:47.440 --> 37:50.600]  great Californian listeners and others out there at that event but it will
[37:50.600 --> 37:54.760]  probably sell out so I will get your tickets and again we calculated the
[37:54.760 --> 38:00.760]  price just to pay for the event you know by the time you pay for the ballroom
[38:00.760 --> 38:04.720]  and the rest of it it'll probably even of the thing sells out probably lose
[38:04.720 --> 38:10.600]  money but yes you got to pay for it $10.80 for the tickets lastly on the
[38:10.600 --> 38:16.960]  plug front here I've been working on a aerosol spring campaign weather
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.800]  modification eugenics film for two years I'd say 30% or so of the film is going
[38:21.800 --> 38:25.320]  to be about that and a lot of the chemtrail films I've seen out there it's
[38:25.320 --> 38:28.800]  just all nebulous you know I mean you go back to films made ten years ago they
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.480]  did test they said it was barium salts aluminum dioxide and lo and behold the
[38:32.480 --> 38:35.120]  government in the last two years comes out and says okay we've been doing
[38:35.120 --> 38:40.160]  massive testing of weather modification to save you from global warming going
[38:40.160 --> 38:44.520]  back into the mid-1990s and that's when suddenly you would see some of the
[38:44.520 --> 38:48.840]  condensation trails persisting persistent jet trails and that's when you
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.040]  started seeing the health problems and the aluminum levels go up in the soil
[38:52.040 --> 38:57.400]  around the area is being heavily sprayed and well now they've gone out and got
[38:57.400 --> 39:04.360]  in the government reports they've gotten the soil samples it's really a
[39:04.360 --> 39:08.000]  powerful film and it's the first film to come out since the government admitted
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.160]  a lot of this and they went to government sponsored functions with top
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.640]  climatologists and others admitting this is going on but basically you know
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.840]  saying it's a great thing it's a very important documentary and it's on
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.120]  pre-sale now and we will be shipping it out to you October 22nd and again it's
[39:25.120 --> 39:28.320]  not the film I made is produced by G. Edward Griffin and some folks are like
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.400]  well aren't you just waiting to promote yours well I don't care I just want to
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.480]  get the information out and this film is you know I think worthy of your
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.280]  consideration I think it's something that's important and needs to be seen
[39:40.280 --> 39:46.200]  it's called what the world are they spring and I have now seen the final
[39:46.200 --> 39:50.040]  cut and it's been completed it's being mass-produced and we're gonna have it

[40:41.720 --> 40:47.360]  ahead now and get into what I think are the most disgusting out of control in
[40:47.360 --> 40:57.960]  your face oppressive naked despotism here is the top story at prisonplanet.com
[40:57.960 --> 41:05.040]  and info wars.com and if you know any veterans if you are in the military if
[41:05.040 --> 41:09.840]  you have family in the military if you're got family thing about joining the
[41:09.840 --> 41:16.960]  military you need to understand that there is a concerted across the board
[41:16.960 --> 41:24.120]  effort going back decades but but but really heating up under Clinton to put
[41:24.120 --> 41:30.880]  hundreds of thousands of veterans on mentally ill list saying that they've
[41:30.880 --> 41:35.120]  got mental problems so that you can't buy guns and they do this is on record
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.640]  expanded under Clinton exploded under Bush and now has gone supernova in its
[41:41.640 --> 41:50.200]  growth under Barack Hussein Obama mr. Barry Sotero and so this is a continuity
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.560]  of agenda that this is ongoing and we would get the federal reports decades
[41:54.560 --> 42:00.400]  ago shang the main focus of the FBI and counterterrorism is veterans and then
[42:00.400 --> 42:04.040]  down the list gun owners conservatives libertarians people that want us out of
[42:04.040 --> 42:08.040]  the UN people that support Ron Paul I mean you've literally seen the hundreds
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.240]  of reports on it we've put out well over a hundred reports ourselves there's
[42:11.240 --> 42:15.360]  been hundreds of mainstream reports on it but they're always well maybe it's a
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.920]  good idea veterans could be violent especially if they don't like the federal
[42:19.920 --> 42:27.640]  reserve boy have you got a Ron Paul sticker on your car I remember major
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.760]  law enforcement magazine nine years ago I was in a 7-11 bought it it was what
[42:32.760 --> 42:37.120]  law enforcement technology then I bought another copy one time it was like SWAT
[42:37.120 --> 42:43.120]  magazine I'm going from memory I showed them here on air and it was like do they
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.560]  have a get us out of the UN sticker better go ahead and pull them over and
[42:46.560 --> 42:49.840]  it actually said one of the articles go ahead and take them in for questioning
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.360]  even if nothing illegals found and police chiefs support your officers when
[42:53.360 --> 42:59.240]  they do this and then now you see the mic at homeland security reports and now
[42:59.240 --> 43:03.560]  the Israeli company hired by Pennsylvania Homeland Security to spy on
[43:03.560 --> 43:08.840]  members of the legislature gun groups I mean you know about that you know about
[43:08.840 --> 43:13.960]  all that but it's so diabolical that it that that it's on record I mean I see
[43:13.960 --> 43:19.400]  this every week in the news and vets call in they'll have DU exposure they'll
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.360]  have shrapnel in them they'll they'll have a heart attack they go in to get
[43:23.360 --> 43:26.840]  health care and the VA says okay we're gonna be able to give you this surgery
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.720]  you need but you've got to agree and sign that you've got PTSD to give you
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.840]  this disability listing you need to you know get this medical care and to get
[43:36.840 --> 43:43.040]  your medicines paid for and then a month later they go to buy a gun or they go to
[43:43.040 --> 43:48.520]  buy one for their grandson and they can't buy a gun there's no judge there's no
[43:48.520 --> 43:53.840]  jury it's just been put in the FBI database and you got Rahm Emanuel
[43:53.840 --> 43:59.280]  about to leave the White House become the new Chicago boss mob boss you know
[43:59.280 --> 44:03.800]  here in America the mob bosses are you know run whole cities I mean just
[44:03.800 --> 44:09.040]  publicly you've got him saying look if we think you might be a terrorist in fact
[44:09.040 --> 44:15.680]  pull up that clip if we think you maybe might be a terrorist no judge no jury no
[44:15.680 --> 44:22.280]  evidence you go on a terrorist watch list and you can't buy a gun if we think
[44:22.280 --> 44:25.360]  maybe you could possibly be a terrorist that's a quote if we think maybe you could
[44:25.360 --> 44:31.840]  possibly be a terrorist if we think you may be could be possibly a terrorist no
[44:31.840 --> 44:35.280]  gun for you you lose your second amendment that's a quote I've played it
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.440]  so many times I can quote it to you verbatim or you can just search the term
[44:40.440 --> 44:49.480]  White House Chief of Staff Emanuel no fly no buy so they're saying if they put
[44:49.480 --> 44:53.800]  you on the secret no fly list or any of these other databases you just can't have
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.160]  a gun no judge no jury no due process you can't find out why and now they're
[44:58.160 --> 45:03.720]  announcing oh yes the no fly list is going nationwide to jobs and employment
[45:03.720 --> 45:09.240]  and everything that if you're on a list you're not gonna get your welfare check
[45:09.240 --> 45:12.240]  you're not gonna get your disability check you're not gonna I mean this is how
[45:12.240 --> 45:17.200]  they're trying to scare everybody and then they introduce the legislation no
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.280]  fly no buy and then now Obama is back in the news today I've actually got it in
[45:22.280 --> 45:27.200]  my internet stack saying well we just even if we can't pass these laws we're
[45:27.200 --> 45:33.520]  gonna implement this and without having a law Obama even if he doesn't pass the
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.920]  Cyber Security Act he's saying the government will order ISPs to shut down
[45:37.920 --> 45:43.760]  your website because somebody up in some shadowy bureaucracy says that that's
[45:43.760 --> 45:53.120]  the way to go let's go ahead and play that video before I get into this
[45:53.120 --> 45:57.880]  article here's Rahm Emanuel take it into the election that is if you are on the
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.080]  no fly list because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot
[46:03.080 --> 46:16.600]  buy a handgun in America and I have not won far from liking the mixing of
[46:16.600 --> 46:21.360]  politics and policy but as my old boss used to say give me that vote and throw
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.960]  me into that prior patch I'll make politics out of that every day because
[46:24.960 --> 46:30.200]  if it's between that terrorist terrorist list and the NRA I know where
[46:30.200 --> 46:33.640]  America is gonna be every time and they're gonna make the right choice we
[46:33.640 --> 46:36.800]  have got to start building on that that is the right thing to take into the
[46:36.800 --> 46:42.080]  election it's the right policy if you're on that no fly list your access to the
[46:42.080 --> 46:45.800]  right to bear arms is canceled because you're not part of the American family
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.800]  okay I'm sorry I play the last part I cut it off at the real zinger you're
[46:50.800 --> 46:54.600]  not part of the American family because we put you on a secret list ride out of
[46:54.600 --> 47:00.640]  1984 right out of East Germany here it is America is gonna be every time and
[47:00.640 --> 47:04.320]  they're gonna make the right choice we have got to start building on that that
[47:04.320 --> 47:07.840]  is the right thing to take into the election it's the right policy if you're
[47:07.840 --> 47:12.960]  on that no fly list your access to the right to bear arms is canceled because
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.080]  you're not part of the American family you don't deserve that right there is no
[47:17.080 --> 47:21.120]  right for you if you're on that terrorist list that should be number one in
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.120]  what we do make sure there's a full force in the law okay the Brady Bell so to
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.480]  all those who've dedicated their lives all right so I mean I just wanted to play
[47:29.480 --> 47:31.840]  that in case some of you are new listeners and thought I was making that
[47:31.840 --> 47:38.160]  up now they have the legislation in but they don't care let me explain the major
[47:38.160 --> 47:44.160]  veteran organizations are completely run by the feds and they will not organize
[47:44.160 --> 47:48.080]  the veterans of this country to say you know what you're not putting me on a
[47:48.080 --> 47:52.600]  secret list to not be able to buy a gun they've been doing this since Clinton but
[47:52.600 --> 47:59.040]  now they're doing it to I mean the calls have had to increase 15 20 fold and the
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.720]  news articles about people who could go and that they just say sorry you're on a
[48:02.720 --> 48:09.080]  list you can't own a gun but I've done nothing wrong or it's like it's standard
[48:09.080 --> 48:11.920]  operating procedure even though the courts have ruled it's unconstitutional
[48:11.920 --> 48:17.800]  that a woman goes out to get a divorce it also happens to women as well men are
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.440]  now doing this and their lawyer files a restraining order and a judge will issue
[48:22.440 --> 48:26.160]  one you know if the if the woman says well he yelled at me once okay
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.680]  restraining order now you can't buy a gun and these men can't get off the list
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.040]  just because their wife during the divorce to seize the house and get
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.600]  control goes and gets a restraining order now you can't have a gun and now
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.160]  they're not just banning you going out without a law and and buying one now
[48:46.160 --> 48:50.440]  police are coming to people's houses or their businesses and saying mr. Johnson
[48:50.440 --> 48:58.640]  you got a restraining order on you for your wife turn your guns into us I mean
[48:58.640 --> 49:03.560]  since when in America is there no judge no jury no law the government just does
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.960]  whatever they want and then the Buffalo News reports four days ago we put it out
[49:08.960 --> 49:14.520]  as the top search term two days ago that if you are disgruntled in any way and
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.640]  credit the government now admits we're listening to your phones your emails we've
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.160]  got microphones on street corners this is in the news and the government just
[49:23.160 --> 49:28.800]  gave a hundred and fifty three million dollars to roll out a computer system to
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.400]  tie all this together to the federal and state governments and police are
[49:33.400 --> 49:37.520]  sitting there nodding their heads in meetings all over the country and they're
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.520]  being told you are now going to have access to everyone's phone calls and
[49:40.520 --> 49:45.920]  emails without a warrant we're listening to everyone the computers are tracking
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.480]  everything and the main group you're going to watch is a veterans does a
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.640]  veteran criticize the government but it gets worse the article says they'll be
[49:55.640 --> 49:58.920]  able to face scan you this is already up nationwide and if you're making ugly
[49:58.920 --> 50:05.720]  faces you'll go on the list I mean it's so bizarro world if I made a science
[50:05.720 --> 50:10.080]  fiction movie 20 years ago it would be a comedy if it had stuff in it like this
[50:10.080 --> 50:18.160]  it's so that's what I'm saying it's so off the chart that I can't even believe
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.480]  it but they're just doing it they don't give radiation badges to the feds
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.000]  driving around with the x-ray trucks those guys are dead in the door now we've
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  had radiologists on the show not just callers who say they're radiologists we've
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.360]  had engineers and radiologists on now I gotta have arguments with the idiot
[50:40.360 --> 50:44.840]  public no running x-ray machines every day well without standing behind a lead
[50:44.840 --> 50:48.560]  wall is gonna kill you I mean look I don't know how else I got explained this
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.120]  to you just like do you's killing your daughter in a hammer how many of you

[54:15.600 --> 54:21.920]  Security is funding Israeli companies to spy on veterans groups gun groups and
[54:21.920 --> 54:26.960]  others they are issuing law enforcement alerts for veterans that
[54:26.960 --> 54:30.760]  criticize anything the government does because they know you know how to fight
[54:30.760 --> 54:39.720]  I mean it's just it's it's so incredible and here's the headline at
[54:39.720 --> 54:43.880]  prisonplanet.com please get this out to everybody feds use pre-crime to target
[54:43.880 --> 54:49.160]  disgruntled veterans mind machine project reports to find domestic terrorists by
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.680]  building psychological profiles from illegally wiretap phone and email
[54:52.680 --> 54:56.840]  conversations and again the police sit there in these symposiums that they're
[54:56.840 --> 55:00.200]  rolling out to them and are told how they're completely breaking the law
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.720]  spying on everything I mean this is just the lawlessness this is real
[55:04.720 --> 55:09.080]  tyranny they're doing it and the government's contracting with foreign
[55:09.080 --> 55:11.960]  intelligence agencies to do it because they can't get enough feds to break the
[55:11.960 --> 55:15.240]  law the government seems to be obsessed with targeting disgruntled veterans
[55:15.240 --> 55:18.200]  with pre-crime and other unconstitutional forms of surveillance
[55:18.200 --> 55:22.160]  demonization and harassment the latest example being an Orwellian software
[55:22.160 --> 55:25.920]  program the reports to identify potential terrorists by analyzing the tone of phone
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.560]  conversations and emails to detect resentment towards government you're
[55:30.560 --> 55:33.720]  not allowed to do that in America America's about sitting down and
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.280]  shutting up and loving government doing whatever it says don't criticize
[55:37.280 --> 55:41.280]  government-run health care don't criticize gun control the Massachusetts
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.200]  Institute of Technologies mind machine project which is currently being
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.720]  demonstrated to law enforcement officials not servants officials around the
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.600]  country is primarily aimed at weeding out troubled veterans that's a quote from
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.920]  the Buffalo news who may be I mean they were at the symposium maybe planning to
[55:57.920 --> 56:02.040]  commit terrorist bombings or political assassinations by legally wiretapping
[56:02.040 --> 56:05.640]  their phone calls internet communications in order to build psychological
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.640]  profiles as we reported yesterday the program reports to be able to identify
[56:10.640 --> 56:13.520]  resentment towards government that's that was the number one search during
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.520]  yesterday good job folks which is characterized by the technologies
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.680]  proponents at some kind of mental illness that requires the intervention of
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.360]  health professionals see because this is all outside the law they've committed
[56:25.360 --> 56:29.600]  no crime but men in white suits come and if you don't like it the SWAT team comes
[56:29.600 --> 56:35.840]  or worse a trait of domestic terrorists planning imminent attacks why is the
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.520]  government so intent on targeting veterans as likely terrorists seemingly
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.640]  unconcerned about Muslim extremists hiding in caves in Central Asia wasn't
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.920]  all of this setup for that no it was always set up for us the big sis DHS
[56:48.920 --> 56:52.160]  anti-terror machine has been firmly pointed towards the American people with
[56:52.160 --> 56:55.920]  the government making every effort to subject its own citizens to measures that
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.280]  were supposedly introduced to fight foreign extremists the latest example
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.400]  being federal checkpoints that radiate American truckers with x-ray devices at
[57:03.400 --> 57:07.840]  highway inspection stations having already had their benefits slash and
[57:07.840 --> 57:10.840]  their right to self-defense eviscerated with the passage of the so-called
[57:10.840 --> 57:14.920]  veterans the Sarmat Act men and women who serve their country are now being
[57:14.920 --> 57:19.880]  treated with more disdain than drug smugglers and illegals coming across
[57:19.880 --> 57:24.080]  the border from Mexico in May of 2009 the New York Times reported on how
[57:24.080 --> 57:27.960]  Boy Scouts were being trained by Homeland Security and FBI to disarm
[57:27.960 --> 57:31.360]  and forcibly arrest quote we have a link to this we're not making this up
[57:31.360 --> 57:36.920]  disgruntled Iraqi war veterans who were characterized in the exercises domestic
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.400]  terrorists and they're training the 14 year olds now 16 year olds to go out and
[57:41.400 --> 57:45.720]  hunt down and kill veterans who wouldn't turn their guns in I mean this is in the
[57:45.720 --> 57:51.080]  news and they're saying it's good oh look at these lovely little Eugen ten
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.440]  minutes into errant mayhem in their town near the Mexican border at gunman but
[57:55.440 --> 57:58.440]  his grunt of the Iraqi war veteran has already taken two people taken out two
[57:58.440 --> 58:02.160]  people one slumped on a desk that I'm quoting the New York Times the other
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.520]  covered in blood on the floor so they always cast the vets as killers began
[58:07.520 --> 58:10.920]  the article later describing how Boy Scouts were told by federal agent to put
[58:10.920 --> 58:14.760]  him on his face and put a knee in his back I guarantee he'll shut up they
[58:14.760 --> 58:19.280]  teach him how to torture people veterans were again targeted in the April 2009

[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.640]  radicalization and recruitment the report warned the number one threat is

[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.960]  grunt of military veterans especially veterans returning from the wars in
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.480]  Iraq and Afghanistan who were demonized as potential terrorist the return of
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.520]  military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.600]  communities could lead to potential emergencies an emergence of terrorist
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.920]  groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks yeah like
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.240]  when somebody finds out that they were soft killed with DU they're just supposed

[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.440]  could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.080]  extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks of the report quoting
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:48.480]  american supposed best and brightest al-qaeda bombers dhs chief janet
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.920]  napolitano to see the terrorists don't like you the homeland security stages
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.040]  that the terror attacks they stage the cyber attacks all of it so they're the
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.200]  terrorists and they're worried you're gonna find out they're the terrorist
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.160]  that's why they've got glenbeck rush limbaugh steven cobear steward on the
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.320]  left all attacking 9-11 truth this week because they're worried because their
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.920]  bosses need to be able to keep bombing stuff so they can point all this at you
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.040]  it's real simple they blow stuff up claim it's for a foggy enemy build a
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.120]  giant apparatus the whole time that was designed for you and now that's admitted
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.240]  so now they're gonna blow stuff up and say you did it you understand how that
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:28.520]  works it's real simple this is how they arrest you they're terrorist and their
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.800]  little mouthpieces are part of the terrorism dhs chief janet napolitano
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.120]  was subsequently forced to apologize the veterans for the report a token
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.000]  gesture which did not satisfy veterans organizations that were deeply offended
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.640]  at the content of the homeland security assessment how about the veterans
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:49.440]  associations complained about gun groups you know being targeted as terrorists
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.840]  how about veterans complained about how they're having their second amendment
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.840]  taken away for no reason
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.280]  pete hegseth chairman of vets for freedom responded it wasn't an apology in
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.880]  my view it was one of those non-apology apologies she was sorry that the
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.680]  veterans were offended she should either apologize for the content of the report
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.960]  as it stands or they should rewrite the report is and reissue it the whole thing
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.880]  is for you it wasn't just that one report despite the apology big sister
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.680]  polatano homeland security the rest of the federal bureaucracy continue to make
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.920]  it clear that military veterans of the primary target of the war on terror with
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.680]  the revelation that authorities are seriously looking at mit's new pre-crime
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.080]  software as a useful tool with which to spy on the vets private communications
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.000]  they're already doing this they're just now rolling it out identify emotional
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.600]  spikes and betray resentment towards government these are quotes and that
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:50.400]  target them with surveillance designed to be used on suspected terrorist while
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.160]  the CIA blocks a lawsuit brought by veterans concerning illegal experiments
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.280]  on troops between the 50s and 70s and while police officers beat those same
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.320]  veterans nearly to death we have links to that the authorities not the servants
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.840]  continue to make vets the number one domestic target of the war on terror a
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.600]  sobering reminder of the fact that the feds have identified the American people
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.720]  as their main enemy and are now focusing the vast and expanding force of big
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.040]  government against those who have considered themselves patriots for
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.320]  their entire lives but they know you're gonna wake up to who the real terrorists
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.120]  are that America's been taken over by offshore mega corporations they know
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.760]  that you're waking up to all of this and they are coming after you homeland

[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.520]  high-tech sleeve and that it is expanding against all of us and the problem is
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.680]  the government can give questionnaire to the TSA the troops the FBI the police
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:53.680]  and can always find a willing reservoir of useful idiots who like petty power

[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:26.080]  October 1st 2010 Mike Adams the health ranger and his lovely wife have arrived
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.920]  here at the studios in studio here in Austin Texas he'll be on with us in the
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:37.040]  next hour to talk about a host of key issues but I was just completing going
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:46.000]  over this article feds use pre-crime to target disgruntled veterans and I wanted
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.080]  to first talk about this with Bob Chapman before we get into the economy
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.320]  and Rupert Murdoch calling for legalization of 40 million illegal
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.760]  aliens so they can get them on the political take and have the Chicago
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.160]  mafia machine completely take over the country but but more and more veterans
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.320]  are starting to understand that the entire Homeland Security system is
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.560]  pointed at them and true patriots we are the enemy of this criminal corporate
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.040]  state known as the New World Order but I'm just amazed that they can come out
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:23.400]  in AP Buffalo News wired magazine and admit okay Homeland Security is already
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.320]  trolling your phone calls your emails everything and of a veteran or anybody
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.880]  else mildly criticizes the government they say we're gonna surveil you more
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.720]  I mean this is a active chilling effect they're coming out and going okay we are
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.400]  breaking the law we are watching all of you you see this whole Homeland Security
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.320]  thing it's set up for you and they know most people police veterans bureaucrats
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.400]  are cowards deep down okay and on average I would say veterans have more
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.760]  courage in the general public you know they have the courage and they've done
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.960]  psychological studies on this where you know somebody the military will charge a
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.280]  machine gun nest of ordered to but it takes more courage to say no to their
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.240]  commander if they're being told to do something immoral like a massacre and so
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:12.600]  that's my point is they play on their fears and know that at a subconscious
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.640]  level we all have a little coward in us and that people will then well this is
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.880]  scary well I'm for whatever Homeland Security does I love naked body scanners
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.800]  I love the bank stealing trillions I love corruption you know I don't see
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.880]  anything I hear nothing I see nothing I speak nothing you know it's like the
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.720]  little monkey covering its eyes its ears and its mouth the three monkeys
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.200]  because you know I'm involved in Orwellian Crime Stop you know I don't
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.440]  care a big brother said we were never at war with East Asia and now we've always
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.160]  been at war with East Asia I'm gonna go along with this because I don't want to
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.960]  get watched and they're trying to invoke this panoptagonic system where
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.320]  everybody is afraid no the answer is to come out and say look you crooks we know
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.920]  you staged the terror attacks we know you did it to set up a police state for
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.720]  the American people I could read the Patriot Act it said it section 802 for
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.080]  the American people for misdemeanors we know this is a corporate takeover and
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.680]  we're aware of what you're doing I mean this is the big issue the the whole
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:17.920]  Homeland Security police state grid was set up and is being expanded for good
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.160]  people if you're not a crook and you're not part of this corruption you are the
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:29.480]  enemy and you can't run the white flag up to these people Bob Bob Chapman you
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.760]  know veteran military intelligence biggest private silver and gold broker
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.880]  in history had the biggest newsletter you know went into retirement have come
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.560]  back with the international forecaster why can something like this be so big so
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.600]  out in the open and they're starting to people are starting to recognize it
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.040]  starting to talk about it this radio show is really trying to force this out
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.320]  in the mainline debate and we're starting to get some some some some toe
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.560]  holes here but but I mean this is just so blatantly obvious Bob well it's an
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.800]  evolutionary process they have to have a enemy that they think they can control
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:11.640]  and they think in a final analysis even though these people are courageous
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.040]  otherwise they wouldn't have been doing what they were doing in behalf of our
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:22.760]  government they want them to be in a position with a rock balance and if they
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.520]  continually attack them and then okay with the public things because they
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.000]  don't think the public's going to do anything I mean the veterans groups will
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.880]  speak out as you just shown and and perhaps some others but by and large
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:45.720]  you're not going to hear much the the the I would say it's a a move that's
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:53.200]  being made to set up a larger move later the interception of electronic
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.840]  communications of one kind or another is something that they're going to put
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.040]  online and a lot of these people are outspoken and they're really afraid of
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.160]  them because let's have an example you have a demonstration it turns wild
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.920]  they bring in the National Guard and the people who were there say hey wait a
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.280]  minute wait a minute you know I used to belong to this unit I just came back
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.600]  from doing two tours in the in the Middle East I mean what are you trying to do
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.400]  to us and the guys and who are in uniform and say yeah yeah what are we
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.400]  doing here and by the way that's already happening in Spain and in Greece and
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.520]  all over Europe the police are joining the protesters and that happened we'll
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:43.560]  check with Chilchescu in Romania and that just happened down in Ecuador that
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:50.400]  that government is a toitering on the edge as well and you know people have
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:57.080]  been recommending that people who want to retire to go there because it's
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:03.600]  inexpensive and it's a it's a quiet life and that sort of thing and anytime you
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.920]  get a communist government you have the possibility of having real problems and
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.480]  I wouldn't be surprised if in the future the Venezuela didn't have the same kind
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:22.040]  of problems and Peru has shut their border I think with Bolivia but anyway
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.200]  these are the kind of things that are going on all over the world and what
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.880]  are the reasons is because of Alex Jones and people like him who are on the
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:36.640]  radio telling the people the truth and these broadcasts are going all over the
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.960]  world and believe me I know and I Alex knows too because he must get the same
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:49.440]  kinds of letters I get from all over the world in fact we've started carrying
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:57.640]  some of our information in Spanish as well as German and and that'll probably
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:03.600]  expand as we go on because it's easy if it's someone to read German if they're
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.480]  German that they would rather read it that way now Bob a dinner up for a
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.920]  moment we're rolling video on screen of the fall of Chilchescu in Romania when
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.480]  people just finally said we're not going along with his tyranny anymore in a
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.080]  matter of hours the general public just came out in mass and the police
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.040]  basically joined them because they had been educated and so that's why the
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.800]  demonization of veterans is going on that's why police I mean come on cops
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.080]  you're smart most police are veterans that's who they recruit from they're
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.800]  trying to train you to spy on and hate veterans and see it as quasi illegal to
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.360]  even mildly criticize the government they're trying to induct you into secret
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:51.080]  police them because they know that when you go into a real tyranny and you do
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.560]  have a command and control system what happened in Rome and it's happening in
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.640]  South America and what happens in Eastern Europe it happens in England in
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.840]  the last few hundred years that once they put a tyranny in the main group
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.040]  they've got a watch is the military and that's where the purges are that's where
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.040]  the terror and the secret arrest are gonna go on just like Hitler did after he
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.040]  got into power once they really take over we're getting to that point they're
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.800]  going to purge the military and police and so history is repeating itself so
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.960]  of course every time we get a homeland security report or the news reports on
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.440]  one of these events it's all about veterans it's all about gun owners it's
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:35.520]  all about police it's all about kicking cops out who don't go along with
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.800]  tyranny because a they've got to get a bunch of thugs in to carry out their
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.400]  takeover but be once they've engaged in their takeover they've got to fully
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.960]  surveil you because tyrants will come up through the military ranks and try to
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.680]  take over the system once you have a command and control shadow government
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.080]  and it comes out in the open then you can have coup d'etats within the
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.760]  structure and the bureaucracy over and over and over again and so this
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  scientific dictatorship has gauged all of that and is going after its number one
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:13.400]  enemy the military so you need to understand this Bob Chapman well I
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.000]  think you couldn't put it put it more eloquently because it's exactly what
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.360]  they're trying to do and that would pit the active forces and the police against
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.600]  the military and let the public know that these veterans are a bunch of crazy
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.640]  people who are terrorists and they're setting a precedent here they're
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.040]  setting a guideline a way to go somebody to pick on they're introducing the next
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.240]  enemy it's it's a what we built all this for brown guys with turbines but
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.440]  guess what you know it's now for that veteran it's that rancher it's that farm
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.080]  owner I mean that's what's in the reports it's that Ron Paul person real
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.400]  Americans that are opposing the criminal takeover that know what's going on the
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.760]  entire architecture is for us get it through your head this is 100% proof
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.800]  nine years after the stage attacks of 9-11 that I was right Bob was right we
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:11.080]  were right about all of this it is for us the attacks were staged to take over
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.360]  the planet including our country get it through your head this is the total
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.960]  proof they baited and switched they told you it was for foreigners thinking you'd
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.840]  be primitive and yeah we'll get them when they were running the foreign
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:30.360]  terrorist it was all to bring down the republic and this sort of thing Alex
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.080]  could lead to a coup d'etat and government they may have overreached here
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.480]  and there's a lot of disgruntled people within the military and they're in a
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.640]  command position you know the people in a Pentagon might think they run things
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.040]  but they don't they give orders to people and they run things and so that
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.200]  possibility exists and the American the military is not missing this one bit and
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:05.440]  I think the public is now catching on to what's going on regarding these talk
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.160]  shows that you mentioned earlier and the direction that they're trying to take
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:16.400]  people in and as we've said before 95% truth 5% propaganda and that's all they
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.400]  can hope for and they keep on doing it over and over and over again and we
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:26.720]  saw new Gallup pull numbers out this week in the last hundred years of Gallup
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.240]  the media has the lowest mainstream media has the lowest credibility in
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.680]  history it's like a lake turning suddenly things just flip they have
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.640]  already imploded they are out of gas that's why they're getting desperate
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.240]  trying to bring in tens of millions of illegals to join the military with the
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:50.200]  Dream Act to get dependent on government to be used as a counterbalance
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:55.040]  internally we'll talk about Rupert Murdoch says legalized 40 million illegal

[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:24.400]  generations went through unspeakable nightmares of death and destruction
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:31.400]  because they didn't stand up early on or even later when it became clear that
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:37.960]  the government was run by a bunch of crooks and you've got all these big
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:45.000]  Republicans now coming out in the news saying legalize as many as 40 million
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.440]  illegal aliens that they really want to get that done Rupert Murdoch calls for
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.040]  amnesty for law abiding illegal immigrants got to love that oxymoron
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:00.760]  and these reports are up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com it says
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.920]  Rupert Murdoch wants amnesty for millions of illegal aliens on Thursday
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.960]  appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on immigration Rupert Murdoch
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:13.600]  somebody from Australia nothing against you know folks from Auslan but I mean
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.440]  come on you got people from Australia Israel they just foreigners run
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.440]  everything and tell us what to do so of course he wants more foreigners Murdoch
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.560]  said he supports amnesty for law abiding illegal immigrants he did not
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.560]  explain how millions of people who have crossed the border and entered the
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:34.160]  country illegally can be considered law abiding and then I have another report
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.480]  here by Matt Ryan today at info wars dot com background checks required to
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.840]  visit your kids at school but the illegal aliens they're exempt the illegal
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:49.040]  aliens oh they don't have to do that and that's here in Austin Texas so and
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.440]  that's going on now all over the country we're going to be discussing that but
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:56.700]  Bob dealing with this open border issue why do the globalists want open
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:03.200]  borders well number one they want cheap labor they want more people paying
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.600]  taxes and social security that's when they want to legalize them they want
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.120]  cannon fodder to go into their wars they want disruption within the American
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.520]  culture and you're seeing that right now in Europe that we have Holland and
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:25.800]  Denmark and particularly France who are telling the Muslims look you know they
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.080]  can't wear workers around here and you want to do that do it inside your house
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.680]  but you can't do it on the street and I see the Muslims praying blocking whole
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:43.800]  section sections of Paris in other cities and it's being done deliberately
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.000]  now because it's illegal and the police are being told well don't disrupt them
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  we don't want any trouble and so people who are from outside sometimes put
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  sometimes push the issue and we've seen that with Larazer and some of the other
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.800]  groups in the United States and over in Paris and other places over there at
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:11.320]  the Muslims and you know these people are a minority in the country and they
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:16.960]  push it far enough and they'll have a serious problem and and particularly in
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.560]  Europe and globalist admit they did that by design they bring in these foreign
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:26.400]  groups that in many cases aren't really compatible with the culture then they
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.920]  get everybody fighting with each other and then government is the arbiter of
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.840]  that and takes everyone's liberties in the name of maintaining order that's
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:43.520]  exactly so and but I think it's going to get a lot worse this dichotomous
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.640]  situation being artificially caused by agents of government a few days and it's
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.360]  just like a false flag operation actually and so you're going to continue to see
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.320]  it and you're going to see the the vilification of veterans and and I'm
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.720]  sure the Tea Party and in other groups whether the guilty of anything and I
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:11.240]  doesn't make any difference and you got a lot of them up to go ahead and troll
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.640]  it's all leading up to control control well I mean look at it the troops are
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.760]  supposedly fighting terrorists but they're really there to get their
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.920]  resources and for a black hole for the government to pump money to the defense
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.360]  contractors and also shuttle drugs and arms around as it's come out with
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.080]  blackwater recently in federal depositions but then it does stir up the
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.200]  foreigners to actually fight back then that's called terrorism but then
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.760]  meanwhile they use the police state grid they've set up at home to defend the
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.400]  homeland to target the troops when they come home I mean you got to love this
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:53.360]  master strategic system well it's a master slave system is what it is and
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:59.400]  these poor young people who are coming back from spending four or five or six
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:04.220]  years in the military and being shot at every day they're finding out that now
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:09.680]  they're the enemy because they did what they signed up to do it it's very
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.080]  confusing to people because they're not used to psychological warfare they
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:19.680]  heard about it and they they've heard about it in the military in
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.320]  particular but they don't understand it and even a lot of people in the media
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:31.640]  don't that's right psychological warfare is very sophisticated but I
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.440]  challenge veterans current military people you better do some research
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:43.480]  because the federal criminal government spends all its time hating your guts and
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.320]  preparing to kill you dead in a hammer and they put soft kill weapons in your
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:55.200]  vaccines to get rid of you we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:04.080]  and the GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.080]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.880]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.560]  Americans at home I've turned in this influence on our president in Congress
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.960]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.800]  American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:32.920]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:36.840]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.640]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.480]  do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:50.480]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the

[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:27.480]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:39.240]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.640]  GCN radio network.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:23.240]  We're going back to Bob Chapman here in just a moment we've got the health
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:27.880]  ranger in studio coming up the next hour probably going to overdrive all week I've
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:33.040]  said that I would do a breakdown of how the New World Order works in a simplistic
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:39.800]  boil down using a chessboard as a prop and I will definitely briefly get to
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:45.120]  that in the next hour we can even show viewers a document cam shot of
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:49.760]  Jaren's chessboard that he was kind enough to bring in I've I've got
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.920]  several chessboards but the French Bulldog has eaten pieces from different
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:58.880]  ones so I didn't want to have a mixed and matched Mongol chessboard in here for
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.880]  you today so we have we have Jaren's Jaren's chessboard Jaren is a chess
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:11.400]  master himself I'm joking he may be joking but he had to have help and how
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.600]  to set the pieces up this is a nice gift though whoever gave you the chessboard
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:21.920]  Jaren all right ladies and gentlemen I look at this news day in and day out and
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:27.200]  it just freaks me out so I try to have some fun I I can't believe how real all
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:31.040]  this is I can't believe how right we've been and I just hope long-term listeners
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.880]  people who can go back and see films I made 13 years ago and TV shows I had
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.400]  15 years ago that are on the web and and just see how right we were I mean we've
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.600]  just studied history we looked at the facts and it's so horrible what's
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.880]  happening it it's it's so much worse than we even thought if we were wrong in
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.560]  any way it was that we underestimated how fast this
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:57.960]  degeneration would take place I mean the sky's the limit that the globalists
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:04.400]  are just out in the open now all right we're gonna go back to Bob here in just
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.920]  a moment because I want to get into the main issue why he's here the economy
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.800]  huge news on that front riots all over the planet we'll get into what's

[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:10.960]  pays a tidy sum to good old Bob and the information is worth it to have the
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:15.720]  newsletter either a digital version or a hard copy your subscription when you
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:25.920]  call 800 686 2237 and get one Frank 800 686 2237 Ted also told me they're
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:31.280]  bringing back an old special that is the hottest deal they've ever had and that
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.720]  is not now listen to me carefully he was telling me about it last night I don't
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.040]  even know I'm supposed to plug this yet but Ted was supposed to be here but he's
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.160]  stuck in a meeting with K talk in Minneapolis about getting me on there
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:46.000]  100,000 watt FM talk and so he's not here to tell you about it but he told me
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:54.880]  last night $26 to get a silver dollar and I forget which one it is but it's a
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:01.260]  it's a silver dollar US silver dollar then we said that a silver dollar 26
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:05.800]  dollars to get a silver dollar and the creature from Jack o'leil and I know
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.600]  Ted's paying $10 a piece for these books they retailed 1995 he pays ten bucks
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:16.320]  for a book and then you get a silver dollar for $26 so that's got to be
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:23.200]  about a $42 value at silver at spot being 22 plus bucks so essentially you
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:26.760]  end up getting the silver dollar for free hey is that a good deal Bob to get
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.440]  a silver dollar and a creature for Jack o'leil and for $26 Bob Chapman it
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:38.520]  certainly is and G Edward Griffin spent a friend of mine since 1964 and I pushed
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:43.000]  the heck out of his book and have ever since he published it he's a great guy
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:51.480]  and that deal is a super duper deal 800 686 2237 and I mean what coming because
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:59.720]  you watch the markets the macro but also the overall systems Bob you silver's at
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:06.520]  22 plus right now that's one of its highest rates in the last 30 years but
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:14.080]  going back here what are silver coins on average overall selling for a ounce of
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:22.720]  silver well right now the spot price is 2204 and the spot market is closed it's
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.800]  been closed about an hour and ten minutes and I expect it's going to
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.240]  continue to go higher along with gold I saw the US government in there today
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:38.240]  banging away at it they banged away at the shares naked shorting trying to keep
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:46.560]  everything down and they can't do it what they have right now is a rush by other
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:54.280]  countries because China has been put under pressure by the Senate and how
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:59.880]  they've been put out of pressure is is that they're going to have tariffs to
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:06.800]  offset the undervalue of the Chinese currency and they contend the Chinese
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.320]  currency is 40% undervalue and they're absolutely correct and why they haven't
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:19.200]  acted 10 years ago I'll never know but Washington is a strange place but what's
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:25.040]  happening is everybody else is doing the same thing but everybody else was doing
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:30.920]  the same thing for the last 10 or 15 years so it's nothing new and you know I
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:38.240]  picked up an article this morning that came in and I like you pick up all
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.440]  kinds of stuff all day long and all I could do when I saw this was think of
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:55.680]  at two Brutus and that was Julius Caesar when the Brutus ran his sword into him and and here
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:01.920]  we have the Mexican Central Bank and what they're doing is they have just sold
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:09.480]  $600 million worth of US dollar options and they're doing that to weaken their
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:19.000]  currency that just went from and this is up this one up from 1325 to 1255 and
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.320]  they want to stop that because they want their goods to be competitive
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:32.280]  competitive with who with China Brazil etc and all the countries are doing this
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.760]  now you know from an American standpoint we're the ones who are getting
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.800]  hurt because we can't export anything because we can't compete with countries
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.800]  that continue to devalue their currency but this is what the G20 said they were
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:54.040]  going to do two years ago was a global concerted currency devaluation and
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.120]  that's your report out today it's up at info wars dot com but also the
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:02.480]  international forecaster dot com will put it back on screen the risk of
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.440]  currency devaluation why should the average schlub out there care about
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:15.600]  this because we can't export because we can't compete so what the US government
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:22.600]  has done is they have pushed down deliberately the value of the dollar by
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:27.400]  not paying attention to it so to speak because they have to make the dollar go
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.800]  down because everybody else is pushing their currencies down this isn't
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:38.080]  official it's unofficial and you're going to continue to see this now and what
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:45.480]  gets me is the only other professional beside myself that I know about Paul
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:51.160]  Craig Roberts is the only one who was called for tariffs on goods and services
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:58.880]  and stiff ones like 40 or 50 percent across the board you know that the
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.400]  tariffs back in the early 1930s they range from 5 to 15 percent that was
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.520]  really nothing and everybody else did the same thing so it really wasn't a
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.040]  factor in why there was a depression even though the Keynesians and that's a
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:22.440]  philosophy of economics would lead you to believe that that was a prime reason
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.320]  and it wasn't but they're in control and we're not so the only way to solve this
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:32.200]  is have tariffs and it would be the best thing that ever happened to America
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:37.080]  because all of these countries especially the transnational corporations
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:42.480]  that moved all of their production out of America now if they build a car in
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:48.520]  China or India or Mexico or Brazil and they sent it into the United States they
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.760]  put a 40 percent tariff on it there's not much sense in continuing to
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.880]  manufacture these things in other countries with slave labor so we've
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:04.320]  already seen massive deindustrialization which the UN and others admit is
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:08.360]  their plan so they can control us and they've also made huge profits by
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.680]  having sweetheart deals with China but now I'm reading about China increasing
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.680]  tariffs even on things like chicken I mean they won't even let us import chicken
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.560]  to them and because we have the biggest sell-out government we're in the worst
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:26.920]  position so that's adding insult to injury overall with your long-term
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:32.880]  forecast for the ongoing depression we're sliding into how do you adjust your
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:37.120]  forecast on the overall global economic outlook all the numbers coming out that
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.840]  indeed the middle class is disappearing not just here but also in Europe and
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.600]  around the world and we also have all these reports coming out about rioting
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:50.520]  all over the world as people's taxes go up where do you see this going Bob
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:57.560]  well I think the approach has been and will be continued to be in the United
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:03.480]  States by the Fed and by the Treasury of the creation of money and credit and I
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.520]  think that will aggregate something on the order of about five trillion dollars
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:15.080]  over the next two years and all it will do is allow the American economy to
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:20.480]  function sideways maybe slightly higher and it's not going to be successful
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:26.120]  and they know that and I think Europe which just raised in general just raised
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.680]  taxes and having austerity and you see the results of that they're going to
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.760]  have to do the same thing all they're going to immediately go into a
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.680]  deflationary depression and they know that now maybe they're they want to be
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:45.200]  the leaders of the pack and six months or a year from now enter deflationary
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:49.920]  depression I don't know what their plan is what does deflationary inflation look
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:58.040]  like unemployment of 50 percent or more wages not only staying the same but
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:06.600]  going down public services being decimated austerity like we're seeing
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:12.800]  already in Europe where retirement ages are being changed the amount of
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:17.360]  retirement income is being changed it's going on all over the world it's
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:22.720]  coordinated and that is going to continue and you know you pop up and you
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.800]  say my goodness gracious well I get some money here and I already got food in the
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.640]  filter and I get some weapons so what do I do with my money what we can I put it
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:37.800]  that I'll be safe there's only one place gold and silver maybe come out of
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:43.120]  these if you're sophisticated enough but other than that forget it now Bob none of
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.560]  that matters though that the banks have engineered this collapse they're having
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.120]  continuity of agenda global coordination they admit they engineered it in their
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.840]  white papers none of that matters because the head of the CIA Panetta says
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.640]  Al Qaeda wants to hit Europe in the US and they're doing everything they can to
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:04.560]  keep us safe and Al Qaeda you know may be involved in this new worm even though
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.160]  Israel basically admits they did it they need to take over the internet shut down
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:12.680]  free speech to protect us from the government's own worm and here's Fox
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:17.840]  News US official bin Laden believed to be involved in European plot he's back
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:24.480]  after nine years we better give up all of our rights Bob or bin Laden bin Laden
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:28.560]  is going to get as it doesn't matter if 95% of all the homeland security
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.480]  trainings to go after gun owning Americans no no no give your rights up
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:38.040]  it's for bin Laden but Bob I'm so scared right now I'm not worried about the
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:41.560]  depression and the open borders and the crime exploding and the kidnappings all
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:46.000]  over the US and society degenerating and the cancer viruses and the vaccines and
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.280]  the mobile x-ray vans and and and the total end of the Fourth Amendment I'm
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:57.440]  worried about bin Laden he's so scary well I'm sure that Leon I helped dig
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:06.760]  him up because he's been dead that long and and that's why they took the
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:12.400]  Indian woman out in Pakistan yeah Budo came out and said this is absolute
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.560]  bull he died a kidney failure here's the date and they said you're dot you die
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.600]  and our media is so controlled all over Europe all over Asia a hundred percent
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.920]  confirmed videotape of her being machine gun getting in her car and our media
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.520]  said she hit her head that's how dumb they think Americans are she and then
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.200]  they said al-qaeda killed her but I've had the former head of Pakistani
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:41.560]  intelligence on he says Dick Cheney said kill her she says bin Laden alive die
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:47.200]  but Dick Cheney wouldn't do that he's a Christian Bob well I want to tell you
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.520]  something and this is inside information when she left Pakistan some
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:59.600]  years ago and she went to London MI6 arranged for all of her goods and
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.640]  things to be shipped out on a British plane and when it was time for her to
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:11.760]  go back well they shipped it all back for her ever since she was in Harvard she
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:20.680]  was a CIA and MI6 operative and they must have been hard-pressed to get rid of
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:26.720]  her and I know that people in the CIA were really upset because one of her
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.080]  best friends was my roommate we were called counterintelligence and he was
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:37.800]  furious but you know you play with the devil you got to pay and that's probably
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.720]  the reason why did she flip I mean why did she decide to go for policy just
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.480]  got fed up with the whole thing and said that this is what's going down the
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:51.440]  guys did and they just took her out he can they can't have people in that kind
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.120]  of a position saying those kind of things they got a control every but Bob she
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:00.880]  hit her head Fox News said she hit her head she just fell down she wasn't a
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.960]  assassinate certainly wasn't alcohol an alcoholic because she didn't drink I know
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.520]  a great deal about the woman no she hit her head mm-hmm now but I'm being
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:14.080]  sarcastic for two days they said she hit her head then they had to go okay she
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.800]  was shot but but I mean going back so when you were in counterintelligence you
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:23.840]  were roommates what in Germany with her friend or yeah that's right and he went
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:29.680]  on to a long and very distinguished career in the State Department his name
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:36.360]  is Peter Galbraith John Kenneth Brown break son and the brother of Jim Galbraith
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.120]  who's an economist from that infamous place called Texas tell you what Bob we

[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:10.600]  by the way if you just joined us at the end of the last segment I wasn't joking
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.840]  if you go back to the news the first two days at Budo got assassinated that
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:22.320]  motorcade our media said she hit her head on the car and it was on television
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.320]  her being machine gun but they didn't show that here that's how controlled our
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.000]  media is but then once all that leaked they said oh yeah we were wrong somebody
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.560]  shot her it was bin Laden bin Laden's people they did it I mean this is how
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.360]  insane it is so Bob going back you know the names everything you can tell us
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:47.200]  about I mean of course it's come out in some of the news that she was being
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.280]  run by the MI6 but you're saying you've got specifics and there is the Guardian
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:57.240]  headline Ben is our Budo assassinated shot twice than bomb exploded that's what
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:02.920]  she gets for driving around in an open car with a bullhorn but Bob that goes
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.920]  back to how dumb they think we are telling us that she hit her head I was
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.960]  just reminding people of that but I mean without me interrupting go over what
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.840]  you were talking about well I think you know the bottom line is that we've
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:19.200]  covered most of it but it's one of the reasons and it's a good reason I didn't
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:28.280]  stay doing what I was doing and become a career diplomat or work for the agency
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.400]  or for NSA NSA was actually who we work for and it was in the early days of
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:41.320]  NSA and the CIA there's a moment but the the things that I learned I mean turned
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:47.720]  me upside down and I was a street smart kid who was a very high IQ and so I I
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.840]  knew that I just couldn't engage in that and of course you know Peter went on and
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:56:00.840]  it would it fit their lifestyle the Harvard thing so to speak and he went
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.840]  on to work in the State Department for years and I've been on programs when
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:12.280]  people from the State Department will either call in or email in and tell me
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:18.240]  yeah everything you say is true and and I say how do you know and they said well
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:26.120]  Peter was my boss for about 25 years so it goes to form in fact one of the
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:32.720]  people who was in my outfit was Porter Goss who became the head of the Central
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:39.920]  Intelligence Agency and I was better at my job than he was well reportedly Porter
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.960]  had to go as as director of Central Intelligence because he was visiting
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:50.720]  those special floors of the Watergate little too often well I had heard that
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:59.160]  but to me it was hearsay but that could be I mean who knows all kinds of things
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:06.280]  go on and in that kind of a lifestyle you can't trust anybody I mean it's a
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:13.080]  terrible way to live I mean I I run into people today that tell me well and they
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:19.160]  may be we're listening to this program today my dad was the head of
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:27.000]  counter and counter insurgency against narcotics in Latin America for years and
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.720]  he said I have to be very careful when I go to places like Mexico where he
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:36.280]  uncovered a lot of people who were doing what they weren't supposed to do in the
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:42.320]  drug trade and had them incarcerated and things like that and it's you know you
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:49.360]  do the right thing and it's a miserable life it's not a good life and then
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.920]  meanwhile if you have worked for the government they're surveilling you all
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:58:00.560]  the time and teaching a new crop of morons that you're a terrorist and that's
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:05.000]  one big thing the globalists have going against them they've made this shift to
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.880]  really trying to hire stupid people to be their enforcers but stupid people
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:15.840]  aren't that good at doing their job well I never forget I had a lunch one day
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:22.400]  with Ali North and one of the top people in the DEA and one of the things
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:26.200]  that struck me because they were working closely with the Colombians he said to
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:31.720]  me that they are somebody out of teach them all how to kill each other
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.680]  well that's what they're certainly teaching us how to do with these open
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.800]  borders stay with us five more minutes Bob I've got more questions on the

[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:32.040]  going into the fourth hour today on this Friday edition a lot of other news I've
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.440]  even gotten to yet but I want to get into all things health the approval of GMO
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:41.440]  salmon and the government doesn't want you to be able to even know if it's GMO
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:45.520]  or not that is a huge precedent setting event we're gonna be talking about that
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:49.760]  but Ted Anderson did get back in time from his meeting and Ted good to have
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.360]  you here because I wanted to have Bob talk a little bit about gold and we've
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.280]  got flames of anger strikes and fury spread over Europe the risk of currency
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:07.720]  devaluation gold hitting an all-time high of what 1317 today we've got all
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:13.280]  of this incredible news coming out and I wanted to have you throw out today's
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.680]  gold and silver offer that I know you're able to hold through Sunday and if
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.560]  people want about a month ago you know this was gold 100 something lower than
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:24.480]  it is now you're almost about to run out of the gold you bought a few weeks ago
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.520]  so that savings will disappear and then gold will go up even more the evident
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:32.200]  shows and you know people be getting the gold you bought this week that's still
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.480]  going to be lower than it is in a few weeks the way this trend is going with
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:38.760]  many of the futures according to Bloomberg being at 1500 in fact the
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.960]  majority by December I don't know if that's gonna happen let me just briefly
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.000]  as we're almost out of time Bob in a nutshell where do you see gold going in
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.400]  the next three months straight up now we're gonna go up through somewhere
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:57.160]  between 15 and 1650 we'll back and fill and after that I think they'll take a
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:03.720]  shot of 2000 maybe even higher they can't stop it now they being the cartel
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:09.080]  that is continuing to try to keep gold down because it makes the dollar and
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:14.200]  everything else look bad and it's not working for them anymore and I see them
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:18.000]  in the market today trying to drive it down they just can't do it and so you
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.640]  want to be long gold and silver assets and you want to do it right now Ted
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.920]  Anderson tell us today super offers that are only available for radio listeners
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:31.480]  and this is good through Sunday evening correct Ted yeah it's good through
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:34.680]  Sunday evening and the only reason why I didn't raise prices is because I think
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.920]  I might have you on k-talk I was just getting out of a meeting with their
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:42.840]  PD over there and I was just excited as ever to be able to 100,000 watt blow
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.560]  towards Ted so you were unable to raise prices because you're the boss up there
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:51.680]  at minus so this is it this is gold you bought weeks ago you're gonna be able to
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.120]  pick up walking Liberty halves for me clear through Sunday at 1050 with
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:02.680]  silver now man I tell you a goal to hit 1321 80 so far silver 2217 Bob excuse me
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:09.800]  did you just say 13 1320 1321 80 I mean it it Alice it's breaking through all
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:16.080]  the resistance so yeah guys Google gold and put up a headline about this I
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:21.720]  guarantee it'll be headlines everywhere 1321 Bob that's amazing their
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:26.880]  speechless on CNBC and Bloomberg I got them both on here
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.800]  all right folks if you want to get gold what did you buy this stuff in the
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.520]  market at like what 1270 or so Ted let's just let's just put it this way I'm
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:40.560]  starting to lose money on transactions because I haven't raised prices I mean
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:45.080]  Frank's are a 283 62 you're not gonna find those out there anywhere especially
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:48.200]  considering the fact that you can get that full year subscription to Bob's
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:52.360]  newsletter it doesn't take a rocket scientist if you're offering the creature
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:59.360]  from Jekyll Island a 1995 value book and a silver dollar for 26 bucks that it
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.280]  doesn't take a rocket scientist that you're losing money on that now that
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:07.520]  one I'm losing money and it but it educates the people it gets people
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.200]  informed I mean people should know what the Fed is all about the truth is you're
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:17.800]  awesome 800 686 2237 and of course you ran out of the buffalos at that price
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.000]  that was hundreds of dollars was I mean I'll be lucky to get onesie twosies if
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.040]  you call in for him and you're looking for the buffalo just to ask the sales
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:28.680]  people and you know they'll do what they can to but you're not gonna buy you
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.960]  know a hundred of them that's for sure it's just the mint stop making them so
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.480]  you know 800 686 2237 well this is the all-time record for gold day after day

[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:07.080]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:11.360]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.160]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:18.800]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.760]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:35.240]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:39.160]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:03.680]  the next thing that's coming to you
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:09.680]  waging war on corruption
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:11.680]  all right you are a ghost

[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:22.680]  ladies and gentlemen
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:26.680]  we've had this up since it started this morning at
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:30.680]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com we'll try to get the former head of Pakistani
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:34.680]  intelligence general hami ghoul on sometime next week
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:37.680]  we're launching that right now
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.680]  attempt to get the general on last two times he's been on we've been contacted
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.680]  by his people
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.680]  second attack on nato convoy in Pakistan
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:49.680]  assailants in pakistan launched two separate attacks friday on vehicles
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:53.680]  carrying fuel for nato and american forces in afghanistan highlighting the
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:57.680]  vulnerability of us led mission a day after pakistan closed a major border
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.680]  crossing a truck driver and his assistant were burned alive in a second
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:05.680]  attack on a single tanker in the parking lot of the restaurant of the
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:11.680]  southeastern province the police officer Muhammad azim said the anti-state
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:17.680]  elements were behind the attack the the problem is mercenaries have been caught
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.680]  staging attacks in my six commandos special our services have been caught
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:24.680]  staging attacks in iraq london guardian i mean they've been caught
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:28.680]  so you never know what's really behind this it'll take time to analyze it and
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.680]  look at it
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:32.680]  but because they've increased drone attacks and they admittedly do it to
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.680]  weddings
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:37.680]  two groups of innocent people because these are tribal folks they will then
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.680]  try to come kill you and come kill our troops and then the media could say
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.680]  look there's a real war there that's why we're there see the globalists don't
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:47.680]  care of troops die in fact they like it
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:51.680]  they like them using du they like using them as guinea pigs with the vaccines
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:56.680]  they like doing secret chemical and biological test on people
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.680]  and so if they're getting trillions and trillions a year through these fake wars
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:04.680]  in oil and weapons sales and no bid contracts
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:11.680]  are they then going to stage a few things or provocateur
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:15.680]  or kill people's families so they fight back and then it's called terrorism
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:20.680]  it's it's it's very very simple how all of this works so
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:23.680]  looks like that war is kicking into high gear just like
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:29.680]  Vietnam and now we're seeing all these ridiculous news reports about
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.680]  bin Laden uses the floods to drum up support in Pakistan he's running
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.680]  everything and and he wants to attack Europe so we better give up all our rights
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:42.680]  or Al Qaeda is going to get us it's it's incredible now we're going to be live
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:47.680]  into the next hour and next hour I'm gonna open the phones up for Mike Adams
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:53.680]  the health ranger who is here in studio with us today and we're also going to
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:57.680]  talk a little bit about some of the things he's been seeing down in
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:03.680]  South America in Ecuador and surrounding areas of course soldiers in
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:09.680]  Ecuador have refused have rescued president or Rafael Carrera from a
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.680]  police hospital where he was being held by force the troops open fired on
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:17.680]  dissonant law enforcement officers the state of emergency has been declared
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:20.680]  in the country following police protest against new government austerity
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:24.680]  measures which would cut off their benefits so got the police out there
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.680]  really angry about that and so you're from down in that neck of the woods
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:32.680]  we'll get your take on that as well and we're gonna talk about a whole host
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:36.680]  of health issues they're trying to take over the family farms and ranches
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:42.680]  legislation the bombshell issue of saying we're gonna put GMO with eel genes
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:47.680]  and insect genes got a bunch of varieties we're gonna approve it and then
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:51.680]  we're not gonna let you have a label on it to know if it's GMO I mean that
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:55.680]  sets the precedent for so much Mike Adams good to have you here buddy
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.680]  it's great to be here Alex always pleasure to be on your show what it's
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:03.680]  great to have you what brings you to the good old USA and what's your take on
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.680]  what's happening down in Ecuador well as you know I lived in Ecuador on and off
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:11.680]  for a couple of years I talked to some of my friends who live in the southern
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:16.680]  portion of the country not a lot has changed in the south but up in the
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.680]  north in Quito where this was taking place yeah a lot of action you gotta realize
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.680]  the police there they're really underfunded I mean they're good people
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:29.680]  but they're underfunded and they felt like their benefits for being cut it felt
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.680]  like an attack to them and there's a lot of frustration among the population
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:38.680]  I talked to taxi drivers down there for example and prices are going up and up
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:42.680]  on everything the food the basics that they need and a lot of that's because
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:46.680]  of the money the monetary policy that you cover here global concerted
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.680]  devaluation absolutely and it's hitting them hard their families are having to
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:54.680]  make tough decisions and in some parts of the country like why kill which is the
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:58.680]  largest city where there's some unrest right now you know it's tough for them
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:02.680]  to make ends meet and so when the police saw their benefits getting cut
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:07.680]  they decided to take some rather radical action that was of course you know
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:13.680]  illegal under the country and Correa survived and now you know
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:16.680]  whatever you think of Correa he's going to be perceived as a hero so I was
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.680]  mispronouncing it is Correa yeah it's Correa it's but in any case he's
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:25.680]  you know he's educated in the US graduated from the University of Illinois
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:30.680]  with a with PhD in economics and well it's come on over and over again that a
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:34.680]  lot of these Asian Latin American African leaders are like Goldman Sachs
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:39.680]  operatives economic hitmen what's the case with him well it's hard to
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:42.680]  characterize him I wouldn't say he's an economic hitman but I would say that
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:48.680]  there are economic hitmen who are trying to influence him and he's a hard guy
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:53.680]  to to influence and he's in fact he's taking some actions against the US
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:58.680]  about the military bases for example but he also leans a little bit you know
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:03.680]  towards Chavez so it's hard to say the same thing happened to Chavez
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:08.680]  back in 2002 one month before it happened Greg Palace the BBC said
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:11.680]  watch there's about to be a coup and the military grabbed him put him on a
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.680]  helicopter to I guess trump up charges and put him in prison like Noriega
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.680]  or something and the military turned back and said you better bring him
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:24.680]  right back yeah well I would say that the situation in Ecuador for people
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.680]  living there is really pretty much normal but at the top in the capital this
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:34.680]  isn't over yet probably and you're going to see some more action
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:38.680]  political action you're going to see him clean house throughout the police force
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:42.680]  they're going to be arrest they're going to be you know people prosecuted
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:47.680]  for treason for sure well we understand why in our own government
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:51.680]  almost all of the actual anti-terror training is for
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:55.680]  actually military and police officers and stuff this whole grid
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.680]  because once you go into a third world type situation this is what's always
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:02.680]  happening so when you look at the Ram Corporation and others they're designing
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:07.680]  a system to bring in tyranny cut the pay of the police but then basically
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:12.680]  have purges against them yeah exactly and when you start cutting the pay
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:17.680]  of law enforcement and requiring them to do more work for example remember
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.680]  when they had post office workers you're supposed to spy on everybody
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:26.680]  you know they have to do more work take more risks report more intel to the
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:30.680]  government for less pay you know they start getting angry about that and in
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:36.680]  South America the police are in some ways a paramilitary force
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:39.680]  I mean they can set up roadblocks well they are here now too I mean once your
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:45.680]  country falls into squalor that's what happens yes yeah so I perhaps
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.680]  what's happening in Ecuador is a precursor to some of what could be going
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:53.680]  on here in North America in the near future if people get angry enough
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.680]  that's my take on it well Bloomberg reported 46 states on the verge of
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:01.680]  bankruptcy and they're already having police layoffs in some cases more than
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.680]  60% of major sheriff's departments police departments and the police are even
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:09.680]  the news saying we've been told just raise revenue we can't respond if you're
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.680]  being robbed right and so they go out and start writing more speeding tickets
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:17.680]  and doing whatever they can to raise revenue but that's not the point we need
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:20.680]  to be stopping the real criminals who you know the big criminals are the crooks
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.680]  in Washington not not the people speeding down the road right that's who we
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.680]  need to be focusing on in terms of law enforcement you know where's the
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:31.680]  Department of Justice on the big issues that matter we're going to go to break
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:34.680]  in a moment but I do want to introduce you most listeners don't need an
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:37.680]  introduction but Mike Adams the health ranger founded naturalnews.com an

[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:43.680]  notice he's carrying his own food around with him got a backpack of it and I
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.680]  mentioned some health just by you being in the room here Mike has also now made
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:50.680]  it his life mission to share the most remarkable discovery he made in his
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:54.680]  quest the vast majority of all diseases can be easily prevented and even cured
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:58.680]  without drugs or surgery health ranger.org natural news.com we've got him
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:01.680]  linked up at info wars.com we're going to break in two minutes you're going to be
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:05.680]  with us for at least another hour so 30 minutes into the next hour and we're
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:09.680]  going to take calls next hour but what do you want to talk about because I've
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.680]  thrown a lot of issues here but but but on your radar what's most important what
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:16.680]  are you going to talk about when we come back on the other side well number one is
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:20.680]  the GMO salmon issue the FDA looks like it's about to approve genetically
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:25.680]  engineered salmon and it will not require it to be labeled which means you
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.680]  won't know if you're buying salmon that has been engineered that has DNA in it
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:33.680]  that could be highly allergenic okay recap that and go into detail and come
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:36.680]  back yeah what else you want to cover after that okay we've got the FTC
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:40.680]  attacking health freedoms yet again going after the palm wonderful company
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.680]  claiming that it's breaking the law by telling the truth about the ways that
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:49.680]  pomegranate juice can help protect your health and then we've got the FDA of
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:53.680]  course also going after your freedoms at the same time we've got Bill Gates trying
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.680]  to tell us that vaccines can be used to reduce the world population and we've
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:03.680]  got infant formula now with beetles in it is being recalled it's made with over
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:06.680]  50% sugar so we have a lot of topics to talk about and we're going to wonder why
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:11.680]  these kids at 10 get diabetes exactly they're being wise diabetes up 3,000%
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:17.680]  in the last 10 years who we're feeding babies a half sugar or half corn syrup
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.680]  and now not only do they not want you to label GMO salmon there they're going to
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:26.680]  call it corn sugar right high fructose corn syrup right the reputation of the
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:29.680]  ingredient in the gutter so they're going to change the name which is
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.680]  essentially a ploy to it's a bait and switch ploy to trick consumers and to
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:39.680]  buy more of this ingredient that I believe is linked to diabetes and obesity
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:43.680]  well you believe I mean it's literally hundreds of studies I think my lawyers
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.680]  told me to say that I believe in front of everything you say about corn syrup
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:50.680]  well I believe I've read hundreds of these major studies all over the news
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:56.680]  that say that I will be right back I believe the sun came up this morning
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:00.680]  I believe my hair is dirty blonde I believe Mike Adams is sitting in that chair
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:04.680]  are the threats of a biological attack to the US real if biological warfare is real
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:08.680]  what should I know before it happens to protect my family the answers to the
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:13.680]  unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams

[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:04.680]  We are part of a new world order
[02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:07.680]  A new world order based upon collective action
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:12.680]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:17.680]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:19.680]  It means all the world under their control
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:22.680]  The United Nations would take over America
[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:25.680]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.680]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:33.680]  to establish an oppressive world government
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:38.680]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:41.680]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:45.680]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else

[02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:03.680]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.680]  and live out their golden years
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:10.680]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:13.680]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:17.680]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:21.680]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:25.680]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:28.680]  The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states

[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:13.680]  I fell into a burning ring of fire
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:18.680]  I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:21.680]  And it burns, burns, burns
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.680]  Mike Adams with us well into the next hour in studio
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.680]  Alright, I'm going to shut up, Mike
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:28.680]  I've got some new news here
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:32.680]  U.S. apologizes for infecting Guatemalans with STDs secretly
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:34.680]  But let's take the shots the government wants us to take
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:37.680]  That's CNN, one of tens of thousands of declassified events
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:41.680]  I actually already had seen this out of Australian reported meeting
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:43.680]  The U.S. did this in Asia, everywhere
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:45.680]  Giving them syphilis, giving them
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:47.680]  And of course AIDS was created, that's declassified
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:49.680]  The general public doesn't want to face that hard
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.680]  You've got the floor, this is a short segment
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:53.680]  Let's get into salmon first
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:56.680]  Okay, well to recap the situation
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:24:59.680]  There's a company that created genetically engineered salmon
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:01.680]  It grows twice as fast as regular salmon
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:06.680]  Because it has growth hormone genes that have been inserted in it from other species
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.680]  So that they can grow it quickly and sell it for more profit
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:11.680]  Now the FDA has been hearing about this
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:13.680]  They've held a hearing for a couple of days to find out
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:16.680]  If they think it's safe to allow this into the food supply
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.680]  So that's the framework here
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:21.680]  And the FDA is full of a revolving door of the scientist
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:23.680]  Oh yeah, they're not even asking the right questions
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:27.680]  They're not really even asking what's the impact on human health
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:29.680]  Or what's the impact on the environment
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:32.680]  Let's say if this DNA escapes into the wild
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:37.680]  We have genetic pollution that could infect, essentially, other species
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.680]  Well it's not good, it already is
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:45.680]  And in the university studies, 40 generations of the salmon will extinct regular salmon
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.680]  And I was mentioning specifically the new head of FDA approval is the former Monsanto
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:51.680]  Yeah, this is how it works
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:52.680]  I'm sorry, just please continue
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:54.680]  No, no, this is great
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:57.680]  This is what's great about being here in person, is we can banter like this
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:59.680]  But you're right, it's a revolving door
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:04.680]  Monsanto and the FDA are in bed together, just like the FDA and Big Pharma
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:08.680]  And they essentially want to shove this GM salmon down your throat
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.680]  Without you having a choice
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:21.680]  But the worst part is, again, the FDA says it would be illegal for them to require this salmon to be accurately labeled as genetically modified
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:23.680]  They say it would be illegal
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.680]  So the law is they got to say corn syrup, they got to say sugar, they got to say, you know, riboflavin
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.680]  But you don't tell them it's got insect and eel genes and they got a whole bunch of these
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:38.680]  Right, this is what I call the FDA's campaign of enforced ignorance
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:40.680]  They want everybody to be kept in the dark
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:43.680]  They want everybody to be nutritionally illiterate
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.680]  That's why they don't let you tell the truth about vitamins and supplements and how they can help protect your health
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:50.680]  They don't want people to know what they're eating
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:53.680]  Because if they did, they might choose something different
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:56.680]  And, you know, this is the really scary part about the whole thing
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:59.680]  Is this enforced ignorance combined with their censorship
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:05.680]  Combined with the tyranny tactics that they use to go after these companies, you know, the natural health companies
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:10.680]  We are looking at statistically, how many Americans have been killed by terrorists
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:14.680]  Even if you believe the government's story on 9-11
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:19.680]  If you throw that into the mix, how many have been killed by terrorists in the last 10 years?
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:25.680]  It's under, you know, it's probably what, 4,000, 3,000, 4,000 Americans killed by terrorists
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:37.680]  The FDA, through its lack of action in protecting the American people, has been involved in the deaths of literally hundreds of thousands of Americans
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:40.680]  Well, bad drug interactions every year, it's over 300,000
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:42.680]  Yes, exactly
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.680]  If you put together what are called iatrogenic deaths, which means death by medicine
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:52.680]  When people are killed by medicine or doctors or surgeries that went bad
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.680]  That number, depending on who you believe, is about three-quarters of a million people a year
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:01.680]  And they've got studies about how the worst diet in the world is in the hospitals
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:04.680]  Exactly, you can buy fast food in the hospitals
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.680]  Just right after a heart bypass procedure, you can go eat junk food burgers, you know
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:13.680]  Nothing like repeat business for the hospitals, right?
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:20.680]  But the point is the FDA kills indirectly through its lack of appropriate action
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:27.680]  It results in the deaths of a huge multiple of the number of people that have been killed by terrorists
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:29.680]  But it's not scary like a guy with a turban
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:30.680]  Well, that's exactly it
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.680]  Most of these deaths, Alex, are silent deaths
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:36.680]  People dying in their beds, at home
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.680]  There's no explosion, no crash to put on TV
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:41.680]  It's a soft kill
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:42.680]  It's a soft kill
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.680]  And it's happening all over the country, all around the world
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:51.680]  And the FDA is, in my opinion, the most dangerous government organization right now
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:53.680]  It's a eugenics operation
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:57.680]  You could certainly draw that conclusion because of how many people are dying
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.680]  And their inability to tell the truth
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:02.680]  Even, look, here's their logic
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:08.680]  They say that you can't label genetically modified salmon because it's no different
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:10.680]  This is what they say
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:12.680]  It's no different from regular salmon
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:17.680]  Well, if it's no different, how did it get twice as big, you know, in half the time?
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:18.680]  That's different
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:20.680]  We should know about this
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:23.680]  And it's not like they bred, you know, bigger salmon together
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:25.680]  You know, the old-fashioned natural way to get a bigger one
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:26.680]  That's fine
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:29.680]  They put different genes of different animals in it
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:30.680]  Well, exactly
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:31.680]  And I'm glad you brought this up

[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:54.680]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:57.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:03.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:05.680]  In the last century alone
[02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:08.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:10.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:13.680]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:17.680]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:19.680]  And they really are calling the shots
[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:24.680]  As American citizens to pay attention
[02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:27.680]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:29.680]  The criminal off-short cartel
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.680]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:34.680]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:36.680]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:38.680]  They're asking for more matches
[02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:41.680]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:43.680]  Today seems like nobody does care
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:45.680]  And right now in Washington DC

[02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:29.680]  We are spraying aluminum dioxide and barium salts all over the world
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:32.680]  Since the mid-1990s in a secret global
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:34.680]  Geoengineering program
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:37.680]  You can see it, CBS news, ABC news
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:39.680]  You can go to YouTube, type in John P. Holdren
[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:42.680]  Geoengineering, watch press conferences
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:45.680]  What did all the Chemtrail experts
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:48.680]  Jim Keith was writing about this in like 92
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:50.680]  Before I was even on the scene
[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:52.680]  But the government says they started in the mid-90s
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:54.680]  That's when it got widespread
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:57.680]  Everything he said, barium salts, aluminum dioxide
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.680]  And they clearly killed him
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:01.680]  And that was the guy ahead of his time
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:04.680]  Really knew what he was talking about, Mr. Keith
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:07.680]  And when you look at this
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.680]  You understand how incredible it is
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:13.680]  That there could be a 15-plus year secret program
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:16.680]  And we've got the patents where they add the barium salts, aluminum dioxide
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:19.680]  To the jet fuel, the airlines don't even know
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:22.680]  Then the patent for the engines to disperse it
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.680]  And then the cover is, we're saving the earth from the sun's rays
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:30.680]  Okay, so people 15-plus years ago
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:33.680]  Tested it and said they're spraying aluminum dioxide
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:35.680]  And barium salts on you and other things
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:38.680]  And then now the government comes out and admits that
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.680]  So we are selling a video that Jebra Griffin produced
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:45.680]  It's very good, and it's the first film to come out
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:47.680]  Since they admitted a lot of this
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:49.680]  This is huge, this is huge
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:51.680]  Chemtrails admitted
[02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:53.680]  What in the world are they spraying? It's the name of the film
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.680]  It's available at infowars.com
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:00.680]  We'll put it up on screen for folks so they can
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:03.680]  You'll actually see it, but if you go to infowars.com
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:06.680]  And click on the shopping cart link there
[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:08.680]  It'll take you to the front page, you'll see the banner
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:09.680]  Where you can buy it
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:11.680]  If you want to get it first
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:14.680]  You simply go to infowars.com and pre-order it
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.680]  And they'll be shipped out in the order they're received starting October 22
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.680]  And again, the name of the film is What In The World Are They Spraying
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.680]  You can also call toll-free to get it
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:28.680]  It's 888-253-3139
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:31.680]  888-253-3139
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:34.680]  And your purchase of the film also supports this operation
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:39.680]  But also Jebra Griffin and the filmmakers of What In The World Are They Spraying
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:42.680]  The Chemtrail Geoengineering Cover-Up Revealed
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:45.680]  888-253-3139
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:49.680]  And you can purchase it at PO Box 1-9-549, Austin, Texas 787-60
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.680]  Alright, now we're going back to the health ranger
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:54.680]  One of my sales guys pointed this out
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:57.680]  They go, you know the health ranger really loves inner food
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:00.680]  And it won their best super food in 2009
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:02.680]  And so you know, asking what he thinks about it
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:04.680]  But I'm putting him on the spot here
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:06.680]  But I remember about five years ago, I got some of this sent to me
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:08.680]  And I was so busy, I didn't even call him back
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:10.680]  Because they wanted to be sponsors
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:12.680]  But years later we came back
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:15.680]  My wife loves it, it's two little scoops in the morning
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:17.680]  In water or juice, you drink it
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:20.680]  And it's 20 super foods at once
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:22.680]  And that way you absorb almost all of it
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:25.680]  Even with the best vitamins and minerals, a lot of it gets passed through you
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:27.680]  And you've got a lot of specials there on the site
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.680]  Four Alex Jones listeners
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:31.680]  Innerfood.com
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:34.680]  Or 866-762-9238
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:37.680]  866-762-9238
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:39.680]  Innerfood.com
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:42.680]  And give us your brief take on Innerfood
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:45.680]  I did give it an award, an editor's choice award
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:47.680]  It's the real thing
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:49.680]  And not only is the product really great
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:51.680]  But the company is great, the people there are great
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:53.680]  They get it, you know they understand nutrition
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:55.680]  They understand what's happening with the world
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:57.680]  And they want you to be nutritionally prepared
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:59.680]  I mean that's the bottom line with this product
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:01.680]  I use it
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:03.680]  Well I know my wife gets upset when she runs out
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:05.680]  Yeah, it's really that good
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:07.680]  She's a lot more health conscious than I am
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:09.680]  I mean I try to be compared to the average American
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.680]  I guess I'm okay but I do have a lot about habits
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:13.680]  But I noticed that
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:15.680]  When I first started taking it
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:17.680]  I mean it was almost like a drug or something
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:19.680]  I mean there's no speed, no caffeine in it
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:21.680]  But it's almost like jolting to have real nutrients
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.680]  It makes you alert
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:25.680]  Without any kind of
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:27.680]  Caffeine type of buzz
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:29.680]  No stimulants whatsoever
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:31.680]  It just basically clears out your system
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:34.680]  And it makes your brain and body function better
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:36.680]  You know, I mean superfoods are really powerful
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.680]  For doing that and with inner food
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:40.680]  He's combined a lot of the best ones in the world
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:42.680]  I don't give out a lot of awards
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:44.680]  You probably know that
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:46.680]  And the key is they don't pasteurize it either
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:48.680]  So it doesn't lose the...
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:50.680]  Yeah, exactly, exactly
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:52.680]  So you've got the nutrients that are destroyed by heat
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:54.680]  In inner food they're not destroyed
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:56.680]  They're intact and that makes all the difference
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:58.680]  Absolutely, okay
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:00.680]  Let's get back into the salmon
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:02.680]  And because the FDA admits
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:04.680]  This is a major change, they're now getting ready to approve
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:06.680]  Hundreds of different
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:08.680]  GMO crops
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:10.680]  They're trying to force Europe to do it
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:12.680]  Despite the farmers burning down
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:14.680]  Whole areas
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:16.680]  Whenever Monsanto and others try to plant it
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:18.680]  And if they're able to put
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:20.680]  Salmon on store shelves
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:22.680]  In restaurants everywhere and not label it
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:24.680]  Not let you know
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:26.680]  That's kind of like when
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:28.680]  Monsanto had the genetically engineered
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:30.680]  Growth hormone in the milk
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:32.680]  They tried to sue
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:34.680]  Non-GMO milk makers for just saying
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:36.680]  We're GMO free
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:38.680]  Like how dare you in America
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:40.680]  Put on a container that you don't have artificial hormones
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:42.680]  How dare you?
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:44.680]  Yeah, exactly, and that's the kind of outrage
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:46.680]  That we should all be expressing on this issue
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:48.680]  They did, they want you to be
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:50.680]  Not just uninformed, but misinformed
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:52.680]  Because the more you know about GMOs
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:54.680]  The more concerned you should be
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:56.680]  About eating them yourself
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:58.680]  Or feeding them to your children or family members
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:00.680]  And right now in the US
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:02.680]  91% of the soybean fields
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:04.680]  Are genetically modified soy
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:06.680]  We have GMO
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:08.680]  Sugar beets
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:10.680]  Creating genetically modified sugar
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:12.680]  In this country, and that's not labeled either
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:14.680]  All kinds of GMO corn being used
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:16.680]  In the food supply
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:18.680]  And every week or two I see a headline
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:20.680]  GMO corn caused organ failure
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:22.680]  In rats, I mean it's just, it's constant
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:24.680]  Yeah, there have been a lot of animal studies
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:26.680]  You know, Jeffrey Smith is
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:28.680]  One of the best experts on this
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:30.680]  He really studied the issue
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:32.680]  And he will tell you how dangerous this can be
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:34.680]  We should be concerned
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:36.680]  Not only because we're not being told the truth
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:38.680]  But also because the testing hasn't been done
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:40.680]  Have these salmon
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:42.680]  These genetically engineered salmon
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:44.680]  Have they ever really been tested
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:46.680]  On humans as a food source
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:48.680]  The answer is no
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:50.680]  And they're not about to be
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:52.680]  Now Alex, this could unleash the floodgates
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:54.680]  If the FDA allows GMO
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:56.680]  Salmon into the food supply
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:58.680]  They could allow any genetically engineered animal
[02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:00.680]  I mean it could be fish
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:02.680]  It could be genetically modified cows
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:04.680]  Pigs, chickens, or some animal
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:06.680]  That we haven't even thought of yet
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:08.680]  Something they create
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:10.680]  They're going to play franken food with animals
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:12.680]  Now and approve that as a food source
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:14.680]  And I've had top scientists
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:16.680]  On the show
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:18.680]  A world renown who ran
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:20.680]  Whole biotech companies and morally said
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:22.680]  I can't do this in one case
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:24.680]  A potato in England
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:26.680]  They changed that one trait
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:28.680]  To make it taste better last longer
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:30.680]  But then it randomly changes
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:32.680]  Thousands of other things
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:34.680]  And then as they breed these
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:36.680]  Over time the potato strains
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:38.680]  Start mutating
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:40.680]  And we already have genetic pollution
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.680]  Where they're already seeing
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:44.680]  Almost no corn strain on earth
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.680]  Has not been infected by the GMO
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:48.680]  We now see it getting into oak trees
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:50.680]  We see the German studies
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:52.680]  About the honey bees
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:54.680]  The pollen, it kills them
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:56.680]  This is genetic Armageddon
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:58.680]  Let's talk about why this really matters
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:00.680]  Because if you get the corn crops
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:02.680]  And the wheat crops and the soy crops
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:04.680]  All contaminated
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:06.680]  With these genetically engineered
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:08.680]  DNA
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:10.680]  Then you could have a susceptibility
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:12.680]  To a widespread viral infection
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:14.680]  Throughout the crop
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:16.680]  A plague of the crops
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:18.680]  That could wipe out
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:20.680]  Our crops in one season
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:22.680]  It's that genetic diversity
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.680]  That stopped that
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:26.680]  Exactly, so I think that these scientists
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:28.680]  By playing God with the food supply
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:30.680]  Developing these franken foods
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:32.680]  They are setting us up
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:34.680]  For future famine
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:36.680]  Starvation, crop failures
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:38.680]  That could just devastate global population
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:40.680]  They've always wanted to reduce
[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:42.680]  Africa, Latin America and Asia's population
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:44.680]  That's on record. Once they get them to
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:46.680]  Accept this and their 90 plus percent
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:48.680]  Of say their corn is GMO
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:50.680]  It gets wiped out
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:52.680]  They're dead in a hammer and then they don't have the seed stocks
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:54.680]  And they admit this is a military
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:56.680]  Style takeover of the planet
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:58.680]  Here's a quick example of trusting these people
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:00.680]  This is just today
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:02.680]  You have to understand, every day
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:04.680]  This is in the news, they even admit it
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:06.680]  Here's CNN, US apologizes
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:08.680]  For infecting Guatemalans
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:10.680]  With STDs in the 1940s
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:12.680]  They always report something 50 years old
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:14.680]  The United States apologizes Friday
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:16.680]  For a 1946-48 study
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.680]  That purposefully infected people
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:20.680]  In Guatemala with sexually transmitted diseases
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:22.680]  A statement by the Secretary of State
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:24.680]  Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Human Services
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:26.680]  Kathleen Sebelius called the action
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:28.680]  Reprehensible
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:30.680]  And it goes on to how they told them
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:32.680]  It was health clinics and injected them
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:34.680]  With syphilis and other things
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:36.680]  I mean it just can
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:38.680]  And we know that they had
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:40.680]  Cancer viruses in the polio shots
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:42.680]  Every year I see articles about people
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:44.680]  Being killed by the polio shots
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:46.680]  They're being given now, it's like oops
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:48.680]  It was live, it was a weaponized strain
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:50.680]  Oops, now everybody better
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:52.680]  Take the vaccine we've got
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:54.680]  Or you'll die and then suddenly
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:56.680]  Their fertility goes down and we have the
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:58.680]  Rockefeller Foundation reports
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:00.680]  That our researchers and writers
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:02.680]  Have been doing a great job digging through
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:04.680]  One great guy over in the Netherlands
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:06.680]  He's publishing articles multiple times a week
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:08.680]  I always think I know it all
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:10.680]  And then I realize how much I don't know
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.680]  We literally have found
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:14.680]  Hundreds of Ford Foundation
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:16.680]  Rockefeller Foundation UN reports
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:18.680]  Where they said we're going to add this
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:20.680]  Hormone to the tetanus shot sterilized people
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:22.680]  Then we have them caught doing it
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:24.680]  We're going to put cancer viruses in the polio
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:26.680]  I mean they did it all
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:28.680]  And that's what
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:30.680]  That's who killed your grandma folks
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:32.680]  That's who killed your grandpa
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:34.680]  And they know what they're doing
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:36.680]  And now they've gotten to a point
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:38.680]  In the past they would deny all this
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:40.680]  Now they just come out and say hey
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:42.680]  They know it's going to kill the troops
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:44.680]  It's not bad for you
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:46.680]  They don't have 500 mobile radiation
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:48.680]  Vans just driving around beaming people
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:50.680]  Can you speak to from your deep research
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:52.680]  I mean do you agree with me that
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:54.680]  We have the facts
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:56.680]  That this is totally staged by design
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:43:58.680]  I mean they are trying to kill us
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:00.680]  It's very clear actually
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:02.680]  The history of medical experimentation
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:04.680]  On the human race
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:06.680]  I mean I published a timeline of that
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:08.680]  At one point that tracks it
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:10.680]  About US history
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:12.680]  Just US history
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:14.680]  Most of those experiments involved the military
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:16.680]  And they would experiment on
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:18.680]  Certain groups African Americans
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:20.680]  Or prisoners or people of low economic
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:22.680]  Status typically
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:24.680]  They would pick certain groups
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:26.680]  They would conduct experiments on them
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:28.680]  And these are all well documented
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:30.680]  This isn't just pie in the sky stuff
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:32.680]  This is all extremely well documented
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:34.680]  And many of these researchers later
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:36.680]  Were found out and they were
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:38.680]  The stuff it came out
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:40.680]  Eventually but like you said 50 years later
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:42.680]  Is usually the case
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:44.680]  But they did they I mean they sprayed
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:46.680]  The population in California with
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:48.680]  Bio weapons I mean this goes
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:50.680]  On all the time and they
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:52.680]  Will tell you later only if they get caught
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:54.680]  But it's happening right now
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:56.680]  With the vaccines
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:58.680]  H1N1 swine flu vaccine
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.680]  The evidence now says
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:02.680]  That those who were vaccinated
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:04.680]  Against swine flu now
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:06.680]  Are at greater risk of catching
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:08.680]  The next seasonal flu
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:10.680]  So it actually weakens your immune system
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:12.680]  That's mainstream news and you said all this
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:14.680]  Over a year ago when it was happening
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:16.680]  And now the British medical journals come out
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:18.680]  And said it was a fraud it's dangerous
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:20.680]  They suspended the flu shots in England
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:22.680]  10 times the convulsions
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:24.680]  Other countries
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:26.680]  Narcolepsy I mean this stuff's frying your brain
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:28.680]  Absolutely it's a nervous system
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:30.680]  Aggravating
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:32.680]  Injection
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:34.680]  It's bad for your brain it's bad for your nervous system
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:36.680]  And it's bad for your immune system
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:38.680]  It makes you more susceptible to a future flu
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:40.680]  In fact this brings me back
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:42.680]  To the Bill Gates quote which is
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:44.680]  You know he says one way to reduce
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:46.680]  Or if we do a good job on vaccines
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:48.680]  And healthcare he says
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:50.680]  We could reduce the world population by
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:52.680]  10 to 15 percent that's pretty close
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:54.680]  Here's your article today from natural news
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:56.680]  Here it is okay right so that's
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:58.680]  Here's yeah he says
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:00.680]  If we do a really great job on new
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:02.680]  Vaccines healthcare reproductive
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:04.680]  Health services we could lower
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:06.680]  That which he's talking
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:08.680]  About the world population
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:10.680]  By perhaps 10 to 15 percent
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:12.680]  Well how do you lower the population with vaccines
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:14.680]  You weaken people's immune systems
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:16.680]  You make them more susceptible
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:18.680]  To future infections
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:20.680]  And then you just wait for something to come along
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:22.680]  Or you introduce something
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:24.680]  I have a word for it this is called a binary weapon
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:26.680]  Yeah exactly right
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:28.680]  You've got to have both elements in place
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:30.680]  Could be a wild virus
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:32.680]  But the first element is the vaccine
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:34.680]  Well now we're learning stuff in vaccines
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:36.680]  Viruses and RNA is one of the things
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:38.680]  Triggering Americans to be more obese
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:40.680]  Not just the diet
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:42.680]  It's that we're eating all this GMO
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:44.680]  And we're being shot up with these vaccines
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:46.680]  That are just frying us
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:48.680]  I think that there is an effort to
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:50.680]  Diseaseify if I could use that made up word
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:52.680]  To diseaseify America
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:54.680]  And it's working to pestilence
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:56.680]  It is because they know that
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:58.680]  Americans they're going to spend every last dollar
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:00.680]  And they're going to give up their freedoms
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:02.680]  To try to save their lives
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:04.680]  If they're promised some kind of
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:06.680]  Yeah these soft kill weapons
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:08.680]  And I've actually seen the studies
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:10.680]  It's designed the stuff they're shooting in vaccines
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:12.680]  Are RNA packages
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:14.680]  Literally nanotech they've designed
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:16.680]  That's what a virus is it's natural nanotech
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:18.680]  They argue is it alive
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:20.680]  Or isn't it
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:22.680]  But the point is it's like a computer program
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:24.680]  That the viruses get into your
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:26.680]  Cells DNA
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:28.680]  And mitochondrial
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:30.680]  And it's designed that when your hormones drop
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:32.680]  Right around the time you're leaving work
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:34.680]  Right around the time that your body's starting to shut down
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:36.680]  To die over the next 20 years
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:38.680]  We have that designed clock in us
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:40.680]  That's when the virus is triggered
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:42.680]  So they discovered in the 20s
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:44.680]  The Rockefeller Foundation and I have all their documents
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:46.680]  On this what's so crazy
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:48.680]  That they know then
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:50.680]  In their hormone test that
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:52.680]  Okay you're done working you've gone to menopause
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:54.680]  Or your testosterone's down
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:56.680]  You're past 60
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:58.680]  Now that's when this stuff gets triggered
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:00.680]  And then you get cancer and die
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:02.680]  It's so diabolical
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:04.680]  And that's when you're going to spend the most money on healthcare
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:06.680]  Yeah all your money you've saved goes to them
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:08.680]  Exactly you work your whole life
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:10.680]  And you end up spending every last penny dying
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:12.680]  Suffering and broke
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:14.680]  Because chemotherapy creates a lot of suffering
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:16.680]  Think about this
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:18.680]  When people go out and they think they're raising money for cancer research
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:20.680]  You know these pink ribbon runs
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:22.680]  They say let's raise money for cancer
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:24.680]  Most of that money
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:26.680]  Goes to these mammogram
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:28.680]  They have trucks with these portable
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:30.680]  Radiation mammogram machines
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:32.680]  That will drive out to low income areas
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:34.680]  Of a major city
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  And they will radiate
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:38.680]  They will radiate women's breath
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:40.680]  And they admit now it's increasing cancer
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:42.680]  But imagine no one would ever think
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:44.680]  That in the name of fighting cancer
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:46.680]  They're out there spreading it
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:48.680]  That's what's so genius about these people
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:50.680]  Who would ever imagine that
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:52.680]  They will specifically target
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:54.680]  Let's say African American neighborhoods
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:56.680]  And they will essentially give breast cancer
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:58.680]  To these women
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:00.680]  And then because they know
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:02.680]  That these women when they have
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:04.680]  Well they now admit ultrasounds brain damaging babies
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:06.680]  Oh no you're exactly right
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:08.680]  I mean most of these screening procedures
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:10.680]  Are actually causing the very diseases
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:12.680]  That they claim to detect
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:14.680]  But they know that
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:16.680]  An African American woman
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:18.680]  Breast cancer through mammography
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:20.680]  Is a cash cow so to speak
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:22.680]  I mean I don't mean anything derogatory
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:24.680]  By the term that's their term
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:26.680]  They look at that woman as a walking ATM
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:28.680]  They can extract money from her
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:30.680]  With up to a million dollars in cancer
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:32.680]  And the more funding they put into
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:34.680]  Fighting breast cancer the more it happens
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:36.680]  Exactly and when you donate
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:38.680]  To breast cancer by buying pink products
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:40.680]  This is an insane idea
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:42.680]  What you think you can cure cancer by going shopping
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:44.680]  Come on that doesn't work
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:46.680]  This money goes to actually causing more breast cancer
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:48.680]  In fact guys people won't believe that
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.680]  Search the term
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:52.680]  Study shows mammograms increase cancer
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:54.680]  And it's like mainstream news
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:56.680]  Well it's radiation
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:58.680]  The story that
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:00.680]  I often reference on our site is
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:02.680]  That 10 women are harmed
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:04.680]  By mammography for every one woman
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:06.680]  That's actually helped where they actually
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:08.680]  Detect a tumor early and
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:10.680]  And a lot of times they find like my grandmother
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:12.680]  They said you've got lung cancer
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:14.680]  It wasn't cancer
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:16.680]  It was a broken blood vessel that had made a clot
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:18.680]  It's very often the case there's a lot of false diagnosis
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.680]  And then that ended up basically soft killing her
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:22.680]  I mean she had a hellish life for the last 10 years of her life
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:24.680]  Well you know radiation
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:26.680]  And poison and cutting people open
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:28.680]  This should not be called medicine Alex
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:30.680]  This is
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:32.680]  Really a war against the American people
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:34.680]  Framed inside the context
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:36.680]  Well no that's what I figured out
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:38.680]  Not just from the documents I'm realizing
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:40.680]  The cell phones, the mobile trucks
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:42.680]  The chest x-ray, the naked body scanners
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:44.680]  All the scientists saying it's deadly
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:46.680]  They now tell the workers just go up and run it
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:48.680]  They are just like the Pentagon
[02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:50.680]  Radiated 4,000 foster children to death
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:52.680]  They're now radiating all of us
[02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:54.680]  And their own troops
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:56.680]  We're all being murdered by the eugenicist
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:50:58.680]  And Bill Gates right now
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:10.680]  I'm afraid to answer it
[02:51:10.680 --> 02:51:12.680]  Afraid to answer your door?
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:14.680]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:16.680]  And attorneys will cost you about 10 times more
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:18.680]  Than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:20.680]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt
[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:22.680]  They are expensive payment plans
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:24.680]  And if you're in debt already
[02:51:24.680 --> 02:51:26.680]  Does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?

[02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:24.680]  Being radiated
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:26.680]  Foster children being put in chambers
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:28.680]  And fried like eggs
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:30.680]  They would kill them instantly
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:32.680]  Or they'd give them lower doses
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:34.680]  They pay the Israeli government
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:36.680]  To irradiate 110,000
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:38.680]  Sephardic children
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:40.680]  Who are seen as lower class
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:42.680]  Because they're dark-skinned
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:44.680]  That's all covered in Endgame
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:46.680]  All these governments are doing this
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:48.680]  To create cadres of scientists
[02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:50.680]  That will kill people
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:52.680]  And we got secret Marine Corps reports
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:54.680]  From the Sunshine Project
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:56.680]  They made a big fracas 10 years ago
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:58.680]  They had to remove them
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:00.680]  And they're still at the Google
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:02.680]  Wayback Machine Archive
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:04.680]  People to still find them in the Marine Corps
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:06.680]  Ordered them down
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:08.680]  Where they have plans in every major city
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:10.680]  With knockout gases
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:12.680]  But also kill gases
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:14.680]  And helicopters in armored facilities
[02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:16.680]  And now they're moving to drones
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:18.680]  So if the pilots refuse it won't matter
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:20.680]  They're ready to take off
[02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:22.680]  I'm not kidding, take off
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:24.680]  And knock out entire cities
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:26.680]  Or kill entire cities
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:28.680]  And make this stuff up
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:30.680]  And that's why they're going to a full drone air force
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:32.680]  Where somebody like Dick Cheney
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:34.680]  In the future, Dr. Evil can just hit the button
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:36.680]  We're not joking
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:38.680]  Why would you take any vaccines
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:40.680]  Or any GMO food that they pitch at you
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:42.680]  When this is their stated plan
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:44.680]  To kill you but kill you slowly
[02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:46.680]  And suck all of your money
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:48.680]  Out of you in the process
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:50.680]  Mike Adams, you're going to be with us
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:52.680]  For 40 minutes in the next hour
[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:54.680]  I'm going to blitz news the last 20 minutes
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:56.680]  But you've covered the GMO salmon
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:55:58.680]  You've got a bunch of other issues
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:00.680]  You want to get into, hit it
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:02.680]  Federal Trade Commission
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:04.680]  Earlier this week went after
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:06.680]  The Palm Wonderful Company
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:08.680]  This is the company that makes the pomegranate juice
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:10.680]  That we've documented
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:12.680]  Many of the health benefits of pomegranate juice
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:14.680]  And by the way, I don't have any financial ties
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:16.680]  With that company, just reporting it
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:18.680]  Pomegranate juice prevents prostate cancer
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:20.680]  It helps prevent heart disease
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:22.680]  It is a fantastic
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:24.680]  Natural medicine from
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:26.680]  Pomegranate seeds, it's very powerful
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:28.680]  We're supposed to eat food
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:29.680]  Food is medicine
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:30.680]  That's exactly it
[02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:32.680]  Well, the FTC takes an issue
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:34.680]  With the fact that this company
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:36.680]  Is telling people the truth
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:38.680]  About some of the health benefits
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:40.680]  Of pomegranates and they are now
[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:42.680]  Claiming that this company is
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:44.680]  Really engaging in criminal activity
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:46.680]  And the FTC has done this
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:48.680]  In many cases, many times
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:50.680]  With other companies, natural product companies
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:52.680]  And they have forced them
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:54.680]  They've threatened them with criminal prosecution
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:56.680]  And they have forced them to sign
[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:58.680]  What are called consent decrees
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:00.680]  And I've seen these, I've had companies
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:02.680]  Send them to me covertly, they didn't want to be on the air
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:04.680]  But they would send them to me because
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:06.680]  They want me to know what's in these
[02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:08.680]  And in these consent decrees
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:10.680]  There is language that says
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:12.680]  You must admit to committing these crimes
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:14.680]  And the crimes are
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:16.680]  The crimes you never even committed
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:18.680]  They are that you have been trafficking
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:20.680]  In drugs
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:22.680]  Because, you see, they can consider
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:24.680]  The pomegranates to be a drug
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:26.680]  According to the FDA's definition
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:28.680]  I've seen SWAT team raids on people growing
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:30.680]  Just regular herbs
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:32.680]  Things like aloe vera
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:34.680]  Oh yeah, sure, I mean
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:36.680]  These government agencies get crazy
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:38.680]  When you start telling people the truth
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:40.680]  About something that can prevent disease
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:42.680]  Because remember, you're denying revenue
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:44.680]  To the pharmaceutical industrial complex
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:46.680]  Which is the Rockefeller mafia
[02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:48.680]  Exactly, so if you start costing them money
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:50.680]  The government's going to come after you
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:52.680]  And they can do that either through the FTC
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:54.680]  Or the FDA, sometimes the USDA
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:56.680]  Although, I got to give the USDA
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:57:58.680]  Credit for their organic labeling program
[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:00.680]  That's actually a really good program
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:02.680]  They've done a good job with that element
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:04.680]  But overall, the government is
[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:06.680]  Attacking and destroying natural health
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:08.680]  And natural product companies
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:10.680]  And now they're really going after the family farms
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:12.680]  With these senate bills
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:14.680]  Saying you can't pick peaches and sell them
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:16.680]  Right, these food safety bills
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:18.680]  These could
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:20.680]  Turn thousands of farmers
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:22.680]  Across America into criminals
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:24.680]  And these are the people who are growing the food
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:26.680]  We're trying to get locally
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:28.680]  These are the ones growing the non-GMO food
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:30.680]  That we need to be eating
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:32.680]  And these are the people being targeted
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:34.680]  Alright, Mike, stay there
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:36.680]  We're coming back live in the fourth hour
[02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:38.680]  It is Friday, October 1st
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:44.680]  Stay with us back in 70 seconds
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:10.680]  The film conclusively proves the existence
[02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:12.680]  Of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:59:12.680 --> 02:59:14.680]  Now being expanded nationwide
[02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:16.680]  This documentary exposes how
[02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:18.680]  The continuity of government program
[02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:20.680]  Has established an old powerful shadow state
[02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:22.680]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening
[02:59:22.680 --> 02:59:24.680]  Depths to which our republic has fallen
[02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:26.680]  Prepare to enter the secret of world
[02:59:26.680 --> 02:59:28.680]  Of emergency dictatorship
[02:59:28.680 --> 02:59:30.680]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies
[02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:32.680]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[02:59:32.680 --> 02:59:34.680]  It's only the beginning
[02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:36.680]  Of the New World Order's hellish plan
[02:59:36.680 --> 02:59:38.680]  The police state isn't coming
[02:59:38.680 --> 02:59:39.680]  It's here

[03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:19.680]  We're showing screenshots of one of the great books
[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:21.680]  Put out by the health ranger
[03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:23.680]  Mike Adams here in studio with us
[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:25.680]  He's like, don't plug my books, don't plug
[03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:26.680]  I'm not here for that
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:27.680]  But I'm going to plug them
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:29.680]  Natural health solutions
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:31.680]  And the conspiracy to keep you from knowing about them
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:34.680]  Mike Adams, America's number one consumer health advocate
[03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:37.680]  Those are available at naturalnews.com
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:39.680]  Spam filters for your brain

[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:48.680]  I think I ought to carry your books and videos
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:51.680]  At infowars.com
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:54.680]  Because I know they're amongst the best research out there
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:57.680]  We do have Mr. Smith's material
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:00.680]  Dealing with the genetic roulette
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:02.680]  And all the GMO and the rest of it
[03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:04.680]  Now, this is a short segment
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:06.680]  I want to fire the phone number out for listeners
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:08.680]  If you have a question or a comment
[03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:10.680]  For Mike Adams
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:12.680]  I don't have those headphones yet
[03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:14.680]  We'll go to calls in about 10 minutes
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:17.680]  1-800-259-9231
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:21.680]  1-800-259-9231
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:24.680]  Specifically on all these major health issues
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:27.680]  That we are talking about
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:29.680]  But they really are Mike trying to bully us
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:32.680]  And saying, okay, radiate me at checkpoints
[03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:34.680]  Okay, don't let me know I'm eating GMO
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:36.680]  Okay, shut down a company
[03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:38.680]  That shows the mainline studies
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:40.680]  Just full of incredible antioxidants
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:42.680]  And all this other stuff in it
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:44.680]  But you've got a bunch of other issues
[03:01:44.680 --> 03:01:46.680]  That dovetail with that
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:48.680]  Meanwhile, they're saying feed babies
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:50.680]  GMO soy that's half sugar
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:53.680]  Okay, yeah, a lot of people heard about the product
[03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:56.680]  It was a voluntary recall by the maker of infant formula
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:58.680]  Called Similac
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:01.680]  Here's a product shot right here, Similac
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:04.680]  And the company said
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:06.680]  Well, some of the containers may have beetles
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:08.680]  Or beetle larvae in them
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:10.680]  And I got to thinking, well, what else is in there
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:12.680]  Because I'm not sure that the beetles
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:14.680]  Are the most dangerous thing in the can
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:16.680]  That might be the only thing good thing in there
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:18.680]  Bugs are actually pretty good
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:20.680]  The only nutritious thing in it is the beetles
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:22.680]  So I went out...
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:24.680]  It's kind of like the prize in a crackerjack box
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:26.680]  Is the beetle, oh, something edible
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:28.680]  Exactly, living foods, right?
[03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:30.680]  So anyway, I bought this
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:32.680]  And I took a look at the ingredients label
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:34.680]  And it just shocked me, Alex
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:37.680]  It freaked me out, and I've seen a lot of crazy foods
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:40.680]  But this label says, look at the number one ingredient on here
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:44.680]  42.6% corn syrup solids
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:45.680]  That's number one
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:49.680]  But that's what a baby needs is 42.6% corn syrup
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:51.680]  Because everybody knows how good corn syrup is
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:53.680]  What are you, some kind of conspiracy theorist?
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:54.680]  I guess so
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:57.680]  And on top of that, 10.1% sucrose
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:02:59.680]  Which is essentially table sugar
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:01.680]  Well, you wonder why the public's so dumb
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:02.680]  They've been getting fed this for decades
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:04.680]  I talk to people and they're like zombies
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:06.680]  Well, pretty soon if you can tie your shoelaces
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:07.680]  You'll be a rocket scientist
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:08.680]  And here's the kicker
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:10.680]  This formula, as far as I know
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:12.680]  And I asked around
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:15.680]  But this formula is covered under state WIC programs
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:18.680]  So you can use government money to feed your baby this
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:20.680]  Well, notice how they incentivize
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:22.680]  You only have money, 43 million Americans
[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:23.680]  On the food stamps
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:25.680]  But it's only good for this
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:26.680]  Exactly
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:29.680]  You will feed them 42.6% corn syrup
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:32.680]  Yep, oh, and also what else is in here
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:34.680]  Is soy protein
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:36.680]  It's 14.7% soy protein
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:38.680]  Doesn't that have estrogen mimicers?
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:41.680]  Well, there was a study done by Consumer Reports
[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:43.680]  Back in 99 on this brand
[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:44.680]  Oh
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:47.680]  That found evidence that it's genetically modified soy
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:48.680]  Oh
[03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:51.680]  And you notice there's no label that says non-GMO
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:52.680]  Well, that would be evil
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:53.680]  Right
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:55.680]  I'm not allowed to know what's in there
[03:03:55.680 --> 03:03:57.680]  You think you're in a free country, pal?
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:03:59.680]  This is what our babies...
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:00.680]  This is for our poor children
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:03.680]  A baby needs 42.6% corn syrup in their diet
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:04.680]  Come on, man
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:05.680]  It's crazy
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:06.680]  It's insane
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:09.680]  I mean, next they'll say, hey, just give babies Coca-Cola
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:11.680]  Well, remember they tried that in the 70s
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:12.680]  Hey, wait a minute
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:13.680]  Guys, go get...
[03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:15.680]  I guess there is no Coca-Cola in this office
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:18.680]  Can somebody run to the store and buy a Coca-Cola
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:20.680]  So we can see what percentage of it
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:23.680]  I would imagine that Coca-Cola is not, per volume
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:26.680]  42.6%
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:27.680]  Fructose corn syrup
[03:04:27.680 --> 03:04:29.680]  Yeah, I bet this is a lot higher than a Coca-Cola
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:32.680]  Well, the Coca-Cola bottle is probably not going to stay the percentage
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:33.680]  It's just...
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:37.680]  Yeah, but you could see per volume and then the grams
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:40.680]  No, this is extremely high in sugar
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:42.680]  But it's got a teddy bear on it
[03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:43.680]  Exactly
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:44.680]  Exactly
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:46.680]  So that means it's safe for kids
[03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:47.680]  Look at that teddy bear, it looks happy
[03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:48.680]  It's crazy
[03:04:48.680 --> 03:04:53.680]  And actually in the big studies, when they fed GMO corn to the gerbils
[03:04:53.680 --> 03:04:55.680]  They did grow hair from inside their mouth
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:56.680]  Maybe that's a good thing
[03:04:56.680 --> 03:05:00.680]  It'll be a conspiracy theory if you don't have hair growing in your mouth
[03:05:00.680 --> 03:05:03.680]  The food storage industry leader has done it again
[03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:07.680]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze Dry Guy

[03:05:55.680 --> 03:05:58.680]  The Freeze Dry Guy, the best you can buy
[03:06:00.680 --> 03:06:05.680]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:05.680 --> 03:06:08.680]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:08.680 --> 03:06:12.680]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights
[03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:14.680]  Not democracy, not mob rule
[03:06:14.680 --> 03:06:16.680]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:21.680]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money
[03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:25.680]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[03:06:25.680 --> 03:06:29.680]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising
[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:30.680]  You have been warned
[03:06:30.680 --> 03:06:34.680]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law
[03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:37.680]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen
[03:06:37.680 --> 03:06:40.680]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you, don't tread on me
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:42.680]  Rise the republic, tyranny is upon us
[03:06:42.680 --> 03:06:46.680]  But liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising
[03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:48.680]  A new tool in the info war, don't tread on me
[03:06:48.680 --> 03:06:56.680]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139
[03:06:56.680 --> 03:07:24.680]  And support independent patriotic liberty films
[03:07:24.680 --> 03:07:30.680]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilagin bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints
[03:07:30.680 --> 03:07:36.680]  Silica is a precursor to calcium, meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart
[03:07:36.680 --> 03:07:42.680]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter
[03:07:42.680 --> 03:07:45.680]  And with an unlimited shelf life you can store it anywhere
[03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:50.680]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org
[03:07:50.680 --> 03:07:59.680]  It's a great way to change your life, so call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today
[03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:28.680]  I was having some gallows humor there joking about that baby formula powder
[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:34.680]  But look at all the scandals in Africa and Asia where you'll have tens of thousands of kids die
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:37.680]  Because the government didn't mix the formula right
[03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:41.680]  And you look at children now, they admit the U.S. and you can pull up mainstream articles
[03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:45.680]  The IQ is down 10 to 20 points depending on what study
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:50.680]  I mean literally they won't hire cops under 100 IQ, they want dumb people
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:53.680]  And I think back to being in, because I have three children
[03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:58.680]  And just reading the labels on things like Pedialyte where it's aspartame
[03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:02.680]  So I mean go back over this without me making sick jokes about it
[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:05.680]  I mean really talk about what's in this stuff and then the other issues you wanted to cover
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:08.680]  Then we're going to Annie, Ruth, Tim, Diane, Jeff and others
[03:09:08.680 --> 03:09:12.680]  Well no, you made a good point, I mean if you want to see some crazy stuff out in the stores
[03:09:12.680 --> 03:09:16.680]  Look at children's medication, over-the-counter medication for kids
[03:09:16.680 --> 03:09:20.680]  It's loaded with aspartame, it's loaded with artificial colors
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:22.680]  The cough syrups are a complete joke
[03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:25.680]  I mean even some of the health regulators say they don't even work
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:27.680]  And they could actually harm your children
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:33.680]  It's what they feed kids, what they manufacture for you to feed your kids in this country
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:34.680]  Should be a crime
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:39.680]  Well I mean it's like when you go under the store shelves and it's fluoride for your kids
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:42.680]  Back to school baby fluoride, increased fluoride
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:44.680]  When that reduces IQ, bone cancer
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:46.680]  I mean they're clearly targeting
[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:47.680]  Well absolutely they are
[03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:49.680]  I mean go back over this loving
[03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:51.680]  Okay, well
[03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:52.680]  Document cam
[03:09:52.680 --> 03:09:54.680]  I think you said most of the stories here, I'll hold it up again
[03:09:54.680 --> 03:09:58.680]  This is over 50% sugars
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:01.680]  According to what's on the label that I'm reading right here
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:04.680]  So 42.6% corn syrup solids
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:08.680]  14.7% soy protein isolate
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:11.680]  And another 10.5% sugar
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:13.680]  And then it's got some safflower oil
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:14.680]  Some soy
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:17.680]  Excuse me, it's 42.6% corn syrup
[03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:19.680]  High fructose and then there's more sugar
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:21.680]  Exactly, another 10%
[03:10:21.680 --> 03:10:23.680]  So that's 52.6%
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:26.680]  This is over 50% sugar
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:27.680]  Now if you want it
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:31.680]  I mean who would, what mom would go into the kitchen and say
[03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:34.680]  I want to mix up a recipe for my babies
[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:36.680]  And throw in 50% sugar
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:38.680]  And mix it up and put that in a bottle
[03:10:38.680 --> 03:10:39.680]  And let their baby
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:42.680]  Here's some GMO soybean, honey
[03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:45.680]  Here's some roundup ready soybean
[03:10:45.680 --> 03:10:49.680]  Here's some, here's a 52.6% sugar
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:51.680]  Pumpkin cake
[03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:52.680]  Now think about this
[03:10:52.680 --> 03:10:54.680]  You've got child protective services in this country
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:57.680]  Going after parents who will choose
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:10:59.680]  A living foods diet for their children
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:01.680]  Or if they get too much quote son
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:03.680]  Oh exactly, exactly
[03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:05.680]  Or if you don't vaccinate your children
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:06.680]  You're considered a bad parent
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:08.680]  But you can feed your babies this stuff
[03:11:08.680 --> 03:11:10.680]  50% sugar and you're a good parent
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:12.680]  But I mean let's zoom in on that though
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:14.680]  Folks show the teddy bear
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:17.680]  Why do you want to hurt the teddy bear?
[03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:19.680]  Well this is you know teddy bear marketing
[03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:21.680]  It's all about symbolism
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:23.680]  It's all about image and not substance
[03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:26.680]  Because I would not want to put this
[03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:28.680]  You know, simulac, go and grow
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:31.680]  Soy based formula
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:34.680]  Well I think it's wonderful stuff
[03:11:34.680 --> 03:11:36.680]  No I mean really I
[03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:38.680]  In fact hold on a minute
[03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:40.680]  Hold on a minute
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:42.680]  Oh a little
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:44.680]  Got the little bear there
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:46.680]  Who wants to be a little teddy
[03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:48.680]  There he is
[03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:50.680]  Look he can walk
[03:11:50.680 --> 03:11:52.680]  He's 14 years old and just learned how to walk
[03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:54.680]  He's one of the most advanced humans
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:56.680]  He's been on
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:11:58.680]  I'm sorry
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:00.680]  You're right to make fun of it
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:02.680]  And if you think about children today
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:04.680]  They have a nature deficiency
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:07.680]  Because most kids in America are vitamin D deficient
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:09.680]  There was research that recently came out
[03:12:09.680 --> 03:12:11.680]  Showing that microbes in the soil
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:13.680]  Actually make you more intelligent
[03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:15.680]  So if you go out and you play in the dirt
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:18.680]  You're smarter than the kid that lives in a sterile environment
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:20.680]  Drinking 50% sugar
[03:12:20.680 --> 03:12:22.680]  I mean they learned that with the bubble boy
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:24.680]  I mean literally I'm real clean
[03:12:24.680 --> 03:12:26.680]  I take two showers a day
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:28.680]  But at the same time
[03:12:28.680 --> 03:12:30.680]  I mean I'll eat a piece of pizza off the floor
[03:12:30.680 --> 03:12:32.680]  I mean seriously
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:34.680]  I mean I'll
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:36.680]  Sometimes if I've been hunting
[03:12:36.680 --> 03:12:38.680]  And I'm gutting a deer
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:40.680]  I'll pull the heart out
[03:12:40.680 --> 03:12:42.680]  Slice up and repeat
[03:12:42.680 --> 03:12:44.680]  You ever eaten raw deer heart?
[03:12:44.680 --> 03:12:46.680]  No that's not, I haven't done that Alex
[03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:48.680]  But I'm just saying
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:50.680]  I mean I'm somebody who
[03:12:50.680 --> 03:12:52.680]  I almost never get sick
[03:12:52.680 --> 03:12:54.680]  Unless it's allergies
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:56.680]  And all the major studies are showing that's connected to the GMO
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:12:58.680]  I've eaten over my life
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:00.680]  That's exactly it
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:02.680]  You and I both have a history of some toxic foods
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:04.680]  Before we sort of woke up
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:06.680]  To what's really out there
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:08.680]  Before I woke up and ate those cocoa puffs for lunch
[03:13:08.680 --> 03:13:10.680]  Oh man
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:12.680]  I know you are
[03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:14.680]  I didn't see a box of cocoa puffs here in the store
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:16.680]  That's because they ate them
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:18.680]  Let's bring that on next time
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:20.680]  And talk about the sugar and cocoa
[03:13:20.680 --> 03:13:22.680]  I'll tell you, Jaren's the greatest example of health in this office
[03:13:22.680 --> 03:13:24.680]  Sorry go ahead
[03:13:24.680 --> 03:13:26.680]  No but a lot of us
[03:13:26.680 --> 03:13:28.680]  Choose a healthy lifestyle
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:30.680]  Today they have some toxicity from the past
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:32.680]  And whose fault is this?
[03:13:32.680 --> 03:13:34.680]  It's again
[03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:36.680]  It's this conspiracy between the government regulators
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:38.680]  And the food industries
[03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:40.680]  And the pharmaceutical industries
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:42.680]  That don't want you to know
[03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:44.680]  They go to great lengths
[03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:46.680]  To keep you uninformed and misinformed
[03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:48.680]  Well that's like, I've told people this five years ago
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:50.680]  They didn't believe me, now it's even CNN
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:52.680]  But they report it like it's good
[03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:54.680]  Oh there's a type of silicone
[03:13:54.680 --> 03:13:56.680]  In most of your McNuggets
[03:13:56.680 --> 03:13:58.680]  And in most of your processed foods
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:00.680]  What's wrong with the petrochemical
[03:14:00.680 --> 03:14:02.680]  You're supposed to drink crude oil
[03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:04.680]  Well here's another example
[03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:06.680]  Go out and buy blueberry bagels
[03:14:06.680 --> 03:14:08.680]  Or blueberry bread
[03:14:08.680 --> 03:14:10.680]  You'll find that most of those blueberries
[03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:12.680]  Are not made out of blueberries
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:14.680]  They're made out of three ingredients
[03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:16.680]  Partially hydrogenated oils
[03:14:16.680 --> 03:14:18.680]  Liquid sugars
[03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:20.680]  And artificial food colors
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:22.680]  That's good for your heart
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:24.680]  Along with the beetles
[03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:26.680]  Blueberry sugar formula
[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:28.680]  Blueberry beetles, that could be a new brand for them
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:30.680]  Exactly
[03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:32.680]  And some of them have propylene glycol in it
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:34.680]  And that's the stuff that you use to winterize RVs
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:36.680]  What's wrong with that?
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:38.680]  Well it's great for RVs
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:40.680]  What about when a cat drinks antifreeze it's good
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:42.680]  Yeah, wouldn't want my
[03:14:42.680 --> 03:14:44.680]  My kids drinking it
[03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:46.680]  But this is the kind of stuff
[03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:48.680]  That people need to know
[03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:50.680]  And the FDA is going out of its way
[03:14:50.680 --> 03:14:52.680]  And they don't know it
[03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:54.680]  Well you just don't care about children
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:56.680]  My being able to have that nice teddy bear
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:14:58.680]  I know, I mean if it were up to me
[03:14:58.680 --> 03:15:00.680]  Alex I would go in, I would
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:02.680]  Ban sugar infant formula
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:04.680]  For babies, I would
[03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:06.680]  I would force this off the shelves
[03:15:06.680 --> 03:15:08.680]  I mean, you know, if they gave me the
[03:15:08.680 --> 03:15:10.680]  Of course, if the eugenesis to break up the family
[03:15:10.680 --> 03:15:12.680]  Hadn't told women how cool it was
[03:15:12.680 --> 03:15:14.680]  To not breastfeed their babies
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:16.680]  Women have got the equipment
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:18.680]  And guess what, it's designed just for the baby
[03:15:18.680 --> 03:15:20.680]  To get the extra weight
[03:15:20.680 --> 03:15:22.680]  And the baby is there for the baby
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:24.680]  To have the baby in that room
[03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:26.680]  The vaccines of every woman before
[03:15:26.680 --> 03:15:28.680]  That woman in history
[03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:30.680]  Delivered to that child
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:32.680]  Heaven forbid we drink cowmil
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:34.680]  That hasn't been boiled or
[03:15:34.680 --> 03:15:36.680]  Past your eyes that passes on some things
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:38.680]  Exactly, oh and we haven't talked about
[03:15:38.680 --> 03:15:40.680]  This vaccine season
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:42.680]  They're already pushing hard
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:44.680]  For everybody to go out and get vaccinated
[03:15:44.680 --> 03:15:46.680]  Now, they want you to get vaccinated
[03:15:46.680 --> 03:15:48.760]  along with all the kids drinking this formula.
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:51.800]  Have you seen the kid shows where they on PBS?
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:53.360]  What's that clip we played last year
[03:15:53.360 --> 03:15:54.200]  where the teacher goes,
[03:15:54.200 --> 03:15:59.200]  muahaha, if you search the term TV pushes vaccines on kids,
[03:15:59.400 --> 03:16:01.480]  cartoon pushes vaccines on kids,
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:03.240]  and it's literally like demonic.
[03:16:03.240 --> 03:16:05.800]  It's like, you take the shot, you'll feel much better.
[03:16:05.800 --> 03:16:07.360]  Ha ha ha ha.
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:08.200]  Sorry.
[03:16:08.200 --> 03:16:10.400]  I've seen some cartoons pushing vaccines.
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:12.000]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.400]  It's kind of like, remember they used to complain
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:17.640]  about the tobacco companies using Joe Camel
[03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:18.960]  to sell cigarettes.
[03:16:18.960 --> 03:16:21.200]  Well, they're using the same thing to sell vaccines
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:22.040]  for kids.
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:23.880]  But it was a conspiracy 40 years ago
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:26.240]  to say cigarettes gave you cancer.
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:27.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:16:27.080 --> 03:16:28.600]  Cigarettes are good for you.
[03:16:28.600 --> 03:16:32.480]  And so is a diet for a baby of 52% corn syrup.
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.720]  Come on.
[03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:35.840]  Well, I know, Alex, I didn't mean to be so unreasonable
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:38.280]  here today to suggest that babies shouldn't drink
[03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:41.480]  corn sugar and, well, no, they got me using the term,
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:42.320]  corn sugar.
[03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:45.840]  It's corn syrup solids, folks, corn syrup solids,
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:47.760]  and fructose and sucrose.
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:49.760]  This is not stuff that babies should be drinking.
[03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:51.720]  They should be drinking mother's milk
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:52.960]  and they should get sunshine.
[03:16:52.960 --> 03:16:53.920]  That's a conspiracy.
[03:16:53.920 --> 03:16:56.200]  Literally in the 20 years from now, if we don't stop this,
[03:16:56.200 --> 03:16:59.000]  it'll be a conspiracy theory that women ever breastfed.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:16:59.840]  It probably.
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:03.640]  It'll be a conspiracy theory that people could talk.
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:07.360]  Well, you know, doctors today are telling women
[03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:09.000]  that if there's cancer in their family,
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.480]  they have to have a double mastectomy
[03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:13.200]  to prevent cancer.
[03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:15.720]  They're cutting off their breasts to prevent cancer
[03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:18.120]  in women who don't even have it.
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:18.960]  This is how.
[03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:19.920]  Instead of telling them to eat healthy food.
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:22.600]  Instead of telling them, yeah, to breastfeed your babies,
[03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:25.080]  let's just lose these, take them off
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:26.200]  so that you don't get cancer.
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:29.440]  And in the meantime, we'll probably irradiate you
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:31.680]  with mammograms just in case.
[03:17:31.680 --> 03:17:34.040]  But you know, I mean, to get, you know,
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:35.560]  focused on something serious
[03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:37.000]  as I've been screwing around a bit.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.880]  If you look at all the studies,
[03:17:39.880 --> 03:17:44.880]  sodium fluoride, they 100% attacks all the organs,
[03:17:45.240 --> 03:17:47.200]  the bones, massively increases cancer
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:49.720]  and is directly linked to breast cancer.
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:51.440]  But so is melamine.
[03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:53.840]  So is bisphenol A.
[03:17:53.840 --> 03:17:54.680]  All of this.
[03:17:54.680 --> 03:17:58.400]  So women wonder why they're having so many problems.
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:01.160]  I mean, because they're killing you.
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:03.920]  Yeah, a lot of women really don't know where it's coming from
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:06.120]  and they're not getting information from good sources.
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:08.680]  That's why I really appreciate what you're doing here, Alex.
[03:18:08.680 --> 03:18:10.200]  And thanks for having me on today too,
[03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:13.120]  because women especially need to know
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:14.800]  you can prevent breast cancer.
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:18.080]  Vitamin D alone, according to the research that I've seen,
[03:18:18.080 --> 03:18:20.400]  that I've quoted, it's science journals.
[03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:23.480]  But Cass Sunstein says that it's a conspiracy theory
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:25.280]  to say the sun is good for you.
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:27.280]  And he says you should be basically arrested.
[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:28.320]  We're not making this up.
[03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:30.120]  And you go, why are you talking about the sun?
[03:18:30.120 --> 03:18:32.000]  You don't get the real vitamin D, do you,
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  without getting that sun?
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.360]  They want you to live in caves like Osama bin Laden.
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:36.440]  That's basically...
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:39.000]  I'm sorry, go over your research on the...
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  Basically four out of five cancers can be prevented
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.080]  just from vitamin D alone.
[03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:45.680]  And if you take some magnesium,
[03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:48.080]  you'll have better absorption of vitamin D.
[03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:50.880]  Vitamin D, there are receptors for this vitamin
[03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:52.120]  on every major organ.
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:54.320]  You mean we are designed to get sun?
[03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:55.720]  Unbelievable, I know.
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:18:57.760]  I wonder why white people have white skin
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:00.160]  because we came from an area more North,
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:02.000]  we need to absorb more of it.
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:03.120]  That's it.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:05.360]  People would just look around.
[03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:08.400]  And, you know, you shouldn't be afraid of the sun.
[03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:09.400]  It's there for a purpose.
[03:19:09.400 --> 03:19:12.720]  Yeah, and yes, folks, you will get old
[03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:14.800]  and sometimes you'll get skin cancer,
[03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:17.000]  but the studies show you'll get more internal cancers,
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:18.160]  the ones that really kill you.
[03:19:18.160 --> 03:19:20.320]  If you don't get the sun, but also a lot of skin cancers,
[03:19:20.320 --> 03:19:21.320]  I've read the major studies,
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:23.760]  are because if you don't have the right nutrients in you,
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:26.200]  then you get sun, bye-bye.
[03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:27.720]  If you have good nutrition,
[03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:31.080]  your chances of skin cancer drop to near zero,
[03:19:31.080 --> 03:19:32.720]  especially if you're doing superfoods.
[03:19:32.720 --> 03:19:35.400]  Well, I'm sold, you know, I'm an extremist
[03:19:35.400 --> 03:19:37.640]  and either I'm extremely unhealthy or extremely healthy.
[03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:41.240]  I am going to take the path of the health ranger.
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:42.560]  I'm happy to hear that, Alex.
[03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:44.040]  And you sure you don't want this simulac?
[03:19:44.040 --> 03:19:44.880]  Because I could leave it in.
[03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:46.400]  It's like they say in Caddyshack,
[03:19:46.400 --> 03:19:48.680]  it's like I've been with the Dalai Lama
[03:19:48.680 --> 03:19:50.720]  and he's told me I will be given total,
[03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:52.680]  total consciousness at my death.
[03:19:52.680 --> 03:19:54.120]  Unga galunga.
[03:19:54.120 --> 03:19:55.240]  By the way, I talked to Jesse Ventura,
[03:19:55.240 --> 03:19:56.680]  he really asked the Dalai Lama,
[03:19:56.680 --> 03:19:58.000]  have you seen Caddyshack?
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:01.080]  We'll be right back with your phone call, stay with us.
[03:20:01.080 --> 03:20:04.200]  Listen up, friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[03:20:04.200 --> 03:20:06.360]  The mainstream media is now admitting
[03:20:06.360 --> 03:20:08.000]  that we're going into a depression.
[03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:09.760]  Don't be dependent on the government
[03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:10.880]  for you and your family.
[03:20:10.880 --> 03:20:12.600]  You need to get your own supply
[03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:16.280]  of high quality, storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:18.040]  They're the best company out there.
[03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:19.880]  The longest continually operating
[03:20:19.880 --> 03:20:22.200]  with a ton of great food to choose from.
[03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:24.520]  It's all fresh made on a monthly basis,
[03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:26.520]  not some old, cruddy food they're selling you
[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:27.840]  like some of the other guys.
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:29.840]  Try their new evacuation pack,
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:32.400]  a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[03:20:32.400 --> 03:20:34.800]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[03:20:34.800 --> 03:20:38.080]  With open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months,
[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:40.920]  the crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations.
[03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:43.120]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:45.480]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:20:45.480 --> 03:20:47.560]  Go to their website online right now,
[03:20:47.560 --> 03:20:52.560]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:57.200]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex
[03:20:57.200 --> 03:21:00.880]  or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:03.880]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:05.920]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:07.560]  and live out their golden years.
[03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:09.360]  Unfortunately with taxation,
[03:21:09.360 --> 03:21:12.560]  the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:15.680]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:21:15.680 --> 03:21:17.280]  Is this a flaw for enterprise
[03:21:17.280 --> 03:21:19.720]  or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:21.600]  forcing us into perpetual debt,
[03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:23.880]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:21:23.880 --> 03:21:25.560]  These questions and more can be answered
[03:21:25.560 --> 03:21:27.360]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:28.960]  The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:31.640]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American
[03:21:31.640 --> 03:21:34.160]  needs to know about central bank power.
[03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:36.320]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:38.400]  of international banking cartel.
[03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:39.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:42.040]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s
[03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:44.120]  to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:49.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:52.000]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:56.840]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:22:00.200]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:00.200 --> 03:22:04.400]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:22:04.400 --> 03:22:05.680]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:09.600]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.600]  The United States is now recognized globally
[03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:17.720]  as one of the most impressive police states on earth.
[03:22:17.720 --> 03:22:20.120]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:22.200]  of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[03:22:22.200 --> 03:22:24.360]  now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:27.240]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government
[03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:30.360]  program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:32.760]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:34.520]  to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:34.520 --> 03:22:37.760]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency
[03:22:37.760 --> 03:22:40.600]  dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,
[03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:44.720]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:48.320]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:50.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:50.200 --> 03:22:51.320]  It's here.
[03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:54.920]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com
[03:22:54.920 --> 03:22:59.280]  or see it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:00.200]  Less is more.
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:04.320]  I want you to think of Life Change T as, well, a 2008
[03:23:04.320 --> 03:23:05.600]  Ferrari 612.
[03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:09.120]  The Ferrari 612 is a two door four passenger luxury car
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:12.040]  that gives an exploding 540 horsepower
[03:23:12.040 --> 03:23:13.800]  through its six liter V12.
[03:23:13.800 --> 03:23:16.800]  It has a top speed of 199 miles per hour
[03:23:16.800 --> 03:23:20.000]  and can accelerate 0 to 16 in about four seconds.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:21.960]  Life Change T will accelerate your life
[03:23:21.960 --> 03:23:24.160]  into feeling more energy, losing weight,
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:27.480]  and cleansing toxins out of your body so you'll live longer.
[03:23:27.480 --> 03:23:28.280]  And guess what?
[03:23:28.280 --> 03:23:31.720]  You can accelerate your life without a Ferrari 612 sticker
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:34.080]  price of $318,000.
[03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:36.640]  You can buy green tea for less, but unfortunately,
[03:23:36.640 --> 03:23:39.720]  it's just another daily driver with no performance.
[03:23:39.720 --> 03:23:43.160]  So for just about $1 a day, you can drive the Ferrari of tees.
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:44.840]  Don't be fooled by size.
[03:23:44.840 --> 03:23:47.680]  Check our website out at GetTheT.com.
[03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:53.920]  That's GetTheT.com, where you can call us at 928-308-0408.
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:23:57.520]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[03:23:57.520 --> 03:24:01.400]  Remember Life Change T.
[03:24:01.400 --> 03:24:03.560]  OK, folks, we are back live.
[03:24:03.560 --> 03:24:08.280]  This was run during the flu season last year on PBS Kids,
[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:09.480]  where they're dancing around.
[03:24:09.480 --> 03:24:11.600]  The little boy's scared, but they're
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:12.440]  going to give him a shot.
[03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:12.960]  Here it is.
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:17.640]  You love your sleeves, and come and get it.
[03:24:17.640 --> 03:24:18.360]  It's fun.
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:19.400]  I don't get the virus.
[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:20.600]  I won't give it to you.
[03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:23.440]  If you don't give it to me, I won't give it to her.
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:26.320]  If I don't get it from her, I won't give it to them.
[03:24:26.320 --> 03:24:28.000]  That's true.
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:30.880]  If I don't get the virus, I won't give it to you.
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:33.520]  Hey kids, we're ready to roll.
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:35.040]  Stop the night virus.
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:36.040]  That's our goal.
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:37.720]  So come on, everybody.
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:38.800]  We're getting the shot.
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:40.320]  And I've heard a little bit.
[03:24:40.320 --> 03:24:41.360]  Just a little bit.
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:44.800]  But it's going to help a whole lot.
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:47.520]  Hey kids, I'm ready to roll.
[03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:49.000]  Stop the night virus.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:50.000]  That's my goal.
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:51.640]  So come on, everybody.
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:52.800]  We're getting the shot.
[03:24:52.800 --> 03:24:54.240]  And I've heard a little bit.
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:55.200]  Just a little bit.
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:24:59.480]  Ouch.
[03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:02.680]  But it's going to help a whole lot.
[03:25:02.680 --> 03:25:04.320]  Ha ha ha ha.
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:06.240]  Hey, where's the unit and play it from the start, where she
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:08.360]  goes, moo ha ha ha.
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:10.200]  Find the moo ha ha ha.
[03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:13.080]  And notice it's all so the little kid, he gets to be cool
[03:25:13.080 --> 03:25:15.320]  with the older kids because he gets the shot.
[03:25:15.320 --> 03:25:20.280]  It turns out it reduces immunity, makes him doubly
[03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:23.200]  susceptible to the regular seasonal flu.
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:24.760]  Mainstream news admits that.
[03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:25.840]  And it was all a fraud.
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:29.240]  And it increases his seizure rate by 10 times
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:30.920]  and gives him all sorts of brain damage.
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:31.640]  All admitted.
[03:25:31.640 --> 03:25:33.640]  All we were right about that again.
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:34.680]  But it's so much fun.
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:38.640]  Did we find the part where she laughs like a goblin?
[03:25:38.640 --> 03:25:42.720]  OK, well, while we're looking for that to find that key area
[03:25:42.720 --> 03:25:44.840]  there where the children are being learned to be injected.
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:46.760]  Remember, I'm seeing in.
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:49.880]  US apologizes for infecting Guatemalans with STDs,
[03:25:49.880 --> 03:25:54.240]  gave thousands of them in one operation, 1,600 people.
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:56.000]  They injected them with syphilis, telling them
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:58.400]  they were giving them a vaccine.
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:02.720]  It might hurt a little, but it's going to help a whole lot.
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:03.360]  You know, they should.
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:06.800]  That cartoon should say these kids are the medical experiment
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:08.880]  for today because that's what they're doing.
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:10.720]  That's that's a medical experiment.
[03:26:10.720 --> 03:26:12.040]  But hey, but she's happy.
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:13.880]  I mean, this she sounds like Dr. Frankenstein.
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:14.440]  Here it is.
[03:26:14.440 --> 03:26:16.360]  It's we're ready to roll.
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:17.800]  Stopping that virus.
[03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:18.840]  That's our goal.
[03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:20.520]  So come on, everybody.
[03:26:20.520 --> 03:26:21.640]  We're getting the shot.
[03:26:21.640 --> 03:26:23.080]  It might hurt a little bit.
[03:26:23.080 --> 03:26:24.200]  Just a little bit.
[03:26:24.200 --> 03:26:26.120]  But it's going to help a whole lot.
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:28.640]  No, it's vaccination.
[03:26:28.640 --> 03:26:29.880]  That's a little enjoyment.
[03:26:29.880 --> 03:26:31.600]  That's a little inside joke.
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:34.840]  It's going to help a whole lot.
[03:26:34.840 --> 03:26:38.080]  Oh, yes, it is an inside joke.
[03:26:38.080 --> 03:26:39.880]  If they really wanted to help those kids, Alex,
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:43.480]  they'd be handing out vitamin D supplements or fish oil
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:45.840]  supplements or just letting them go outside and play.
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:49.760]  They'd have them in the creek catching tadpoles.
[03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:51.160]  They do something other than.
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:54.160]  You know, they don't allow nationwide dodgeball or chase
[03:26:54.160 --> 03:26:55.600]  or any type of exertion.
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:57.840]  It's there was a study recently, Alex,
[03:26:57.840 --> 03:27:02.320]  that said 95% of Americans never do anything that
[03:27:02.320 --> 03:27:03.960]  requires exertion.
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:05.640]  Only 5%.
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:08.240]  So the most exercise some people get
[03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:09.960]  is walking across the parking lot
[03:27:09.960 --> 03:27:11.800]  to go by their pharmaceuticals.
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:15.000]  Or maybe they just go through the drive-thru to get them now.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:16.360]  You've got drive-thru pharmacies.
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:20.200]  I think I'm going to swim 2,000 yards today.
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:21.280]  I'll join you.
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:22.040]  Really want to go?
[03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:23.400]  Yeah, let's go.
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:24.680]  We go to the lake, swim across it.
[03:27:24.680 --> 03:27:25.480]  I'm good.
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:26.880]  I'm going to do that Saturday.
[03:27:26.880 --> 03:27:28.040]  OK.
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:29.240]  How long are you here in town?
[03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:31.240]  Well, I don't want to say that on the air, Alex,
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:32.360]  but I'll go with you.
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:34.720]  That's right, you got the spooks after you.
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:37.520]  Well, you know, when us truth-tellers
[03:27:37.520 --> 03:27:40.400]  have to be careful about who knows where we are.
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:42.160]  I mean, I had people of the bad guys
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:44.680]  got to be careful if they find me.
[03:27:44.680 --> 03:27:46.320]  I'm sure that's the case.
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:47.280]  Yes.
[03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:49.160]  But it's true.
[03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:53.840]  It's, you know, they don't want us to be able to educate people
[03:27:53.840 --> 03:27:56.880]  about these things because when people wake up and start
[03:27:56.880 --> 03:28:00.160]  thinking, and there are a lot of great, well-informed people
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:03.800]  out there who are on top of the situation,
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:06.160]  and when we connect with those people
[03:28:06.160 --> 03:28:08.680]  and empower them with additional information,
[03:28:08.680 --> 03:28:10.520]  and sometimes they'll send us tips, right?
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:12.440]  You get tips from people I do too.
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:16.240]  Then that creates a feedback loop of knowledge.
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:19.960]  And knowledge is dangerous to the system that's trying to run.
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:21.520]  Well, you're also very credible.
[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:22.280]  You're very credible.
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:23.560]  I want to quit hogging you.
[03:28:23.560 --> 03:28:25.480]  Let's go to some phone calls because, well,
[03:28:25.480 --> 03:28:28.240]  and we're going to have most of the next segment folks as well.
[03:28:28.240 --> 03:28:29.880]  It's so good to meet you in person.
[03:28:29.880 --> 03:28:31.920]  It's really great to be here and to see you, Alex.
[03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:33.960]  I've been interviewing you for, what, six, seven years?
[03:28:33.960 --> 03:28:35.680]  It's been a number of years.
[03:28:35.680 --> 03:28:37.320]  We've always done it over the phone.
[03:28:37.320 --> 03:28:38.240]  And that's fine.
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:40.440]  But here in person, we can actually have more fun.
[03:28:40.440 --> 03:28:40.800]  You know what?
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:43.840]  I'll bring more baby food next time.
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:45.760]  Actually, I'm kind of hungry right now.
[03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:47.280]  Is there a beetle in that?
[03:28:47.280 --> 03:28:49.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Annie in Indiana.
[03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:51.600]  Annie, you're on the air.
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:52.440]  Good afternoon.
[03:28:52.440 --> 03:28:54.280]  It's a great show today, guys.
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:55.280]  Thank you.
[03:28:55.280 --> 03:28:57.280]  And I have a question for you, Mike.
[03:28:57.280 --> 03:29:01.480]  I believe I've already seen you on YouTube as a health ranger.
[03:29:01.480 --> 03:29:02.920]  Yeah, probably so.
[03:29:02.920 --> 03:29:06.480]  He's not wearing his little black disguise
[03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:07.640]  like the Lone Ranger today.
[03:29:07.640 --> 03:29:09.200]  And Tonto's not here with him.
[03:29:09.200 --> 03:29:12.840]  But yeah, no, he's out of disguise.
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:14.080]  Oh, gosh.
[03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:15.120]  And I have a question.
[03:29:15.120 --> 03:29:17.040]  I have a big red dog, 90 pounds.
[03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:18.880]  She looks like a red lab.
[03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:20.360]  I call her red dog.
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:23.680]  I'm the big clip at the big red dog.
[03:29:23.680 --> 03:29:26.960]  Like most red haired humans, she has skin allergies.
[03:29:26.960 --> 03:29:28.320]  And she's allergic to flea bot.
[03:29:28.320 --> 03:29:31.400]  She's constantly botting and chewing on herself.
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:34.000]  And I'm starting to realize it's possibly
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:37.200]  the GMO dry dog food I've been feeding her.
[03:29:37.200 --> 03:29:38.800]  Well, well, stay there, because I
[03:29:38.800 --> 03:29:42.440]  have done a lot of research on mainline dog food.
[03:29:42.440 --> 03:29:44.720]  It's, well, I'll tell you about it on the other side.
[03:29:44.720 --> 03:29:46.560]  We'll get the health ranger.
[03:29:46.560 --> 03:29:47.560]  We'll get his take on it.
[03:29:51.320 --> 03:29:52.720]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.720 --> 03:29:55.200]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:05.680]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away
[03:30:05.680 --> 03:30:06.520]  by yourself.
[03:30:06.520 --> 03:30:07.760]  But with the help of Dan Pillar,
[03:30:07.760 --> 03:30:10.400]  you can get your problem solved once and for all.
[03:30:10.400 --> 03:30:11.640]  Hi, I'm Dan Pillar.
[03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:13.760]  For 30 years, I've helped thousands of people
[03:30:13.760 --> 03:30:14.960]  solve their tax debt problem.

[03:30:19.520 --> 03:30:20.880]  to solving your problem.
[03:30:20.880 --> 03:30:22.920]  First, we stabilize IRS collection action
[03:30:22.920 --> 03:30:24.680]  so you don't have to worry about the IRS
[03:30:24.680 --> 03:30:26.600]  using your bank counter paycheck.

[03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:31.400]  to get your tax debt reduced to the fullest extent possible,
[03:30:31.400 --> 03:30:33.720]  sometimes even completely eliminated.
[03:30:33.720 --> 03:30:36.040]  And finally, we work with you every step of the way
[03:30:36.040 --> 03:30:38.400]  to get your problem solved once and for all.

[03:30:47.520 --> 03:30:50.200]  Dan Pillar has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS
[03:30:50.200 --> 03:30:52.640]  for three decades, and he can help you, too.
[03:30:52.640 --> 03:30:57.240]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[03:30:57.240 --> 03:31:00.880]  That's 800-34 no tax.
[03:31:00.880 --> 03:31:03.280]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:31:03.280 --> 03:31:05.600]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:31:05.600 --> 03:31:08.760]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:11.920]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[03:31:11.920 --> 03:31:13.920]  through their own words and documents.
[03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:15.960]  The new world order really is a tool
[03:31:15.960 --> 03:31:18.400]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:20.880]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:20.880 --> 03:31:23.640]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:23.640 --> 03:31:26.520]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:26.520 --> 03:31:30.040]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[03:31:30.040 --> 03:31:31.960]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:31:31.960 --> 03:31:34.480]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:34.480 --> 03:31:37.200]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short
[03:31:37.200 --> 03:31:39.880]  of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:39.880 --> 03:31:42.720]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:42.720 --> 03:31:45.080]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite,
[03:31:45.080 --> 03:31:46.400]  and then everyone else.
[03:31:46.400 --> 03:31:47.520]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:47.520 --> 03:31:48.760]  You're everyone else.

[03:33:12.080 --> 03:33:16.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:16.240 --> 03:33:18.040]  We are the heart of the Resistance,
[03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:20.040]  biggest alternative news websites in the world,
[03:33:20.040 --> 03:33:22.560]  most powerful alternative radio show on the planet.
[03:33:22.560 --> 03:33:27.720]  And we've got the number one advocate hands down
[03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:31.480]  for true healthy living and exposing this eugenics takeover.
[03:33:31.480 --> 03:33:33.680]  Mike Adams, the health ranger here with us.
[03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:36.360]  And I'm going to run through five calls quickly.
[03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:38.160]  Because I do want to hear from you.
[03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:39.880]  But I need to get to some breaking news.
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:43.960]  Remember, ABC website tells kids when they should die.
[03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:46.520]  That's news.com.au.
[03:33:46.520 --> 03:33:50.120]  And kids are taught in cartoons and on the ABC website
[03:33:50.120 --> 03:33:52.840]  that animals are dying if they don't commit suicide.
[03:33:52.840 --> 03:33:54.520]  And you've seen families shoot themselves,
[03:33:54.520 --> 03:33:55.720]  shoot their baby.
[03:33:55.720 --> 03:33:57.080]  Now that happened in South America.
[03:33:57.080 --> 03:33:58.920]  The guy take over Discovery Channel.
[03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:00.240]  And they're now saying all of the news
[03:34:00.240 --> 03:34:03.200]  are calling it eco, eco fascism.
[03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:05.080]  And this is why I criticize Avatar.
[03:34:05.080 --> 03:34:07.120]  They take a real message that we're in trouble.
[03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:10.200]  And their answer is keep eating GMO.
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:13.940]  But we need to tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[03:34:13.940 --> 03:34:16.440]  So they're taking over people's reasonable concerns
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:18.640]  and co-opting it, kind of like Glenn Beck does
[03:34:18.640 --> 03:34:20.280]  to conservatives and libertarians.
[03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:22.800]  That's how they dominate and control things.
[03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:25.840]  But ABC News website tells kids when they should die,
[03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:29.360]  Dillingpole, The London Telegraph, they have a new TV ad.
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:31.720]  It's four minutes long where kids are basically taught
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:33.880]  how great it is to lower their carbon footprint
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:34.880]  if they would just die.
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:36.120]  It's very gruesome.
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:39.000]  I want to warn people that are watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:40.840]  But this is what kids are being shown.
[03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:43.840]  Go green or we'll kill your kids, says Richard Curtis.
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:45.800]  Eco propaganda shocker.
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:47.800]  And so I want to go over the fact that that's
[03:34:47.800 --> 03:34:49.520]  wondering a lot of kids are committing suicide now
[03:34:49.520 --> 03:34:52.160]  and they cite, I'm doing this for Earth.
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:53.480]  But let's go back to Annie.
[03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:56.600]  Annie and Indiana, they call it awful.
[03:34:56.600 --> 03:34:58.760]  They take the intestines, the things they can't put
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:01.000]  in hot dogs, they take dead animals,
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:02.560]  a lot of veterinary clinics sell.
[03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:04.160]  This is mainstream news.
[03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:07.800]  Sell your dead dogs and cats and they grind them up.
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:10.840]  And then that's what's fed to your dog.
[03:35:10.840 --> 03:35:13.160]  And so if you think humans are being fed bad stuff,
[03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:14.240]  the dog can't talk.
[03:35:14.240 --> 03:35:16.100]  That's why most dogs don't want to eat dog food.
[03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:17.760]  Or they've been given real food.
[03:35:17.760 --> 03:35:20.800]  And it's just better if you're going to have a dog
[03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:23.080]  to cook for them, that's what we do.
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:25.240]  And there are some smaller dog food brands out there
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:26.080]  that are healthier.
[03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:28.080]  But do you want to comment on what she's talking about?
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:31.000]  Her animal having allergies because of GMO diet
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:31.840]  it's eating?
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:33.440]  Well, I think she's on the right track.
[03:35:33.440 --> 03:35:35.800]  Everything you said is right on Alex there.
[03:35:35.800 --> 03:35:38.160]  You can't go with mainstream dog food brands.
[03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:41.200]  But I just, I appreciate the fact that Annie is paying
[03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:42.960]  attention to the health of her dog.
[03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:45.280]  If parents did that with their babies,
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:47.200]  not just with their pets, but their kids as well.
[03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:49.720]  I'm sure Annie pays attention to her children's health
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:50.880]  if she has children.
[03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:53.280]  But if more parents around the country would pay attention
[03:35:53.280 --> 03:35:55.800]  to their children's health and get them on healthy food,
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:35:58.460]  then we would be better off as a country.
[03:35:58.460 --> 03:35:59.720]  We'd be more productive.
[03:35:59.720 --> 03:36:00.680]  We would live longer.
[03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:03.160]  We'd have greater happiness, greater health.
[03:36:03.160 --> 03:36:04.240]  That's extremist.
[03:36:04.240 --> 03:36:05.080]  I know.
[03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:05.920]  I admit it.
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:06.760]  I'm an, I'm-
[03:36:06.760 --> 03:36:10.520]  Look, feeding a baby 52% corn syrup is good.
[03:36:10.520 --> 03:36:12.440]  Annie, does that answer your question?
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:13.280]  Yes.
[03:36:13.280 --> 03:36:14.840]  And I was hoping you could maybe comment
[03:36:14.840 --> 03:36:17.400]  in any nutrients like Omega-3s.
[03:36:17.400 --> 03:36:20.400]  And I have heard brand names of the Honest Kitchen
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:22.520]  and Newman's Own for Dry Dog Foods.
[03:36:22.520 --> 03:36:24.960]  I can't find any that will sell wholesale.
[03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:28.240]  And I'm trying to find them locally in the stores.
[03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:30.640]  Both of those brands are really good.
[03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:32.000]  Honest Kitchen's good.
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:35.320]  Lisa Newman's brand is really good as Mira is a good brand.
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:37.760]  But Omega-3s and fish oils are really, really healthy
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:40.040]  for pets just as they are for humans.
[03:36:40.040 --> 03:36:41.400]  Okay.
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:42.880]  Thank you so much, Annie.
[03:36:42.880 --> 03:36:44.640]  Ruth and Louisiana, you're on the air
[03:36:44.640 --> 03:36:45.760]  with the Health Ranger.
[03:36:46.680 --> 03:36:47.880]  Yes, hello.
[03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:48.720]  Hi, Ruth.
[03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:49.560]  How you doing?
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:52.920]  Look, I have a question for Mike.
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:36:56.360]  I have chronic migraines.
[03:36:56.360 --> 03:37:01.360]  I'm looking into chelation to get the mercury out of my system
[03:37:04.480 --> 03:37:08.680]  because I used to have a whole bunch of silver fillings.
[03:37:08.680 --> 03:37:10.560]  But I wanted to do it naturally.
[03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:14.160]  And I was looking up like Chlorella and Cilantro
[03:37:14.160 --> 03:37:18.080]  to see whether or not that could bind from the mercury
[03:37:18.080 --> 03:37:19.720]  of flushing it out of my system.
[03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:22.000]  So, Lontro, the herb that grows in the yard,
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:23.400]  that's evil.
[03:37:23.400 --> 03:37:25.400]  Well, she's on the right track.
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:26.520]  Cilantro is really good.
[03:37:26.520 --> 03:37:28.000]  It binds with mercury.
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:29.720]  And just as Chlorella does.
[03:37:29.720 --> 03:37:31.080]  Well, that's good because I love it.
[03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:32.760]  Yeah, it's really good.
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:35.120]  But you're on the right track there, Ruth.
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:36.560]  But I do want to say I'm not a doctor.
[03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:38.440]  And so I can't offer a diagnosis.
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:41.280]  However, there are some great naturopaths
[03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:45.160]  who are well aware of mercury poisoning detox systems
[03:37:45.160 --> 03:37:46.000]  that work.
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:47.400]  And they do involve some of the nutrients
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:48.640]  that you already mentioned.
[03:37:48.640 --> 03:37:51.240]  Ah, anything else, Ruth?
[03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:56.040]  Hi, is there a certain site that I could go to,
[03:37:56.040 --> 03:38:00.160]  that you'd feel that would be better than others?
[03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:03.480]  Well, I would just look for organic Chlorella.
[03:38:03.480 --> 03:38:04.320]  It's out there.
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:06.640]  It's on many, many retailer sites.
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:09.960]  Just Google it, find a source that you trust,
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:11.360]  and buy organic.
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:13.720]  Yeah, I mean, if you find a site and you're not sure,
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:16.320]  just put the name of their site or their product in
[03:38:16.320 --> 03:38:18.080]  and do consumer reviews.
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:21.280]  And Angie's list, I mean, a lot of times, if something's good,
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:22.960]  you'll see positive reviews.
[03:38:22.960 --> 03:38:24.600]  But if something's bad, you know you're
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:26.200]  going to see stuff about it.
[03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:28.480]  Yeah, I don't know if it's OK if I plug a couple of companies
[03:38:28.480 --> 03:38:29.160]  that I know, Alec.
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:29.920]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:38:29.920 --> 03:38:33.520]  OK, well, then John Barron's baseline nutritionals
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:35.280]  is a really good source for detox,
[03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:39.160]  as well as edgroupsglobalhealingcenter.com.
[03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:40.280]  All right.
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:42.760]  All right, thank you so much, Ruth, hope that helps you.
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:44.040]  Let's talk to Tim and Nevada.
[03:38:44.040 --> 03:38:46.560]  Tim, you're on the air with the Health Ranger.
[03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:49.320]  Hey, Alec, this is former TSA guy
[03:38:49.320 --> 03:38:50.680]  that talked to you the other day.
[03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:52.920]  Yeah, and I've since confirmed that they're calling
[03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:54.160]  them in with questionnaires.
[03:38:54.160 --> 03:38:55.160]  Didn't I tell you?
[03:38:55.160 --> 03:38:56.960]  I told you.
[03:38:56.960 --> 03:38:58.800]  No, no, you told us, but then I went and actually did
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:01.360]  some research and saw others complaining about it,
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:03.440]  that they're laying off TSA, firing them.
[03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:04.840]  They call them in and say, do you mind
[03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:06.440]  running the body scanners?
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:08.280]  Do you have a concern with radiation?
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:11.400]  And if you're smart and say, yeah, I do, they go, thank you.
[03:39:11.400 --> 03:39:12.800]  Here's your pink slip.
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:14.440]  We'll find somebody who's stupid.
[03:39:14.440 --> 03:39:15.960]  What's on your mind, Tim?
[03:39:15.960 --> 03:39:17.720]  You guys are having an awesome show today.
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:21.080]  I just wanted to call in and tell Mike and you, Alec.
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:22.720]  I've educated my son so well.
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:24.520]  He's 13 years old now.
[03:39:24.520 --> 03:39:25.960]  I had him when I was in high school,
[03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:31.200]  and he just does not like all the things that's going on,
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:32.920]  but he really loves you guys.
[03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:36.000]  He knows everything about GMO, vaccines, high fructose
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:37.440]  corn syrup, everything.
[03:39:37.440 --> 03:39:40.800]  And it's all due to you guys and me, his dad,
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:45.400]  and he just, every day that I go to see him, he's like, dad,
[03:39:45.400 --> 03:39:47.080]  did you watch Alec's show today?
[03:39:47.080 --> 03:39:49.160]  Did you hear about this?
[03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:50.160]  Did you hear about that?
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:39:53.440]  He even knows so much about GMO crops that he knows.
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:57.960]  He watched the film about how to,
[03:39:57.960 --> 03:40:00.400]  he watched the film on your channel
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:05.120]  and how to find GMO food in the stores by product numbers.
[03:40:05.120 --> 03:40:06.840]  This kid is so smart.
[03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:10.640]  Wow, I mean, it sounds like he may be some kind of extremist
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:12.840]  that he reads labels.
[03:40:12.840 --> 03:40:15.080]  That is pretty extreme.
[03:40:15.080 --> 03:40:15.800]  That's awesome.
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:18.720]  My brother's son is almost three years old,
[03:40:18.720 --> 03:40:21.000]  and he's having problems with speaking right now.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:25.600]  And that just goes to prove what Alec is saying about,
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:28.040]  you know, the conspiracy theory of the future of, oh my God,
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:29.840]  you know, if human beings can actually speak,
[03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:31.080]  that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:33.720]  So, you know, the kid's three years old,
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:34.760]  he's a healthy baby.
[03:40:34.760 --> 03:40:37.000]  There's never really been anything wrong with him,
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:40.480]  but maybe some of the vaccinations that my brother gave him
[03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:41.760]  that I tried to ward him against
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:44.040]  and some of the GMO foods and some of the-
[03:40:44.040 --> 03:40:46.600]  No, I mean, listen, the IQ is dropping.
[03:40:46.600 --> 03:40:48.440]  And children that have been vaccinated
[03:40:48.440 --> 03:40:49.880]  and they're piling more and more on,
[03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:52.520]  I mean, they admitted Gardasil was killing girls
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:54.200]  that took it in the trials and they just approved it
[03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:56.480]  and a bunch of people died and it goes on the news,
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:40:58.120]  crying mothers and dead cheerleaders,
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:00.080]  and the government just says, that's the way it is.
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:02.680]  Hey, you're dying a DU, good, go die.
[03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:05.040]  I just want to say a good job being a parent, Tim,
[03:41:05.040 --> 03:41:10.040]  because I think your child and children from parents like you
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:13.440]  are going to represent the future of the human race.
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:16.400]  Future of civilization is going to be in their hands.
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:18.560]  Kids who can think, kids who can stay healthy,
[03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:19.400]  who can-
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:21.480]  But they know we're getting away from their system,
[03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:23.760]  so they're now coming out with mobile X-rayers
[03:41:23.760 --> 03:41:25.680]  where the cops are literally going to taser you
[03:41:25.680 --> 03:41:27.640]  if you don't walk through their radiation machine.
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:28.560]  Yeah.
[03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:30.920]  I mean, it's pure evil, it's total insanity.
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:32.320]  God bless you, Tim, moving quick here,
[03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:34.120]  Diane in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:36.600]  Hey guys, great show.
[03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:38.560]  Mike, I get your newsletter every morning
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:40.840]  and absolutely love it.
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:42.880]  I have a question about water.
[03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:45.600]  We're going to be building a house.
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:49.120]  It'll be in a rural area and so I have the option
[03:41:49.120 --> 03:41:53.600]  of a well or a rainwater catchment system
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:58.560]  or the, not the city water, but the county waterline
[03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:00.440]  with a whole house filter.
[03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:01.280]  Uh-huh.
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:05.440]  And now with all the chemtrails
[03:42:05.440 --> 03:42:10.440]  and the Gulf cleanup oil tick toxins in the air,
[03:42:10.760 --> 03:42:12.600]  what is your better choice for clean water?
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:14.240]  Whatever you do, you filter it.
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:15.080]  Well, absolutely.
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:17.240]  I would find a neighbor who's got a well,
[03:42:17.240 --> 03:42:19.320]  ask if you can test their water.
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:21.880]  If that tests clean and free of pesticides,
[03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:22.920]  then drill a well.
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:25.320]  Because that's a source that you can control
[03:42:25.320 --> 03:42:27.280]  and you can't control what's in the air
[03:42:27.280 --> 03:42:29.600]  and that could affect catchment systems.
[03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:32.680]  And you obviously can't control what comes out of the county
[03:42:32.680 --> 03:42:34.360]  or city water systems.
[03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:36.960]  And you can't really guarantee that those are going to work
[03:42:36.960 --> 03:42:38.960]  in the case of an infrastructure failure,
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:40.840]  whether it's short-term or long-term.
[03:42:40.840 --> 03:42:42.000]  So I would go with a well,
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:44.160]  go with a DC pump that's solarized,
[03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:47.160]  so you can drive it with the sun.
[03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:48.960]  Now, Diane, don't listen to him.
[03:42:48.960 --> 03:42:51.880]  I recommend, we're going to give you a document cam shot
[03:42:51.880 --> 03:42:53.080]  of this.
[03:42:53.080 --> 03:42:56.600]  We have Ozarka fluorated water for kids.
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:59.920]  And then we have HEB with added fluoride for children.
[03:42:59.920 --> 03:43:03.040]  I'm going to show folks a document cam shot of that.
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:03.880]  Do not listen to him.
[03:43:03.880 --> 03:43:05.640]  Don't filter your water.
[03:43:05.640 --> 03:43:07.400]  The government tens of thousands of times
[03:43:07.400 --> 03:43:09.200]  has killed people in secret tests,
[03:43:09.200 --> 03:43:12.360]  put cancer viruses in vaccines, CNN News today.
[03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:14.440]  Trust them.
[03:43:14.440 --> 03:43:16.040]  I mean, you know, when they,
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:17.400]  it doesn't matter of all the studies show
[03:43:17.400 --> 03:43:19.840]  this massively increases cancer.
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:22.000]  Listen, don't listen.
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:23.040]  Trust the government.
[03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:24.240]  Trust these good companies.
[03:43:24.240 --> 03:43:25.400]  Drink fluoride, ma'am.
[03:43:25.400 --> 03:43:26.600]  I appreciate your call.
[03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:28.640]  What? I mean, come on.
[03:43:28.640 --> 03:43:29.880]  That's awesome.
[03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:31.640]  Well, I mean, this is sick.
[03:43:31.640 --> 03:43:33.640]  Telling people to have well water.
[03:43:33.640 --> 03:43:34.480]  Maybe they're going to stop fluoride.
[03:43:34.480 --> 03:43:35.320]  Stop a freak.
[03:43:35.320 --> 03:43:36.480]  Hold on, I've got a freak are you.
[03:43:36.480 --> 03:43:37.920]  It's, yeah, I know.
[03:43:37.920 --> 03:43:38.760]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:40.760]  Our babies should have clean water, breast milk,
[03:43:40.760 --> 03:43:41.600]  sunshine.
[03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:45.880]  No, 52% corn syrup and fluoride.
[03:43:45.880 --> 03:43:47.480]  I say more dirt, Alex.
[03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:50.320]  Hey, listen, roach poison is in many brands
[03:43:50.320 --> 03:43:51.160]  are part fluoride.
[03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:53.120]  That's obviously for a baby.
[03:43:53.120 --> 03:43:54.040]  Come on, man.
[03:43:54.040 --> 03:43:54.880]  You got to do a whole.
[03:43:54.880 --> 03:43:56.920]  Our kids deserve more.
[03:43:56.920 --> 03:43:58.720]  Well, they're going to get more.
[03:43:58.720 --> 03:43:59.560]  Cause next time.
[03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:00.640]  Next, you're going to tell me.
[03:44:00.640 --> 03:44:01.480]  I'm going to bring some more.
[03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:03.000]  Next, you're going to tell me that 10 times
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.520]  a chest X-ray, that's what they have
[03:44:05.520 --> 03:44:07.520]  with these mobile vans looking through your wall
[03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:09.800]  is a bad for you and be a violation.
[03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:13.040]  The fourth amendment says mobile radiation vans
[03:44:13.040 --> 03:44:14.360]  will look through your walls.
[03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:15.320]  That's freedom.
[03:44:15.320 --> 03:44:17.920]  I have a right to be surveilled on the toilet.
[03:44:18.920 --> 03:44:21.320]  Well, I'm going to disagree with you on that.
[03:44:22.320 --> 03:44:24.120]  Totally sick.
[03:44:24.120 --> 03:44:24.960]  Yeah.
[03:44:24.960 --> 03:44:25.800]  See, I'm starting to like this.
[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:27.280]  I'm going to start seeing from their view.
[03:44:27.280 --> 03:44:28.400]  We could, we could do that.
[03:44:28.400 --> 03:44:30.920]  That show actually, I'll,
[03:44:30.920 --> 03:44:32.520]  what's wrong with some of these troops complaining
[03:44:32.520 --> 03:44:34.000]  about experimental shots being given to them?
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:35.600]  What's wrong with people?
[03:44:35.600 --> 03:44:38.040]  It's wrong to tell troops that D you has a four and a half
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:41.960]  or five and a half billion year half life and it kills them.
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:42.800]  And that's good.
[03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:44.280]  Dying is good.
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:45.520]  What's wrong with you people?
[03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:49.080]  You play the FTC and the FDA and I'll,
[03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:52.400]  I'll be the health ranger and we'll do a show.
[03:44:52.400 --> 03:44:54.680]  We'll do a show about supplements or health.
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:55.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:44:55.520 --> 03:44:57.320]  Let's do it in about a month and you can be over the phone.
[03:44:57.320 --> 03:44:59.200]  I got to play this video and then we're going to have to
[03:44:59.200 --> 03:45:00.880]  say bye to you at the end of it because I'm coming back
[03:45:00.880 --> 03:45:02.680]  with some financial news in the last segment,
[03:45:02.680 --> 03:45:04.120]  but it's been amazing.
[03:45:04.120 --> 03:45:06.280]  This is go green or we'll kill your kids.
[03:45:06.280 --> 03:45:09.080]  It says Richard Curtis, eco propaganda shocker
[03:45:09.080 --> 03:45:12.480]  and they have released a new video
[03:45:12.480 --> 03:45:17.480]  and this is like the UT scientist saying,
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:20.160]  he wants everybody to be killed by airborne Ebola.
[03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:21.520]  There's some of that in there.
[03:45:21.520 --> 03:45:22.360]  And here's another one.
[03:45:22.360 --> 03:45:24.280]  ABC website tells kids when they should die
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:25.320]  to save the earth.
[03:45:25.320 --> 03:45:27.120]  So just everywhere they're teaching people
[03:45:27.120 --> 03:45:28.520]  how to kill themselves,
[03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:30.040]  but then they want to put your kid on Prozac
[03:45:30.040 --> 03:45:31.600]  to stop them committing suicide,
[03:45:31.600 --> 03:45:34.400]  but the Prozac insert says it causes suicide.
[03:45:34.400 --> 03:45:37.280]  But see, I'm mentally ill because I notice all this.
[03:45:37.280 --> 03:45:39.760]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this clip.
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:40.600]  Now watch out folks.
[03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:41.440]  This is violent.
[03:45:41.440 --> 03:45:43.320]  You're watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[03:45:43.320 --> 03:45:45.080]  I'll be giving radio listeners play by play.
[03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:45.920]  Here it is.
[03:45:46.840 --> 03:45:48.640]  Right kids, just before you go,
[03:45:48.640 --> 03:45:50.160]  there's a brilliant idea in the air
[03:45:50.160 --> 03:45:51.720]  that I'd like to run by you.
[03:45:51.720 --> 03:45:53.800]  Now it's called 10, 10.
[03:45:53.800 --> 03:45:57.560]  The idea is everyone starts cutting their carbon emissions
[03:45:57.560 --> 03:45:59.320]  by 10%
[03:45:59.320 --> 03:46:02.680]  thus keeping the planet safe for everyone eventually.
[03:46:02.680 --> 03:46:04.560]  Now this hasn't got to be a huge thing,
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:07.920]  but I would love it if you and your families
[03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:09.480]  would think about doing something.
[03:46:09.480 --> 03:46:10.800]  What sort of thing miss?
[03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:14.640]  Well, like getting your dad to insulate the loft
[03:46:14.640 --> 03:46:19.040]  or taking your next holiday by train instead of flying,
[03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:22.560]  or buying energy-saving apples for him.
[03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:24.120]  We're thinking of using our car less.
[03:46:24.120 --> 03:46:25.400]  I'm going to cycle school.
[03:46:25.400 --> 03:46:27.520]  That's fantastic, Jemima.
[03:46:27.520 --> 03:46:29.000]  Now, no pressure at all,
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:30.360]  but it'd be great to get a sense
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:31.720]  of how many of you might do this.
[03:46:31.720 --> 03:46:33.560]  Just a rough percentage.
[03:46:33.560 --> 03:46:34.880]  That's fantastic.
[03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:36.720]  And there's not.
[03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:38.440]  Philip and Tracy.
[03:46:38.440 --> 03:46:39.440]  That's fine.
[03:46:39.440 --> 03:46:40.440]  That's absolutely fine.
[03:46:40.440 --> 03:46:41.440]  Your own choice.
[03:46:41.440 --> 03:46:43.960]  OK, class, thank you so much for today.
[03:46:43.960 --> 03:46:45.400]  Well, they're not going to cut to that.
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:46.400]  They're going to die.
[03:46:46.400 --> 03:46:47.400]  Oh!
[03:46:47.400 --> 03:46:48.400]  Just before you go,
[03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:53.400]  I just need to press this little button here.
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:46:58.400]  The kids didn't do it.
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:01.560]  But everybody, please remember to read chapters 5 and 6
[03:47:01.560 --> 03:47:03.920]  on volcanoes and glaciation.
[03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:05.920]  She murdered the planet.
[03:47:05.920 --> 03:47:07.920]  She murdered the children.
[03:47:07.920 --> 03:47:08.920]  Right.
[03:47:08.920 --> 03:47:11.920]  Just want to check on that 10-10 thing.
[03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:14.400]  Had some brilliant ideas from lots of you,
[03:47:14.400 --> 03:47:17.400]  how the firm can cut down emissions by 10%.
[03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:18.920]  Just a quick show of hands.
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:20.920]  Everyone who wants to get involved.
[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:22.920]  And if you don't, they kill you.
[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:23.920]  That's nearly everybody.
[03:47:23.920 --> 03:47:25.920]  And they're now announcing top scientists.
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:27.920]  They want to start killing us.
[03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:28.920]  But now they're just open, saying,
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:29.920]  yeah, we want to kill people.
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:30.920]  There's too many people.
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:32.920]  I mean, the folks.
[03:47:32.920 --> 03:47:34.920]  They don't raise their hand.
[03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:35.920]  No problem.
[03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:36.920]  Your choice.
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:37.920]  Okay.
[03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:39.920]  So those of you planning something here at home
[03:47:39.920 --> 03:47:41.920]  should probably get working on it.
[03:47:41.920 --> 03:47:44.920]  And, oh, gorgeous.
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:46.920]  Those of you who aren't...
[03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:50.920]  Kills them.
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:52.920]  Of course, they're already killing you with the vaccines
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:53.920]  and the GMO.
[03:47:53.920 --> 03:47:55.920]  Great weekend, everyone.
[03:47:55.920 --> 03:47:56.920]  Little control freaks.
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:47:57.920]  They enjoy killing.
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:47:58.920]  It's their power trip.
[03:47:58.920 --> 03:47:59.920]  It's their religion.
[03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:00.920]  Well, hello, everyone.
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:02.920]  It's great to be back here at Spurs.
[03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:04.920]  So many happy memories for me.
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:06.920]  Now they're on a soccer field.
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:07.920]  They're going to kill top footballers
[03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:08.920]  if they don't agree.
[03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:10.920]  What is this 10-10 thing the club is doing?
[03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:12.920]  Well, it means that we're trying to cut out
[03:48:12.920 --> 03:48:13.920]  carbon emissions by 10 cents a year.
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:14.920]  And they've announced...
[03:48:14.920 --> 03:48:16.920]  They're saying we already go fascist.
[03:48:16.920 --> 03:48:18.920]  We're going to kill you if you don't do what we said.
[03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:19.920]  You take the floodlights or what?
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:20.920]  Our lane.
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:21.920]  So they don't have energy.
[03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:23.920]  Lots of our fans are coming to matches on buses,
[03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:24.920]  trains, bikes and stuff,
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:26.920]  rather than coming by car.
[03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:27.920]  I see.
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:28.920]  Whatever.
[03:48:28.920 --> 03:48:29.920]  I wouldn't do it.
[03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:32.920]  It seems like distraction from football to me.
[03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:33.920]  That's just fine, David.
[03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:35.920]  You don't have to join in.
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:36.920]  Just ignore it.
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:37.920]  No pressure.
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:41.920]  So they kill him.
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:42.920]  Right, lads.
[03:48:42.920 --> 03:48:44.920]  Let's do some penalties.
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:47.920]  And see, this desensitizes you for mass death.
[03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:48.920]  10-10.
[03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:50.920]  Hundreds of thousands of people,
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:52.920]  schools, businesses, hospitals,
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:54.920]  movie stars, knitting circles,
[03:48:54.920 --> 03:48:57.920]  scout troops, presidents and governments,
[03:48:57.920 --> 03:48:59.920]  all tackling climate change
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:01.920]  in more than 40 countries.
[03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:03.920]  So the message is,
[03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:05.920]  we're going to kill you.
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:07.920]  But see, these little sneaky slimebags,
[03:49:07.920 --> 03:49:10.920]  they don't come and blow you up
[03:49:10.920 --> 03:49:11.920]  unless you're an Iraqi.
[03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:13.920]  They just put it in your food and your water.
[03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:15.920]  And that's what these scientific control freaks
[03:49:15.920 --> 03:49:17.920]  love the enjoyment.
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:19.920]  And they had a big meeting with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett
[03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:20.920]  with the Chinese leadership,
[03:49:20.920 --> 03:49:21.920]  where they all gave money
[03:49:21.920 --> 03:49:23.920]  for eugenics this week.
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:24.920]  Health ranger, in closing,
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:25.920]  what did you think of that?
[03:49:25.920 --> 03:49:26.920]  Well, that's pretty shocking.
[03:49:26.920 --> 03:49:28.920]  I haven't seen that clip until today.
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:29.920]  In my mind, 10-10,
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:31.920]  I thought that was the non-GMO day,
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:32.920]  because that's what we're gearing up for,
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:34.920]  10-10, October 10th.
[03:49:34.920 --> 03:49:35.920]  By the way, before I forget,
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:38.920]  tell Watson to get this up right now.
[03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:39.920]  Tell Watson to get this,
[03:49:39.920 --> 03:49:41.920]  but see, they move all the good non-GMO stuff
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:43.920]  under this umbrella to sell it.
[03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:44.920]  Exactly.
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:45.920]  But Watson, everybody,
[03:49:45.920 --> 03:49:47.920]  get that video on prisonplanet.com
[03:49:47.920 --> 03:49:49.920]  and infowars.com right now.
[03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:50.920]  But I got to say, you know,
[03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:52.920]  I try to live in a sustainable way.
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:55.920]  I try to live in a green way myself personally,
[03:49:55.920 --> 03:49:58.920]  but I don't want someone threatening me to do that.
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:00.920]  No, no, but see, the globalists control every movement.
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:02.920]  They come in and poison and kill and destroy,
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:04.920]  and then say carbon dioxide,
[03:50:04.920 --> 03:50:05.920]  which is taxes to them.
[03:50:05.920 --> 03:50:07.920]  You wrote about Bill Gates saying,
[03:50:07.920 --> 03:50:10.920]  we've got to get rid of humans to lower carbon.
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:11.920]  That's exactly it.
[03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:12.920]  It's his formula.
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:14.920]  It's a mathematical formula that he has out there
[03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:15.920]  that these globalists have.
[03:50:15.920 --> 03:50:17.920]  You've got to reduce the population
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:19.920]  in their minds to reduce...
[03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:20.920]  Well, that's the overall message,
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:21.920]  is kill people to lower carbon.
[03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:22.920]  It is.
[03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:23.920]  That is.
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:24.920]  It's very clear now.
[03:50:24.920 --> 03:50:25.920]  We're not even...
[03:50:25.920 --> 03:50:28.920]  Now you know why I gave a bad review of Avatar.
[03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:31.920]  Because it sells a lot of good ideas,
[03:50:31.920 --> 03:50:32.920]  but then with bad ones,
[03:50:32.920 --> 03:50:35.920]  and then we sent you info about Mr. Cameron, didn't we?
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:36.920]  You did.
[03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:37.920]  I didn't know that about James Cameron.
[03:50:37.920 --> 03:50:40.920]  Some of that info shocked me.
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:41.920]  Tell folks what you learned.
[03:50:41.920 --> 03:50:42.920]  He's a big globalist.
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:43.920]  Well, it just goes to show, you know,
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:45.920]  that we can always learn from each other.
[03:50:45.920 --> 03:50:47.920]  And that's why I think it's good for...
[03:50:47.920 --> 03:50:48.920]  It's great to be here in person
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:49.920]  and we can share some ideas.
[03:50:49.920 --> 03:50:52.920]  But, you know, some of Cameron's views,
[03:50:52.920 --> 03:50:55.920]  I thought were very much against what I believe,
[03:50:55.920 --> 03:50:56.920]  which is individual freedom.
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:50:58.920]  I believe in the U.S. Constitution.
[03:50:58.920 --> 03:50:59.920]  Oh, he wants tyranny.
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:00.920]  I...
[03:51:00.920 --> 03:51:02.920]  It seems from the information you sent me
[03:51:02.920 --> 03:51:04.920]  that he leans in that direction.
[03:51:04.920 --> 03:51:05.920]  Well, at the end of the movie,
[03:51:05.920 --> 03:51:07.920]  they have a military coup,
[03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:09.920]  and the humans are bad,
[03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:10.920]  but other humans join in,
[03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:11.920]  and they say,
[03:51:11.920 --> 03:51:12.920]  go back to your planet and die.
[03:51:12.920 --> 03:51:13.920]  The message is,
[03:51:13.920 --> 03:51:14.920]  we're going to kill you.
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:15.920]  But meanwhile,
[03:51:15.920 --> 03:51:16.920]  all the big environmentalists now
[03:51:16.920 --> 03:51:19.920]  are up on C-SPAN praising the GMO fish.
[03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:21.920]  Real things that hurt the biosphere
[03:51:21.920 --> 03:51:23.920]  and hurt the real integrity of the planet.
[03:51:23.920 --> 03:51:24.920]  No, that's not a problem.
[03:51:24.920 --> 03:51:26.920]  It's carbon dioxide
[03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:27.920]  because it's part of the carbon cycle.
[03:51:27.920 --> 03:51:29.920]  If they tax that, they control it all.
[03:51:29.920 --> 03:51:30.920]  Yeah, they're way off track
[03:51:30.920 --> 03:51:32.920]  because the real threat to the environment
[03:51:32.920 --> 03:51:34.920]  is the GMO crops.
[03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:36.920]  It is the pharmaceuticals that are destroying...
[03:51:36.920 --> 03:51:38.920]  I mean, polluting the water supplies,
[03:51:38.920 --> 03:51:39.920]  the HRT drugs.
[03:51:39.920 --> 03:51:41.920]  The shrimp are committing suicide now.
[03:51:41.920 --> 03:51:43.920]  Did you see where they just swam up to fish?
[03:51:43.920 --> 03:51:44.920]  ABC News?
[03:51:44.920 --> 03:51:45.920]  New scientist?
[03:51:45.920 --> 03:51:47.920]  Oh, because their nervous systems are all whacked up.
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:48.920]  Yeah, they're just...
[03:51:48.920 --> 03:51:49.920]  They can't protect them.
[03:51:49.920 --> 03:51:50.920]  Yeah.
[03:51:50.920 --> 03:51:51.920]  Well, the truth is,
[03:51:51.920 --> 03:51:54.920]  we're poisoning the whole planet through pharmaceuticals
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:51:56.920]  that are going through our bodies
[03:51:56.920 --> 03:51:58.920]  and actually through dental care.
[03:51:58.920 --> 03:52:01.920]  You know, there are many thousands of tons of mercury
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:05.920]  just being washed downstream from modern dentistry,
[03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:08.920]  and it's still legal to put mercury in a baby's mouth
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:09.920]  as long as you call it dentistry.
[03:52:09.920 --> 03:52:11.920]  And it's still legal to feed them this,
[03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:13.920]  this fluoride, fluoride water.
[03:52:13.920 --> 03:52:14.920]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:52:14.920 --> 03:52:16.920]  Everybody knows there's problems in the environment.
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:18.920]  They take that common sense and use it,
[03:52:18.920 --> 03:52:21.920]  and the Rockefellers are true trailblazers of evil.
[03:52:21.920 --> 03:52:23.920]  Over 100 years ago, they created the National Parks.
[03:52:23.920 --> 03:52:24.920]  This is on record.
[03:52:24.920 --> 03:52:25.920]  This is on PBS.
[03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:28.920]  They created the conservation, you know,
[03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:29.920]  the modern conservation movement
[03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:31.920]  as a way to steal property, control people.
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:33.920]  But then meanwhile, they're involved
[03:52:33.920 --> 03:52:36.920]  in the most environmentally destructive things imaginable.
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:38.920]  So they only use it to shut off their competition.
[03:52:38.920 --> 03:52:40.920]  They're at a shrimp on Prozac commit suicide.
[03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:44.920]  A study finds that shrimp swimming in Prozac-attended water
[03:52:44.920 --> 03:52:46.920]  tend to swim towards the light,
[03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:49.920]  making them easier prey, and they don't even care
[03:52:49.920 --> 03:52:51.920]  about birds and other fish eating them.
[03:52:51.920 --> 03:52:53.920]  Well, it's not surprising that these pharmaceuticals,
[03:52:53.920 --> 03:52:56.920]  especially these psychiatric or psychotropic drugs,
[03:52:56.920 --> 03:52:59.920]  imbalance our brain function.
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:01.920]  And now they're trying to say it's your genes.
[03:53:01.920 --> 03:53:04.920]  A study just a couple of days ago said ADHD,
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:06.920]  they now say, oh, it's caused by your genes.
[03:53:06.920 --> 03:53:08.920]  Well, you know, mercury in the shots they admit
[03:53:08.920 --> 03:53:10.920]  is actually changing our DNA.
[03:53:10.920 --> 03:53:11.920]  Well, exactly.
[03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:14.920]  And in fact, it's the drugs that children are being given
[03:53:14.920 --> 03:53:18.920]  for ADHD that cause their brains not to grow as well.
[03:53:18.920 --> 03:53:20.920]  So they have smaller physical brains.
[03:53:20.920 --> 03:53:22.920]  That's admitted. Exactly. That shows up on the chart.
[03:53:22.920 --> 03:53:26.920]  Look, they give us rat poison in the name of it being good.
[03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:29.920]  And in almost every statistic, once they get you on Prozac
[03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:31.920]  or Adderall or any of these drugs,
[03:53:31.920 --> 03:53:34.920]  then you get on more and more until you're a zombie.
[03:53:34.920 --> 03:53:36.920]  And the pharmaceutical companies love targeting
[03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:38.920]  wealthy people and middle-class people's kids
[03:53:38.920 --> 03:53:41.920]  because they got a big checkbook and insurance.
[03:53:41.920 --> 03:53:44.920]  And, you know, a wonderful enlightened child
[03:53:44.920 --> 03:53:46.920]  who throws a fit when they're 12,
[03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:48.920]  20 years later is literally a zombie
[03:53:48.920 --> 03:53:50.920]  talking to themselves on the street corner.
[03:53:50.920 --> 03:53:52.920]  I've gone up and talked to these people.
[03:53:52.920 --> 03:53:54.920]  I found out their back stories
[03:53:54.920 --> 03:53:56.920]  and they are just complete brain-dead zombies.
[03:53:56.920 --> 03:53:58.920]  Zombie is exactly the right word.
[03:53:58.920 --> 03:54:01.920]  Sometimes I've used the word drone, but zombie is perfect
[03:54:01.920 --> 03:54:05.920]  because their brain function has been suppressed.
[03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:09.920]  Sometimes you can heal them with superfoods
[03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:11.920]  and natural substances.
[03:54:11.920 --> 03:54:13.920]  You can reverse some of it. Exactly.
[03:54:13.920 --> 03:54:15.920]  You can reverse the brain inflammation. Exactly.
[03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:17.920]  Listen, we've had you for almost two hours.
[03:54:17.920 --> 03:54:19.920]  I want to say bye to you at the end of the show,
[03:54:19.920 --> 03:54:21.920]  but I've got to end it here with some financial news.
[03:54:21.920 --> 03:54:23.920]  Please don't leave you and your lovely wife.
[03:54:23.920 --> 03:54:25.920]  I want to say bye to you and also do a quick interview
[03:54:25.920 --> 03:54:27.920]  for an upcoming film.
[03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:29.920]  I appreciate you coming in
[03:54:29.920 --> 03:54:31.920]  and we're going to eat some pork chops
[03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:33.920]  and gravy here in just a minute.
[03:54:33.920 --> 03:54:35.920]  But Mike Adams, thank you for coming in.
[03:54:35.920 --> 03:54:37.920]  Always my pleasure, Alex.
[03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:39.920]  It's been good to have you here with us today.
[03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:42.920]  And, ladies and gentlemen, there goes the Health Ranger.
[03:54:42.920 --> 03:54:44.920]  This is a four-hour transmission today.
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:47.920]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:47.920 --> 03:54:49.920]  And I hope you enjoyed that transmission.
[03:54:49.920 --> 03:54:51.920]  Very informative. Very scary,
[03:54:51.920 --> 03:54:54.920]  but we did try to have some gallows humor to all of it.
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:54:56.920]  That video, Go Greener Will Kill Your Kids,
[03:54:56.920 --> 03:54:58.920]  says Richard Curtis, eco-propaganda shocker.
[03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:01.920]  Paul Watson is getting this up at Prismplana.com.
[03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:03.920]  Matt Ryan is getting it up at infowars.com,
[03:55:03.920 --> 03:55:05.920]  the video right now.
[03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:08.920]  And we're going to dovetail it with ABC website
[03:55:08.920 --> 03:55:10.920]  tells kids when they should die.
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:12.920]  I planned to do a video two weeks ago on this
[03:55:12.920 --> 03:55:14.920]  and never get it about how they're training people
[03:55:14.920 --> 03:55:15.920]  to commit suicide.
[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:17.920]  I've got to get that video shot today
[03:55:17.920 --> 03:55:19.920]  so it can go up next week.
[03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:21.920]  Because this whole agenda is coming out in the open
[03:55:21.920 --> 03:55:23.920]  with the eco-fascist.
[03:55:23.920 --> 03:55:25.920]  But I wanted to end the transmission
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:27.920]  because gold has literally hit
[03:55:27.920 --> 03:55:29.920]  an all-time high yet again.
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:31.920]  Gold settles above 1,317
[03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:33.920]  as traders weigh Fed comments.
[03:55:33.920 --> 03:55:35.920]  The Federal Reserve has announced it is going to print
[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:37.920]  trillions of dollars and give it to itself.
[03:55:37.920 --> 03:55:39.920]  They are going to monetize more debt.
[03:55:39.920 --> 03:55:41.920]  There are riots globally happening right now
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:43.920]  over taxes being raised,
[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:44.920]  pensions being cut.
[03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:46.920]  It's now coming here to the United States.
[03:55:46.920 --> 03:55:47.920]  That's CNBC.
[03:55:47.920 --> 03:55:49.920]  Gold prices break new highs.
[03:55:49.920 --> 03:55:51.920]  The street, gold jumps to another record.
[03:55:51.920 --> 03:55:52.920]  Wall Street Journal.
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:54.920]  Gold futures rise to another record.
[03:55:54.920 --> 03:55:56.920]  On dollar skid, Silver extends rally.
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:55:58.920]  30 plus years in the gold and silver business
[03:55:58.920 --> 03:55:59.920]  tracking it.
[03:55:59.920 --> 03:56:01.920]  Ted Anderson, what does this mean to you?
[03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:03.920]  Well, I mean, I don't know.
[03:56:03.920 --> 03:56:05.920]  Other than Ed from a couple of weeks ago,
[03:56:05.920 --> 03:56:07.920]  I don't think there's anybody left in this audience
[03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:09.920]  that don't think that gold is a better buy
[03:56:09.920 --> 03:56:11.920]  than having fiat currency.
[03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:15.920]  Silver just shot up over $22.2217.
[03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:20.920]  Gold jumping up as high as $1,321.80.
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:22.920]  It is just a very big reflection.
[03:56:22.920 --> 03:56:24.920]  Ted, we're not rocket scientists.
[03:56:24.920 --> 03:56:26.920]  When they start devaluing the dollar down to nothing,
[03:56:26.920 --> 03:56:28.920]  gold's going to go up because
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:30.920]  it's being paid for in dollars.
[03:56:30.920 --> 03:56:31.920]  It's not rocket science.
[03:56:31.920 --> 03:56:32.920]  No, that's exactly right.
[03:56:32.920 --> 03:56:33.920]  The dollar's falling.
[03:56:33.920 --> 03:56:35.920]  You can even see that on the charts.
[03:56:35.920 --> 03:56:37.920]  It's falling against other currencies,
[03:56:37.920 --> 03:56:39.920]  and the other currencies are falling right along with it.
[03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:40.920]  You know, the thing is,
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:43.920]  it's like gold right now has a floor,
[03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:45.920]  a support floor of $1,300,
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:49.920]  and now the next resistance level is $1,350.
[03:56:49.920 --> 03:56:50.920]  Alex, just last week,
[03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:53.920]  we were wondering if gold was going to hit $1,300.
[03:56:53.920 --> 03:56:55.920]  I remember saying there on Thursday
[03:56:55.920 --> 03:56:58.920]  that I think we'll hit gold at $1,300 an ounce on Friday,
[03:56:58.920 --> 03:57:00.920]  and then we hit $1,301,
[03:57:00.920 --> 03:57:02.920]  and that was just a guess.
[03:57:02.920 --> 03:57:05.920]  I just knew because it only had a couple more dollars to move.
[03:57:05.920 --> 03:57:08.920]  Now we're looking at $1,300 an ounce as a resistance level,
[03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:10.920]  hard to get back behind,
[03:57:10.920 --> 03:57:14.920]  and probably going to get through this $1,350 in very short order.
[03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:15.920]  Ted, it's amazing,
[03:57:15.920 --> 03:57:19.920]  and you have not raised prices yet from gold and silver you bought
[03:57:19.920 --> 03:57:20.920]  when it was a lot lower.
[03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:21.920]  You're passing on those savings.
[03:57:21.920 --> 03:57:22.920]  Tell folks the offer.
[03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:24.920]  They've got to say it's the radio special,
[03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:25.920]  or they'll pay more,
[03:57:25.920 --> 03:57:26.920]  which is still a great price,
[03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:28.920]  very competitive, it might as,
[03:57:28.920 --> 03:57:30.920]  but these deals Ted's offering in Sunday evening,
[03:57:30.920 --> 03:57:32.920]  fire out those offers Ted Anderson.
[03:57:32.920 --> 03:57:34.920]  Well, I mean, the best thing right now
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:36.920]  is the walking Liberty Half at $10.50,
[03:57:36.920 --> 03:57:39.920]  and I would definitely take advantage of that frank at $283
[03:57:39.920 --> 03:57:42.920]  and $62 cents, man.
[03:57:42.920 --> 03:57:44.920]  You get a full year subscription to Bob's newsletter.
[03:57:44.920 --> 03:57:46.920]  A lot of folks have already got that.
[03:57:46.920 --> 03:57:47.920]  What are Frank's by themselves?
[03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:49.920]  Right now, they're at $283.62.
[03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:50.920]  You can buy them for that,
[03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:53.920]  or you can go online and pick them up for $288
[03:57:53.920 --> 03:57:55.920]  and pay $5 an ounce more.
[03:57:55.920 --> 03:57:58.920]  I mean, the internet prices have already gone up.
[03:57:58.920 --> 03:58:00.920]  It's what's available by calling and saying
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:01.920]  you're on the Alex Jones special.
[03:58:01.920 --> 03:58:03.920]  I have to raise prices.
[03:58:03.920 --> 03:58:04.920]  I will on Monday.
[03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:06.920]  And the silver dollars are still at $10.50,
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:08.920]  with silver blasting through $22.
[03:58:08.920 --> 03:58:10.920]  We're silver right now.
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:13.920]  Silver right now is at currently $2210.
[03:58:13.920 --> 03:58:17.920]  $2210, you've got silver half dollar at $10.50.
[03:58:17.920 --> 03:58:21.920]  Do the math, $806.86, 2237,
[03:58:21.920 --> 03:58:26.920]  support minus resources in this radio show.
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:28.920]  Though these deals are so good.
[03:58:28.920 --> 03:58:31.920]  I mean, it doesn't even really do anything.
[03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:35.920]  800-686-2237, back Sunday live.
[03:58:35.920 --> 03:58:37.920]  My interview with Bob Chapman coming up,
[03:58:37.920 --> 03:58:38.920]  infowars.com.
[03:58:38.920 --> 03:58:52.920]  See you Sunday, 4 p.m. Central.
