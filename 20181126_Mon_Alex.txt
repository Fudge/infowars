[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:07.680 --> 00:14.260]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[00:14.260 --> 00:40.540]  there are times in history known as quickening where more happens in just a
[00:40.540 --> 00:45.420]  few years than happens in the previous hundred with all the technology and the
[00:45.420 --> 00:53.020]  population of the earth exploding most historical futurists and analysts I concur
[00:53.020 --> 00:57.620]  with them believe and have been proven right so far that you're going to see
[00:57.620 --> 01:04.220]  these trends only accelerated further so we're on the verge of a super quickening
[01:04.220 --> 01:09.940]  a super turning that's something David Knight talks a lot about the fourth
[01:09.940 --> 01:13.780]  turning we're going into but I'm calling it the mega turning the super
[01:13.780 --> 01:18.100]  turning he's going to join us in the third segment about 15 minutes Paul
[01:18.100 --> 01:23.220]  Watson's joining us on the Briggs it deal that makes England and the UK
[01:23.220 --> 01:29.060]  vassal slaves of the EU unbelievable tyranny total open borders to the
[01:29.060 --> 01:35.900]  Islamist it is incredible so they're trying to snatch victory from the jaws
[01:35.900 --> 01:42.380]  of defeat on that but may is set to be basically removed from office over that
[01:42.380 --> 01:47.740]  obviously one of the big stories is that Trump is thrown down the gauntlet and
[01:47.740 --> 01:51.900]  said they're more than 50,000 people that we've counted in all these different
[01:51.900 --> 01:57.140]  caravans it was 2,000 a week ago in Tijuana over the border from San
[01:57.140 --> 02:06.860]  Diego, California now it's 5,000 10,000 are set to show up it's estimated that
[02:06.860 --> 02:14.060]  within two weeks there's going to be 50,000 people you and paid for with
[02:14.060 --> 02:23.140]  US taxpayer money converging on the Tijuana border with the United States
[02:23.140 --> 02:27.060]  and this is all being orchestrated with Democrat judges wedding on the other
[02:27.060 --> 02:33.500]  side to give them two three four years to show up for their immigration hearing
[02:33.500 --> 02:38.340]  on supposedly being political or religious refugees which obviously
[02:38.340 --> 02:43.180]  they're not and the media oh it only shows us images of this one woman that
[02:43.180 --> 02:47.300]  looks like she had missed any meals with her two kids that she's dragging into
[02:47.300 --> 02:52.780]  harm's way across thousands of miles child endangerment demanding oh look
[02:52.780 --> 02:59.180]  it's all women and children we've looked at the numbers over 90% are men it's
[02:59.180 --> 03:04.420]  less than 10% are women and children this is disgusting behavior but all of
[03:04.420 --> 03:09.340]  that's on the back burner we've got reporters being deployed right now to
[03:09.340 --> 03:14.420]  the heart of this all of that is on the back burner because I happened to have
[03:14.420 --> 03:19.220]  done a little bit of studying on the geopolitical ramifications of what's
[03:19.220 --> 03:25.060]  happening in the EU what's happening in Ukraine what is happening in the
[03:25.060 --> 03:36.860]  surrounding areas and 100% the Ukrainian president is unpopular just ran this
[03:36.860 --> 03:44.820]  stunt into Russian waters in a Russian port where they have treaties for 15
[03:44.820 --> 03:49.740]  years and treaties before that for several hundred that when you enter the
[03:49.740 --> 03:54.460]  port you radio the port pilots like it's done all over the world from Japan to
[03:54.460 --> 04:00.420]  Mexico to the US to Italy when you come into the port could be 12 miles could be
[04:00.420 --> 04:06.340]  10 miles a few miles in you see boats that come in and guide you harbor
[04:06.340 --> 04:09.460]  pilots is what they're called and they've got machine guns on the fronts of
[04:09.460 --> 04:13.060]  their boat it's called the Coast Guard and the Russians have Coast Guard we have
[04:13.060 --> 04:20.340]  Coast Guard and if you came in to a shipping area and you came in in your
[04:20.340 --> 04:25.740]  ships and you went try to go under the bridge into any of our international
[04:25.740 --> 04:31.500]  waters into US waters and you didn't radio ahead and say who you were and
[04:31.500 --> 04:36.820]  didn't follow procedure it would be worse than being rammed you would be
[04:36.820 --> 04:41.620]  rammed you would be shot up you would be boarded which is exactly what the
[04:41.620 --> 04:47.500]  Russians just did it's cut and dry procedure and it was all violated so
[04:47.500 --> 04:53.460]  that horse Niko or however you say his name could declare martial law which he

[06:27.540 --> 06:32.300]  it's official what we told you 20 plus years ago is now admitted there's not
[06:32.300 --> 06:38.900]  just human clones walking around they are edited humanoids that aren't even
[06:38.900 --> 06:44.900]  human and don't even have the same number of chromosomes told you China was
[06:44.900 --> 06:48.700]  getting ready to announce it it's been announced ladies and gentlemen and now
[06:48.700 --> 06:54.100]  you're gonna see everything just start breaking a world government system
[06:54.100 --> 06:58.860]  tracking everything you do from smart toilets surveilling you to not being
[06:58.860 --> 07:04.780]  able to even have a job or buy groceries if you're not a good globalist total
[07:04.780 --> 07:13.060]  tyranny is here meanwhile you have the UN funding giant invasion forces with
[07:13.060 --> 07:18.940]  debit cards and training and political operatives leading them slamming 15
[07:18.940 --> 07:25.020]  million the last six years into Europe now you've got 50 plus thousand marching
[07:25.020 --> 07:32.660]  to meet the 5,000 already on the Tijuana Mexico US San Diego border some of them
[07:32.660 --> 07:37.660]  actually made it through yesterday 35 million illegals have already made it
[07:37.660 --> 07:42.380]  in the last 20 years in the United States but many of those were actually
[07:42.380 --> 07:45.740]  looking for jobs these people have been politically prepared politically
[07:45.740 --> 07:50.620]  brainwashed politically brought in to colonize the United States and they're
[07:50.620 --> 07:56.660]  on record saying and we have the treasonous treacherous UN and Hillary
[07:56.660 --> 08:01.380]  and Barack Hussein Obama helping set all this up with Peter Sutherland and the
[08:01.380 --> 08:09.540]  open Society Foundation of George Soros and others it is an incredible time to
[08:09.540 --> 08:15.860]  be alive and once you see this 50,000 make it in and overwhelm the courts then
[08:15.860 --> 08:20.820]  even more will come by the millions until the whole country looks like the
[08:20.820 --> 08:26.980]  worst squalor you see in places like Paris and other areas of Europe that
[08:26.980 --> 08:32.140]  have been completely overrun it is unbelievable ladies and gentlemen again
[08:32.140 --> 08:37.380]  we're a radio broadcast first and foremost but we're multimedia and so we're
[08:37.380 --> 08:41.780]  also have a full TV production operation that's sent out on satellite to TV
[08:41.780 --> 08:45.580]  stations and cable systems and that all of you can watch as well at info wars
[08:45.580 --> 08:49.980]  dot com forward slash show and as you know we're the most banned the most
[08:49.980 --> 08:55.780]  demonized most attack program in the world because we had over six billion
[08:55.780 --> 09:01.260]  views on YouTube conservatively billions of views on Facebook hundreds of radio
[09:01.260 --> 09:07.460]  and TV stations we still have and we were raising the alarm over and over and
[09:07.460 --> 09:13.660]  over and over again about the globalist plan to implode the borders about the
[09:13.660 --> 09:19.660]  secret human cloning programs about the plan to attack the family about the
[09:19.660 --> 09:24.420]  plan to attack the two genders about the entire program through the vaccines
[09:24.420 --> 09:29.140]  and through other systems and the food and water to actually change our DNA
[09:29.140 --> 09:34.100]  and put binary weapons into our bodies so that the population can be forcibly
[09:34.100 --> 09:38.820]  reduced and now as private world government gets openly announced and is
[09:38.820 --> 09:46.700]  all this unfolds our credibility has shot straight up so they first have to
[09:46.700 --> 09:54.380]  demonize us they first have to lie about us they first have to create
[09:54.380 --> 10:00.100]  something that info wars and Alex Jones aren't to set the precedent to begin not
[10:00.100 --> 10:04.900]  just our censorship and shut down but all of you the globalist or formulaic and
[10:04.900 --> 10:08.780]  they're making their move and that's why it's so critical for all of you to
[10:08.780 --> 10:13.580]  be more involved and engaged than ever because we've got a fighting chance to
[10:13.580 --> 10:17.980]  turn this around but if we stand down and if we let this
[10:17.980 --> 10:21.780]  technocracy take over and we let these multinational corporations out live
[10:21.780 --> 10:27.220]  with the chai comms take over our children but ourselves as well this is
[10:27.220 --> 10:35.900]  now here it's not coming are facing a true dystopian future now what just
[10:35.900 --> 10:43.740]  happened today in
[10:45.980 --> 10:59.740]  Ukraine is so incredibly dangerous and it's so obvious and it's so transparent
[10:59.740 --> 11:11.020]  that it's sickening and what's cute what gets worse is when you tune in to
[11:11.020 --> 11:16.420]  mainstream corporate media and Fox News none of it you're hearing is true we
[11:16.420 --> 11:21.100]  know on record from the Ukrainian news and the Russian news exactly what's
[11:21.100 --> 11:36.820]  going on we know that there is a Russian port that they've had for 500 years and
[11:36.820 --> 11:42.020]  that they have treaties going back hundreds of years and they signed another
[11:42.020 --> 11:51.060]  treaty in 2003 where Ukrainian vessels coming into the Russian port have to
[11:51.060 --> 11:55.980]  announce themselves now they harbor pilot coast guard just like the US does or
[11:55.980 --> 12:05.740]  any other modern country bring you into port well they sit in gun boats and the
[12:05.740 --> 12:09.620]  Ukrainian Navy has said that they intend to blow up a bridge that the Russians
[12:09.620 --> 12:13.740]  have built there and so the Russians simply came up bumped the boats they
[12:13.740 --> 12:17.900]  didn't stop they had our men on board so they took them over that is standard
[12:17.900 --> 12:24.020]  procedure and it was done by the Ukrainians to violate standard procedure
[12:24.020 --> 12:31.940]  in law to create a pretext for the so-called president of the Ukraine
[12:31.940 --> 12:41.660]  Poroshenko to declare martial law which he has now done here are the Russians on
[12:41.660 --> 12:48.740]  their loudspeaker and their coast guard telling them to pull over telling them
[12:48.740 --> 12:55.660]  to announce themselves and communicate military tugboats with men on the deck
[12:55.660 --> 13:01.700]  with machine guns when they don't do it the Russians ram them to disable them
[13:01.700 --> 13:08.580]  and then board them our news is calling this an active war and NATO is talking
[13:08.580 --> 13:14.620]  about military action against the Russians and starting a physical shooting
[13:14.620 --> 13:19.900]  war this is what's going on ladies and gentlemen you know the Russians don't
[13:19.900 --> 13:23.580]  have a illegal alien problem they don't let the Islamists's crash over their
[13:23.580 --> 13:27.420]  borders only Europe does that you know the Russians aren't teaching five-year-old
[13:27.420 --> 13:32.580]  boys they're really girls and vice versa and coming up the bottom of the hour
[13:32.580 --> 13:38.460]  I'm going to go over the entire history of this I'm going to break it all down
[13:38.460 --> 13:46.580]  I'm going to show you the treaty I'm going to show you the facts not not
[13:46.580 --> 13:52.980]  conjecture it's not siding with the Russians it's siding with reality the
[13:52.980 --> 13:57.660]  Crimea is basically a peninsula sticking out from Russia let's put a map on
[13:57.660 --> 14:04.300]  screen and there is just a tiny little area of water between Russia and Crimea
[14:04.300 --> 14:11.060]  Russia started in Crimea about 600 years ago that's like saying the US started in
[14:11.060 --> 14:18.260]  Boston and then you have Russia proper they built a bridge across there to
[14:18.260 --> 14:25.300]  Crimea the Ukrainian government wants to blow it up they said they are and they
[14:25.300 --> 14:29.500]  come out of the larger sea into this bay that's always been Russian held and has
[14:29.500 --> 14:35.660]  their main gas pipelines coming through and has their naval base there and now
[14:35.660 --> 14:39.500]  here comes the military of Ukraine shangling in 10 hostilities in past
[14:39.500 --> 14:50.180]  years violating a 2003 treaty in the Kerch straight it's all there coming
[14:50.180 --> 14:54.220]  right in to start a fight so last chances to stay in power Ukrainian
[14:54.220 --> 15:01.420]  president signs decree on martial law oh and you guessed it suspending the
[15:01.420 --> 15:05.980]  elections all a provocation I'll break it all down play all the videos bottom

[20:22.220 --> 20:28.820]  Waging War on Corruption it's Alex Jones
[20:29.540 --> 20:37.260]  Poroshenko the real dictator of the Ukraine evidence shows he stole that
[20:37.260 --> 20:41.660]  election the company's been in a civil war since Soros and the UN and NATO
[20:41.660 --> 20:45.860]  openly funded the overthrow of the elected government now they tried to
[20:45.860 --> 20:51.340]  seize the Russian-controlled East that's always been Russian all hell is
[20:51.340 --> 20:57.580]  breaking loose and there is a port area that Russia's had for 500 years on its
[20:57.580 --> 21:03.700]  border and there is a bridge going into the Russian territorial waters they
[21:03.700 --> 21:11.620]  have a treaty now a bunch of gunboats pour through it under orders not to
[21:11.620 --> 21:18.020]  follow the orders of the Russians and the Russian Coast Guard and so just like
[21:18.020 --> 21:21.500]  the US Coast Guard did they rammed them took out their routers and boarded them
[21:21.500 --> 21:29.740]  and now Poroshenko has declared martial law and is talking about suspending the
[21:29.740 --> 21:33.820]  elections because he's about to lose them I'll cover all this in the next
[21:33.820 --> 21:36.860]  segment in great detail but I wanted to get David Knight who hosts the David
[21:36.860 --> 21:42.820]  Knight show 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. to pop in about a topic he covers a lot that I
[21:42.820 --> 21:47.740]  agree with historically these turnings that happen at key points where the
[21:47.740 --> 21:52.460]  future course for the next 100 years or so is is governed and we see a global
[21:52.460 --> 21:56.940]  realignment against the tyranny of the globalist we see huge awakenings but we
[21:56.940 --> 22:00.380]  also see a lot of change period good and bad human cloning being announced we
[22:00.380 --> 22:03.180]  already knew what's going on world government being announced massive
[22:03.180 --> 22:08.660]  censorship being announced the UN trying to smash borders corporations new
[22:08.660 --> 22:15.020]  kinds of warfare all the AI all of the social credit social credit scores
[22:15.020 --> 22:19.340]  tracking people all hell's breaking loose everything we've been talking about
[22:19.340 --> 22:24.500]  for decades is now confirmed and we know that this globalist system is a very
[22:24.500 --> 22:29.540]  authoritarian very anti-human very nasty group and there's a global race by
[22:29.540 --> 22:33.500]  these different power structures to see who will get the technocracy in place
[22:33.500 --> 22:39.860]  they admit that at Davos so here we are facing the authoritarian technocrats the
[22:39.860 --> 22:43.900]  general public in somewhat of a days but it's starting to awaken historically
[22:43.900 --> 22:49.020]  what triggers these big turnings and I'm calling the fourth turning the final
[22:49.020 --> 22:52.460]  turning because if we don't make it through this turning and we don't try to
[22:52.460 --> 22:55.580]  reverse some of this you can see where the lines converge and really what you
[22:55.580 --> 22:59.580]  call Armageddon literally the final turning the mega turning the most
[22:59.580 --> 23:03.940]  important turning what would you call this period David Knight well you know
[23:03.940 --> 23:08.300]  I've talked to Hugo DeGaris many times and he's talked about artificial
[23:08.300 --> 23:13.060]  intelligence and just that one aspect he talks about the fact that we might have
[23:13.060 --> 23:18.380]  an artificial intelligence and essentially the technocratic elite
[23:18.380 --> 23:21.740]  going to war with the rest of us and he says that's going to result in giga
[23:21.740 --> 23:26.340]  death and I think that's just the tip of it quite frankly because there's so many
[23:26.340 --> 23:30.500]  other aspects of this as you're pointing out Alex this information coming out of
[23:30.500 --> 23:34.900]  China the fact that they have broken this prohibition of DNA manipulation of
[23:34.900 --> 23:39.540]  babies that's very important because when you do it to a baby when you do it
[23:39.540 --> 23:44.660]  when you manipulate the seed DNA then it has a capability of propagating any of
[23:44.660 --> 23:48.620]  those changes whether they're good or bad any mistakes that you might make are
[23:48.620 --> 23:53.180]  propagated to future generations is very different than the kind of medical
[23:53.180 --> 23:57.420]  manipulation that they might do for treatment to an adult because there they
[23:57.420 --> 24:01.820]  can come in and they can change certain cells but there are so many billions and
[24:01.820 --> 24:09.220]  billions of cells in a mature adult human or even an animal that any changes you
[24:09.220 --> 24:12.900]  might make like they've they've changed the DNA and monkeys for example to allow
[24:12.900 --> 24:16.540]  them to be able to see in color but that is a temporary thing because
[24:16.540 --> 24:20.660]  eventually the body replaces those modified cells but when you do it to a
[24:20.660 --> 24:24.300]  baby then it propagates to future generations at the same time we're
[24:24.300 --> 24:27.420]  seeing that they're coming out and talking about how they're going to start
[24:27.420 --> 24:30.900]  geoengineering as if they haven't been doing that saying hey look we can change
[24:30.900 --> 24:34.060]  the climate we can put stuff up in the stratosphere and so forth they've been
[24:34.060 --> 24:38.220]  talking about this for a very long time is that we wanted to have a debate
[24:38.220 --> 24:42.540]  about this before it became standard and ubiquitous and so our crime is being
[24:42.540 --> 24:47.060]  dead-on and trying to warn the public and being not futurist but being realist
[24:47.060 --> 24:50.900]  because this stuff's already been around for a long time the decision has just
[24:50.900 --> 24:54.900]  been made to roll it out you look at China the model of the social credit
[24:54.900 --> 24:59.140]  score now going nationwide then going worldwide in the next five years and our
[24:59.140 --> 25:03.540]  own governments trying to push this and adopt it they admit they're gonna gene
[25:03.540 --> 25:09.140]  edit by law to have approved embryos that'll be subservient that's the end of
[25:09.140 --> 25:12.540]  humans these aren't humans yes and that's why they have the trans movement
[25:12.540 --> 25:17.740]  where you can't say a man's really a man not a woman because they're getting you
[25:17.740 --> 25:21.940]  ready for the biological androids and it'll be a crime to say they're not
[25:21.940 --> 25:26.980]  human it's a brave new world agenda and China it doesn't really care about what
[25:26.980 --> 25:30.260]  anybody thinks they don't care whether people know what they're doing or not
[25:30.260 --> 25:33.980]  and so they're coming out with these different things and talking openly
[25:33.980 --> 25:38.980]  about geoengineering about genetic engineering they're talking about the
[25:38.980 --> 25:42.740]  control grid that you're talking about they're they're creating an underwater
[25:42.740 --> 25:47.660]  AI facility in the South Pacific as well as projecting their military power
[25:47.660 --> 25:52.700]  they really don't care and the European globalists like Macron and others even
[25:52.700 --> 25:56.260]  though they might try to control this you got Hillary Clinton and John Kerry
[25:56.260 --> 25:59.260]  saying hey you guys in Europe you need to slow this down the people are starting
[25:59.260 --> 26:03.100]  to notice they don't care because they've got an agenda they understand that
[26:03.100 --> 26:07.300]  with the natural cycle of human generations that this is all going to be
[26:07.300 --> 26:11.100]  done by 2030 so they've got to pour it on whether or not people realize or not
[26:11.100 --> 26:14.140]  and of course the Chinese don't care so they're out there talking about all the
[26:14.140 --> 26:16.660]  stuff they're talking about their geoengineering that's why they have
[26:16.660 --> 26:20.380]  CNN and CBS start to talk about this they're openly bragging about their
[26:20.380 --> 26:23.940]  genetic engineering and so it's a combination of the time frame that
[26:23.940 --> 26:27.580]  they're up against knowing that they've got to get this in place by 2030 there's
[26:27.580 --> 26:32.740]  going to be a major societal change one way or the other by 2030 and so they
[26:32.740 --> 26:36.060]  have that kind of pressure put on them and then you've got the other side of
[26:36.060 --> 26:38.860]  it where China is just openly bragging about what they're going to do and
[26:38.860 --> 26:42.180]  establishing a new world order or a brave new world order I guess we could say
[26:42.180 --> 26:46.900]  and let's be clear you just said it perfectly the future of the world is to
[26:46.900 --> 26:52.980]  be decided by 2030 and all the forces of godless globalism who believe
[26:52.980 --> 26:58.420]  humanity's actually obsolete are preparing their so-called transcendence
[26:58.420 --> 27:03.900]  and the decision has been made to bring in a true dystopian mass culling and
[27:03.900 --> 27:08.540]  meanwhile humanity's starting to wake up at a spiritual and cultural level to
[27:08.540 --> 27:12.660]  this threat and so they're actually accelerating their program now which
[27:12.660 --> 27:16.540]  means it's going to cause even more unseen crises and problems that's why
[27:16.540 --> 27:20.980]  all of you speaking out now is so incredibly critical I mean how much
[27:20.980 --> 27:24.460]  credibility does info wars have now that we've been the cutting edge of
[27:24.460 --> 27:29.780]  exposing this whole exact program of a worldwide dystopic technocracy and human
[27:29.780 --> 27:33.660]  clones and gene editing and world government because that was the plan and
[27:33.660 --> 27:38.220]  now here we are David and we're the bad guys we have to be taken off the air
[27:38.220 --> 27:44.060]  well that's why they had to move now even as in your face as it was for all of
[27:44.060 --> 27:47.900]  them to move at once to take info wars office social media it was imperative
[27:47.900 --> 27:50.620]  for them to do that had to do it before the election and they had to do it
[27:50.620 --> 27:54.020]  because all this stuff is is coming out and we would be telling everybody on
[27:54.020 --> 27:58.100]  social media it would really ramp up if we had a bigger foot they couldn't have
[27:58.100 --> 28:02.500]  us there to celebrate that we got popular selected that we overrode their
[28:02.500 --> 28:05.940]  tyranny that our audience who are activists at this that oh we were right
[28:05.940 --> 28:08.620]  about the clones and world government right about it all right about the
[28:08.620 --> 28:12.460]  migrant caravans no they have to have total media supremacy so they can say
[28:12.460 --> 28:17.620]  there's still no migrant caravan David and you know as I was talking about in
[28:17.620 --> 28:23.380]  the program earlier today we have this Nina Burley from Newsweek magazine
[28:23.380 --> 28:26.420]  and she was coming out saying you know all these AR-15 owners they're their
[28:26.420 --> 28:30.820]  mass murderers and the few that aren't are paranoid freaks and she got pushed
[28:30.820 --> 28:34.420]  back on that and she said well I've just reported you to secure democracy and to
[28:34.420 --> 28:38.060]  robot labs these are the people who like the Southern Powery Law Center are
[28:38.060 --> 28:41.740]  serving the Democrats they give them a list of people that they've identified
[28:41.740 --> 28:45.500]  as being bots with their bots and then you dare argue with them you're
[28:45.500 --> 28:49.460]  demonizing you're a Russian and then you get removed there the social scores
[28:49.460 --> 28:53.300]  already here and they've got their Stasi enforcers oh and Google is moving in

[32:15.100 --> 32:20.580]  iodine the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[32:20.580 --> 32:24.100]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us
[32:24.100 --> 32:28.540]  getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent
[32:28.540 --> 32:32.860]  iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment
[32:32.860 --> 32:36.980]  trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[32:36.980 --> 32:41.460]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist scientists and others showed us
[32:41.460 --> 32:46.060]  the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine
[32:46.060 --> 32:52.940]  and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable ladies
[32:52.940 --> 32:56.020]  and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible
[32:56.020 --> 33:05.100]  discovery x3 now available at m4's live calm you're listening to the alex
[33:05.100 --> 33:07.940]  jones show
[33:07.940 --> 33:22.580]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:37.940 --> 33:47.660]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide I am your host
[33:47.660 --> 33:55.620]  alex jones and Paul Joseph Watson joins us from the United Kingdom to talk
[33:55.620 --> 34:04.020]  brexit to talk about the total betrayal that Theresa May is engaged in also the
[34:04.020 --> 34:14.420]  fact that the leader of Ukraine who came to power after the West overthrew the
[34:14.420 --> 34:18.300]  elected government of Ukraine five years ago is set to be voted out in major
[34:18.300 --> 34:23.620]  polls so he just declared martial law now we're still going to see if the
[34:23.620 --> 34:30.820]  cabinet and then their congress or their parliament accepts that but he has
[34:30.820 --> 34:38.140]  signed the decree of martial law after he sent a bunch of his armed patrol
[34:38.140 --> 34:44.740]  boats into Russian waters into the Russian port violating a 2003 treaty
[34:44.740 --> 34:48.100]  and many many others we're supposed to call to the port and tell them they're
[34:48.100 --> 34:51.860]  coming through so this is a total provocation the Russians have seized
[34:51.860 --> 34:57.820]  several of the boats and over 20 sailors and obviously rammed some of the
[34:57.820 --> 35:01.500]  vessels to stop them and board them so we're going to look at that with Paul
[35:01.500 --> 35:06.700]  Watson and then you've got the ongoing Islamic invasion of Europe tied in to
[35:06.700 --> 35:10.740]  the migrant invasion here that slammed into the border some of them made it
[35:10.740 --> 35:15.100]  across yesterday most of them have been stopped but tens of thousands more are
[35:15.100 --> 35:21.220]  coming so what we saw in Europe is now happening here meanwhile Theresa May
[35:21.220 --> 35:27.820]  refuses asylum for Pakistani Christian hunted by lynch mobs to appease
[35:27.820 --> 35:32.580]  British Muslims that's right well it's rude if you don't let them kill the
[35:32.580 --> 35:37.940]  Christians they don't let Christians live in Pakistan but that's okay come on

[38:24.220 --> 38:27.780]  joining us for the balance of this segment the next Paul Watson of info
[38:27.780 --> 38:32.420]  wars.com and news wars.com so much insanity going on as different power
[38:32.420 --> 38:36.860]  brokers jockey for control everything we talked about for decades now out in the
[38:36.860 --> 38:41.980]  open world government edited humanoid babies being born in China
[38:41.980 --> 38:48.580]  humanoid's being grown in cows total open borders imaginary caravan slamming
[38:48.580 --> 38:54.580]  in just total censorship Christians under attack everywhere Christians refuse
[38:54.580 --> 38:59.060]  asylum and they're actually famous and then I've had death sentences for being
[38:59.060 --> 39:02.220]  Christian and people are trying to murder them and not allowed into Europe I
[39:02.220 --> 39:08.860]  mean what in Hades is going on Paul well yeah Alex you mentioned a Christian
[39:08.860 --> 39:14.580]  asylum seeker out of Pakistan this ties into Brexit as well the immigration
[39:14.580 --> 39:18.300]  problem in the United Kingdom is not European immigrants is this big debate
[39:18.300 --> 39:22.660]  over you know ending free movement of people between European countries
[39:22.660 --> 39:27.580]  Polish people aren't the problem coming to the UK they mainly get jobs they work
[39:27.580 --> 39:31.380]  hard they do integrate to a great extent they're Christians they're not the
[39:31.380 --> 39:36.260]  problem okay you look at the rape gangs in the UK 84% of the members of those
[39:36.260 --> 39:43.020]  rape gangs are Pakistani or Bangladeshi okay you still got tens of thousands of
[39:43.020 --> 39:47.340]  Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants combined it's probably over 50,000 at
[39:47.340 --> 39:52.460]  least every single year to come into the UK the Pakistani population of the UK
[39:52.460 --> 39:59.540]  just over the 10 years between the 2001 2011 census increased by nearly half a
[39:59.540 --> 40:04.820]  million people Alex this is a country of just over 60 million population you've
[40:04.820 --> 40:08.140]  got half a million Pakistani alone coming in over the course of 10 years
[40:08.140 --> 40:12.180]  that was 2011 there's probably another half a million now and those are the
[40:12.180 --> 40:16.340]  ones who actually fill in the census so these are the people causing the
[40:16.340 --> 40:19.860]  problems they're overrepresented in crime statistics they're vastly
[40:19.860 --> 40:26.260]  overrepresented in gang rape statistics so then you get one Pakistani woman who
[40:26.260 --> 40:30.820]  was the victim of a lynch mob because she tried to drink from the same water
[40:30.820 --> 40:35.860]  supply as men in Pakistan they're out on the streets basically demanding her
[40:35.860 --> 40:42.020]  death she's desperately clamoring for asylum Theresa May says no because it
[40:42.020 --> 40:46.580]  might upset the precious Muslims already in the United Kingdom what does that
[40:46.580 --> 40:51.340]  tell you about Theresa May about the Conservative Party which promised to
[40:51.340 --> 40:56.220]  reduce immigration to the UK to the tens of thousands is currently over 300,000
[40:56.220 --> 41:01.620]  a year they've done absolutely nothing this Brexit deals a total sellout they
[41:01.620 --> 41:06.380]  get the opportunity to virtue signal to some extent letting one Christian
[41:06.380 --> 41:10.940]  Pakistani refugee and they say no because the feelings of Muslims in the
[41:10.940 --> 41:16.860]  United Kingdom are more important absolutely Muslims are God to the left
[41:16.860 --> 41:22.820]  and the globalist why are they God because they've aligned with the same
[41:22.820 --> 41:26.900]  forces that want to tear down Western civilization I mean look at look at this
[41:26.900 --> 41:31.460]  UN migrant pact Alex they say oh it's not legally binding but then they say it's
[41:31.460 --> 41:36.380]  politically binding and lawyers will use it to argue their cases this basically
[41:36.380 --> 41:41.620]  makes it a human right to illegally emigrate anywhere in the world of
[41:41.620 --> 41:45.260]  course most of these people are coming from the Middle Eastern North Africa the
[41:45.260 --> 41:49.380]  UK is going to sign on to it again we're having this whole debate about why
[41:49.380 --> 41:54.740]  people voted for Brexit yes some of it was to do with immigration me so she's
[41:54.740 --> 41:58.780]  bragging about ending movement of people which you won't even do for years and
[41:58.780 --> 42:02.980]  years anyway we can get into that meanwhile she's signing on to a UN
[42:02.980 --> 42:09.420]  migration pact which makes a human right to illegally illegally emigrate to any
[42:09.420 --> 42:13.820]  country in the world from the Middle Eastern North Africa Alex there was an
[42:13.820 --> 42:18.700]  MEP who came out on Thursday had the headline on info was MEP ones new UN
[42:18.700 --> 42:23.060]  pact will make it illegal to criticize mass immigration so it's not just about
[42:23.060 --> 42:28.020]  Islam anymore it's about if you post on Facebook that may be allowing hundreds
[42:28.020 --> 42:31.580]  of thousands of people into the country every single year might not be a great
[42:31.580 --> 42:36.580]  thing that is now going to be hate speech under this pact that's how bad it
[42:36.580 --> 42:42.620]  is and so the UK votes never voted to join the EU votes to get out 18 months
[42:42.620 --> 42:52.180]  ago two years ago lost and magically it turns into you'll be arrested if you
[42:52.180 --> 42:55.500]  criticize open borders and unlimited Muslims are coming in but no
[42:55.500 --> 42:59.780]  Christians because we got to leave them overseas to get killed living in
[42:59.780 --> 43:04.660]  volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found
[43:04.660 --> 43:09.580]  here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and
[43:09.580 --> 43:14.460]  we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[43:14.460 --> 43:19.500]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy
[43:19.500 --> 43:25.460]  levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and
[43:25.460 --> 43:30.180]  pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[43:30.180 --> 43:34.940]  and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure
[43:34.940 --> 43:39.740]  gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[43:39.740 --> 43:45.700]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the
[43:45.700 --> 43:50.660]  Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[43:50.660 --> 43:55.620]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a
[43:55.620 --> 44:01.500]  good water filtration system will purify it stress is a natural part of life

[46:12.820 --> 46:16.220]  syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them because they were

[46:53.900 --> 46:57.980]  us financially Soros the global Spain win this is info wars darkness hour we
[46:57.980 --> 47:20.060]  your support you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream
[47:20.060 --> 47:30.060]  media government cover us you want answers well so does he live from Austin
[47:30.060 --> 47:54.940]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones we are back live we are
[47:54.940 --> 47:58.940]  broadcasting worldwide this is the most demonized most lied about most tap show
[47:58.940 --> 48:03.820]  in the world because we're pointing out there's a corporate international race
[48:03.820 --> 48:09.620]  working with authoritarian regimes to bring in a cashless society grid of
[48:09.620 --> 48:14.340]  total control now Paul watch has done a very powerful video that I'm gonna be
[48:14.340 --> 48:19.700]  airing today in the third hour the truth about China's social score it's
[48:19.700 --> 48:24.940]  already here and out of the gates they're saying if you talk to someone with a
[48:24.940 --> 48:29.260]  low score your scores dropped and you won't be able to move one inch without
[48:29.260 --> 48:35.540]  it you will then starve to death this is their announcement out of the gates and
[48:35.540 --> 48:42.500]  it's being adopted here we must say no to this remember just a few years ago I
[48:42.500 --> 48:50.260]  was a crazy cook talking about this info wars calm broke this in 2014
[48:50.260 --> 48:55.380]  Apollo Joseph Watson article and I worked with Paul in that article because I
[48:55.380 --> 48:59.180]  was reading some white papers and we talked about we said folks this is the
[48:59.180 --> 49:03.500]  future using all the data face scanning who do you talk to what you do into one
[49:03.500 --> 49:09.100]  platform and then once you comply to it then they start adding more and more
[49:09.100 --> 49:14.100]  you've got to do to comply and now it's like they almost control your soul
[49:14.100 --> 49:19.420]  you'll think and say whatever they want and Paul that leads me to this
[49:19.420 --> 49:26.500]  Twitter is now clamping down on anti-trans abuse and it says that deliberately
[49:26.500 --> 49:32.100]  misgendering someone or saying that a man who's biologically a man is really a
[49:32.100 --> 49:37.180]  man and if a nurse refuses to do a pap smear on a man because he doesn't have
[49:37.180 --> 49:42.860]  a vagina and because he doesn't have a cervix he will be fired Twitter
[49:42.860 --> 49:50.060]  permanently banned feminist for writing that men aren't women that's like saying
[49:50.060 --> 49:57.180]  you know tigers aren't blue whales or Easter bunnies don't exist but this is
[49:57.180 --> 50:03.020]  in Laura Loomer got banned over the weekend for exposing genital mutilation
[50:03.020 --> 50:08.180]  and Islam selling women into slavery that's hurtful you just heard Paul cover
[50:08.180 --> 50:11.700]  earlier mainstream news they won't let a famous Christian woman in who's got
[50:11.700 --> 50:15.420]  fatta was out who was going to be given the death penalty who they've sworn to
[50:15.420 --> 50:18.900]  kill in Pakistan she wants to come to the UK and they said no you would anger
[50:18.900 --> 50:23.940]  Muslims so here it is Twitter permanently banned feminist for writing that men
[50:23.940 --> 50:29.700]  aren't women the new rules of service also acknowledge that marginalized groups
[50:29.700 --> 50:33.940]  and marginalized including women people of color LGBT people tend to face more
[50:33.940 --> 50:39.980]  abuse on the platform this includes targeting of misgendering or dead
[50:39.980 --> 50:44.340]  naming it sounds like a crazy language San Francisco came up with it so San
[50:44.340 --> 50:48.980]  Francisco is running a eugenics cult to destroy the family and that's tentacles
[50:48.980 --> 50:53.860]  shooting out across the planet we need a wall around Texas a digital wall a wall
[50:53.860 --> 50:59.100]  around America from the traders in San Francisco working with the chai comms
[50:59.100 --> 51:02.940]  and others to take down the free society Paul Watson your take on this and
[51:02.940 --> 51:08.740]  where this is all going well they've they've actually put into a policy now
[51:08.740 --> 51:13.540]  which basically dictates that you can't ever acknowledge that Bruce Jenner ever
[51:13.540 --> 51:19.300]  existed that's what dead naming is dead naming is referring to somebody when
[51:19.300 --> 51:23.380]  they used to be a man or used to be a woman now that they're transgender so
[51:23.380 --> 51:28.340]  for you to merely post a video of Bruce Jenner from the Olympics or whatever or
[51:28.340 --> 51:33.420]  even discuss him that is now a violation of Twitter's terms of service of course
[51:33.420 --> 51:36.500]  the big fork in the road is going to be Ben Shapiro because that's his whole
[51:36.500 --> 51:40.420]  shtick is talking about the transgender issue that's how he came to
[51:40.420 --> 51:44.100]  prominence a few years ago he's obviously more aligned with the
[51:44.100 --> 51:49.420]  establishment neo-con wing of the Republicans he was a never-trumper so
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.420]  if they go after Ben Shapiro that's going to be a fork in the road but as as we
[51:53.420 --> 51:58.820]  posted today on info wars they just banned an Iraq war vet Jesse Kelly he
[51:58.820 --> 52:03.260]  literally thought his friends died in Iraq he came back injured only to be
[52:03.260 --> 52:08.140]  silenced by Silicon Valley by San Francisco he was on Tucker Carlson a
[52:08.140 --> 52:13.140]  couple of months ago when you got banned on Twitter saying listen Alex Jones is
[52:13.140 --> 52:19.140]  the first of many and now he's gone they didn't even give him a reason he's banned
[52:19.140 --> 52:23.700]  from Twitter as he said Laura Loomer basically criticized female genital
[52:23.700 --> 52:29.300]  mutilation she's banned from Twitter somebody did a list of the most
[52:29.300 --> 52:33.900]  prominent conservatives on Twitter there's like five left now it's like
[52:33.900 --> 52:39.020]  Ben Shapiro and a few others depending on who you categorize as conservative but
[52:39.020 --> 52:42.540]  with people with over like two three four hundred thousand followers there's
[52:42.540 --> 52:48.140]  literally about five people left now so you know I joked that someone like
[52:48.140 --> 52:53.980]  Lindsey Graham will be the last person on Twitter in 2038 and he's on a final
[52:53.980 --> 52:58.580]  warning for forgetting to include one of the letters in lgbtq i blah blah
[52:58.580 --> 53:03.260]  whatever that's that's that was wrong that's gonna happen even sooner than
[53:03.260 --> 53:07.460]  that that will be the next thing if you forget to include one letter in lgbtq
[53:07.460 --> 53:12.500]  you know add in for an item then you'll be gone from Twitter so yeah where's the
[53:12.500 --> 53:16.060]  executive order Alex I mean it was supposedly in the pipeline for the past
[53:16.060 --> 53:21.820]  two months and then it just disappeared didn't it if Trump doesn't address this
[53:21.820 --> 53:26.140]  he's gonna upset a lot of people within his base but the other thing that's
[53:26.140 --> 53:29.740]  happening with Twitter Alex is that Instapundit which was a pretty big
[53:29.740 --> 53:33.900]  account on Twitter literally just retired he said that's it and my ideas
[53:33.900 --> 53:37.380]  aren't welcome here what is the point in point any time and effort into a
[53:37.380 --> 53:41.660]  platform which hates me and makes me feel unwelcome and is about to ban me
[53:41.660 --> 53:47.340]  anyway so people are now literally retiring Fox News hasn't tweeted for
[53:47.340 --> 53:51.940]  three weeks since Twitter refused to pull down tweets threatening Tucker
[53:51.940 --> 53:56.620]  Carlson's family after that Antifa raid on his house so Fox News is basically
[53:56.620 --> 54:00.620]  retired from Twitter who will be the next prominent name to retire from Twitter
[54:00.620 --> 54:06.740]  and will that send it down Alex they're already hemorrhaging users they call it
[54:06.740 --> 54:10.700]  killing bots I haven't grown I was getting you know 500 new followers a day
[54:10.700 --> 54:15.340]  now it's it's nothing or it declines every day so they're losing thousands and
[54:15.340 --> 54:19.220]  thousands of followers a day is it gonna go the same way as Facebook or is it
[54:19.220 --> 54:22.980]  just gonna become an even more even bigger echo chamber for the left but
[54:22.980 --> 54:26.660]  that's exactly what they want because they're not real liberals they're
[54:26.660 --> 54:33.300]  authoritarians Paul look we already have a social score here and it's not a
[54:33.300 --> 54:38.060]  social credit score it's a behavioral template to quote surveil everything you
[54:38.060 --> 54:43.580]  do and then penalize you and others until you are basically conditioned to
[54:43.580 --> 54:46.740]  follow whatever orders they give you and then they can always change those
[54:46.740 --> 54:50.980]  orders and expand them so it's not coming it's here this is clear and
[54:50.980 --> 54:55.260]  present authoritarianism and it's a cult where they want to bring out the
[54:55.260 --> 54:58.980]  clone human babies they want to have the gene edited humans that really won't
[54:58.980 --> 55:02.980]  even be humans and then they want to make it illegal if you criticize any of
[55:02.980 --> 55:06.620]  that so they're starting with men turning into women and women turning into men
[55:06.620 --> 55:10.020]  and they make it first oh don't be hateful I don't hate any of these people
[55:10.020 --> 55:13.820]  most of them are mentally ill but now they want to target your kids and tell
[55:13.820 --> 55:17.620]  them they need to have this done to them and brainwash them and and
[55:17.620 --> 55:22.300]  psychologically abuse them which it clearly is and then if you try to dead
[55:22.300 --> 55:29.220]  name and say here is Caitlyn Jenner when he was a man and he's always been a man
[55:29.220 --> 55:33.340]  he didn't even have the surgery to remove his male genitals so this is a cult
[55:33.340 --> 55:37.660]  where they sit there and they tell you you will say what we want you will
[55:37.660 --> 55:41.060]  believe what we want and if you disagree with what we're doing or us
[55:41.060 --> 55:45.020]  sexualizing your children please get that thing off the screen if you're
[55:45.020 --> 55:49.260]  doing this it's these men dressed up in clown outfits if you don't let men in
[55:49.260 --> 55:54.180]  clown outfits come talk to your children about their genitals then you're a bad
[55:54.180 --> 55:57.980]  person so you always wondered how the pedophiles and how the control freaks
[55:57.980 --> 56:01.500]  that have taken over the Vatican and everything else would do this they're
[56:01.500 --> 56:05.300]  doing it it's here they're ending humanity as we know it it's a full
[56:05.300 --> 56:11.740]  assault on the species Paul Watson yeah now they're actually incorporating it
[56:11.740 --> 56:17.220]  into the curriculum in schools in Sweden Alex meanwhile sterilizations of men
[56:17.220 --> 56:21.060]  have doubled the thing in Stockholm tripled over the past five years so
[56:21.060 --> 56:26.140]  that's the coordinated move in the UK there was a big scandal recently in
[56:26.140 --> 56:30.900]  schools children as young as five and six turned out they were autistic children
[56:30.900 --> 56:36.580]  and the teachers were abusing that and calling them confused so as then to press
[56:36.580 --> 56:40.420]  on to them this idea that they were maybe transgender maybe they needed the
[56:40.420 --> 56:44.660]  hormone blockers and the sex change literally sending them to doctors and
[56:44.660 --> 56:49.860]  hospitals kids as young as six when they were just autistic kids with learning
[56:49.860 --> 56:54.580]  difficulties so it is a child abuse issue right now but again you can't talk
[56:54.580 --> 56:57.860]  about that on Twitter otherwise you get banned and again it does go back to this
[56:57.860 --> 57:03.140]  social credit school thing Alex because they take off-platform behavior into
[57:03.140 --> 57:07.780]  account so now if you say something bad on Facebook Twitter recognizes that you
[57:07.780 --> 57:11.860]  get banned on Twitter as well same thing in China with the social credit school
[57:11.860 --> 57:14.900]  hey at least China's being honest about what they're doing at least they're
[57:14.900 --> 57:19.300]  being upfront about it the irony is the sheer hypocrisy of the media in
[57:19.300 --> 57:23.620]  the West decrying China for what they're doing while cheerleading for and
[57:23.620 --> 57:29.140]  lobbying for the exact same thing with media with social media in the West
[57:29.140 --> 57:32.100]  that's the hypocrisy
[57:32.500 --> 57:36.260]  and they literally have public events where small children stick money in the
[57:36.260 --> 57:42.100]  g-stream of fat men shaking their asses and Twitter and Facebook saying the
[57:42.100 --> 57:46.260]  longest doodle we were taken down we're daring to say it's wrong
[57:46.260 --> 57:52.740]  it's the total assault on reality Monday through next Sunday we are bringing

[1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:06.340]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they
[1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:13.220]  collapse humanity they end up on top the truth is humanity is coming down fast
[1:00:13.220 --> 1:00:19.060]  but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[1:00:19.060 --> 1:00:23.780]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:24.980 --> 1:00:31.300]  in the fictional nightmare police state world of 1984
[1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:37.780]  winston smith said freedom is the ability to say two plus two
[1:00:37.780 --> 1:00:43.060]  equals four but in the real dystopic world that we
[1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:46.900]  now live in in 2018 that's more like brave new world
[1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:50.980]  where they're building the genderless classless slave society
[1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:54.420]  the ability to say men or men and women are women
[1:00:54.420 --> 1:01:01.940]  and there are only two genders that is freedom we were just breaking down
[1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:07.620]  the true abuse of children in the us and uk where they go into mentally disabled
[1:01:07.620 --> 1:01:10.980]  children and confuse them and then say would you like to
[1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:14.260]  get on hormones you could really be a boy you could really be a girl
[1:01:14.260 --> 1:01:17.780]  that's what bullies and monsters do they pick on children that's why all of
[1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:21.540]  these drag taught events many cases they don't even tell the parents
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:24.420]  they're coming target first graders and kindergartners
[1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:30.660]  and they dress up in macabre demon outfits and clown outfits
[1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:34.100]  as to traumatize
[1:01:38.980 --> 1:01:43.220]  all Watson shifting gears the time we had with you
[1:01:44.020 --> 1:01:47.860]  the situation with brexit boiling it down gut level i talked a lot of people in
[1:01:47.860 --> 1:01:50.820]  the uk you live there oh we had some folks over from the
[1:01:50.820 --> 1:01:54.100]  uk for Thanksgiving and they said the people are on the
[1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:57.700]  edge of civil war people have never been more awake
[1:01:57.700 --> 1:02:01.540]  the fact that they can't get out of the EU they never voted to be in it
[1:02:01.540 --> 1:02:05.620]  the fact they're being flooded with radical Muslims everywhere and giant
[1:02:05.620 --> 1:02:08.660]  sex kidnapping rings and acid attacks and just
[1:02:08.660 --> 1:02:12.500]  London just as a hellhole now just like Paris
[1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:16.500]  that they've really jumped the shark so may may be able to engage in treason and
[1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:19.700]  turn brexit into this total capitulation even worse than what the uk was
[1:02:19.700 --> 1:02:22.660]  under before but isn't this the beginning of the end
[1:02:22.660 --> 1:02:26.180]  for the globalists because now they fully have awoken the nationalist parties
[1:02:26.180 --> 1:02:29.300]  like Hillary said earlier this week she said oh i want open borders and world
[1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:31.620]  government but you need to back off for a while
[1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:34.820]  that's why nationalists are winning every election what's your gut level
[1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:38.580]  assumption well what's happening with brexit
[1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:42.340]  alex is that i don't even know why they call this a deal it's not a deal
[1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:45.860]  it's an extension of the uk remaining in the EU
[1:02:45.860 --> 1:02:49.300]  they had this transition period first it was one year then it was 18 months and
[1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:55.620]  that's two years now it's forever alex in article 132 of this brexit deal
[1:02:55.620 --> 1:03:00.260]  it literally says that the uk if the government requests it
[1:03:00.260 --> 1:03:06.660]  the transition period can be extended to 31st of December 20xx
[1:03:06.660 --> 1:03:10.260]  okay that could be anything that could be 2099
[1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:13.860]  so within this deal is the option to extend it
[1:03:13.860 --> 1:03:18.100]  forever with the britain remaining in the EU subject to all their rules and
[1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:21.620]  regulations but with no say whatsoever on what those
[1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:24.660]  rules and regulations are no see at the table
[1:03:24.660 --> 1:03:29.940]  and even after this transition period if we do leave the EU which is in name only
[1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:33.940]  we're in this backstop agreement which means we're in
[1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:37.940]  the customs union until we can sign a trade deal with the EU
[1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:41.700]  so it's not they haven't even agreed a trade deal they've just extended us
[1:03:41.700 --> 1:03:46.820]  being in the EU until 20xx so it wasn't an agreement it was a
[1:03:46.820 --> 1:03:50.660]  complete capitulation it was surrender it's the worst deal in
[1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:53.380]  history therese may somehow managed to pull off
[1:03:53.380 --> 1:03:57.060]  negotiating a deal so bad that it would be better staying
[1:03:57.060 --> 1:04:01.860]  in the EU for the UK and that's exactly the point alex they want it to be
[1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:04.820]  terrible they want it to be bedlam so then we
[1:04:04.820 --> 1:04:08.500]  re-enter the EU officially within the next five years
[1:04:08.500 --> 1:04:10.820]  there was an article in the sunday times last week
[1:04:10.820 --> 1:04:15.060]  british government considering encouraging financial market crash
[1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:18.740]  to intimidate MPs into voting for therese amaze brexit deal
[1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:22.980]  so she's probably going to lose the vote on this crappy deal which isn't a deal
[1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:26.500]  and we're going to go into no deal which is the best scenario for sovereignty at
[1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:29.060]  this point then they're going to have this financial
[1:04:29.060 --> 1:04:33.300]  crash they've talked about triggering it then have another vote where the MPs
[1:04:33.300 --> 1:04:37.380]  are intimidated into expecting her do five more minutes because this
[1:04:37.380 --> 1:04:39.620]  is too important and i forgot to make this point
[1:04:39.620 --> 1:04:42.900]  it's like the democrats trying to plunge our economy and
[1:04:42.900 --> 1:04:46.020]  milmar sink plunge the economy to stop trump and now the federal reserve is
[1:04:46.020 --> 1:04:49.540]  raising interest rates to do it and they do it publicly i mean
[1:04:49.540 --> 1:04:52.820]  what a scandal that they're threatening financial armageddon
[1:04:52.820 --> 1:04:56.660]  to keep you in the unelected EU we'll be right back with
[1:04:56.660 --> 1:05:01.140]  pjw please whatever you do realize they were all getting
[1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:05.060]  punched drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 twitter accounts they say
[1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:08.100]  affiliated with info wars yes some of them are like little side accounts they
[1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:11.540]  even know we had like info were stored that just showed our products but they
[1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:14.900]  just banned them all yesterday in punishment that i be in a
[1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:17.940]  trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us
[1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:20.980]  your excitement about america your excitement about this broadcast is what
[1:05:20.980 --> 1:05:24.340]  brought the country and the world back from the brick but the globalists now
[1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:28.660]  want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the
[1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:32.820]  future i want to be troublesome and pesky i want to
[1:05:32.820 --> 1:05:37.460]  keep going i want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially
[1:05:37.460 --> 1:05:40.900]  i want to push all the way i've committed to do that i've
[1:05:40.900 --> 1:05:43.780]  prayed for that and i've been told that's going to happen but
[1:05:43.780 --> 1:05:47.620]  you've got a back ish and i promise you this i will never falter
[1:05:47.620 --> 1:05:50.900]  i will never waver at the spiritual level i physically will
[1:05:50.900 --> 1:05:53.780]  but i give you my commitment if you financially support us
[1:05:53.780 --> 1:06:11.620]  the force for dot com to give you my absolute total commitment
[1:06:11.620 --> 1:06:25.460]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[1:06:25.460 --> 1:06:45.460]  joseph watson is in the uk and he just began to lay out if you just joined us
[1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:53.460]  how insane the new so-called brexit deal is so they take the uk voting two years
[1:06:53.460 --> 1:06:59.780]  ago plus to pull out of the e you they never voted to enter
[1:06:59.780 --> 1:07:03.700]  and years later treason may then has a brexit deal which opens the borders
[1:07:03.700 --> 1:07:06.900]  puts the uk totally under the unelected e us
[1:07:06.900 --> 1:07:14.500]  total control and then
[1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:18.580]  members of the government began to threaten financial collapse
[1:07:18.580 --> 1:07:24.100]  to make the public and other members of parliament get behind staying in the
[1:07:24.100 --> 1:07:27.220]  e you that's why people warned to never go into the e you
[1:07:27.220 --> 1:07:30.100]  because they and now they're creating an e you army to dominate and control
[1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:32.020]  people paul spend a few minutes lay out the
[1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:35.460]  compendium because you've been going to parliament you're involved with uk
[1:07:35.460 --> 1:07:38.740]  the uk independence party uh you're an advisor
[1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:42.020]  you've been in these meetings you've been at parliament in the last week
[1:07:42.020 --> 1:07:46.500]  describe what you've witnessed and break down what's happening
[1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:50.900]  what's happening alex is that we've been sold a bill of goods this isn't even a
[1:07:50.900 --> 1:07:54.180]  brexit deal it's an extension of the uk remaining
[1:07:54.180 --> 1:07:58.100]  in the e you and that's in article 132 of the agreement
[1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:02.260]  which literally states the government if it so chooses can trigger
[1:08:02.260 --> 1:08:06.420]  an extension to the transition phase which is already
[1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:10.900]  the end of 2020 initially could be the end of 2022 eventually
[1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:17.620]  an extension of that until 31st of december 20xx that could literally be
[1:08:17.620 --> 1:08:21.620]  in 80 years time we could still be in the e you
[1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:24.660]  under this agreement which is the worst agreement ever
[1:08:24.660 --> 1:08:27.860]  it wasn't a negotiation it was a capitulation it was a complete
[1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:32.020]  surrender overseen by tereza may who voted to remain
[1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:35.700]  who is a globalist overseen by almost her entire cabinet who are all
[1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:39.940]  remainers and globalists overseen by the top civil servant in
[1:08:39.940 --> 1:08:43.540]  britain negotiating brexit a guy called olly robbins
[1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:47.300]  who was literally a soviet union sympathizer
[1:08:47.300 --> 1:08:53.220]  who hated capitalism praised starlin this is in his own article from his
[1:08:53.220 --> 1:08:56.260]  college days which weren't that long ago he said quote the
[1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:59.220]  demise of the soviet experiment means that for those growing up in the world
[1:08:59.220 --> 1:09:01.780]  today especially western europe there appears to be no
[1:09:01.780 --> 1:09:05.300]  alternative to the mad excesses of modern capitalism
[1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:09.220]  so he's in this article praising communism praising soviet leaders
[1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:13.220]  he's the guy overseeing the agreement to extricate the
[1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:17.060]  uk from the e you a remainder a soviet sympathizer
[1:09:17.060 --> 1:09:23.300]  tereza may a globalist a remainder okay we're paying them 39 billion pounds for
[1:09:23.300 --> 1:09:26.580]  this separation which isn't even a separation
[1:09:26.580 --> 1:09:30.500]  we're going to remain in the e you customs union
[1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:33.300]  for a period that we don't even know how long it's going to last
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:37.220]  we haven't even negotiated a trade deal with the e you if the e you choose is
[1:09:37.220 --> 1:09:41.460]  not to negotiate with us then we stay in the e you because they have control over
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:44.660]  that negotiation and then negotiating with people
[1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:48.660]  who have already betrayed the uk and whose loyalties lie with globalists not
[1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:53.300]  with their own country so this is not us leaving the e you it's an
[1:09:53.300 --> 1:09:58.180]  extension of us remaining in the e you we're going to copy the common rule book
[1:09:58.180 --> 1:10:01.700]  which is all the e you rules and regulations we're going to be unable to
[1:10:01.700 --> 1:10:05.060]  make new trade deals with other countries around the world including
[1:10:05.060 --> 1:10:09.300]  america it prevents us from doing that this deal alex
[1:10:09.300 --> 1:10:14.260]  is worse than actually remaining in the e you we'd be better off remaining in the
[1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:17.300]  e you because we'd actually have a say we'd have a seat at the table
[1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:19.700]  and that's exactly what it was intended to do
[1:10:19.700 --> 1:10:23.940]  from the very start sunday times report last weekend
[1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:28.100]  mps the government talking about encouraging a financial market crash
[1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:32.340]  to intimidate members of parliament into voting for tereza may's
[1:10:32.340 --> 1:10:35.940]  crappy deal which isn't even a deal which isn't even as leaving the e you
[1:10:35.940 --> 1:10:40.580]  so they literally talk about kamikaze style financial terrorism
[1:10:40.580 --> 1:10:43.540]  they're fear mongering the troops on the streets they're saying
[1:10:43.540 --> 1:10:46.500]  we won't be able to put the chemicals in our water
[1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:50.340]  because all the chemicals that purify the water come from european countries
[1:10:50.340 --> 1:10:52.740]  they could easily source it from a different source
[1:10:52.740 --> 1:10:55.860]  but again they're not going to do that because they're intentionally
[1:10:55.860 --> 1:11:00.260]  trying to trigger bedlam so we essentially remain in the e you
[1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:03.860]  this has been the plan from the very beginning this is what i warned about
[1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:07.220]  we've had denmark island france all these are the countries
[1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:12.980]  vote against e you treaties and the vote is completely ignored every single
[1:11:12.980 --> 1:11:17.380]  time they're doing the same thing with the u k it's a complete betrayal
[1:11:17.380 --> 1:11:21.220]  and it's unconscionable i mean they had riots in denmark after they
[1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:24.660]  after they voted against the e you and yet they ran it through anyway
[1:11:24.660 --> 1:11:28.580]  whether that happens in the u k remains to be seen but they're willing to risk
[1:11:28.580 --> 1:11:32.180]  financial collapse and bedlam to get their way
[1:11:32.180 --> 1:11:38.660]  to try and override this natural populist revolution that's sweeping europe
[1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:42.420]  paul i'm going to take this piece with with you live in this segment the last
[1:11:42.420 --> 1:11:45.860]  segment it's very powerful i'm going to put it out to warn the world
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:50.180]  not just the truth about brexit but i mean how do you put this it's so epic
[1:11:50.180 --> 1:11:55.700]  uh traders inside the u k threaten financial collapse
[1:11:55.700 --> 1:11:59.940]  or or u k held hostage with threats of financial collapse
[1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:04.100]  by globalist e you supporters because we're going to put this video out it's
[1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:07.220]  very important it's on record they're threatening the collapse
[1:12:07.220 --> 1:12:11.300]  that right there shows how villainous these people are
[1:12:11.300 --> 1:12:14.260]  yeah i'll read it straight from the sunday times isn't
[1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:17.860]  info or saying this is from the sunday times number tens plan is to encourage
[1:12:17.860 --> 1:12:21.940]  a crash in financial markets after losing the first vote
[1:12:21.940 --> 1:12:27.780]  okay the first vote on her brexit deal is december 13th and she's going to lose
[1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:31.140]  it by all accounts she hasn't got enough votes so she will lose it
[1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:35.540]  so that after losing the first vote in the hope this stampede's mp's into voting
[1:12:35.540 --> 1:12:39.540]  for it a second time remember they did the same thing with the bailouts in
[1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:42.740]  america alex they threatened martial law
[1:12:42.740 --> 1:12:46.260]  financial collapse basically a new depression
[1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:49.620]  unless they voted for the bailouts this is economic terrorism
[1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:53.860]  and it's in the pages of the sunday times the preeminent newspaper
[1:12:53.860 --> 1:12:57.940]  in britain talking about the same thing because they're that desperate
[1:12:57.940 --> 1:13:01.140]  to ignore the results of a democratic
[1:13:01.140 --> 1:13:05.700]  vote that's how evil authoritarian and mackey of ellie and they truly are
[1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:10.260]  and that clip was on c span there was a secretary of
[1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:14.020]  the treasury henry polson being questioned
[1:13:14.020 --> 1:13:17.380]  and and they threatened to martial law tanks in the streets
[1:13:17.380 --> 1:13:20.660]  if they hadn't done the bailout mainly to EU
[1:13:20.660 --> 1:13:24.820]  banks that was absolutely insane that's
[1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:27.300]  that's how crazy all this is and now they're threatening
[1:13:27.300 --> 1:13:31.860]  an EU army an EU army to physically invade
[1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:35.700]  places like idly if they don't let more of the islamists is in

[1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:34.660]  agree to plea deal he refuses to lie to i guess indict roger stone so
[1:14:34.660 --> 1:14:39.220]  this is just heart-wrenching to see coursey a super patriot
[1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:43.140]  i talked to a national host one of the biggest tv hosts in the country
[1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:46.500]  he's the second largest television host in the country and he was just pointing

[1:19:20.580 --> 1:19:23.940]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:28.260]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been
[1:19:28.260 --> 1:19:31.140]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block
[1:19:31.140 --> 1:19:34.740]  that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[1:19:34.740 --> 1:19:38.900]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others
[1:19:38.900 --> 1:19:42.500]  showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds
[1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:46.740]  two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it
[1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:51.620]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:54.580]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery
[1:19:54.580 --> 1:19:59.380]  x3 now available at infowarslife.com
[1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:10.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:36.820]  well it's been quite a two-year roller coaster with robert
[1:20:36.820 --> 1:20:43.060]  mueller the third who helped deliver the uranium to the russians illegally
[1:20:43.060 --> 1:20:46.260]  who helped cover up all the different clinton crimes
[1:20:46.260 --> 1:20:49.460]  tap hillary with uranium one and hillary with the chai comms and hillary
[1:20:49.460 --> 1:20:52.740]  with the child smuggling out of hayty and hillary with hundreds of countries
[1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:57.620]  putting billions into her foundation and then the very foxes that have been
[1:20:57.620 --> 1:21:01.220]  slaughtering the hens in the chicken coop
[1:21:01.220 --> 1:21:06.500]  have an endless witch hunt against roger stone and trump and myself and
[1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:09.780]  and i mean believe me i know that the thing's a hundred percent fake because
[1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:13.940]  i have zero connections to the kremlin and all this crap
[1:21:13.940 --> 1:21:17.860]  and then we hear that they're telling corset a lie
[1:21:17.860 --> 1:21:21.060]  he says they're telling me to lie and make up stuff and say that roger stone
[1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:23.540]  perjury himself when he didn't and they're they're
[1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:26.900]  they're asking questions about alex jones and they're asking questions about
[1:21:26.900 --> 1:21:30.100]  all this and i won't lie
[1:21:30.100 --> 1:21:33.860]  and then we hear oh he's gonna turn he's gonna he never said that
[1:21:33.860 --> 1:21:37.860]  to try to get us to turn against him and then he goes well i might do a plea
[1:21:37.860 --> 1:21:40.500]  bargain but now he's come out and said well i'm not because they want me to
[1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:44.580]  lie again well here's alan dershowitz last night
[1:21:44.580 --> 1:21:48.980]  yesterday saying that oh it's gonna be devastating it won't be criminal
[1:21:48.980 --> 1:21:53.380]  but politically it'll be damning why doesn't the president have fireside
[1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:57.300]  chats and address the nation once a week
[1:21:57.300 --> 1:22:01.940]  and look at the cameras and say hillary's the russian agent hillary's the
[1:22:01.940 --> 1:22:05.220]  globalist i'm the pro american guy i'm the guy trying to stop the border being
[1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:07.940]  rammed down trying to bring our jobs back and the fellow reserve just raised
[1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:11.380]  interest rates seven times to kill our economy
[1:22:11.380 --> 1:22:15.220]  tweeting isn't enough mr president and i i'm not telling you what to do
[1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:18.180]  i'm not saying you're not doing a great job i'm saying people i was talking to
[1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:22.420]  the military on and off area yesterday and they said they want fireside chats
[1:22:22.420 --> 1:22:26.100]  they want you looking in the camera from the oval office
[1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:34.740]  from that famous desk and laying out this garbage
[1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:38.340]  so with this latest twist we're going to roger stone but here is alan
[1:22:38.340 --> 1:22:42.660]  dershowitz uh who's been acting like he's pro trump lately but
[1:22:42.660 --> 1:22:46.260]  now he's pulling the knife out here it is let's just talk about the information
[1:22:46.260 --> 1:22:49.380]  so we're getting information from paul manifor we're getting information
[1:22:49.380 --> 1:22:52.660]  perhaps from corsie we're already getting information from gates
[1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:56.260]  from collin from film that's an awful lot of people tied to the president
[1:22:56.260 --> 1:23:00.340]  providing evidence it is and i think the report is going to be devastating to
[1:23:00.340 --> 1:23:04.420]  the president and i know that the president's team is already working
[1:23:04.420 --> 1:23:09.060]  on a response to the report and so at some point
[1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:13.300]  when the reports made public and that's a very hard question considering the new
[1:23:13.300 --> 1:23:16.340]  attorney general who has the authority to decide
[1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:19.620]  when and under what circumstance to make it public
[1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:24.020]  it will be made public probably with a response alongside
[1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:26.900]  the president will say ah look it's political
[1:23:26.900 --> 1:23:30.100]  there's their account and there's our account and the american public will have
[1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:32.660]  to judge the credibility it's devastating it's really something
[1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:35.060]  well let's just talk about the information so we're getting
[1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:40.180]  wow so think about that they can't indict anybody for any connection to
[1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:43.300]  russians it's all oh you didn't pay taxes 15 years
[1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:47.780]  ago on taxicabs or whatever nothing to do with trump
[1:23:47.780 --> 1:23:51.620]  so to be this political garbage from someone in bed with the russians
[1:23:51.620 --> 1:23:55.060]  who launched all this to cover up his involvement
[1:23:55.060 --> 1:23:59.300]  roger's popping in for the next five minutes uh roger i gotta tell you i
[1:23:59.300 --> 1:24:01.940]  always liked corsie always admired him that's why he worked for info wars for
[1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:05.780]  about two years um
[1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:09.300]  now to see that he openly says they're telling him to lie and that he won't do
[1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:11.780]  it and then okay well there's a plea deal but
[1:24:11.780 --> 1:24:15.300]  obviously the plea deal was more lies and he says he will not do it
[1:24:15.300 --> 1:24:18.100]  hey what do you expect to come next and what can we do
[1:24:18.100 --> 1:24:22.580]  for this poor guy corsie pray for him well first of all it's very clear that
[1:24:22.580 --> 1:24:26.260]  he's being persecuted and prosecuted not for his
[1:24:26.260 --> 1:24:29.860]  uh not for lying but for his refusal to lie
[1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:33.220]  as he told uh one american news they want him to say
[1:24:33.220 --> 1:24:37.700]  that he was the conduit between uh julian assange and wiki leagues
[1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:41.460]  and roger stone and roger stone was the conduit to donald trump
[1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:45.860]  and the trump campaign that's a falsehood that is not true
[1:24:45.860 --> 1:24:49.860]  he knows it's not true uh any information he gave to me about the
[1:24:49.860 --> 1:24:53.540]  pedestals was available in the public domain
[1:24:53.540 --> 1:24:58.420]  if you were a brilliant researcher like corsie and knew where to look for it
[1:24:58.420 --> 1:25:02.500]  uh and if he deduced that john pedestals emails were being stolen
[1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:05.940]  and would be published he never told me about it
[1:25:05.940 --> 1:25:09.860]  that said all of the research he did give me on the pedestals about their
[1:25:09.860 --> 1:25:14.180]  involvement with the oligarchs around putin and the lucrative gas deal and
[1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:17.140]  the lucrative aluminum deal and the lucrative banking deal
[1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:20.660]  everything he told me turned out to be entirely accurate
[1:25:20.660 --> 1:25:23.700]  that's the amazing thing alex there was russian collusion
[1:25:23.700 --> 1:25:27.140]  but it was in hillary's campaign well and then she later admitted that she
[1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:31.700]  didn't meet once she didn't meet twice she met three times
[1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:36.580]  with vladimir putin when she was secretary of state once in his private
[1:25:36.580 --> 1:25:41.780]  home she spent more than two hours and and and she
[1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:46.980]  where we find out about it in her own book previous to that she'd said she'd
[1:25:46.980 --> 1:25:50.340]  never met with putin then she publishes a book
[1:25:50.340 --> 1:25:54.820]  after she criticizes trump admitting she met with putin i mean what do you make
[1:25:54.820 --> 1:25:58.020]  of this oh and as we know barack obama is caught
[1:25:58.020 --> 1:26:01.540]  on a hot mic saying once i'm reelected i'll have much greater
[1:26:01.540 --> 1:26:05.140]  flexibility so who was it who was telling out to the russians
[1:26:05.140 --> 1:26:08.340]  who was it who was trying to get cozy with vladimir putin
[1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:12.580]  not donald trump that's for sure uh look i i think uh
[1:26:12.580 --> 1:26:18.100]  i feel very badly about uh uh jerry coursey he described their interrogation
[1:26:18.100 --> 1:26:23.140]  of him 40 hours of interrogation is something worthy of the kgb or the
[1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:26.580]  north koreans uh and he's he refuses simply
[1:26:26.580 --> 1:26:30.740]  so well his quote was to mbc they kept saying things that weren't true
[1:26:30.740 --> 1:26:34.900]  over and over again and telling me to say they were that that's illegal
[1:26:34.900 --> 1:26:38.820]  to to to have the time of the fbi it's hillary's former top lawyer
[1:26:38.820 --> 1:26:42.580]  involved in uranium one of course uh and and you know other things other
[1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:47.220]  cover-ups the foundation she's in there literally
[1:26:47.220 --> 1:26:52.580]  you know under the hot lights for four different visits 10 hours each time
[1:26:52.580 --> 1:26:56.180]  literally trying to get him to lie or she'll throw his ass in prison when she
[1:26:56.180 --> 1:26:58.500]  should be the one getting indicted in my view
[1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:02.420]  well there's the real irony you have all these democrats demanding the winner
[1:27:02.420 --> 1:27:06.340]  could recuse himself to mattering the acting attorney general wittaker
[1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:10.660]  come before congress uh arguing that he has no authority
[1:27:10.660 --> 1:27:14.660]  based on his previous political position but the woman
[1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:18.900]  who mocked and ridiculed coursey on the witness stand
[1:27:18.900 --> 1:27:23.700]  was genie ray who was the personal attorney for the clinton foundation in
[1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:28.500]  for hillary clinton and gave 5400 to the clinton campaign
[1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:33.620]  that's mr. Muller's prosecutor for gerry coursey i think this tells us
[1:27:33.620 --> 1:27:38.820]  much it tells us that these people are crazy
[1:27:38.820 --> 1:27:42.340]  arrogant that they could find some other political prosecutor
[1:27:42.340 --> 1:27:46.980]  but to then sit in hillary's personal attack dog
[1:27:46.980 --> 1:27:50.340]  who's up to her eyeballs at the foundation with all
[1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:55.060]  of this criminal activity it's just too rich it's too much roger
[1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:59.780]  well i think the american people will see through it but as you know alex
[1:27:59.780 --> 1:28:03.140]  they have an unlimited budget with which to destroy
[1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:08.900]  gerry coursey roger stone alex jones and anybody who supports this president
[1:28:08.900 --> 1:28:12.180]  so i urge people to go to stonedefensefund.com

[1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:44.980]  now when we kick off the next hour i'm going to get into the declaration of
[1:33:44.980 --> 1:33:48.820]  martial law in ukraine and the provocation where they set the ships
[1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:52.900]  into the russian harbor violating the treaty and harbor rules so the russians
[1:33:52.900 --> 1:33:56.020]  would then board them with their ghost guard so that they can then declare
[1:33:56.020 --> 1:34:01.300]  martial law because the leader in the ukraine is very unpopular and was set
[1:34:01.300 --> 1:34:05.940]  to lose the election he's talking about canceling the election now
[1:34:05.940 --> 1:34:08.180]  because he did the provocation with the russians we're going to play all the

[1:34:23.780 --> 1:34:27.140]  we told you about it five years ago but now it's mainstream news that is all
[1:34:27.140 --> 1:34:31.460]  coming up but if you look at all this it's interconnected
[1:34:31.460 --> 1:34:35.780]  and you've got george soros and the un getting us taxpayer money
[1:34:35.780 --> 1:34:38.820]  funding the caravans out of north africa on the
[1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:43.140]  zodiac boats and funding the groups of the middle east of europe
[1:34:43.140 --> 1:34:46.500]  and now you've got the big aid organizations building these refugee
[1:34:46.500 --> 1:34:49.300]  centers in latin america and moving them towards the border
[1:34:49.300 --> 1:34:53.140]  brandon darby is the editor of breitbart texas at
[1:34:53.140 --> 1:34:56.980]  brandon darby on twitter breitbart.com
[1:34:56.980 --> 1:35:00.260]  four slash author four slash brandon darby of course you can find his work
[1:35:00.260 --> 1:35:02.420]  it's usually on the front page of a breitbart
[1:35:02.420 --> 1:35:05.860]  and he goes into mexico and some of the most dangerous no-go zones
[1:35:05.860 --> 1:35:08.660]  because we've seen some of our reporters in there and the fbi meets them at the
[1:35:08.660 --> 1:35:11.540]  airport because they don't even go in there they always ask for our footage
[1:35:11.540 --> 1:35:15.380]  and stuff so i mean brandon goes in there hundreds of times
[1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:20.340]  perfect time to get him on to talk about the five thousand they report in
[1:35:20.340 --> 1:35:24.820]  tijuana trying to get into the u.s the 35 million the last 20 years have
[1:35:24.820 --> 1:35:27.700]  already gotten in but these are different they're totally
[1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:30.020]  more and more being politically motivated before with a lot of folks
[1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:33.380]  actually fleeing carnage and some of these people are doing that as well but
[1:35:33.380 --> 1:35:36.500]  the media keeps showing images of a woman and and two children
[1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:39.700]  instead of the fact that they're almost all military aged men
[1:35:39.700 --> 1:35:44.020]  so brandon darby uh is uh joining us in this segment the next
[1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:47.380]  uh to give us his expert take on this and what his ice
[1:35:47.380 --> 1:35:52.100]  and border patrol sources in california texas and other areas are telling him
[1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:56.900]  the president tweeted today that mexico should move
[1:35:56.900 --> 1:36:01.620]  the flag waving migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their
[1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:04.020]  own countries do it by plane do it by bus do it
[1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:08.580]  anyway you want something dr seuss but they are not coming to the u.s
[1:36:08.580 --> 1:36:13.540]  we will close the border permanently if need be congress build that wall and
[1:36:13.540 --> 1:36:19.220]  then trump goes on from there uh so brandon thank you for joining us
[1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:22.740]  hey thank you for having me on alec where to start here because you are one of
[1:36:22.740 --> 1:36:27.060]  the leading experts on this the caravan though the latest you're seeing
[1:36:27.060 --> 1:36:30.020]  trump's response what's front and center for you
[1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:35.460]  well front and center is this um we have to remember that over the last year
[1:36:35.460 --> 1:36:41.620]  we've had an estimated 1200 people either illegally or regularly and that is
[1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:45.380]  up for debate because some of them cross and turn themselves in
[1:36:45.380 --> 1:36:52.660]  but we've had an average of 1200 people per day that means every four days
[1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:57.060]  there is a caravan's worth of of these people
[1:36:57.060 --> 1:37:00.580]  coming across our border in between ports of entry
[1:37:00.580 --> 1:37:05.060]  we've had this happening for over a year um and i think that people need to
[1:37:05.060 --> 1:37:08.340]  understand that yes it's important to focus on the caravan
[1:37:08.340 --> 1:37:12.180]  yes it's newsworthy what happened yesterday the definitely newsworthy
[1:37:12.180 --> 1:37:16.500]  the people have to understand that most of the people roughly a thousand of
[1:37:16.500 --> 1:37:19.300]  those 1200 per day are coming into texas
[1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:23.220]  and so that is happening every day every four days of the caravan's worth
[1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:26.340]  coming into texas it gets very little coverage outside of bright part and a
[1:37:26.340 --> 1:37:29.700]  few others uh mainstream media doesn't focus on it
[1:37:29.700 --> 1:37:33.380]  and also the government officials don't focus on it and they they
[1:37:33.380 --> 1:37:36.420]  have us focused over there and that's fine for now um
[1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:41.300]  yesterday you know there's an estimated 5000 uh people from this caravan in
[1:37:41.300 --> 1:37:45.300]  tijuana yesterday 10 of them which is 500 mostly
[1:37:45.300 --> 1:37:50.020]  military age men decided to seize our border they ripped open border panels
[1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:53.860]  came through they threw softball sized rocks on our border patrol agent which
[1:37:53.860 --> 1:37:56.660]  is life-threatening border patrol agents responded
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:00.500]  with uh with chemicals there's debate about whether it was pepper balls or
[1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:03.460]  tear gas i think it was pepper balls and pepper gas
[1:38:03.460 --> 1:38:09.780]  um but uh which could be argued that is tear gas you know it is a form of it
[1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:12.900]  um but when you got thousands of people storming and throwing rocks at you
[1:38:12.900 --> 1:38:15.620]  they're lucky they didn't get shot rubber bullets
[1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:20.100]  right and so what happened is a couple of very irresponsible parents had their
[1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:24.420]  kids in the mix of that mainstream media has decided to focus on
[1:38:24.420 --> 1:38:28.740]  the kids and the women holding two kids fleeing in that image
[1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:33.460]  and not just the photos of of life-threatening softball sized rocks being thrown
[1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:39.380]  at our agents as military age men rip our border barrier apart and run through
[1:38:39.380 --> 1:38:44.020]  um and that's where we're at uh media's focusing on it they're making some very
[1:38:44.020 --> 1:38:47.140]  outrageous claims claiming that uh government or that trump is using
[1:38:47.140 --> 1:38:53.140]  chemical warfare on migrants uh but then we remembered that in 2013 the
[1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:56.740]  exact same thing happened around the exact same time
[1:38:56.740 --> 1:39:02.580]  uh on november 24th or 25th of 2013 and the obama administration
[1:39:02.580 --> 1:39:07.620]  responded with the same response they used the same response fired the same
[1:39:07.620 --> 1:39:13.220]  pepper bullets fired uh and repelled a caravan from
[1:39:13.220 --> 1:39:16.820]  forcibly entering just like uh trump has done
[1:39:16.820 --> 1:39:20.340]  the trump administration is done uh but when we're doing a side-by-side
[1:39:20.340 --> 1:39:23.860]  comparison of media coverage uh the media didn't
[1:39:23.860 --> 1:39:30.660]  blame obama for it at that time uh they blamed the unruly uh people coming in
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:34.420]  very interesting well i've seen the headlines as have you and
[1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:37.620]  everybody else when the mainstream media does cover this there wasn't a lot of
[1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:41.460]  coverage of it last night that i saw it was crop photos of a few women and
[1:39:41.460 --> 1:39:44.100]  children as you mentioned we just showed up to tv viewers
[1:39:44.100 --> 1:39:48.020]  or headlines like border patrol attacks migrants
[1:39:48.020 --> 1:39:52.020]  approaching us no they weren't approaching they were over
[1:39:52.020 --> 1:39:55.540]  running it and then if those images are seen
[1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:59.220]  worldwide just like what happened to europe starting six years ago
[1:39:59.220 --> 1:40:02.660]  we'll have 15 million people and i've talked to military folks on air
[1:40:02.660 --> 1:40:05.780]  i also talked to some off air i know you talked to a lot of people involved
[1:40:05.780 --> 1:40:09.300]  they're being told uh by the pentagon briefers that
[1:40:09.300 --> 1:40:12.980]  if these tens of thousands get in because obviously more coming
[1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:15.780]  there are a whole bunch of caravans as you said many arriving every day in
[1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:19.220]  places like texas but if these really aggressive big caravans
[1:40:19.220 --> 1:40:22.900]  uh break through that's going to then be the signal
[1:40:22.900 --> 1:40:27.540]  for even a larger groups to start to quote migration
[1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:31.140]  well and and that's kind of what we're seeing that you know as as policies
[1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:33.940]  changed during the obama administration the numbers increased and
[1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:37.140]  increased and increased when trump first took office
[1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:40.420]  the numbers decreased because the rhetoric people thought hey i'm not
[1:40:40.420 --> 1:40:43.220]  going to be allowed to come i'm not going to be allowed to stay so they
[1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:46.740]  didn't come and then they started to realize wait we are allowed to stay
[1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:49.860]  so they started to come in the same numbers again and now we're back up to
[1:40:49.860 --> 1:40:52.420]  obama era numbers if not surpassing them
[1:40:52.420 --> 1:40:55.620]  i think uh you know the average is 1200 per day over the last year but in
[1:40:55.620 --> 1:41:00.500]  october we had over 50 000 people cross our border in between
[1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:04.100]  ports of entry that that's just the ones we apprehended and they said
[1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:09.060]  they say that we probably apprehended 55 percent of the people who crossed
[1:41:09.060 --> 1:41:13.380]  so that's very significant in number you know i think a lot of people
[1:41:13.380 --> 1:41:17.300]  need to keep in mind uh when we're talking about this and especially if
[1:41:17.300 --> 1:41:19.780]  someone out there is a liberal and they're listening whether because they're
[1:41:19.780 --> 1:41:22.980]  just interested or whether because they're trying to wait for one of us to
[1:41:22.980 --> 1:41:25.700]  say something and use it against us or whatever they do
[1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:30.260]  they need to understand that this was 10 percent of the caravan who did this and
[1:41:30.260 --> 1:41:33.460]  engaged in this behavior there's another 90 percent
[1:41:33.460 --> 1:41:37.220]  who decided not to engage in this behavior and
[1:41:37.220 --> 1:41:40.740]  rather than defending that 90 percent which are telling their stories which i
[1:41:40.740 --> 1:41:44.260]  could understand there's some that's under that's understandable
[1:41:44.260 --> 1:41:48.020]  media is choosing to focus and defend these rock throwing
[1:41:48.020 --> 1:41:53.140]  military aged men who use a couple of women and children as as human shields
[1:41:53.140 --> 1:41:57.060]  are as as uh media ploys and i think that's just the most
[1:41:57.060 --> 1:42:02.260]  bizarre thing i've ever heard of you know brandon when we come back from
[1:42:02.260 --> 1:42:04.340]  break i i know you just stick as eternal is the
[1:42:04.340 --> 1:42:08.340]  facts of what's happening but but but the end game the aid group soros is
[1:42:08.340 --> 1:42:11.140]  involved they admit they want to break our
[1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:13.300]  borders and then use the groups they bring in
[1:42:13.300 --> 1:42:17.220]  who they politically control as an internal group uh
[1:42:17.220 --> 1:42:22.500]  for milking their welfare payments that the democrat group scheme off of
[1:42:22.500 --> 1:42:26.180]  using them as a voting block i mean this is really a clear and present danger to
[1:42:26.180 --> 1:42:30.260]  the sovereignty of the nation and when trump says it's the number one issue
[1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:34.660]  i mean it really is it's the basic integrity of having a country
[1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:39.060]  and now when the president says we're a nation they say the word nation or
[1:42:39.060 --> 1:42:43.140]  nationalist is bad well well then what are we if we're not a nation

[1:45:34.820 --> 1:45:39.300]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist scientists and others showed us
[1:45:39.300 --> 1:45:42.580]  the research that by combining it with three other compounds
[1:45:42.580 --> 1:45:48.900]  two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it even more

[1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:26.180]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[1:47:26.180 --> 1:47:31.220]  of the info war
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:36.260]  all right uh brane and darby gave me some really powerful intel off record but
[1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:39.140]  we're not able to get to it at this point but let's just say this
[1:47:39.140 --> 1:47:43.220]  everybody should be watching the next few days because things are obviously
[1:47:43.220 --> 1:47:45.860]  already crazy they're about to get a lot more crazy
[1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:50.500]  up to 5 000 people from the different un funded caravans have already showed up
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:54.500]  uh in tijuana on the us border with
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:48:00.980]  the united states there in san diego compelling video compelling audio
[1:48:00.980 --> 1:48:04.980]  and by brandon when we went to break we were getting into what's the end game
[1:48:04.980 --> 1:48:07.700]  here i mean we know a lot of these are normal people
[1:48:07.700 --> 1:48:11.140]  they're leaving economic collapse but a lot of them aren't a lot of them are
[1:48:11.140 --> 1:48:14.660]  socialists a lot of them are criminals a lot of them have been caught smuggling
[1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:18.180]  drugs people uh what is the the big end game here
[1:48:18.180 --> 1:48:21.300]  though from your research with the democrats and others and what are they
[1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:25.140]  planning to do to president trump because i see them hoping that there's
[1:48:25.140 --> 1:48:28.820]  some type of violence hoping some kids get hurt and instead of the people that
[1:48:28.820 --> 1:48:32.500]  put their kids in harm's way instead of them getting in trouble it's going to
[1:48:32.500 --> 1:48:36.740]  be the american people and the fact that our nation even exists
[1:48:36.740 --> 1:48:40.340]  yeah you know it's a it's a kind of a complicated deal like i
[1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:44.020]  i look at these groups and i think i think that
[1:48:44.020 --> 1:48:47.380]  historically what i see is that the vast majority of them are really people
[1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:50.500]  who are living in a really bad situation
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:55.780]  and uh they're probably not bad people um but it doesn't take away from the fact
[1:48:55.780 --> 1:48:59.700]  if you have 10 or 20 percent who are bad people
[1:48:59.700 --> 1:49:03.700]  you still can't allow that many people who are who are
[1:49:03.700 --> 1:49:07.220]  the type of people who would throw rocks that are border patrol agents
[1:49:07.220 --> 1:49:11.860]  that would possibly maim or kill them you can't allow them in the country right
[1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:15.220]  and then you get into economic issues sovereignty issues i mean we have a
[1:49:15.220 --> 1:49:18.820]  plethora of issues but when we look at just out of that five thousand like i
[1:49:18.820 --> 1:49:22.100]  said 10 percent of them tried to do something violent and aggressive
[1:49:22.100 --> 1:49:26.980]  the other 90 percent didn't um so so there's a mix of people and it's
[1:49:26.980 --> 1:49:31.220]  you know you can you can acknowledge the humanity of these people
[1:49:31.220 --> 1:49:34.980]  and the plight that they're going through but at the same time think hey
[1:49:34.980 --> 1:49:38.980]  as a nation we can't allow this to occur we can't allow you in
[1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:43.460]  you know because you imagine if those if those men who were attacking our agents
[1:49:43.460 --> 1:49:46.980]  yesterday with those rocks and had such aggression
[1:49:46.980 --> 1:49:50.900]  if they would stay home and turn that aggression towards the criminal groups
[1:49:50.900 --> 1:49:54.340]  that are destroying their country making it uninhabitable in the first place
[1:49:54.340 --> 1:49:58.260]  they would they would take their country back but instead it's easier see
[1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:02.260]  we give a relief valve for these countries and so all of the people who
[1:50:02.260 --> 1:50:05.940]  strive for something better who are willing to fight for liberty or fight
[1:50:05.940 --> 1:50:09.060]  for something better and take chances for something better
[1:50:09.060 --> 1:50:13.140]  we let we make it easier for them to come here than it is for them just to
[1:50:13.140 --> 1:50:17.300]  better their own country and that's actually a disservice to El Salvador
[1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:20.660]  it's a disservice to Honduras it's a disservice to Mexico
[1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:24.580]  and and all of the rest of the nations that we allow to do this we
[1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:28.100]  we need to do something that makes those people stay home
[1:50:28.100 --> 1:50:32.100]  and those people who strive for better need to strive for better and fight for
[1:50:32.100 --> 1:50:35.460]  better in their own country so their countries will be better so they can
[1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:38.820]  have jobs they can overthrow the criminal organizations that are
[1:50:38.820 --> 1:50:42.340]  running their countries and and they can ultimately better the
[1:50:42.340 --> 1:50:44.500]  entire world that way what we're doing
[1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:48.180]  providing that pressure valve it's not helping it doesn't help us
[1:50:48.180 --> 1:50:52.340]  but it it dang sure doesn't help their countries where they come from
[1:50:52.340 --> 1:50:56.340]  well you're absolutely right and you know you've been demonized and lied
[1:50:56.340 --> 1:50:59.300]  about because you've been very truthful you've been very effective
[1:50:59.300 --> 1:51:02.420]  and you really scare the left because you used to be what you call a liberal
[1:51:02.420 --> 1:51:05.540]  i'm speaking for you and i think you still are a classical liberal just not a
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:08.180]  modern leftist but when you look at the average
[1:51:08.180 --> 1:51:11.860]  leftist they will lie they will cheat they will steal
[1:51:11.860 --> 1:51:14.420]  they want to bring these people in to have a
[1:51:14.420 --> 1:51:18.900]  permanent underclass that they control just like in all the blue cities
[1:51:18.900 --> 1:51:23.620]  uh set up the very same system and just experiencing the left
[1:51:23.620 --> 1:51:26.420]  i didn't realize how bad the average leftist was
[1:51:26.420 --> 1:51:30.260]  even 15 years ago when now i know in hindsight they were making up
[1:51:30.260 --> 1:51:32.900]  now totally proven unbelievable lies about you
[1:51:32.900 --> 1:51:36.900]  then i've had it happen to me where they just and and it's it's gone from
[1:51:36.900 --> 1:51:40.340]  high level leftist being liars and being corrupt and
[1:51:40.340 --> 1:51:44.100]  hating america and in kwamos you're saying america was never great
[1:51:44.100 --> 1:51:48.180]  they'll never be great or whatever to to now even low level liberals i mean a
[1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:51.300]  lot of them are still nice but if they're a leftist
[1:51:51.300 --> 1:51:54.500]  they have just gotten radicalized and they are
[1:51:54.500 --> 1:51:58.500]  anti-free speech and they're anti-family and they're anti-america
[1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:03.380]  and they just say no borders no walls no usa at all and so
[1:52:03.380 --> 1:52:08.180]  i think of antifa as a little small group of idiots but now i think antifa
[1:52:08.180 --> 1:52:11.700]  that mindset is becoming the operating system of the democrats what's your
[1:52:11.700 --> 1:52:14.580]  view because you're you're embedded in the middle of this you you go into
[1:52:14.580 --> 1:52:18.260]  those dangerous areas uh see your reports of that of anybody
[1:52:18.260 --> 1:52:21.540]  and so you're you're seeing all sides and i agree with you i don't think the
[1:52:21.540 --> 1:52:24.420]  poor people trying to have a better life on average are bad
[1:52:24.420 --> 1:52:28.180]  but they're being used by very very bad people
[1:52:28.180 --> 1:52:32.020]  oh very much so i mean you know this is where
[1:52:32.020 --> 1:52:35.780]  it's just we all just have a big difference of how we look at the world
[1:52:35.780 --> 1:52:39.220]  and what we want for the world you know some things we have in common like i
[1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:41.940]  don't want to see people hungry they don't want to see people hungry i want
[1:52:41.940 --> 1:52:44.660]  everyone to get health care they want everyone to get health care
[1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:47.620]  but they believe in going about it a very different way
[1:52:47.620 --> 1:52:51.540]  but then other things we just don't agree on you know
[1:52:51.540 --> 1:52:58.100]  they believe in a european model of of of of our personal responsibilities i
[1:52:58.100 --> 1:53:02.340]  don't that really matters like they want to take guns i want to keep my guns
[1:53:02.340 --> 1:53:05.700]  but what's behind that is really the issue what's behind that
[1:53:05.700 --> 1:53:10.100]  is that they have adopted a mindset and a mentality
[1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:15.620]  that that exists or that was created in an area where there's a lot of population
[1:53:15.620 --> 1:53:20.420]  density where the police are nearby um we live in areas where we have a
[1:53:20.420 --> 1:53:23.300]  country that's very vast open wide expanses
[1:53:23.300 --> 1:53:27.060]  where law enforcement sometimes can't get there for 25 minutes or more
[1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:30.580]  and with a lot of our communities in texas say for instance and in the united
[1:53:30.580 --> 1:53:34.180]  states even and and so so taking away guns like
[1:53:34.180 --> 1:53:38.740]  for me for instance i challenge cartels like i directly exposed
[1:53:38.740 --> 1:53:43.700]  members of of mexican drug cartels international criminal syndicates
[1:53:43.700 --> 1:53:47.380]  and i get them busted that's what i do that's what my writing does i tell
[1:53:47.380 --> 1:53:50.180]  stories i i i tell the people's stories who are
[1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:53.140]  affected by them i let them write it under a pseudonym
[1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:56.740]  we bring enough media attention to one of these guys that the the mexican
[1:53:56.740 --> 1:53:59.380]  government gets embarrassed the u.s government gets embarrassed they go
[1:53:59.380 --> 1:54:02.900]  after him and then you have these criminal networks who strongly
[1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:06.900]  resent me and my team and so for me when you say you're
[1:54:06.900 --> 1:54:12.340]  going to take my firearms or i shouldn't have a high capacity magazine
[1:54:12.340 --> 1:54:16.660]  i take that as a very direct threat to my way of life and to my existence
[1:54:16.660 --> 1:54:21.060]  because i exercise my freedom of expression these people want to kill me
[1:54:21.060 --> 1:54:24.820]  and now i have liberals who want to take my firearms from me
[1:54:24.820 --> 1:54:28.740]  i'm not going to i don't accept that but see they look at the world and they
[1:54:28.740 --> 1:54:31.780]  don't think that we should protect ourselves or our property
[1:54:31.780 --> 1:54:35.780]  they don't even value the property i look at my property and i say hey
[1:54:35.780 --> 1:54:40.260]  that's part of my life i worked really hard to pay for my jeep i worked my
[1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:43.460]  butt off that's a lot of time i took away from my child
[1:54:43.460 --> 1:54:47.860]  to work to pay for that jeep if you take my jeep you're taking part of my life
[1:54:47.860 --> 1:54:51.380]  i have to defend what's mine they don't look at things that way because they
[1:54:51.380 --> 1:54:54.420]  don't value per private property the same way we do
[1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:57.540]  they don't value the same thing so the left is a lot
[1:54:57.540 --> 1:55:00.340]  like the right there are all these different factions on the right and
[1:55:00.340 --> 1:55:03.540]  different mindsets and there's all these different factions and mindsets on the
[1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:08.580]  left but right now on the left uh the democratic party like in
[1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:12.020]  texas it's controlled by a lot of very moderate
[1:55:12.020 --> 1:55:16.420]  democrats uh it on a national level it's very much
[1:55:16.420 --> 1:55:20.100]  controlled by the far left who i think do sympathize
[1:55:20.100 --> 1:55:24.820]  with antifa do sympathize with the more radical elements on the far left
[1:55:24.820 --> 1:55:27.940]  you know andrew breitbart used to call him chardonnay stepping
[1:55:27.940 --> 1:55:31.780]  revolutionaries because they have their nice homes they have their money they
[1:55:31.780 --> 1:55:35.220]  drink their wine at night their chardonnay yet they glorify
[1:55:35.220 --> 1:55:39.540]  deify romanticize their more radical counterparts on the left
[1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:43.860]  and they offer cover for them whenever i had an issue when i worked undercover i
[1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:47.460]  busted a bunch of far leftist antifa guys who were trying to
[1:55:47.460 --> 1:55:52.820]  bomb republicans and bomb uh law enforcement officers simply for
[1:55:52.820 --> 1:55:56.260]  meeting and for expressing their their constitution
[1:55:56.260 --> 1:55:59.460]  engaging in their constitutional rights to to meet in a symbol
[1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:04.340]  and express their views um they tried to shut the r and c down in 2008
[1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:08.820]  and did the new york times editorial boards go out there and throw molotovs
[1:56:08.820 --> 1:56:13.860]  no they didn't but what did they do is instead of framing it as far left
[1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:17.140]  spawns bomb plot they framed it as far left
[1:56:17.140 --> 1:56:21.540]  fields betrayed by their government and they began to frame and offer political
[1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:27.060]  air cover for these far left radicals i was the bad guy the fbi was the bad
[1:56:27.060 --> 1:56:31.060]  guy not the people who tried to burn in main people with homemade may
[1:56:31.060 --> 1:56:34.500]  oh listen when i tried to get into trump's inauguration they had all these
[1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:37.220]  interests is blocked they beat up women and children in front of me
[1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:39.940]  the police were protecting him because they were you know still under obama's
[1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:43.780]  control until trump got inaugurated and then the media
[1:56:43.780 --> 1:56:46.900]  the new york times called me and said i made that up and when i sent them like
[1:56:46.900 --> 1:56:51.060]  10 articles showing it even from nbc news they said i made it up
[1:56:51.060 --> 1:56:54.820]  so it's this it's this upside down world where jenna costa
[1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:58.500]  grabs the mic pushes the woman's arm down and then they say we doctored the
[1:56:58.500 --> 1:57:00.820]  video i know you're about to be on the road you got to go
[1:57:00.820 --> 1:57:03.780]  very exciting stuff coming up from right mark texas brandon darby but we got to
[1:57:03.780 --> 1:57:07.140]  go to break do five more minutes because i want to ask you when we come back
[1:57:07.140 --> 1:57:11.860]  in five more minutes where you think all this ends and how can we reach out to
[1:57:11.860 --> 1:57:14.580]  the average leftist and get them to think of themselves because there's seven
[1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:18.180]  and a half billion people in the world there's about to be 10 billion by 2030
[1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:21.780]  the estimate less than a billion are in the first world
[1:57:21.780 --> 1:57:25.540]  we can't have billions of people coming here i mean and not with a welfare
[1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:28.580]  state it'll collapse and you know in the in the days of
[1:57:28.580 --> 1:57:32.740]  ellis island you didn't get any welfare and you got quarantine for three months

[2:00:14.340 --> 2:00:17.540]  i'm alex jones your host brandon darby is
[2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:23.620]  right up there with the folks at project veritas i mean there's no
[2:00:23.620 --> 2:00:27.940]  more hardcore journalist out there than uh people obviously like the
[2:00:27.940 --> 2:00:32.340]  folks at bright mark texas headed up by brandon darby and then of course
[2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:35.780]  uh the folks over at project veritas james o' keith and you see
[2:00:35.780 --> 2:00:39.380]  how they get persecuted how they get lied about how people go after
[2:00:39.380 --> 2:00:44.660]  you and i i was always a libertarian but not so much a conservative so the left
[2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:48.740]  would lie about me some but not as much when i started backing trump
[2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:54.100]  i really got the full treatment and i learned you cannot believe a word
[2:00:54.100 --> 2:00:57.780]  they say in fact whatever they say it's the opposite and it's incredible how
[2:00:57.780 --> 2:00:59.940]  they all gang up but that's a separate issue
[2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:03.380]  uh brandon where do you see all this going
[2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:06.740]  with the third world population exploding socialist governments
[2:01:06.740 --> 2:01:10.580]  looting the people like venezuela borders collapsing everywhere
[2:01:10.580 --> 2:01:13.780]  there's no way we can take care of all these people like you were saying so
[2:01:13.780 --> 2:01:20.580]  how do we stop this yeah but see i think i think a lot of when we talk about
[2:01:20.580 --> 2:01:23.940]  i mean a lot of it has to do with our tone a lot of it has to do with just
[2:01:23.940 --> 2:01:26.420]  being a reasonable person and knowing the facts
[2:01:26.420 --> 2:01:32.180]  so if i talk about like like the problems internally in our country
[2:01:32.180 --> 2:01:36.660]  that come from allowing mass migration on this scale to occur
[2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:40.660]  uh well i'm going to appeal to people on the right who care about that issue
[2:01:40.660 --> 2:01:44.580]  but when i start talking about the humanitarian consequences of an
[2:01:44.580 --> 2:01:47.700]  unsecured border when i start talking about the
[2:01:47.700 --> 2:01:51.620]  overall impact on the world and on the migrants themselves
[2:01:51.620 --> 2:01:55.060]  well all of a sudden i start to appeal to people on the left as well
[2:01:55.060 --> 2:01:59.780]  and so i try to talk about both and most people don't do that you have the left
[2:01:59.780 --> 2:02:03.380]  just talking about the migrants what they want to get here and what they
[2:02:03.380 --> 2:02:05.860]  experience you have the right just talking about the
[2:02:05.860 --> 2:02:09.940]  migrants who are here who commit crimes but then you have this weird little
[2:02:09.940 --> 2:02:13.540]  hybrid thing going on where Breitbart, Texas tells the whole story
[2:02:13.540 --> 2:02:18.180]  and the story is this the things to focus on it's like for instance
[2:02:18.180 --> 2:02:22.420]  up to 70 to 80 percent of the females from central america
[2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:26.180]  who come to our border are sexually assaulted along the way
[2:02:26.180 --> 2:02:30.260]  sometimes multiple times that's a big deal that's not just Breitbart
[2:02:30.260 --> 2:02:34.740]  reporting or alex jones that that is the united nations that is
[2:02:34.740 --> 2:02:38.420]  amnesty international that we could go down the line you can google it sexual
[2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:41.700]  assault of migrants from central america
[2:02:41.700 --> 2:02:45.460]  and there's a wikipedia entry that has tons of good literature for you and
[2:02:45.460 --> 2:02:47.860]  links for you to you know i'm glad you mentioned that because even the
[2:02:47.860 --> 2:02:50.580]  washington post says the headline that unicef
[2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:53.780]  and amnesty international estimate 80 percent of women
[2:02:53.780 --> 2:02:57.220]  central americans traveling through mexico get to the us are raped and how
[2:02:57.220 --> 2:03:00.580]  is that not a huge issue how is america the bad guys
[2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:03.300]  and trumps the bad guy and 80 percent there it is
[2:03:03.300 --> 2:03:08.260]  huffington post yep huffington post reports that and it's not just
[2:03:08.260 --> 2:03:11.780]  Breitbart and so that's what i'm trying to talk about it if we talk about the
[2:03:11.780 --> 2:03:14.820]  other 95 percent of their journey not just
[2:03:14.820 --> 2:03:17.620]  what happens when border patrol agents apprehend them
[2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:22.180]  but if we focus on how bad this system is and what we're encouraging people
[2:03:22.180 --> 2:03:25.780]  don't realize that like los ethos in the golf cartel factions of those
[2:03:25.780 --> 2:03:29.700]  cartels like the rea nosa faction rea nosa faction of the golf cartel south
[2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:32.580]  of mcallon they make as much or more from the legal
[2:03:32.580 --> 2:03:37.620]  immigration as they do from drugs you know and and so we're fueling our
[2:03:37.620 --> 2:03:42.820]  kindness is fueling the very systems of oppression
[2:03:42.820 --> 2:03:46.020]  that people are leaving fleeing from in the first place
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:49.700]  and when you start to talk like that right when you don't call them animals
[2:03:49.700 --> 2:03:52.980]  you don't you you talk about people just as people
[2:03:52.980 --> 2:03:56.340]  you talk about their reality and the facts of the matter and what we're
[2:03:56.340 --> 2:04:00.100]  encouraging with this flow you start to appeal to a lot more
[2:04:00.100 --> 2:04:03.460]  people and so i think that that's the way that people on the left not the
[2:04:03.460 --> 2:04:06.500]  entire left but people on the left will start to come around
[2:04:06.500 --> 2:04:11.380]  is as i think by just by talking about the migrants like the human beings
[2:04:11.380 --> 2:04:14.740]  because they are and talking about the realities of what we're doing and what
[2:04:14.740 --> 2:04:16.500]  we're encouraging what we're encouraging is
[2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:19.060]  countries south of our border who will never get better
[2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:23.620]  all of the talent all of the courage is being sucked out to our country
[2:04:23.620 --> 2:04:27.460]  and it's causing all kinds of problems back home they need to stay home and
[2:04:27.460 --> 2:04:31.540]  they need to fix their own nation and we need we can help them fix their nation
[2:04:31.540 --> 2:04:37.140]  where they are but this is the way that i talk about it i think i find a lot of
[2:04:37.140 --> 2:04:40.820]  brandon that's exciting we know you've got big news at right mark texas coming

[2:06:16.740 --> 2:06:21.780]  for your mind
[2:06:21.780 --> 2:06:27.220]  the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order
[2:06:27.220 --> 2:06:31.140]  it must be followed there's about four minutes
[2:06:31.140 --> 2:06:35.940]  between the order being given and the people responsible for launching
[2:06:35.940 --> 2:06:40.580]  nuclear weapons to do so as president i will make it clear
[2:06:40.580 --> 2:06:43.700]  that the united states will treat cyber attacks
[2:06:43.700 --> 2:06:47.540]  just like any other attack we will be ready with serious
[2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:52.500]  political economic and military responses they're voting for peace on
[2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:56.180]  planet earth if they vote for trump but if they vote for
[2:06:56.180 --> 2:07:02.660]  hillary it's war we came we saw he died
[2:07:02.660 --> 2:07:06.740]  with her you'll end up in world war i want the iranians to know that if i'm
[2:07:06.740 --> 2:07:11.540]  the president we will attack iran right now senator for us to control all of
[2:07:11.540 --> 2:07:15.380]  the airspace in syria would require us to go to war
[2:07:15.380 --> 2:07:20.980]  against syria and russia the u.s. military has just raised the threat
[2:07:20.980 --> 2:07:24.500]  level to def con too meanwhile hillary clinton is
[2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:27.780]  still threatening russia with military action
[2:07:27.780 --> 2:07:30.900]  following unconfirmed reports of further hacking
[2:07:30.900 --> 2:07:33.700]  it's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions
[2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:39.540]  of course not because she's really loud noise
[2:07:39.540 --> 2:07:42.100]  all right looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties
[2:07:42.100 --> 2:07:48.100]  we'll try to get leon back on in a few minutes
[2:07:48.100 --> 2:07:52.100]  when the president gives the order it must be
[2:07:52.100 --> 2:08:16.660]  following
[2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:36.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, the so-called President of Ukraine has declared martial law several
[2:08:36.380 --> 2:08:39.660]  hours ago.
[2:08:39.660 --> 2:08:51.100]  And when you studied the geopolitical history of Crimea, of Ukraine, of Russia, and when
[2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:58.780]  you've looked at the different angles of it, it is extremely clear exactly what is going
[2:08:58.780 --> 2:09:06.340]  on.
[2:09:06.340 --> 2:09:19.420]  The President has declared martial law, and the President of Ukraine, and he's now saying
[2:09:19.420 --> 2:09:27.460]  that he is looking at suspending the elections that are upcoming, that polls show he's set
[2:09:27.460 --> 2:09:29.260]  to lose.
[2:09:29.260 --> 2:09:36.540]  So you've got Crimea, part of Russia for 500 years is where Russia was founded, 550
[2:09:36.540 --> 2:09:37.900]  years or so.
[2:09:37.900 --> 2:09:45.380]  You've got Ukraine that historically its eastern part is Russian, its western part
[2:09:45.380 --> 2:09:50.220]  is more Catholic and more allied with Germany and Poland.
[2:09:50.220 --> 2:09:59.780]  Now if you look at the history of World War II, Hitler occupied Ukraine, and then Ukraine
[2:09:59.780 --> 2:10:06.380]  fought on the side of the Nazis against Russia, at least the western part did.
[2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:15.700]  So there are big beefs between Russian Ukraine that's Orthodox and western Ukraine that's
[2:10:15.700 --> 2:10:18.420]  mainly Catholic.
[2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:20.980]  Those are the main fishers.
[2:10:20.980 --> 2:10:28.420]  Five years ago, George Soros and the United Nations and NATO publicly bragged that they
[2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:35.300]  overthrew the elected government of Ukraine and actually put an interim government of
[2:10:35.300 --> 2:10:43.940]  Nazis that actually Hyle Hitler, the interim vice president, actually Hyle's Hitler.
[2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:46.740]  You can pull it up.
[2:10:46.740 --> 2:10:47.740]  Now think about Soros.
[2:10:47.740 --> 2:10:52.220]  He went on for Izarkaria and said, yes, I am behind overthrowing Ukraine.
[2:10:52.220 --> 2:10:53.220]  I did good job.
[2:10:53.220 --> 2:10:55.580]  I got the $5 billion State Department money.
[2:10:55.580 --> 2:10:56.660]  I do it.
[2:10:56.660 --> 2:10:57.660]  I did it.
[2:10:57.660 --> 2:10:59.100]  Would you like me to pull the clip up?
[2:10:59.100 --> 2:11:04.260]  When I helped the Nazis round up people, it was the best time of my life, happy making
[2:11:04.260 --> 2:11:05.260]  time.
[2:11:05.260 --> 2:11:06.580]  I feel nothing bad about it.
[2:11:06.580 --> 2:11:08.460]  After all, it's like markets.
[2:11:08.460 --> 2:11:10.460]  If I'm not good, someone else do it.
[2:11:10.460 --> 2:11:11.460]  I mean, these are real quotes.
[2:11:11.460 --> 2:11:19.860]  So I could talk for five hours just about the history of Crimea, the history of Russia,
[2:11:19.860 --> 2:11:25.140]  the history of Ukraine, just because I've studied World War II, World War I, and basic
[2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:26.140]  history.
[2:11:26.140 --> 2:11:30.300]  Now, if I was Ukrainian or Russian, they'd say, let us really tell you.
[2:11:30.300 --> 2:11:33.660]  And they've got two different perspectives.
[2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:40.140]  And there's no doubt that Stalin did a lot of brutal stuff to the people in Ukraine and
[2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:42.660]  that they use it as a bread basket.
[2:11:42.660 --> 2:11:46.900]  There's no doubt that the Soviets looted the hell out of their own people and their neighbors.
[2:11:46.900 --> 2:11:52.060]  And famously, Russian surf said, you know, the Tsars took everything, but at least left
[2:11:52.060 --> 2:11:54.540]  us with our lives.
[2:11:54.540 --> 2:12:01.180]  Stalin kills us.
[2:12:01.180 --> 2:12:05.780]  But then again, at recent millions, the slave camps and killed millions, there were only
[2:12:05.780 --> 2:12:07.340]  folks left that would go along with it.
[2:12:07.340 --> 2:12:10.060]  They kind of had their own social score, their own social credit score.
[2:12:10.060 --> 2:12:11.060]  Do what you're told or you're dead.
[2:12:11.060 --> 2:12:15.340]  So there's beefs on both sides, but make no mistake.
[2:12:15.340 --> 2:12:21.980]  Western Ukraine is more allied with Europe, Western Europe, and the Catholic Church, Eastern
[2:12:21.980 --> 2:12:24.580]  Ukraine is Orthodox.
[2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:26.660]  And if you're a radio listener, I'll try to describe this.
[2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:29.780]  For team of viewers, you can see it bigger than Dallas.
[2:12:29.780 --> 2:12:40.860]  There is a world map blown up to show Crimea that is a peninsula of Ukraine, but also a
[2:12:40.860 --> 2:12:46.940]  peninsula of Russia with only a tiny little waterway open, kind of like an inter-coastal
[2:12:46.940 --> 2:12:54.260]  canal in Galveston, where the Russians have built a bridge.
[2:12:54.260 --> 2:13:01.980]  Now, Crimea is where you have the Genesis story of the Russian Empire and the Tsars
[2:13:01.980 --> 2:13:05.980]  and all of it beginning more than 500 years ago.
[2:13:05.980 --> 2:13:10.060]  And Russia has fought more than you can debate what's a war, what's not a war, but dozens
[2:13:10.060 --> 2:13:17.260]  of major conflicts and wars over Crimea because it's such good farmland that it's where Russia
[2:13:17.260 --> 2:13:18.260]  began.
[2:13:18.260 --> 2:13:19.260]  So it's part of Russia.
[2:13:19.260 --> 2:13:20.260]  It's incontrovertible.
[2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:21.260]  There's no debating it.
[2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:25.180]  It's an absolute fact.
[2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:31.980]  And you've got Russia proper only a less than a mile away from Crimea, and Crimea is where
[2:13:31.980 --> 2:13:36.340]  they have their big gas lines coming out of Russia and coming out of Ukraine and then
[2:13:36.340 --> 2:13:37.340]  going to Europe.
[2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:40.500]  And it's the port that they have in that major sea.
[2:13:40.500 --> 2:13:46.260]  And then you've got this major bay that is where the Russian Navy stays out from the
[2:13:46.260 --> 2:13:58.300]  weather, you park your ships in a protected bay, and that's the Sea of A-Z-O-V.
[2:13:58.300 --> 2:14:03.100]  So you've got the Black Sea and then you've got the smaller sea where they keep their
[2:14:03.100 --> 2:14:08.100]  ships and they keep their main Navy for the Black Sea.
[2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:14.340]  So imagine that's basically like their naval pentagon on the Black Sea to project power
[2:14:14.340 --> 2:14:20.460]  into Georgia and Romania and Bulgaria and all these other areas, and the Islamists
[2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:23.140]  are all trying to invade through there.
[2:14:23.140 --> 2:14:28.260]  And so there's 100-year-old treaties and there's 15-year-old treaties from 2003 that say when
[2:14:28.260 --> 2:14:36.660]  you come through that Strait, the K-E-R-C-H Strait, when you come into Russian-controlled
[2:14:36.660 --> 2:14:43.540]  waters for 500-plus years, you have to call ahead, say who you are, what your vessel,
[2:14:43.540 --> 2:14:47.500]  your tonnage, what you're carrying, then a pilot boat from their coast guard, just
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:51.620]  like we do here, just like England does and just like South Africa does and just like
[2:14:51.620 --> 2:14:58.100]  China does, comes out and tells you, go on this bearing and follow me.
[2:14:58.100 --> 2:15:00.580]  And sometimes they might want to search your cargo, you know, if you're coming in from
[2:15:00.580 --> 2:15:06.380]  North Korea or maybe Iran, maybe something suspicious, maybe they're going to say, we're
[2:15:06.380 --> 2:15:11.940]  boarding you on the other coast guard, I've been boarded before when we were out in New
[2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:16.900]  York City back in like 2005, out on some guy's yacht, a listener brought us out there and
[2:15:16.900 --> 2:15:20.260]  then we were driving around the Statue of Liberty at night and pulled the coast guard
[2:15:20.260 --> 2:15:23.180]  with their machine guns and they said, we're going to look at you, they kind of checked,
[2:15:23.180 --> 2:15:27.620]  said okay, have a nice night, don't drink too much, imagine if they pulled up and said
[2:15:27.620 --> 2:15:32.620]  stop and went, no, and said screw you, well they would and then we didn't stop, they'd
[2:15:32.620 --> 2:15:37.940]  ram us and board us, that didn't work, they'd shoot our rudder off, it's standard procedure.
[2:15:37.940 --> 2:15:42.820]  That's what happened yesterday and now martial law has been declared, they're suspending
[2:15:42.820 --> 2:15:48.620]  the election and NATO is talking about a full blown war with Russia off of this ridiculous
[2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:53.060]  made up provocation when they tried to sail their attack ships in to the middle of the
[2:15:53.060 --> 2:15:55.420]  Russian harbor and more.

[2:16:55.180 --> 2:16:58.780]  In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook

[2:18:56.140 --> 2:19:01.940]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[2:19:01.940 --> 2:19:05.340]  Obviously water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing, and I've had water filtration
[2:19:05.340 --> 2:19:09.620]  sponsors since the day I got on air, and over the years I learned a lot about water
[2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:10.620]  filtration.
[2:19:10.620 --> 2:19:11.620]  I learned what the best was.
[2:19:11.620 --> 2:19:15.700]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the
[2:19:15.700 --> 2:19:16.940]  most gallons an hour.
[2:19:16.940 --> 2:19:17.940]  It's amazing.
[2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:20.260]  That's how all the bad stuff leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:24.980]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters
[2:19:24.980 --> 2:19:27.020]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[2:19:27.020 --> 2:19:28.740]  He has a glut of them.
[2:19:28.740 --> 2:19:31.860]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:35.860]  When it's discounted using $200, it's $127.
[2:19:35.860 --> 2:19:41.220]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $27 bucks on them.
[2:19:41.220 --> 2:19:43.460]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[2:19:43.460 --> 2:19:45.700]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[2:19:45.700 --> 2:19:46.700]  It's amazing.
[2:19:46.700 --> 2:19:59.020]  Alexa Pure Pro at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or call AAA-253-3139.
[2:19:59.020 --> 2:20:18.420]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:18.420 --> 2:20:30.260]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:30.260 --> 2:20:35.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing a massive crisis unfold in Ukraine.
[2:20:35.540 --> 2:20:40.980]  Yesterday, attack boats with heavily armed men with rocket launchers and heavy machine
[2:20:40.980 --> 2:20:51.460]  guns went into the control port area controlled by Russia for more than 500 years in a major
[2:20:51.460 --> 2:20:54.780]  provocation.
[2:20:54.780 --> 2:21:00.340]  Here is some footage of that unfolding when the Russian Coast Guard rams one of the boats
[2:21:00.340 --> 2:21:17.700]  that came into the controlled port without authorization.
[2:21:17.700 --> 2:21:42.700]  And there's footage of at least three boats with heavily armed that came in to the admitted
[2:21:42.700 --> 2:21:50.180]  Russian control waters, they have multiple treaties that you have to have authorization
[2:21:50.180 --> 2:21:51.180]  to come in.
[2:21:51.180 --> 2:21:55.340]  If you did this to a military port in the U.S., there's a good chance you'd get actually
[2:21:55.340 --> 2:22:03.500]  attacked with a phalanx minigun or that you'd actually have your hull fired upon.
[2:22:03.500 --> 2:22:06.060]  But the Russians did ram that ship.
[2:22:06.060 --> 2:22:11.020]  They did shoot the rudder off several others because they wouldn't stop moving in towards
[2:22:11.020 --> 2:22:14.300]  the bridge that the Ukrainian government has said they're going to blow up.
[2:22:14.300 --> 2:22:23.580]  But now, the big news is here that the leader of the Ukrainian government has declared martial
[2:22:23.580 --> 2:22:27.940]  law and says he may suspend the election.
[2:22:27.940 --> 2:22:32.940]  That is the huge takeaway.
[2:22:32.940 --> 2:22:38.420]  So there's the image of attack helicopters flying around, fighter jets, and our own
[2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:44.260]  media Fox News CNN is the Russians for no reason out of international waters in the
[2:22:44.260 --> 2:22:47.860]  Black Sea attacked some ships for no reason.
[2:22:47.860 --> 2:22:49.140]  No one knows why.
[2:22:49.140 --> 2:22:55.780]  Why the ships always just go through that church straight out of the Black Sea in the
[2:22:55.780 --> 2:22:58.820]  Russian port and we have no idea where the Russians did this.
[2:22:58.820 --> 2:23:03.900]  Meanwhile, the Russians had to put a oil tanker cargo ship in front of the opening to protect
[2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:08.820]  the bridge because you had more attack boats coming up towards the bridge, which the president
[2:23:08.820 --> 2:23:15.700]  of Ukraine has said he intends to blow up because the Russians have always controlled
[2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:19.980]  Crimea, which is a peninsula of Ukraine is where Russia started.
[2:23:19.980 --> 2:23:26.740]  Russia is right by that and has always had control of Crimea before Ukraine existed.
[2:23:26.740 --> 2:23:27.940]  This is a fact.
[2:23:27.940 --> 2:23:28.940]  This is in the history books.
[2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:30.180]  This is in the encyclopedia.
[2:23:30.180 --> 2:23:34.300]  But if you point this out, you're a Russian agent.
[2:23:34.300 --> 2:23:41.300]  You know, if the Russians came over to Western Ukraine and say attacked Odessa, which has
[2:23:41.300 --> 2:23:44.820]  never been Russian control, then I'd say that's wrong.
[2:23:44.820 --> 2:23:45.980]  They didn't.
[2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:47.420]  It's their port.
[2:23:47.420 --> 2:23:50.500]  It's their area.
[2:23:50.500 --> 2:23:53.740]  And then here comes these boats who refuse to talk on the radio.
[2:23:53.740 --> 2:23:58.300]  By the way, this reportedly went on for an hour, went up to 10 boats, only what four of
[2:23:58.300 --> 2:24:01.740]  them got got taken and 20 something sailors.
[2:24:01.740 --> 2:24:09.660]  And here come Ukrainian commandos following their orders to come up, to not talk, to come
[2:24:09.660 --> 2:24:13.380]  towards the bridge and then have the Russians freak out for an hour because they wouldn't
[2:24:13.380 --> 2:24:16.980]  respond until they got the order, ram them and board them.
[2:24:16.980 --> 2:24:18.420]  Let me tell you something.
[2:24:18.420 --> 2:24:19.860]  You do that with a Coast Guard.
[2:24:19.860 --> 2:24:24.980]  You'd be boarded in three minutes flat by the time they got up.
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:28.260]  They would start shooting your router out from 500 yards away.
[2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:30.460]  They would never come up close like the Russians did.
[2:24:30.460 --> 2:24:33.580]  This is extremely restrained by the Russians.
[2:24:33.580 --> 2:24:36.580]  You pull that with a Coast Guard, your rudder's getting blown off.
[2:24:36.580 --> 2:24:40.300]  You know the Coast Guard's blowing ships up every day, right?
[2:24:40.300 --> 2:24:43.180]  Drug runners, you name it?
[2:24:43.180 --> 2:24:46.060]  I mean, you pull up to British waters like that.
[2:24:46.060 --> 2:24:50.700]  They're not even going to shoot your rudder.
[2:24:50.700 --> 2:24:54.060]  So this is going to start a new war.
[2:24:54.060 --> 2:24:58.340]  You've got the footage of the fighter jets and the helicopters and all the rest of it.
[2:24:58.340 --> 2:24:59.340]  Look at that arm boat.
[2:24:59.340 --> 2:25:03.380]  It's got like your M-60 machine gun right there, M-60 style machine guns, three of them
[2:25:03.380 --> 2:25:04.380]  right there.
[2:25:04.380 --> 2:25:05.380]  Back that up.
[2:25:05.380 --> 2:25:06.380]  I'll show you.
[2:25:06.380 --> 2:25:10.140]  And imagine when they pull up to these boats, the men all get inside.
[2:25:10.140 --> 2:25:14.420]  They're ordered, go out there, drive under the bridge, refuse to answer them, and when
[2:25:14.420 --> 2:25:16.380]  they come, hide inside.
[2:25:16.380 --> 2:25:18.620]  Now the Russians have no idea what's going on.
[2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:22.660]  That's why the US Coast Guard would have shot the rudders off, which they did do in three
[2:25:22.660 --> 2:25:24.100]  ships and not rammed them.
[2:25:24.100 --> 2:25:28.060]  They wouldn't even see that many gun on the front of that Russian boat, though.
[2:25:28.060 --> 2:25:32.820]  You see, that's exactly what our boats have got of that size in major harbors.
[2:25:32.820 --> 2:25:39.900]  They would have sunk that ship in many cases in the United States.
[2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:43.860]  They'd shoot the rudder off and if people didn't come out, why endanger a boarding
[2:25:43.860 --> 2:25:44.860]  party?
[2:25:44.860 --> 2:25:50.460]  Sink the ship and then that's what they do.
[2:25:50.460 --> 2:25:54.100]  Once you warn them, then you shoot the rudder off.
[2:25:54.100 --> 2:25:58.540]  If people don't come out with their hands up after about five minutes, they then aim
[2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:02.820]  at the water line, at the back of the boat, at the front of the boat, as to not kill people,
[2:26:02.820 --> 2:26:05.820]  but to put a hole in it and you start sinking the boat.
[2:26:05.820 --> 2:26:07.620]  And usually people come out at that point.
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:11.260]  If they don't come out at that point, you then start shooting more holes in the boat
[2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:12.420]  and you sink it.
[2:26:12.420 --> 2:26:20.380]  That's standard naval procedure for, again, about 500 years worldwide.
[2:26:20.380 --> 2:26:24.260]  You've been on a cruise ship, you pull up anywhere in the world, out come the harbor
[2:26:24.260 --> 2:26:29.660]  boats, out comes the harbor control because there are ships coming in from the whole world.
[2:26:29.660 --> 2:26:32.660]  There could be weapons, there could be smugglers, there could be drugs, there could be kidnapped
[2:26:32.660 --> 2:26:35.260]  kids, there could be bio weapons, you don't know.
[2:26:35.260 --> 2:26:39.100]  And so you pull up, you say who you are and they may decide to board you.
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:41.060]  It's a border.
[2:26:41.060 --> 2:26:50.180]  So Ukraine sends a bunch of attack boats into the harbor at the main Russian naval base
[2:26:50.180 --> 2:26:56.620]  where the Ukrainian president's been threatening to blow it up and then the people hide inside
[2:26:56.620 --> 2:27:01.220]  because they know the Russians are going to start shooting.
[2:27:01.220 --> 2:27:06.500]  And that's exactly what they got.
[2:27:06.500 --> 2:27:11.420]  And now they want to start a wider war and ship more weapons in and quote, take back
[2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:16.540]  areas of Ukraine taken by the Russians when it's George Soros and the globalist on record.
[2:27:16.540 --> 2:27:21.380]  George Soros is on CNN saying he did it overthrowing an elected government.
[2:27:21.380 --> 2:27:24.420]  The country goes into civil war.
[2:27:24.420 --> 2:27:30.580]  Joe Biden's son is out of college given control of the Ukrainian gas company makes hundreds
[2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:33.660]  of millions of dollars a year off of it himself.
[2:27:33.660 --> 2:27:39.940]  And they start seizing Russian facilities in Crimea.
[2:27:39.940 --> 2:27:44.500]  And so the Russian military went in and wiped them out.
[2:27:44.500 --> 2:27:48.540]  And there's an ongoing war with 30, 40,000 dead.
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:51.060]  You hear on the news, 10,000, it's way more than that.
[2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:56.860]  There's little green men, Russians all over the eastern part of the country now.
[2:27:56.860 --> 2:27:58.620]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[2:27:58.620 --> 2:28:01.740]  And there's U.S. advisors and U.S. military now there.
[2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:07.540]  And we're on Russia's doorstep where Russia was started starting a war with the globalist
[2:28:07.540 --> 2:28:12.020]  running our country that wanted to destroy our country and the EU's licking its lips
[2:28:12.020 --> 2:28:17.780]  to loot Ukraine, implode Ukraine, cut Russia's main export of gas off, which is an act of
[2:28:17.780 --> 2:28:19.660]  war.
[2:28:19.660 --> 2:28:24.980]  What would we do if four, well, it was actually 10, but the Russians only grabbed four.
[2:28:24.980 --> 2:28:30.900]  If 10 Mexican patrol boats with machine guns and rocket launchers pulled into Galveston
[2:28:30.900 --> 2:28:35.700]  Harbor and started driving towards the naval base there, what do you think the Coast Guard
[2:28:35.700 --> 2:28:40.860]  would do as they drove in for 20 minutes from the 12-mile marker saying nothing and
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:42.300]  not responding?
[2:28:42.300 --> 2:28:45.260]  Exactly what the Russians did.
[2:28:45.260 --> 2:28:47.300]  The Mexicans would do the same thing to us.
[2:28:47.300 --> 2:28:49.060]  It's standard procedure.
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:55.260]  But they think you're all stupid and they're trying to start a new World War.
[2:28:55.260 --> 2:29:00.660]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[2:29:00.660 --> 2:29:01.660]  the world.
[2:29:01.660 --> 2:29:04.660]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[2:29:04.660 --> 2:29:10.620]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[2:29:10.620 --> 2:29:14.380]  In its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[2:29:14.380 --> 2:29:15.380]  Was there ever a vote?
[2:29:15.380 --> 2:29:16.940]  Who do we fight for?
[2:29:16.940 --> 2:29:23.500]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[2:29:23.500 --> 2:29:25.380]  at Amazon Books.
[2:29:25.380 --> 2:29:29.500]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the

[2:33:00.100 --> 2:33:19.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:19.380 --> 2:33:33.060]  You know, here's an example of how I'm covering news, reading foreign news, U.S. news, you
[2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:34.060]  name it.
[2:33:34.060 --> 2:33:38.620]  The media is reporting that there was a standoff for over an hour when up to 10 different boats
[2:33:38.620 --> 2:33:43.460]  tried to go through a waterway out of the Black Sea into a Russian-controlled port
[2:33:43.460 --> 2:33:52.260]  under treating that, again, borders Russia proper, and then the crew pointed out that
[2:33:52.260 --> 2:34:00.260]  actually it's reported that the standoffs began 15 hours before, so there were standoffs
[2:34:00.260 --> 2:34:07.940]  like an hour apiece with some of the ships, but the whole fiasco started 15 hours.
[2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:11.940]  And again, what is this smoke screening for?
[2:34:11.940 --> 2:34:16.140]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, BBC Sky News.
[2:34:16.140 --> 2:34:19.300]  This is getting almost no coverage in the world.
[2:34:19.300 --> 2:34:23.420]  I didn't even know about it until earlier it was pointed out.
[2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:26.860]  Syria gas attack sparks Russian strikes.
[2:34:26.860 --> 2:34:30.820]  The rebels have been caught repeatedly launching chemical attacks and then trying to blame
[2:34:30.820 --> 2:34:33.940]  it on the Syrian government.
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:37.380]  Well, now it's happened again and the Russians have struck it.
[2:34:37.380 --> 2:34:40.580]  You'd think you'd hear about a gas attack, but because the rebels are clearly the ones
[2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:44.540]  behind it, no coverage here in the U.S.
[2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:46.580]  Russians carried out airstrikes against Syrian rebels.
[2:34:46.580 --> 2:34:50.740]  It accuses of launching a chemical attack on the government-held city of Aleppo.
[2:34:50.740 --> 2:34:54.980]  Both Syria and its Russian allies say shells carrying toxic gas injured about 100 people
[2:34:54.980 --> 2:34:56.860]  late on Saturday.
[2:34:56.860 --> 2:35:02.380]  State media showed images of Aleppo residents being treated in hospital after they struggled
[2:35:02.380 --> 2:35:03.380]  to breathe.
[2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:08.380]  We'll go watch those videos because in the past the rebels have done real attacks on
[2:35:08.380 --> 2:35:13.020]  themselves, but also on areas they hold, but also they've staged them.
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:17.300]  So who knows, this whole thing is a circus, but is this latest attack obviously so they
[2:35:17.300 --> 2:35:22.540]  can suspend the elections coming up and so they could declare martial law in Ukraine,
[2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:27.940]  which has now happened, is it also to cover up this big story, more than 100 hurt in suspected
[2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:33.940]  chemical attack on Aleppo, but almost no coverage here in the United States.
[2:35:33.940 --> 2:35:39.140]  The reason this is so important is George Soros is funding U.S. anti-farm, and George
[2:35:39.140 --> 2:35:44.900]  Soros helped overthrow the Soviet Union, you can say that's a good thing, but he's kind
[2:35:44.900 --> 2:35:50.340]  of the leftist intelligence operative, kind of the figurehead of all this, but when you
[2:35:50.340 --> 2:35:55.340]  overthrow the elected government of Ukraine and when he's promoting basically communism
[2:35:55.340 --> 2:36:03.300]  here in America, that's not a good thing, and it now threatens a wider, larger war.
[2:36:03.300 --> 2:36:13.460]  And remember, I got sued by the University of Georgetown, which is owned by the Catholic
[2:36:13.460 --> 2:36:20.620]  Church, the Vatican sued me, and falsely claimed that I said some individual, let him really
[2:36:20.620 --> 2:36:26.460]  know who he was until he sued me, saying that I said he killed the girl that got run over,
[2:36:26.460 --> 2:36:30.820]  no, the guy that ran her over killed her.
[2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:34.380]  We were pointing out that anti-fuzz funded by the Soros group on record, that's been
[2:36:34.380 --> 2:36:41.580]  in court, the documents are public, that the police stood down, and that the neo-Nazi group,
[2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:47.340]  all three leaders, a year before had been Democrats working for Obama, Hillary, one
[2:36:47.340 --> 2:36:51.700]  of them's dad, high-level government, leftist, open borders group.
[2:36:51.700 --> 2:36:57.340]  Now suddenly, these guys that basically look like the college drama club dressed up in
[2:36:57.340 --> 2:37:02.860]  1930s Nazi outfits are walking around with torches.
[2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:10.060]  Now that's not the same Nazi quote, alt-right, as Hillary calls them, from Charlottesville,
[2:37:10.060 --> 2:37:14.780]  that's Ukraine, that's the group five years ago that overthrew the government, shooting
[2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:19.020]  police and others, actually Hal Hitler, and it turns out, it's been confirmed, that it's
[2:37:19.020 --> 2:37:24.860]  funded by the very same leftist groups, isn't that funny?
[2:37:24.860 --> 2:37:31.580]  So see, we hit a little too close to home, and we pointed out that Soros is caught funding
[2:37:31.580 --> 2:37:39.180]  these groups, hell, he'd set it on Freezarkaria, on CNN, so it wasn't caught, he said it.
[2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:45.020]  And now it's coming out in all sorts of foreign newspapers, you name it, that there were Western
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:49.780]  white supremacists, craned by the same leftist groups over here, who were then sent over
[2:37:49.780 --> 2:37:52.700]  to Ukraine.
[2:37:52.700 --> 2:37:57.260]  So see, all we said was, man, it's crazy how you get a bunch of anti-fun, a bunch of leftist
[2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:01.180]  all mad, you get them out there, you bring the white supremacists, when clear evidence
[2:38:01.180 --> 2:38:09.580]  shows it's actually a cutout group, to then project on to Trump and the American people.
[2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:14.060]  And then, the police make everybody march into a big group, there's a melee, a guy gets
[2:38:14.060 --> 2:38:17.860]  scared, drives his car into a woman, she dies, and then all conservatives are blamed to be
[2:38:17.860 --> 2:38:25.220]  Nazis and for killing the girl, and then I get sued, saying that I'm saying this specific
[2:38:25.220 --> 2:38:29.820]  guy killed a woman, I never said that, I never even thought that till I got sued and it said
[2:38:29.820 --> 2:38:30.820]  that.
[2:38:30.820 --> 2:38:39.300]  But see, being sued now is, makes you guilty, you're no longer innocent until proven guilty.
[2:38:39.300 --> 2:38:46.380]  Work your mind around that, not saying a camera guy killed a woman.
[2:38:46.380 --> 2:38:50.740]  We did point out he worked for the State Department and for Hillary, and it was a bunch of leftists
[2:38:50.740 --> 2:38:57.660]  out there, covering the melee, obviously so that if there was violence, it could be used
[2:38:57.660 --> 2:39:02.740]  to trigger a demonization of the right in general, which is what the left admitted they
[2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:04.620]  wanted out of Charlottesville.
[2:39:04.620 --> 2:39:13.900]  So here it is, it's out of consortium, news, US funded neo-Nazis in Ukraine, mentor at
[2:39:13.900 --> 2:39:20.380]  the US white supremacist, and that's the neo-Nazis from Ukraine funded by Soros on record.
[2:39:20.380 --> 2:39:25.100]  Short-sighted US foreign policy that backs to Charlottesville Middle East, and neo-Nazis
[2:39:25.100 --> 2:39:30.860]  Ukraine is once again blowing back on the United States, Max Blumenthal explains, just
[2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:33.780]  try to get him on the show.
[2:39:33.780 --> 2:39:38.700]  And this is what we're saying, is that radical groups are getting funded by Soros, and if
[2:39:38.700 --> 2:39:45.820]  you look at the three leaders of the white supremacist, neo-alt-right, whatever they are,
[2:39:45.820 --> 2:39:53.940]  that when you look at these people, we've had them on the show, and I'm like, a year
[2:39:53.940 --> 2:39:57.620]  ago, before all this, you worked for Obama, you worked for Hillary.
[2:39:57.620 --> 2:40:03.420]  Well, yes, but I've changed my mind now, Alex.
[2:40:03.420 --> 2:40:10.060]  It's the oldest trick in the book, and then you create a climate, they have the people
[2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:15.900]  clash, and out of that, you get the national crisis, and now it's started to come out in
[2:40:15.900 --> 2:40:21.500]  lawsuits, it's coming out in court cases, it's coming out in federal filings, and this
[2:40:21.500 --> 2:40:26.660]  is incredible, and that doesn't mean every leftist or every photographer, every group
[2:40:26.660 --> 2:40:27.980]  out there is involved.
[2:40:27.980 --> 2:40:33.060]  The media has a spectacle, you've got a right-wing racist group led by the globalist, you've
[2:40:33.060 --> 2:40:37.820]  got the left-wing anti-footled by them, we've got documents where they talk about staging
[2:40:37.820 --> 2:40:42.740]  provocations and staging events, that's what they do, and then everybody else shows up
[2:40:42.740 --> 2:40:46.860]  from the left and right, there's a big melee, an innocent woman gets killed, and Soros is
[2:40:46.860 --> 2:40:50.060]  to blame, and the globalists are to blame for creating the climate, it's like you have
[2:40:50.060 --> 2:40:54.580]  a chemistry set, you put two things together, you know we're going to explode.
[2:40:54.580 --> 2:40:59.060]  The chemicals themselves aren't conscious or guilty, they were just induced to be there,
[2:40:59.060 --> 2:41:03.860]  to be put together for there to be an explosion, how do you change the subject from that, and
[2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:09.740]  George Soros funding Antifa, well he just files a lawsuit to change the subject, that's
[2:41:09.740 --> 2:41:16.100]  what they do, and it's another provocation, ladies and gentlemen, to take us off the air
[2:41:16.100 --> 2:41:19.900]  by misrepresenting who we are and what we stand for and what we do, now I want to get
[2:41:19.900 --> 2:41:24.820]  into the Chinese social score and how deep the rabbit hole goes on that when we come
[2:41:24.820 --> 2:41:31.700]  back from break, but I do want to just tell listeners here that all the specials you saw
[2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:38.820]  last week with Black Friday specials have been extended for at least another two days

[2:42:41.580 --> 2:42:44.980]  an at cost from them because they need to move it out for inventory into the year but

[2:43:51.540 --> 2:43:55.020]  Everybody needs to try Alpha Power today.
[2:43:55.020 --> 2:43:59.060]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[2:43:59.060 --> 2:44:04.300]  from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[2:44:04.300 --> 2:44:09.380]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[2:44:09.380 --> 2:44:14.100]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[2:44:14.100 --> 2:44:18.220]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[2:44:18.220 --> 2:44:22.820]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[2:44:22.820 --> 2:44:26.180]  nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[2:44:26.180 --> 2:44:31.380]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[2:44:31.380 --> 2:44:36.100]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[2:44:36.100 --> 2:44:41.100]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:47.660]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:50.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[2:44:50.740 --> 2:44:56.420]  discovery, X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[2:44:56.420 --> 2:45:03.860]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[2:45:03.860 --> 2:45:09.780]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double-patriot points, up to 50% off on
[2:45:09.780 --> 2:45:13.620]  storeable food, super high quality, that is huge.

[2:45:28.660 --> 2:45:32.340]  getting to get rid of inventory, so take advantage of that, it's an amazing system.
[2:45:32.340 --> 2:45:36.060]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars, they're trying to defund us, so I said everything
[2:45:36.060 --> 2:45:40.620]  must go by the end of the year, so that we're at least have the cash to continue operating
[2:45:40.620 --> 2:45:41.620]  for a while.
[2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:48.700]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple-A2533139, support the InfoWars, get great products,
[2:45:48.700 --> 2:45:53.260]  get your Christmas shopping done early, and battle the globalists, a total 360 win.
[2:45:53.260 --> 2:45:56.060]  InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:45:56.060 --> 2:46:00.700]  Please, whatever you do realize, we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship, and
[2:46:00.700 --> 2:46:04.820]  you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes some of them are like little
[2:46:04.820 --> 2:46:08.820]  side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products,
[2:46:08.820 --> 2:46:13.460]  but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and
[2:46:13.460 --> 2:46:15.820]  be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[2:46:15.820 --> 2:46:19.340]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[2:46:19.340 --> 2:46:24.180]  and the world back from the brick, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[2:46:24.180 --> 2:46:27.060]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:32.860]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[2:46:32.860 --> 2:46:37.580]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way, I've committed
[2:46:37.580 --> 2:46:41.700]  to do that, I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've
[2:46:41.700 --> 2:46:47.220]  got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:51.700]  level, I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at
[2:46:51.700 --> 2:47:21.540]  InfoWars.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[2:47:22.700 --> 2:47:28.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:35.140]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:35.140 --> 2:47:40.900]  Now Paul Watson has put an extremely powerful piece together, really showing you the latest
[2:47:40.900 --> 2:47:45.140]  developments on the Communist Chinese, so-called social score that is really the mark of the
[2:47:45.140 --> 2:47:53.660]  beast, total tracking system that if you associate with Christians or Buddhists or gun owners,
[2:47:53.660 --> 2:47:57.700]  even in America, you will have your score lowered until you literally starve to death
[2:47:57.700 --> 2:47:58.900]  on the side of the road.
[2:47:58.900 --> 2:48:03.260]  But meanwhile, the fact that this is being brought in by Google and Facebook and others
[2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:09.300]  in America, we first broke this five years ago, next year's students today, that's a
[2:48:09.300 --> 2:48:14.980]  non-issue, it's all, did Facebook scrape some political data and use it?
[2:48:14.980 --> 2:48:18.620]  Their big crime is they were only 90% Democrat slaves.
[2:48:18.620 --> 2:48:21.420]  They let Republicans do some of the same stuff.
[2:48:21.420 --> 2:48:26.380]  Meanwhile, Google reveals plan to monitor our moods, our movements, and our children's
[2:48:26.380 --> 2:48:29.340]  behavior at home when you bring the Google Assistant in.
[2:48:29.340 --> 2:48:36.740]  And so is Amazon's Alexa, and so is Facebook's, precisely what I told you 20 years ago because
[2:48:36.740 --> 2:48:42.260]  I had NSA sources that they were already planning this, but that's not the issue we're told.
[2:48:42.260 --> 2:48:48.460]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's all what Zuckerberg's done because there's a hostile takeover by
[2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:49.940]  George Soros of Facebook.
[2:48:49.940 --> 2:48:53.500]  He's going to drive it down to nothing, then take control of it for a political weapon.
[2:48:53.500 --> 2:48:57.020]  That's why Trump must act now.
[2:48:57.020 --> 2:49:00.860]  Internal documents Facebook has fought to keep private obtained by the UK Parliament.
[2:49:00.860 --> 2:49:04.980]  Meanwhile, they're coming out with toilets that monitor everything you do and track how
[2:49:04.980 --> 2:49:07.980]  high-tech toilets could soon be tracking your every movement.
[2:49:07.980 --> 2:49:09.940]  Yahoo News, AP.
[2:49:09.940 --> 2:49:10.980]  That's not a big problem.
[2:49:10.980 --> 2:49:12.700]  It's only Facebook did something.
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:13.700]  One tent is bad.
[2:49:13.700 --> 2:49:17.300]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[2:49:17.300 --> 2:49:20.660]  Nobody does authoritarianism quite like China.
[2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:26.020]  By 2020, every citizen will have a social credit score that will go up and down based
[2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:28.060]  on their personal behavior.
[2:49:28.060 --> 2:49:31.660]  Behavior leading to a deduction in credit will include J-Walking.
[2:49:31.660 --> 2:49:45.340]  Driving, smoking on trains.
[2:49:45.340 --> 2:50:14.140]  Buying too many video games, buying too much junk food, buying too much alcohol, calling
[2:50:14.140 --> 2:50:19.460]  a friend who has a low credit score, merely having a friend online who has a low credit
[2:50:19.460 --> 2:50:26.780]  score, posting fake news online, criticizing the government, visiting unauthorized websites,
[2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:30.940]  walking a dog without a leash, letting your dog bark too much.
[2:50:30.940 --> 2:50:36.660]  At least in 1984, Winston Smith could take a train to temporarily escape the surveillance
[2:50:36.660 --> 2:50:38.380]  state that he labored under.
[2:50:38.380 --> 2:50:53.020]  In China, low-ranked citizens will be prevented from taking buses, planes, and trains.
[2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:58.300]  This man's not allowed to travel one inch, and he shows them the app.
[2:50:58.300 --> 2:51:05.660]  They use the app to smart phones to control you.
[2:51:05.660 --> 2:51:09.860]  In America, they're going to get us to opt-in by being trendy.
[2:51:09.860 --> 2:51:15.300]  They won't let you book a train.
[2:51:15.300 --> 2:51:18.540]  It's already here.
[2:51:18.540 --> 2:51:20.540]  Where have I seen that before?
[2:51:20.540 --> 2:51:23.060]  That's reserved for members of our prime flight program.
[2:51:23.060 --> 2:51:24.060]  You've got to be a 4.2 or over-qualified.
[2:51:24.060 --> 2:51:25.060]  Oh, I'm a 4.2.
[2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:26.060]  By the way, we broke all this before blackmail.
[2:51:26.060 --> 2:51:27.060]  I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.
[2:51:27.060 --> 2:51:28.060]  But blackmail is cool, though.
[2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:29.060]  We're not.
[2:51:29.060 --> 2:51:30.060]  We're just the platform being totally on target.
[2:51:30.060 --> 2:51:38.860]  I'm sorry, well, let me book it without the correct rankings.
[2:51:38.860 --> 2:51:45.140]  6.7 million Chinese people have already been prevented from buying air and train tickets,
[2:51:45.140 --> 2:51:47.900]  and the system hasn't even been properly rolled out yet.
[2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:52.660]  The punishments for citizens whose credit score sinks too low are limited only by the
[2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:53.660]  imagination.
[2:51:53.660 --> 2:51:59.100]  Renting a house, getting a loan, booking a hotel, filling up a car with petrol.
[2:51:59.100 --> 2:52:00.460]  All will be restricted.
[2:52:00.460 --> 2:52:02.220]  I can't buy property.
[2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:05.220]  My child can't go to private school, he says.
[2:52:05.220 --> 2:52:08.580]  You feel like you're being controlled by the list all the time.
[2:52:08.580 --> 2:52:15.460]  Good behavior will also be rewarded by green-channel benefits, free perks, discounted loans, fast-tracked
[2:52:15.460 --> 2:52:21.820]  visa university and job applications, VIP airport access, faster internet speeds.
[2:52:21.820 --> 2:52:27.020]  Dating websites are even offering users with high credit scores better visibility on Tinder-style
[2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:28.020]  apps.
[2:52:28.020 --> 2:52:32.700]  Oil informant will be well taken care of, and the entire system will be overseen by
[2:52:32.700 --> 2:52:39.020]  an estimated 400 million surveillance cameras with facial recognition software.
[2:52:39.020 --> 2:52:43.700]  Cameras record them going through intersections, zero in on their face, and then publicly
[2:52:43.700 --> 2:52:46.420]  shake their screens.
[2:52:46.420 --> 2:52:51.780]  And it will eventually encompass real-time geo-location tracking of citizens via their
[2:52:51.780 --> 2:52:52.780]  cell phone.
[2:52:52.780 --> 2:52:57.300]  Overall credit scores can go up and down in real-time based on a person's behavior.
[2:52:57.300 --> 2:53:01.020]  But it can also be affected by the people they associate with.
[2:53:01.020 --> 2:53:02.020]  Who starts?
[2:53:02.020 --> 2:53:03.020]  Two stars?
[2:53:03.020 --> 2:53:08.300]  Wasn't a meaningful encounter.
[2:53:08.300 --> 2:53:13.900]  Everyone is a little bit heightened and false because everyone is terrified of being marked
[2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:17.340]  down because the consequences of that are unpleasant.
[2:53:17.340 --> 2:53:20.060]  So it's basically the world we live in.
[2:53:20.060 --> 2:53:23.620]  And all this will eventually be unified in a centralized database.
[2:53:23.620 --> 2:53:28.480]  In the words of the Chinese government, if trust is broken in one place, restrictions
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:30.380]  are imposed everywhere.
[2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:36.020]  They literally say that those deemed untrustworthy will be, quote, unable to move even a single
[2:53:36.020 --> 2:53:38.020]  step.
[2:53:38.020 --> 2:53:50.180]  When you ask Chinese people about social credit, most of them say, it's great.
[2:53:50.180 --> 2:53:51.940]  Gee, I wonder why.
[2:53:51.940 --> 2:53:59.220]  I think it's a good thing, this woman said, it makes people more honest.
[2:53:59.220 --> 2:54:03.580]  Could it be because under that very same social credit system, they will be punished for
[2:54:03.580 --> 2:54:05.700]  criticizing the social credit system.
[2:54:05.700 --> 2:54:08.660]  But social credit isn't just about behaving yourself.
[2:54:08.660 --> 2:54:13.780]  It's about marshalling the behavior of others, the prisoners guarding the other prisoners.
[2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:18.980]  The Chinese government just doubled the reward for reporting the illegal publishing of pornography.
[2:54:18.980 --> 2:54:23.020]  I'm not going to work today, wrote one potential porn buster on Weibo.
[2:54:23.020 --> 2:54:27.700]  I'll look everywhere for materials so I can report anyone who I find disagreeable.
[2:54:27.700 --> 2:54:29.820]  There's money to be made in reporting.
[2:54:29.820 --> 2:54:32.620]  So what am I doing working myself to death?
[2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:36.780]  China already has a spy program to rival the East German Starzy.
[2:54:36.780 --> 2:54:44.300]  In one area of Beijing alone, Chaoyang, there are around 120,000 paid informants in operation.
[2:54:44.300 --> 2:54:49.740]  While social credit kicks into high gear, so many more thought criminals will be detected
[2:54:49.740 --> 2:54:55.820]  that all those Uighur Muslims in Chinese reeducation camps are going to have a lot more company.
[2:54:55.820 --> 2:55:02.660]  The Uighur minority is already forced to download an app that reports their entire browser.
[2:55:02.660 --> 2:55:06.340]  The full reports posted at the front page of info wars dot com will put that on screen
[2:55:06.340 --> 2:55:09.660]  so I can give you the actual title and it goes on for about three more minutes.
[2:55:09.660 --> 2:55:13.780]  It's very important because then he shows how it's being done here.
[2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:17.780]  And here it's going to be even more arbitrary with SJW is trained by Soros.
[2:55:17.780 --> 2:55:22.660]  This is Associated Press deciding what your score is.
[2:55:22.660 --> 2:55:25.580]  China's terrifying social credit system.
[2:55:25.580 --> 2:55:27.420]  Now it's already operating in the West.
[2:55:27.420 --> 2:55:31.460]  You can override the sensors, but we make it easy.
[2:55:31.460 --> 2:55:36.340]  News wars dot com has not been put in all the databases as banned and as evil.
[2:55:36.340 --> 2:55:41.460]  Most libraries, Boeing corporation, the Pentagon in full wars dot com is blocked.
[2:55:41.460 --> 2:55:45.340]  A lot of Trump's Twitter is blocked as well.
[2:55:45.340 --> 2:55:48.740]  There's traders in the government, but you can go to news wars dot com or this has been
[2:55:48.740 --> 2:55:52.460]  posted and share that URL and we're going to start creating more and more almost URLs
[2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:58.940]  of the week where you can share the content and not get the negative social score that
[2:55:58.940 --> 2:56:05.300]  is people blocking you demonizing you attacking you and get the information out.
[2:56:05.300 --> 2:56:07.460]  But there's no doubt where all this is going.
[2:56:07.460 --> 2:56:11.380]  It verifies everything we've said we've been dead on and that's why we have to be shut
[2:56:11.380 --> 2:56:14.740]  down because we've been proven to be so incredibly accurate.
[2:56:14.740 --> 2:56:16.340]  The Bible has been proven to be accurate.
[2:56:16.340 --> 2:56:17.340]  It's happening.
[2:56:17.340 --> 2:56:20.340]  So I want to thank the listeners for all their support, all their prayers and what you've
[2:56:20.340 --> 2:56:24.740]  done steadfastly to back info wars because I'm proud of what we've done.
[2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:29.020]  I'm not starting other websites and other things because I'm ashamed of info wars.
[2:56:29.020 --> 2:56:31.660]  It's still going to be the big mothership.
[2:56:31.660 --> 2:56:36.500]  We're doing this to give you tools for now to get around the system while we fight to
[2:56:36.500 --> 2:56:40.660]  have Congress and the president and others move against the real tyranny.
[2:56:40.660 --> 2:56:46.980]  The EU and the Democrats aren't going up against Facebook because it's tyrannical.
[2:56:46.980 --> 2:56:51.220]  It's because it's not tyrannical enough and they don't fully control it and it's a red
[2:56:51.220 --> 2:56:55.620]  herring distraction from all the real stuff that's going on that's 50 times worse.
[2:56:55.620 --> 2:56:56.780]  I'm no fan of Zuckerberg.
[2:56:56.780 --> 2:56:58.460]  I'm not defending him.
[2:56:58.460 --> 2:57:02.780]  Soros is trying to take it over right now and they're using some little flimsy thing
[2:57:02.780 --> 2:57:04.900]  as the excuse.
[2:57:04.900 --> 2:57:09.260]  Soros started paying a year ago to have people that work at Facebook leak them info so they
[2:57:09.260 --> 2:57:11.020]  could twist it and spin it.
[2:57:11.020 --> 2:57:15.140]  This is an example of what a monster he is and the consortium he represents, what monsters
[2:57:15.140 --> 2:57:16.140]  they are.
[2:57:16.140 --> 2:57:17.380]  We're going to go to break.
[2:57:17.380 --> 2:57:23.020]  We have a great guest host, Owen Benjamin, always informative, the band comedian.
[2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:28.340]  He will be hosting the fourth hour coming up and please don't forget, Cyber Monday means
[2:57:28.340 --> 2:57:32.860]  all of Black Friday specials last week, our biggest sale ever, is extended for just a
[2:57:32.860 --> 2:57:38.740]  few more days for the free shipping store live, 50% off all the supplements and other
[2:57:38.740 --> 2:57:42.620]  huge sales and double-patriot points and then FullWareStore.com.
[2:57:42.620 --> 2:57:43.620]  Please support us.
[2:57:43.620 --> 2:57:45.460]  You are our only hope.
[2:57:45.460 --> 2:57:51.260]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[2:57:51.260 --> 2:57:52.980]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[2:57:52.980 --> 2:57:57.580]  It's a good thing and I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on here and over
[2:57:57.580 --> 2:58:01.100]  the years I learned a lot about water filtration, I learned what the best was.
[2:58:01.100 --> 2:58:04.980]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the
[2:58:04.980 --> 2:58:06.220]  most gallons an hour.
[2:58:06.220 --> 2:58:07.220]  It's amazing.
[2:58:07.220 --> 2:58:09.500]  All the bad stuff leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[2:58:09.500 --> 2:58:14.700]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatreon.com apply that have developed these filters, ordered
[2:58:14.700 --> 2:58:16.340]  a huge amount of them this year.
[2:58:16.340 --> 2:58:18.060]  He has a glut of them.
[2:58:18.060 --> 2:58:21.060]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[2:58:21.060 --> 2:58:23.460]  When it's discounted, it's $200.
[2:58:23.460 --> 2:58:24.460]  It's $127.
[2:58:24.460 --> 2:58:30.540]  He's selling them to us at cost and we're making $20 something bucks on them.
[2:58:30.540 --> 2:58:32.780]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[2:58:32.780 --> 2:58:35.020]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:44.020]  It's amazing, Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:59:05.020 --> 2:59:11.260]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[2:59:11.260 --> 2:59:12.260]  You are the InfoWars.
[2:59:12.260 --> 2:59:17.300]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[2:59:17.300 --> 2:59:22.380]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[2:59:22.380 --> 2:59:28.260]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[2:59:28.260 --> 2:59:33.820]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[2:59:33.820 --> 2:59:36.220]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[2:59:36.220 --> 2:59:41.660]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward
[2:59:41.660 --> 2:59:43.300]  slash newsletter.
[2:59:43.300 --> 2:59:49.620]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[2:59:49.620 --> 3:00:19.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:19.460 --> 3:00:49.260]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[3:00:49.260 --> 3:01:04.580]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:01:04.580 --> 3:01:09.420]  Well a fellow thought criminal, one of the top national comics out there banned off every
[3:01:09.420 --> 3:01:13.780]  platform you can imagine, Owen Benjamin is going to be taken over after this quick break
[3:01:13.780 --> 3:01:16.900]  in about five minutes.
[3:01:16.900 --> 3:01:22.500]  And then of course the war rooms coming up three o'clock central with Owen Shroyer, Roger
[3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:28.860]  Stone and others sitting back here looking at these headlines and looking at how suddenly
[3:01:28.860 --> 3:01:33.420]  Facebook is the big evil group because of some of the spying and data mining they've
[3:01:33.420 --> 3:01:34.420]  done.
[3:01:34.420 --> 3:01:39.460]  And meanwhile, all these other groups Google and others are light years ahead of it and
[3:01:39.460 --> 3:01:44.060]  Amazon uses the Alexa in your house to listen and watch and track everything you're doing
[3:01:44.060 --> 3:01:50.740]  and now in federal cases with all these home assistants, the judges are ruling, yeah, give
[3:01:50.740 --> 3:01:56.300]  us your history and it's everything since you plugged it in even when it's off, recorded.
[3:01:56.300 --> 3:01:58.700]  They're using them in murder trials.
[3:01:58.700 --> 3:02:02.700]  It's beyond 1984, way beyond.
[3:02:02.700 --> 3:02:09.780]  And again, I first had NSA whistleblowers on 23 years ago and they laid everything out
[3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:13.220]  and that's why I was the bad guy, oh there's going to be a world government and a social
[3:02:13.220 --> 3:02:19.540]  score and everything you do being tracked and on and on and on and now it's all here and
[3:02:19.540 --> 3:02:23.940]  that's why I have to be blocked and taken off the air everywhere.
[3:02:23.940 --> 3:02:30.340]  Now speaking of censorship, I wanted to get to this before Owen Benjamin comes on.
[3:02:30.340 --> 3:02:35.060]  Iraq War Vet who called out social media censorship booted from Twitter.
[3:02:35.060 --> 3:02:37.460]  He's a talk show host in Houston ran for Congress.
[3:02:37.460 --> 3:02:39.260]  They won't even tell him why he's been booted.
[3:02:39.260 --> 3:02:43.620]  See the new thing is they don't even tell you why you're booted, with me they made up
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:49.340]  some stuff and now a feminist that said men are not women, she's been booted.
[3:02:49.340 --> 3:02:52.180]  If you say the sky's blue you'll be booted.
[3:02:52.180 --> 3:02:56.100]  Iraq War Vet who called out social media censorship booted from Twitter, here's a clip from Tucker
[3:02:56.100 --> 3:03:00.340]  Carlson before he got banned where he predicted it.
[3:03:00.340 --> 3:03:03.980]  So you wrote this piece that I thought was really compelling about Alex Jones and you
[3:03:03.980 --> 3:03:08.220]  said look I don't agree with Alex Jones' views but that's not the point.
[3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:12.300]  The point as you articulated was if you can silence this guy because you don't like what
[3:03:12.300 --> 3:03:16.140]  he says, why can't they silence you or me?
[3:03:16.140 --> 3:03:20.180]  That is the point Tucker and they're coming for you and me next.
[3:03:20.180 --> 3:03:25.360]  Alex Jones was the weak member of the herd because of his insane views on certain things.
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:28.980]  They knew they could pick him off and what he was was a test run.
[3:03:28.980 --> 3:03:33.580]  If we can pick off this nut job then maybe sooner or later we can come for the more
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:35.740]  mainstream voices on the right.
[3:03:35.740 --> 3:03:41.220]  This is not the social media, Facebook, Twitter, that's 2.5 billion people they reach.
[3:03:41.220 --> 3:03:44.860]  People have to understand it's no longer a couple of nerds sitting in a college dorm
[3:03:44.860 --> 3:03:46.940]  room swapping stories about a man.
[3:03:46.940 --> 3:03:47.940]  Let's stop right there.
[3:03:47.940 --> 3:03:51.100]  I want to get this guy on because I want to debate him.
[3:03:51.100 --> 3:03:53.460]  I want him to tell me what I said that was cookie and was wrong.
[3:03:53.460 --> 3:03:56.820]  He'll probably quote mainstream stuff like Mars bases.
[3:03:56.820 --> 3:03:58.460]  I never said that.
[3:03:58.460 --> 3:04:03.340]  But at least he said hey, the weak member of the herd dude, 6-7 billion views on YouTube,
[3:04:03.340 --> 3:04:05.260]  hundreds of radio stations, TV stations.
[3:04:05.260 --> 3:04:08.220]  See, he feels powerful, weak member of the herd.
[3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:16.140]  But it is true that they chose me to build a straw man weak member of the herd to then
[3:04:16.140 --> 3:04:21.580]  take me down so people wouldn't defend me and then once they didn't defend me they wouldn't
[3:04:21.580 --> 3:04:22.580]  defend the next person.
[3:04:22.580 --> 3:04:26.100]  And by the time they banned everybody else, everybody's sick of hearing it and we've accepted
[3:04:26.100 --> 3:04:27.100]  it.
[3:04:27.100 --> 3:04:28.100]  That's the plan.
[3:04:28.100 --> 3:04:31.540]  But I just love how people always had the proviso, oh I don't agree with him, he's a
[3:04:31.540 --> 3:04:33.580]  terrible nut job.
[3:04:33.580 --> 3:04:37.300]  You know when I criticize somebody I say what it was they said that was wrong.
[3:04:37.300 --> 3:04:39.300]  You see the difference?
[3:04:39.300 --> 3:04:42.500]  We'll be right back with Alan Benjamin.
[3:04:42.500 --> 3:04:54.900]  I'm Alan Schoen, newswars.com, infowars.com, spread those links.
[3:04:54.900 --> 3:05:00.780]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWars

[3:06:32.740 --> 3:06:33.740]  That's awesome.
[3:06:33.740 --> 3:06:34.740]  Hi everybody.
[3:06:34.740 --> 3:06:40.820]  My name's Owen Benjamin and I am guest hosting for the next 54ish minutes here on InfoWars
[3:06:40.820 --> 3:06:46.620]  and today the first thing I want to talk about is obviously the mainstream media's distortion,
[3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:53.220]  why they do it, what motivates them, specifically Jim Acosta I've had a slight obsession with
[3:06:53.220 --> 3:06:54.620]  lately.
[3:06:54.620 --> 3:07:01.060]  And so we shot a trailer for a movie that would be in Jim Acosta's head.
[3:07:01.060 --> 3:07:06.860]  I sent you guys the video, it's called, what's it called, The Warrior or something?
[3:07:06.860 --> 3:07:07.860]  Yeah.
[3:07:07.860 --> 3:07:10.180]  If you guys want to play this, it's pretty funny.
[3:07:10.180 --> 3:07:13.460]  It's called Reluctant Hero, The Jim Acosta Story.
[3:07:13.460 --> 3:07:22.260]  So let's watch this and then we'll talk about what goes on in these journalist heads.
[3:07:22.260 --> 3:07:23.580]  Jim Acosta.
[3:07:23.580 --> 3:07:29.660]  They say the pen is mightier than the sword.
[3:07:29.660 --> 3:07:35.020]  Just remember rookie, when everyone's tweeting in one direction, you tweet in that direction.
[3:07:35.020 --> 3:07:37.180]  So it's called trending, right?
[3:07:37.180 --> 3:07:38.180]  Yeah pal.
[3:07:38.180 --> 3:07:43.820]  It's called trending, all right?
[3:07:43.820 --> 3:07:47.860]  Only the mightiest of men can wield the pen.
[3:07:47.860 --> 3:07:51.660]  And that's when I realized that if there were no guns, there would be no crime.
[3:07:51.660 --> 3:07:53.140]  Hey baby, it's me again.
[3:07:53.140 --> 3:07:57.580]  Yeah, I know I haven't been around in a while and I've just been really busy, you know.
[3:07:57.580 --> 3:08:01.180]  I've been hanging out with the poppy brothers a ton and Aziz Ansari.
[3:08:01.180 --> 3:08:04.980]  I just want to let you know I miss you and you know, I was thinking about you.
[3:08:04.980 --> 3:08:12.340]  A true hero is not made in war or battle, but on the internet, with birds.
[3:08:12.340 --> 3:08:14.500]  Did you get that Salpy on something?
[3:08:14.500 --> 3:08:18.020]  Good morning Joe.
[3:08:18.020 --> 3:08:20.500]  Even the greatest warriors have a breaking point.
[3:08:20.500 --> 3:08:24.100]  All I ever wanted is to work for CNN.
[3:08:24.100 --> 3:08:25.500]  I'm one of the good guys.
[3:08:25.500 --> 3:08:27.860]  Can one man listen to a chant?
[3:08:27.860 --> 3:08:29.980]  Please call me back.
[3:08:29.980 --> 3:08:31.220]  That he sucks.
[3:08:31.220 --> 3:08:33.820]  I think the future of journalism.
[3:08:33.820 --> 3:08:41.180]  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know what journalism is.
[3:08:41.180 --> 3:08:49.060]  Or is that the breaking point of all men?
[3:08:49.060 --> 3:09:02.740]  All we ever wanted is to be a blogger or a panelist, just like our dad.
[3:09:02.740 --> 3:09:09.060]  All right, so that seems like an exaggeration, obviously it's comedic, but that really is
[3:09:09.060 --> 3:09:11.020]  how a lot of these guys see themselves.
[3:09:11.020 --> 3:09:17.060]  They see themselves as actual heroes when in fact they're cowards and they don't represent
[3:09:17.060 --> 3:09:19.660]  anything heroic at all.
[3:09:19.660 --> 3:09:21.500]  So why did they do this?
[3:09:21.500 --> 3:09:29.540]  I think that, I think there's been a massive long-term degradation of art and beauty in
[3:09:29.540 --> 3:09:36.300]  our culture to get to us, to get to the point where we can't identify what is good or bad.
[3:09:36.300 --> 3:09:40.540]  And I think that Jim Acosta and all these people are the wizards that do it.
[3:09:40.540 --> 3:09:45.900]  They reframe everything to move, okay, Caitlyn Jenner was woman of the year.
[3:09:45.900 --> 3:09:53.540]  Okay, so we have a 65, 67 year old guy that has mental issues, you know, which is like
[3:09:53.540 --> 3:10:03.020]  a screwed up face and just on hormones, just ran a woman off the road to her death.
[3:10:03.020 --> 3:10:08.700]  And so we take this distortion, it's almost like a Salvador Dali painting, and then we
[3:10:08.700 --> 3:10:12.380]  show it to everybody and say, this is the best woman.
[3:10:12.380 --> 3:10:17.220]  And so the people, granted a lot of us wouldn't get on board that, and that's why I'm not
[3:10:17.220 --> 3:10:25.020]  allowed to perform in comedy clubs anymore, but enough did that the controllers or whoever
[3:10:25.020 --> 3:10:31.340]  is at the top of responsible for all this felt a little better about themselves because
[3:10:31.340 --> 3:10:36.260]  they know that people are one step closer to believing and doing anything they're told.
[3:10:36.260 --> 3:10:40.620]  If you agree that Caitlyn Jenner is the woman of the year, you'll agree with anything.
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:44.740]  And these are those purity tests that came out in 1984, like say there's four lights
[3:10:44.740 --> 3:10:45.940]  when there's only three lights.
[3:10:45.940 --> 3:10:46.940]  All right.
[3:10:46.940 --> 3:10:49.420]  So how did they do this?
[3:10:49.420 --> 3:10:56.980]  Ask yourself, can you name one band that's awesome, that's came out after 2012?
[3:10:56.980 --> 3:10:57.980]  I can't.
[3:10:57.980 --> 3:11:03.900]  You can't name one, they're all DJs, they're all, they're just, they're regurgitating past
[3:11:03.900 --> 3:11:08.100]  art and making it worse and then throwing it out there for your consumption because
[3:11:08.100 --> 3:11:14.340]  the problem with beauty is beauty inspires, you know, heroism inspires, so you take Jim
[3:11:14.340 --> 3:11:23.780]  Acosta and you make him out to be this hero, a guy who just this, this, this deranged special
[3:11:23.780 --> 3:11:30.180]  boy that thinks he deserves all the questions and he, and he pushes lies just to get America
[3:11:30.180 --> 3:11:31.660]  into another war.
[3:11:31.660 --> 3:11:32.660]  Check this one out.
[3:11:32.660 --> 3:11:33.660]  All right.
[3:11:33.660 --> 3:11:34.660]  Here's another sketch we did.
[3:11:34.660 --> 3:11:35.660]  You guys want to play that sketch with the audio?
[3:11:35.660 --> 3:11:50.980]  Mr. President, will you come on, Russia, Mr. President, are you causing the hurricane?
[3:11:50.980 --> 3:12:00.300]  I'm not going anywhere, sir, until you respond about Stormy Daniels, Mr. President.
[3:12:00.300 --> 3:12:08.060]  It's like they're framing this guy whose questions are all proven lies as a hero, a free speech.
[3:12:08.060 --> 3:12:12.180]  Well, people like me, Alex Jones, there's another, someone else just got banned from
[3:12:12.180 --> 3:12:14.380]  Twitter that's ridiculous.
[3:12:14.380 --> 3:12:22.020]  They frame us to be these outlier, dangerous people when in fact we're simply doing what
[3:12:22.020 --> 3:12:23.020]  we want to do.
[3:12:23.020 --> 3:12:27.140]  We're free people thinking freely, speaking freely and trying to inspire ourselves, our
[3:12:27.140 --> 3:12:31.980]  family, people that listen to us, and that is actually the problem.
[3:12:31.980 --> 3:12:40.100]  It's not about saying something that's vulgar because you got Louis CK, you got all these
[3:12:40.100 --> 3:12:44.380]  guys saying horribly vulgar things that they had no problem with those guys.
[3:12:44.380 --> 3:12:51.940]  It's about demonstrating that you're not willing to be, to say nonsense for money and power.
[3:12:51.940 --> 3:12:53.540]  I sent you guys another article.
[3:12:53.540 --> 3:12:56.180]  I want to show you guys how the media works.
[3:12:56.180 --> 3:12:58.700]  It's very, very tricky, but I think I cracked the code.
[3:12:58.700 --> 3:13:04.660]  If you want to show that image of the Netflix article, I actually felt for this today.
[3:13:04.660 --> 3:13:05.660]  They actually tricked me.
[3:13:05.660 --> 3:13:08.380]  I'm not that easy to trick these days, but they got me.
[3:13:08.380 --> 3:13:11.260]  You guys got that image of the Netflix article?
[3:13:11.260 --> 3:13:14.860]  Oh, thanks.
[3:13:14.860 --> 3:13:24.060]  The basic gist is it says Netflix responds to controversy about underage nudity.
[3:13:24.060 --> 3:13:28.900]  Of course, I jump on that and post it, and I'm like, these people should be in jail because
[3:13:28.900 --> 3:13:35.060]  I'm horrified by the normalization of pedophilia these days, and then I saw what they were
[3:13:35.060 --> 3:13:38.060]  really doing.
[3:13:38.060 --> 3:13:39.260]  If we can't get the image, that's cool.
[3:13:39.260 --> 3:13:46.500]  I can describe it to you, but it was like a 16 or 17-year-old trans boy.
[3:13:46.500 --> 3:13:51.620]  It's a boy dressed as a girl, trans.
[3:13:51.620 --> 3:13:56.940]  There was a scene when that boy was shirtless, which isn't nudity.
[3:13:56.940 --> 3:14:04.380]  They started a debate based on the premise that that's a girl, and that's why I took
[3:14:04.380 --> 3:14:05.380]  it down.
[3:14:05.380 --> 3:14:06.380]  I'm like, ah, they got me.
[3:14:06.380 --> 3:14:08.180]  They tricked me because that's how you move the frame.
[3:14:08.180 --> 3:14:12.500]  You say there's outrage today, and they never say who's outraged.
[3:14:12.500 --> 3:14:14.540]  People aren't outraged about Alex Jones or me.
[3:14:14.540 --> 3:14:15.540]  They think we're hilarious.
[3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:16.540]  Okay.
[3:14:16.540 --> 3:14:17.540]  Look at this.
[3:14:17.540 --> 3:14:18.540]  Netflix, yeah.
[3:14:18.540 --> 3:14:19.540]  That's a dude, right?
[3:14:19.540 --> 3:14:21.820]  That's a typical read.
[3:14:21.820 --> 3:14:22.980]  What is the headline read?
[3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:30.580]  It says Netflix, they start a false debate, Netflix girl, Netflix battles film director
[3:14:30.580 --> 3:14:33.060]  over underage frontal nudity.
[3:14:33.060 --> 3:14:35.060]  Okay.
[3:14:35.060 --> 3:14:40.060]  If you engage in that debate at all, you've accepted that that's a girl and not a boy.
[3:14:40.060 --> 3:14:42.780]  That's how it works.
[3:14:42.780 --> 3:14:48.780]  It's kind of a sales technique, but it's like a satanic sales technique, where if you say
[3:14:48.780 --> 3:14:53.660]  how many children, people are outraged at the number of children Hillary Clinton's allowed
[3:14:53.660 --> 3:14:55.860]  to eat.
[3:14:55.860 --> 3:14:59.860]  If you debate that, you're already saying that it's okay to eat children.
[3:14:59.860 --> 3:15:04.060]  I know that's an extreme example, but it's not really that extreme when compared to the
[3:15:04.060 --> 3:15:05.060]  story.
[3:15:05.060 --> 3:15:10.220]  So they take a boy, pump them full of hormones, dress them up like a girl, probably do some
[3:15:10.220 --> 3:15:15.540]  sort of surgery, ensuring that they'll be childless.
[3:15:15.540 --> 3:15:20.460]  And now in a mental category of 40% suicide, which is higher than the prisoners of Auschwitz.
[3:15:20.460 --> 3:15:24.420]  And then they say, oh, we have to protect the nudity of this girl.
[3:15:24.420 --> 3:15:26.100]  Aren't you outraged?
[3:15:26.100 --> 3:15:29.220]  And that to me is wizard, that's wizardry.
[3:15:29.220 --> 3:15:30.860]  It's straight cold wizardry.
[3:15:30.860 --> 3:15:35.460]  And when we come back, when we come back, I'm going to talk about what they're doing
[3:15:35.460 --> 3:15:38.940]  with the border and the wizard tricks they're doing there.
[3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:44.380]  And I got another sketch for you guys because that's some high level witchcraft.
[3:15:44.380 --> 3:15:47.300]  You know, at least they're pretty good at it.
[3:15:47.300 --> 3:15:55.180]  Just I would have preferred if it wasn't so, so evil, awful pain in my neck, back and shoulders
[3:15:55.180 --> 3:15:57.260]  has really gotten worse.
[3:15:57.260 --> 3:16:00.300]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[3:16:00.300 --> 3:16:02.700]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[3:17:54.300 --> 3:17:58.340]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:18:03.580]  from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[3:18:03.580 --> 3:18:06.460]  literally dumbs the population down.
[3:18:06.460 --> 3:18:10.620]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[3:18:10.620 --> 3:18:13.380]  gone through two permutations.
[3:18:13.380 --> 3:18:17.500]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[3:18:17.500 --> 3:18:19.460]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[3:18:19.460 --> 3:18:24.740]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[3:18:24.740 --> 3:18:25.740]  incredible.
[3:18:25.740 --> 3:18:30.660]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[3:18:30.660 --> 3:18:32.940]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[3:18:32.940 --> 3:18:37.580]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[3:18:37.580 --> 3:18:44.420]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[3:18:44.420 --> 3:18:45.420]  bioavailable.
[3:18:45.420 --> 3:18:50.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[3:18:50.020 --> 3:18:51.020]  discovery.
[3:18:51.020 --> 3:18:54.340]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[3:18:54.340 --> 3:18:58.700]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:18:58.700 --> 3:19:03.420]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:19:03.420 --> 3:19:04.920]  to detoxify the body.
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:09.780]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:19:09.780 --> 3:19:11.300]  It's made in the USA.
[3:19:11.300 --> 3:19:16.220]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:19:16.220 --> 3:19:18.060]  the body and it supports the infowar.
[3:19:18.060 --> 3:19:20.340]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:19:20.340 --> 3:19:24.820]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[3:19:24.820 --> 3:19:29.500]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:19:29.500 --> 3:19:30.500]  get.
[3:19:30.500 --> 3:19:33.700]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:19:33.700 --> 3:19:38.700]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:19:38.700 --> 3:19:43.940]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:19:43.940 --> 3:19:46.700]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:19:46.700 --> 3:19:49.940]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[3:19:49.940 --> 3:19:57.540]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShieldM4sLive.com.
[3:19:57.540 --> 3:20:15.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:15.300 --> 3:20:21.020]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:21.020 --> 3:20:28.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Benjamin.
[3:20:28.420 --> 3:20:29.420]  What's up?
[3:20:29.420 --> 3:20:31.660]  Yeah, that was a hot baseline, man.
[3:20:31.660 --> 3:20:38.220]  That was getting me in a good zone, and I'm going to throw out my website, hugepianist.com.
[3:20:38.220 --> 3:20:40.020]  I'm on tour in December.
[3:20:40.020 --> 3:20:42.620]  Denver and Phoenix just sold out, but we got a bunch of other dates.
[3:20:42.620 --> 3:20:51.980]  You want to check out privately produced specials that didn't have to go through the Netflix.
[3:20:51.980 --> 3:20:53.620]  I don't even know what I'd call it.
[3:20:53.620 --> 3:20:58.620]  I picture Netflix almost being like that meat thing from Pink Floyd's The Wall.
[3:20:58.620 --> 3:20:59.620]  All right.
[3:20:59.620 --> 3:21:03.140]  Anyway, so let's talk more about the media and what they do because I've been fascinated
[3:21:03.140 --> 3:21:09.420]  with this my whole life because my mom teaches children's literature like how to boil down
[3:21:09.420 --> 3:21:15.020]  like a really great story, and my dad teaches rhetoric and public speech.
[3:21:15.020 --> 3:21:19.220]  From the time I was a little kid, I've been getting taught some of this stuff, and I never
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:23.260]  thought that it would be so relevant to my life as it is now because we see the media
[3:21:23.260 --> 3:21:30.220]  doing just such psychotic wizardry, like just high level propaganda.
[3:21:30.220 --> 3:21:34.380]  Let's talk about what's happening right now at the Mexican border.
[3:21:34.380 --> 3:21:42.620]  Right now, we have a border between America and Mexico, and that border is very necessary
[3:21:42.620 --> 3:21:50.020]  for America to exist because just like who said Chesterton said morality is like art.
[3:21:50.020 --> 3:21:51.420]  You have to draw a line somewhere.
[3:21:51.420 --> 3:21:54.020]  I was like that quote, and it's the same with nations.
[3:21:54.020 --> 3:21:59.220]  If you don't have a line, you don't have a nation, and the left, these leftists, these
[3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:03.900]  Marxists, globalists, communists, whatever you want to call them, they have a worldview
[3:22:03.900 --> 3:22:06.300]  where there is no lines.
[3:22:06.300 --> 3:22:12.220]  Postmodernism, moral, subjective reality, my truth, my feelings, I feel, all that stuff
[3:22:12.220 --> 3:22:17.300]  is designed so that no one has to designate anything ever, and you can just acquire as
[3:22:17.300 --> 3:22:21.780]  much power and candy as you possibly want.
[3:22:21.780 --> 3:22:28.940]  What we're seeing now is CNN backing this nonsense because the way they frame the world
[3:22:28.940 --> 3:22:30.380]  is very important.
[3:22:30.380 --> 3:22:35.940]  This first picture I'm going to show you guys is what was on the CNN website, and it shows
[3:22:35.940 --> 3:22:40.460]  a woman and her children, and they're running, and it looks like there's tear gas.
[3:22:40.460 --> 3:22:42.940]  It literally looks like a war zone.
[3:22:42.940 --> 3:22:49.260]  That's a cropped photo of a larger photo, and I'm going to show you that larger photo.
[3:22:49.260 --> 3:22:55.580]  Here we have, that's the exact moment that I just described for those of you just listening.
[3:22:55.580 --> 3:23:02.460]  You see camera people, people standing around, a ton of males jumping a fence.
[3:23:02.460 --> 3:23:08.620]  She appears to be the only woman with children that isn't just standing somewhere.
[3:23:08.620 --> 3:23:15.540]  The gas bomb or whatever is pretty far from her and not really near anybody, and we can
[3:23:15.540 --> 3:23:18.860]  see how this looks like a reality show set.
[3:23:18.860 --> 3:23:23.300]  There's literally a camera of people everywhere, so they're trying to get the one frame that
[3:23:23.300 --> 3:23:31.260]  has women and children in it just to appeal to usually female sensibilities because women
[3:23:31.260 --> 3:23:33.700]  usually think more short-term about care.
[3:23:33.700 --> 3:23:35.820]  I have two children under three.
[3:23:35.820 --> 3:23:40.900]  My wife typically has the worldview of whatever is going to help them right now, and that's
[3:23:40.900 --> 3:23:42.740]  why we survive as a species.
[3:23:42.740 --> 3:23:44.140]  God bless mothers.
[3:23:44.140 --> 3:23:49.580]  They're like, whatever is going to help these two-year-olds, that's the answer.
[3:23:49.580 --> 3:23:56.300]  Women usually think long-term where you think, okay, well, if we open our borders just because
[3:23:56.300 --> 3:24:03.740]  one two-year-old is running in a crop photo, many, many, many, many more will die.
[3:24:03.740 --> 3:24:08.140]  It's the more long-term approach, and together, the male and the female, the two approaches
[3:24:08.140 --> 3:24:11.700]  make for a pretty stable, beautiful, wonderful society.
[3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:14.380]  I see a role for both.
[3:24:14.380 --> 3:24:22.380]  Now that we have this media that's trying to stoke the fires within that female instinct
[3:24:22.380 --> 3:24:27.420]  of just protect children at all costs, and bear in mind, statistically, a lot of these
[3:24:27.420 --> 3:24:32.740]  kids have been kidnapped, they're being human trafficked.
[3:24:32.740 --> 3:24:39.260]  I think 80% of women that are coming into America illegal are raped on the way, so there's
[3:24:39.260 --> 3:24:41.620]  nothing humanitarian about what's happening.
[3:24:41.620 --> 3:24:42.620]  Why?
[3:24:42.620 --> 3:24:43.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:24:43.700 --> 3:24:50.300]  These pictures are designed to make people feel empathy, and that empathy is weaponized
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:24:54.340]  because empathy is not a productive quality.
[3:24:54.340 --> 3:25:01.260]  Compassion is, compassion is kind of like empathy mixed with logos, where you can not
[3:25:01.260 --> 3:25:06.140]  physically feel what someone else is going through, but you can have compassion for your
[3:25:06.140 --> 3:25:09.460]  fellow man and help and contribute to your society.
[3:25:09.460 --> 3:25:15.300]  I'm not saying to be a cold person, but empathy is a weapon, so you have media that tries
[3:25:15.300 --> 3:25:20.740]  to traumatize people with images and with emotional triggers that they don't make the
[3:25:20.740 --> 3:25:27.100]  right decisions, and right now, we're seeing that with the border.
[3:25:27.100 --> 3:25:33.140]  It's getting to the point where the masculine and the feminine are being so divided in this
[3:25:33.140 --> 3:25:38.660]  country, and some females have seen past it, many, many, many females have seen past it.
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:43.100]  Many women that are married with their own children can see past the nonsense.
[3:25:43.100 --> 3:25:46.540]  There's a lot of males that have fallen for this in this white night fashion, where it's
[3:25:46.540 --> 3:25:52.640]  like, I'll save you, and so what is going to be the result of it is just an even more
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:57.860]  divided nation and a nation that can't address its problems head on.
[3:25:57.860 --> 3:26:04.860]  If you can see my hair, I kind of look a little bit like a lesbian Wolverine because for a
[3:26:04.860 --> 3:26:09.820]  while now, I don't like getting my hair cut because the hairdresser, it's a dice roll,
[3:26:09.820 --> 3:26:13.460]  so rather or not, they're going to hate me because when you're sitting in that chair,
[3:26:13.460 --> 3:26:17.620]  one of the first things they say is, like, so what do you do for a living or whatever?
[3:26:17.620 --> 3:26:21.060]  If I'm like, I'm a comedian, they're like, oh, I love comedy.
[3:26:21.060 --> 3:26:25.580]  I love Trevor Noah and Amy Schumer, and wow, those people are so funny.
[3:26:25.580 --> 3:26:28.860]  I'm like, yeah, yeah, and they're like, would you like those guys?
[3:26:28.860 --> 3:26:34.180]  I'm like, not really my cup of tea, and then I start saying who I think is funny, and then
[3:26:34.180 --> 3:26:42.260]  there's a silence, and then I realized that someone who believes that I want school shootings
[3:26:42.260 --> 3:26:48.460]  to happen and I want little kids to be gunned down at borders, they're that close from my
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:53.560]  neck with a blade, and so that's why I've been having my wife cut my hair, and that's
[3:26:53.560 --> 3:26:56.180]  why I look like lesbian Wolverine.
[3:26:56.180 --> 3:27:03.900]  So what the media is accomplishing right now is dividing the country in a way where it's
[3:27:03.900 --> 3:27:08.620]  not about shared goals, because back in the day, maybe I was delusional, but I thought
[3:27:08.620 --> 3:27:14.100]  that Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, libertarian anarchists, we could all argue
[3:27:14.100 --> 3:27:19.780]  about stuff because we all assumed that we wanted what's best for America's future.
[3:27:19.780 --> 3:27:23.100]  Back in the day when I'd argue with my father about stuff like that, because my father's
[3:27:23.100 --> 3:27:31.300]  more on the left, and I still know that we have similar goals, but I knew that he still
[3:27:31.300 --> 3:27:33.180]  wanted the same stuff as me.
[3:27:33.180 --> 3:27:39.060]  We're now facing a world where I don't trust that a leftist wants the same world as me.
[3:27:39.060 --> 3:27:46.900]  I think there are people that truly want only police to have guns, no nations, little children
[3:27:46.900 --> 3:27:48.380]  can choose their own genders.
[3:27:48.380 --> 3:27:55.740]  Like that to me is not a, it's not like a discussion, it's not a debate, it's like you're my enemy
[3:27:55.740 --> 3:28:03.140]  now, because it's one thing to say, oh, socialized healthcare will solve more problems.
[3:28:03.140 --> 3:28:07.700]  If you believe that, I think you're wrong, but you may still be a very good person and
[3:28:07.700 --> 3:28:11.020]  we're still in the same country and we'll debate it and we'll figure it out.
[3:28:11.020 --> 3:28:16.100]  If you think that a child should be given the option to take hormones so they become
[3:28:16.100 --> 3:28:19.460]  infertile, there's no debate there.
[3:28:19.460 --> 3:28:23.060]  It's not like what's the best way to get to a good world.
[3:28:23.060 --> 3:28:28.540]  That's simply someone saying that they want what I consider to be hell on earth.
[3:28:28.540 --> 3:28:34.180]  So in response to that, I'm still going to do comedy and tour and do specials and whatnot.
[3:28:34.180 --> 3:28:41.980]  And if you want to check mine out, go to hugepianist.com, youtube.com slash Owen Benjamin Comedy.
[3:28:41.980 --> 3:28:46.380]  I'm currently a fan from live streaming, but I live stream on another channel and then
[3:28:46.380 --> 3:28:48.380]  upload it after.
[3:28:48.380 --> 3:28:53.500]  Yeah, I'm not going to stop.
[3:28:53.500 --> 3:29:00.580]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[3:29:00.580 --> 3:29:03.980]  The last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay heating
[3:29:03.980 --> 3:29:04.980]  pads?
[3:29:04.980 --> 3:29:10.420]  Sunny Bay heating pads made by Biomed DB Design right here in the USA come in all sizes.

[3:29:54.620 --> 3:29:58.620]  Our grandparents and great grandparents know that they can't food during the fall, so they
[3:29:58.620 --> 3:29:59.620]  have it during the winter.
[3:29:59.620 --> 3:30:03.620]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com.

[3:30:54.180 --> 3:30:59.980]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[3:30:59.980 --> 3:31:03.340]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing, and I've had water filtration
[3:31:03.340 --> 3:31:06.020]  sponsors since the day I got on air.
[3:31:06.020 --> 3:31:09.060]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration, I learned what the best
[3:31:09.060 --> 3:31:10.060]  was.
[3:31:10.060 --> 3:31:13.980]  Now, the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nice, sustainable steel unit that does the most
[3:31:13.980 --> 3:31:14.980]  gallons an hour.
[3:31:14.980 --> 3:31:15.980]  It's amazing.
[3:31:15.980 --> 3:31:18.300]  All the bad stuff leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[3:31:18.300 --> 3:31:23.260]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patriots supply that have developed these filters,
[3:31:23.260 --> 3:31:25.020]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[3:31:25.020 --> 3:31:26.740]  He has a glut of them.
[3:31:26.740 --> 3:31:29.700]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[3:31:29.700 --> 3:31:32.140]  When it's discounted, it uses $200.
[3:31:32.140 --> 3:31:33.140]  It's $127.
[3:31:33.140 --> 3:31:39.220]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $20-something bucks on them.
[3:31:39.220 --> 3:31:41.460]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[3:31:41.460 --> 3:31:43.700]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[3:31:43.700 --> 3:31:44.700]  It's amazing.

[3:32:57.060 --> 3:33:14.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:14.940 --> 3:33:23.060]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[3:33:23.060 --> 3:33:25.060]  What's up?
[3:33:25.060 --> 3:33:26.060]  What's up?
[3:33:26.060 --> 3:33:27.060]  What's going on?
[3:33:27.060 --> 3:33:29.320]  I'm digging these music intros.
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:37.060]  So this segment, I wanted to talk about what is drawing a certain type of a person to the
[3:33:37.060 --> 3:33:44.940]  safe space mentality, because safe space is the new selling tool of socialism or communism.
[3:33:44.940 --> 3:33:50.260]  The safest place you can be is a solitary confinement in a supermax prison.
[3:33:50.260 --> 3:33:51.980]  That's a true safe space.
[3:33:51.980 --> 3:33:55.740]  You have walls, you have bars, you have a meal plan, health insurance.
[3:33:55.740 --> 3:33:56.740]  You name it.
[3:33:56.740 --> 3:33:57.740]  All provided by the state.
[3:33:57.740 --> 3:33:59.660]  The safe space is a prison.
[3:33:59.660 --> 3:34:05.060]  So that sale of safe space, what causes it?
[3:34:05.060 --> 3:34:12.680]  I believe that it's caused by this bizarre societal abuse that we do to children, puts
[3:34:12.680 --> 3:34:19.780]  them in a position where they are seeking safe spaces, which is government control.
[3:34:19.780 --> 3:34:27.020]  And I used to think it was ridiculous when I'd hear a 20-year-old soy addict tell me
[3:34:27.020 --> 3:34:28.020]  that they had PTSD.
[3:34:28.020 --> 3:34:31.740]  And as someone with a lot of friends that have come back from Afghanistan, and I know
[3:34:31.740 --> 3:34:36.980]  what real PTSD looks like, I would always think that they were insane.
[3:34:36.980 --> 3:34:43.380]  But I'm starting to understand that there is a type of PTSD that does come from public
[3:34:43.380 --> 3:34:49.060]  schools that just keeps making you just remember facts and not how to get to the facts.
[3:34:49.060 --> 3:34:50.580]  Like, you don't learn how to learn.
[3:34:50.580 --> 3:34:55.780]  You just learn a bunch of facts that mean nothing and just recite them.
[3:34:55.780 --> 3:34:58.220]  It keeps you in kind of this weird state.
[3:34:58.220 --> 3:35:04.620]  And then on television, you watch a never-ending amount of violence and pornographic type scenes.
[3:35:04.620 --> 3:35:08.140]  And the media just keeps you scared, scared, scared.
[3:35:08.140 --> 3:35:13.140]  So when you grow up in that environment, especially if you don't have a stay-at-home mother or
[3:35:13.140 --> 3:35:19.460]  when you're raised in a situation where there's a high level of abuse, you constantly are
[3:35:19.460 --> 3:35:21.260]  seeking safety.
[3:35:21.260 --> 3:35:27.060]  And so I made a comedy sketch, because that's kind of what I do.
[3:35:27.060 --> 3:35:32.900]  I'll take these complicated and somewhat dark concepts and make them funny, because it's
[3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:35.660]  easier to kind of reveal with humor.
[3:35:35.660 --> 3:35:37.020]  I think there's two types of humor.
[3:35:37.020 --> 3:35:41.060]  There's humor that reveals evil, and there's humor that normalizes evil.
[3:35:41.060 --> 3:35:46.620]  The left, with Netflix and all this stuff, they figured out this formula where they can
[3:35:46.620 --> 3:35:51.860]  take comedy to make things that are really dark and awful seem acceptable.
[3:35:51.860 --> 3:35:57.860]  And then there's also comedy, and this is a comedy that's banned currently, that reveals
[3:35:57.860 --> 3:36:03.580]  the problems with society and the evils of society in a way that's a lot more palatable
[3:36:03.580 --> 3:36:06.060]  than just saying all this stuff to people.
[3:36:06.060 --> 3:36:12.660]  So here's a sketch I made, it's called The Last Bernie Bro, and I hope you enjoy it.
[3:36:12.660 --> 3:36:16.060]  The Last Bernie Bro is trying to...
[3:36:16.060 --> 3:36:20.620]  My name is Chad, and I'm a Bernie Bro.
[3:36:20.620 --> 3:36:27.260]  There used to be millions of us, then there were thousands, now there's only me.
[3:36:27.260 --> 3:36:32.460]  We stood for something greater than ourselves, the quality of outcome.
[3:36:32.460 --> 3:36:39.580]  The greedy capitalist called us morons, said we didn't have jobs and we lived off our pants.
[3:36:39.580 --> 3:36:45.780]  I mean, that's all true, but they did not have to say it like that.
[3:36:45.780 --> 3:36:49.300]  When I first heard Bernie Sanders, something had me changed.
[3:36:49.300 --> 3:36:52.700]  You know, it's funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is
[3:36:52.700 --> 3:36:55.220]  with people lining up for food.
[3:36:55.220 --> 3:36:57.220]  That's a good thing.
[3:36:57.220 --> 3:37:02.420]  I knew that the problems in my life were not my fault, they were someone else's fault.
[3:37:02.420 --> 3:37:06.860]  Capitalism, greed, America, not me.
[3:37:06.860 --> 3:37:11.020]  Everyone else turned on Bernie Sanders, I did not.
[3:37:11.020 --> 3:37:16.500]  Bernie spoke of a land that listened to him, had the courage to follow the dream.
[3:37:16.500 --> 3:37:21.940]  I couldn't find it on a map or spell it, but I knew it had carried his dream and I would find it.
[3:37:21.940 --> 3:37:39.060]  I brought only my machete, a frisbee, bubbles, two liqueurs, in my trusted day of time.
[3:37:39.060 --> 3:37:43.460]  The natural environment is raw, beautiful.
[3:37:43.460 --> 3:37:48.420]  When I think about white privilege in America and capitalism, I flip out on it and just
[3:37:48.420 --> 3:37:54.420]  beat the shit out of it, greedy capitalism makes me freak out so fricking bad.
[3:37:54.420 --> 3:38:01.220]  My name is Chad, and if you are reading this, just know there is hope for you too.
[3:38:01.220 --> 3:38:07.260]  Come to Socialist Utopia, Bernie Sanders dreamed about.
[3:38:07.260 --> 3:38:14.660]  Escape America's evil rich clutches if you dare and try to break into a dream, a dream
[3:38:14.660 --> 3:38:21.180]  that is Venezuela.
[3:38:21.180 --> 3:38:24.180]  My name is Chad.
[3:38:24.180 --> 3:38:35.700]  Yes, Venezuela, I'm here.
[3:38:35.700 --> 3:38:42.140]  I want to come in Venezuela so bad and these walls divide us, please just open your gates
[3:38:42.140 --> 3:38:43.140]  to me.
[3:38:43.140 --> 3:38:44.140]  Wait, you want to come in?
[3:38:44.140 --> 3:38:45.140]  Yes, please.
[3:38:45.140 --> 3:38:46.140]  Like, in here.
[3:38:46.140 --> 3:38:51.260]  I've come all the way through this horrible jungle from America to be a part of your beautiful
[3:38:51.260 --> 3:38:52.260]  utopia.
[3:38:52.260 --> 3:38:54.420]  I was a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[3:38:54.420 --> 3:38:55.420]  You're an American.
[3:38:55.420 --> 3:38:58.180]  A lot of shame, I know.
[3:38:58.180 --> 3:39:02.140]  The land of greed and then meanness.
[3:39:02.140 --> 3:39:03.140]  I want equality.
[3:39:03.140 --> 3:39:05.140]  Do you have a passport?
[3:39:05.140 --> 3:39:08.780]  Of course, the shameful document that keeps people apart.
[3:39:08.780 --> 3:39:09.980]  Let me see, let me see.
[3:39:09.980 --> 3:39:10.980]  I'll burn it right now.
[3:39:10.980 --> 3:39:18.460]  No, stop, stop it, put it down, put it down.
[3:39:18.460 --> 3:39:19.460]  You wait right there.
[3:39:19.460 --> 3:39:20.460]  Okay.
[3:39:20.460 --> 3:39:21.460]  I'll do anything.
[3:39:21.460 --> 3:39:25.260]  I can't wait to play Frisbee and blow bubbles.
[3:39:25.260 --> 3:39:26.540]  Is that valid?
[3:39:26.540 --> 3:39:27.540]  Unfortunately, yes.
[3:39:27.540 --> 3:39:30.540]  All right, pick it up slowly.
[3:39:30.540 --> 3:39:49.900]  Hold this, for freedom, hold this, but why would I want a gun in the land of utopia?
[3:39:49.900 --> 3:39:52.020]  Stay right here.
[3:39:52.020 --> 3:39:53.620]  But aren't these illegal?
[3:39:53.620 --> 3:39:54.620]  Now take back!
[3:39:54.620 --> 3:39:56.620]  Where are you going, sir?
[3:39:56.620 --> 3:39:58.700]  I'm going to America!
[3:39:58.700 --> 3:40:00.700]  And that man's very confusing.
[3:40:00.700 --> 3:40:02.620]  Who are all these people running towards me?
[3:40:02.620 --> 3:40:04.620]  Why do they look like skeletons?
[3:40:04.620 --> 3:40:05.620]  Hello?
[3:40:05.620 --> 3:40:13.260]  Where do I play hacky stack around here, and who has some goddamn wakwa?
[3:40:13.260 --> 3:40:21.460]  All right, so now that you just watched that and you're like, wow, that was super hilarious.
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:23.140]  Where do I see more of that guy?
[3:40:23.140 --> 3:40:27.580]  Hugepianist.com for self-produced specials and tour dates.
[3:40:27.580 --> 3:40:36.580]  But so the point of that is that this type of person that can't seem to think for themselves,
[3:40:36.580 --> 3:40:41.020]  it's because of just this constant training, this constant trauma from the media and the
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:46.700]  news to get to the point where they can live in a constant state of cognitive dissonance.
[3:40:46.700 --> 3:40:53.220]  Why would people be clamoring to get in America if America truly is this awful place of inequality
[3:40:53.220 --> 3:40:54.820]  and socialism is great?
[3:40:54.820 --> 3:40:58.940]  Right now in Venezuela, they had so many children that were starving to death that
[3:40:58.940 --> 3:41:05.580]  instead of doing something about it, they just made reporting that illegal.
[3:41:05.580 --> 3:41:11.380]  Venezuela has gotten so low that the UN is now calling it a failed state.
[3:41:11.380 --> 3:41:15.740]  And that's the UN that is currently pushing a globalist agenda.
[3:41:15.740 --> 3:41:21.460]  Venezuela is supposed to be like a success story, that they came in with socialism, they
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:27.180]  centralized everything, and it went from having some of the highest oil reserves in the world
[3:41:27.180 --> 3:41:32.780]  to just becoming just a mess.
[3:41:32.780 --> 3:41:36.900]  It's debatably the most impoverished country in the world now because socialism always
[3:41:36.900 --> 3:41:40.020]  ends in starvation and genocide every single time.
[3:41:40.020 --> 3:41:46.940]  So how did they get these people to think that America is so bad, but yet we should
[3:41:46.940 --> 3:41:50.300]  let these people into our country to save them?
[3:41:50.300 --> 3:41:51.940]  Save them from what?
[3:41:51.940 --> 3:41:59.300]  Save them from their utopia of centralized planning without these awful white male cis
[3:41:59.300 --> 3:42:03.060]  straight capitalists to ruin their life for them?
[3:42:03.060 --> 3:42:08.260]  That's such an obvious contradiction that I realized that it isn't based on someone
[3:42:08.260 --> 3:42:12.820]  not understanding it, or maybe I can just explain it to somebody and they'll see it.
[3:42:12.820 --> 3:42:18.140]  It's a permanent state of cognitive dissonance that they can't seem to snap out of.
[3:42:18.140 --> 3:42:21.340]  And that's why they're called non-player characters.
[3:42:21.340 --> 3:42:23.940]  It's literally like a drone army.
[3:42:23.940 --> 3:42:28.660]  It's one thing if you have issues with policy or whatnot, but you can't say Donald Trump
[3:42:28.660 --> 3:42:31.780]  is literally Hitler, now give your guns to Hitler.
[3:42:31.780 --> 3:42:33.820]  You must submit to tolerance.
[3:42:33.820 --> 3:42:36.740]  These statements can't exist in a healthy mind.
[3:42:36.740 --> 3:42:43.820]  So the only way out is to raise good kids, keep on eating, keep on working, and just
[3:42:43.820 --> 3:42:48.940]  really hope that we can just avoid these people because they're super annoying.
[3:42:48.940 --> 3:42:53.300]  They're just a lot of soy.
[3:42:53.300 --> 3:42:57.340]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[3:42:57.340 --> 3:43:02.580]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[3:43:02.580 --> 3:43:05.460]  literally dumbs the population down.
[3:43:05.460 --> 3:43:09.620]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[3:43:09.620 --> 3:43:12.380]  gone through two permutations.
[3:43:12.380 --> 3:43:16.500]  This seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[3:43:16.500 --> 3:43:18.460]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[3:43:18.460 --> 3:43:23.300]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[3:43:23.300 --> 3:43:24.300]  That's been incredible.
[3:43:24.300 --> 3:43:29.660]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[3:43:29.660 --> 3:43:31.900]  of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[3:43:31.900 --> 3:43:36.420]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[3:43:36.420 --> 3:43:42.460]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[3:43:42.460 --> 3:43:45.900]  it even more bioavailable.
[3:43:45.900 --> 3:43:49.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[3:43:49.020 --> 3:43:50.020]  discovery.
[3:43:50.020 --> 3:44:19.980]  This is X3, now available at EnforcedLife.com.

[3:44:23.340 --> 3:44:27.900]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life, it's more important than

[3:45:54.540 --> 3:46:01.540]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[3:46:01.540 --> 3:46:04.540]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[3:46:04.540 --> 3:46:07.540]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[3:46:07.540 --> 3:46:11.540]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[3:46:11.540 --> 3:46:18.540]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[3:46:18.540 --> 3:46:24.540]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[3:46:24.540 --> 3:46:26.540]  We have seen what they want to do.
[3:46:26.540 --> 3:46:28.540]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[3:46:28.540 --> 3:46:30.540]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[3:46:30.540 --> 3:46:33.540]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[3:46:33.540 --> 3:46:35.540]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[3:46:35.540 --> 3:46:41.540]  They want to hack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[3:46:41.540 --> 3:46:43.540]  It's The David Knight Show.
[3:46:43.540 --> 3:46:45.540]  You never missed your show.
[3:46:45.540 --> 3:46:47.540]  Any day.
[3:46:47.540 --> 3:47:12.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:12.540 --> 3:47:18.540]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[3:47:18.540 --> 3:47:23.540]  It's Owen Benjamin.
[3:47:23.540 --> 3:47:25.540]  All right, all right.
[3:47:25.540 --> 3:47:26.540]  What's up?
[3:47:26.540 --> 3:47:27.540]  I'm back.
[3:47:27.540 --> 3:47:28.540]  I'm back for another segment.
[3:47:28.540 --> 3:47:35.540]  And as you can see, the light continues to change on me because the sun is setting over some beautiful mountains.
[3:47:35.540 --> 3:47:42.540]  I'm in the Adirondack Mountains up in northern New York, just had a great Thanksgiving.
[3:47:42.540 --> 3:47:43.540]  Very thankful.
[3:47:43.540 --> 3:47:45.540]  The whole family came together and it was awesome.
[3:47:45.540 --> 3:47:53.540]  And I just wanted to touch on a point that talking about this stuff and thinking about this stuff and thinking about why people do what they do.
[3:47:53.540 --> 3:48:00.540]  And as evil as it can get sometimes, it's actually relaxes you because I really thought about this.
[3:48:00.540 --> 3:48:07.540]  My stressing people out, is it going to hurt people's health to talk about some of this stuff and if people just want to relax and ignore it?
[3:48:07.540 --> 3:48:17.540]  For me personally, and I'm sure a lot of you agree that the most anxious I get is when I have no idea why someone is acting the way they are,
[3:48:17.540 --> 3:48:20.540]  because I can't predict anything about the future.
[3:48:20.540 --> 3:48:30.540]  So as dark as some of these conversations can get about how these abused people grow up leading a safe space and vote in socialism and all that stuff,
[3:48:30.540 --> 3:48:33.540]  at least we know the causes and it's not just random.
[3:48:33.540 --> 3:48:37.540]  Like for example, when I used to live in Los Angeles, people started doing CrossFit.
[3:48:37.540 --> 3:48:44.540]  And I checked it out and it was literally just people like moving tires and just swinging like hammers on tires.
[3:48:44.540 --> 3:48:53.540]  And as someone who's done a lot of hard labor jobs, I'm looking at this and I'm like, so you pay them to just do work?
[3:48:53.540 --> 3:48:58.540]  You know, it literally looked like you're just helping someone move and people are like, yeah, CrossFit.
[3:48:58.540 --> 3:49:00.540]  I'm like, how much do you pay these people?
[3:49:00.540 --> 3:49:07.540]  And then I finally understood that people who believe in nothing, like the atheist, nihilist mentality of Los Angeles,
[3:49:07.540 --> 3:49:11.540]  it's not that they believe in nothing, they would believe in anything at that point.
[3:49:11.540 --> 3:49:15.540]  They're just constantly looking to fill themselves with some new meaning,
[3:49:15.540 --> 3:49:21.540]  even if it's literally moving a tire that I would demand at least 20 hours an hour to pay me.
[3:49:21.540 --> 3:49:28.540]  And then me and my brother were joking about that we're going to start CrossFit construction where, you know, here at CrossFit construction,
[3:49:28.540 --> 3:49:39.540]  you pay us $100 a month and you, you know, we meet with the homeowner and we just complete these construction bits that we're going to make the money out.
[3:49:39.540 --> 3:49:47.540]  CrossFit, can redemption. If you want to be redeemed, you bring us all these cans for the nickels, $100 a month, you know,
[3:49:47.540 --> 3:49:49.540]  and people would probably really do that.
[3:49:49.540 --> 3:49:56.540]  All right, so now what we're going to talk about is we're just starting to talk about Bernie Sanders and socialism,
[3:49:56.540 --> 3:50:02.540]  why the government keeps expanding and why the laws keep getting more ridiculous.
[3:50:02.540 --> 3:50:12.540]  And it's a pretty basic idea. So I wanted to put it into a dramatic form and I went out into the real world
[3:50:12.540 --> 3:50:19.540]  and I did this sketch that I'm going to play for you guys and by the end we'll talk about why the government seems to keep expanding.
[3:50:19.540 --> 3:50:22.540]  So check this out. I hope you enjoy it.
[3:50:22.540 --> 3:50:23.540]  Enjoy it.
[3:50:23.540 --> 3:50:24.540]  What should I look for when starting a small business?
[3:50:24.540 --> 3:50:27.540]  My top one would be hiring great employees.
[3:50:27.540 --> 3:50:33.540]  I need compassion because I don't want an abusive place, but I also need someone willing to hurt people.
[3:50:33.540 --> 3:50:36.540]  Some of our best employees are like retired school teachers.
[3:50:36.540 --> 3:50:37.540]  That's a good idea.
[3:50:37.540 --> 3:50:38.540]  They know the books already.
[3:50:38.540 --> 3:50:41.540]  So I should find like retired drug mules.
[3:50:41.540 --> 3:50:42.540]  There you go.
[3:50:42.540 --> 3:50:44.540]  They used to be a police officer down in Virginia.
[3:50:44.540 --> 3:50:45.540]  Oh, sweet.
[3:50:45.540 --> 3:50:47.540]  And we worked in the county lockup.
[3:50:47.540 --> 3:50:49.540]  But where are the pitfalls of prison life?
[3:50:49.540 --> 3:50:54.540]  The pitfalls are what comes out of the cell is the most dangerous.
[3:50:54.540 --> 3:50:58.540]  Pooh or food. You want to steer clear of that for sure.
[3:50:58.540 --> 3:50:59.540]  Don't throw a poo at ya?
[3:50:59.540 --> 3:51:00.540]  Oh, yeah.
[3:51:00.540 --> 3:51:02.540]  Do you worry about insurance for their new prison?
[3:51:02.540 --> 3:51:05.540]  Because it's one of our big expenses for us as insurance as far as...
[3:51:05.540 --> 3:51:08.540]  I have insurance. His name's Gary. He owes me a favor.
[3:51:08.540 --> 3:51:12.540]  So I'm doing customer outreach because, you know, you're kind of a squirtly little guy.
[3:51:12.540 --> 3:51:14.540]  I figured there's a good chance you're going to end up in prison one day.
[3:51:14.540 --> 3:51:17.540]  If you end up going to prison, what do you want out of your prison?
[3:51:17.540 --> 3:51:19.540]  A bed.
[3:51:19.540 --> 3:51:20.540]  How about pets?
[3:51:20.540 --> 3:51:21.540]  They're going to have a nice breakfast.
[3:51:21.540 --> 3:51:26.540]  Waffle makers? Because when I'm on the road and I'm at a day's end and I'm like...
[3:51:26.540 --> 3:51:31.540]  Oh, no way, it's a waffle maker. That makes up for the semen and the bed sheets.
[3:51:31.540 --> 3:51:37.540]  One thing I found about this area that I'm starting to really resent is the low crime rates.
[3:51:37.540 --> 3:51:42.540]  Because I took my family from LA to be in this beautiful place and I'm trying to start this prison.
[3:51:42.540 --> 3:51:46.540]  And the last thing I need is the fact that no one commits murder.
[3:51:46.540 --> 3:51:49.540]  Right now cops are very discriminatory because they're usually only going after criminals.
[3:51:49.540 --> 3:51:50.540]  That's right.
[3:51:50.540 --> 3:51:51.540]  Oh, man.
[3:51:51.540 --> 3:51:54.540]  You do games for the crime. Shooting and all that.
[3:51:54.540 --> 3:51:57.540]  Okay, so why don't you go out and do it for real and not be sent to a coward?
[3:51:57.540 --> 3:52:01.540]  I read on some hippie website that one in three black males
[3:52:01.540 --> 3:52:03.540]  end up in the prison system at some point in their life.
[3:52:03.540 --> 3:52:07.540]  That seems low to me. How do we get those other two guys in there?
[3:52:07.540 --> 3:52:12.540]  So you have certain classes of individuals that are known as protected classes.
[3:52:12.540 --> 3:52:13.540]  Right.
[3:52:13.540 --> 3:52:14.540]  Minorities, people with disabilities.
[3:52:14.540 --> 3:52:16.540]  People whose brother has been half-wagged.
[3:52:16.540 --> 3:52:19.540]  Things like that. Yeah, that's not your market.
[3:52:19.540 --> 3:52:22.540]  So 22-year-old white females.
[3:52:22.540 --> 3:52:25.540]  Because they're already probably having a hard time finding a job.
[3:52:25.540 --> 3:52:28.540]  Hey, three squares in a bed at 22.
[3:52:28.540 --> 3:52:30.540]  One and a half squares in the math.
[3:52:30.540 --> 3:52:32.540]  Let's, you know, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[3:52:32.540 --> 3:52:35.540]  Everyone's going after dudes as prisoners, right?
[3:52:35.540 --> 3:52:37.540]  Because they're committing all the crimes.
[3:52:37.540 --> 3:52:38.540]  Right.
[3:52:38.540 --> 3:52:40.540]  But I want to get you guys in there.
[3:52:40.540 --> 3:52:41.540]  How do I get more women?
[3:52:41.540 --> 3:52:45.540]  Well, you create laws against things like indecision.
[3:52:45.540 --> 3:52:49.540]  Because then when you've got chicks, like, because every time I see a woman,
[3:52:49.540 --> 3:52:53.540]  they're always just doing this.
[3:52:53.540 --> 3:52:54.540]  Lock them up.
[3:52:54.540 --> 3:52:58.540]  I want to expand the prison industry because I want to make more money.
[3:52:58.540 --> 3:52:59.540]  You know, look at those eyes.
[3:52:59.540 --> 3:53:01.540]  Like, I wake up every morning and he looks at me and goes,
[3:53:01.540 --> 3:53:03.540]  Dad, Dad, do I have to go to state school?
[3:53:03.540 --> 3:53:04.540]  Like, the scumbags?
[3:53:04.540 --> 3:53:06.540]  Look at him in the eye and tell him he doesn't deserve everything,
[3:53:06.540 --> 3:53:07.540]  his hard desires.
[3:53:07.540 --> 3:53:10.540]  Now, help me out and let's get some white chicks in prison.
[3:53:10.540 --> 3:53:13.540]  Once I do this business plan, what do I do next?
[3:53:13.540 --> 3:53:15.540]  You've got to execute it.
[3:53:15.540 --> 3:53:16.540]  Execute it?
[3:53:16.540 --> 3:53:17.540]  No, I don't want executions.
[3:53:17.540 --> 3:53:19.540]  I'm actually against capital punishment.
[3:53:19.540 --> 3:53:20.540]  Capital punishment?
[3:53:20.540 --> 3:53:21.540]  You are.
[3:53:21.540 --> 3:53:22.540]  Because there's no capital in it.
[3:53:22.540 --> 3:53:24.540]  Big sodium pentathal is killing little guys like me.
[3:53:24.540 --> 3:53:25.540]  I don't know.
[3:53:25.540 --> 3:53:26.540]  This might be a bad idea to start a prison.
[3:53:26.540 --> 3:53:28.540]  Maybe I should just do a coffee shop.
[3:53:28.540 --> 3:53:29.540]  Coffee shop.
[3:53:29.540 --> 3:53:31.540]  It's really going to be a prison.
[3:53:31.540 --> 3:53:32.540]  Yeah.
[3:53:32.540 --> 3:53:33.540]  Welcome to my home.
[3:53:33.540 --> 3:53:35.540]  And I got a special surprise for you at home.
[3:53:35.540 --> 3:53:36.540]  Potential customers.
[3:53:36.540 --> 3:53:37.540]  I'm just kidding.
[3:53:37.540 --> 3:53:38.540]  No, for real though.
[3:53:38.540 --> 3:53:41.540]  I'll get you.
[3:53:41.540 --> 3:53:45.540]  This is my very own prison with my very own employee.
[3:53:45.540 --> 3:53:46.540]  Tom the guard.
[3:53:46.540 --> 3:53:47.540]  Always asleep.
[3:53:47.540 --> 3:53:48.540]  Always hammered.
[3:53:48.540 --> 3:53:49.540]  Good guy.
[3:53:49.540 --> 3:53:50.540]  Good guy.
[3:53:50.540 --> 3:53:52.540]  And here are my first two customers.
[3:53:52.540 --> 3:53:53.540]  Right?
[3:53:53.540 --> 3:53:54.540]  Who wants some waffles?
[3:53:54.540 --> 3:53:59.540]  We have the Sarenac Lake Strangler convicted on a technicality.
[3:53:59.540 --> 3:54:02.540]  And we have an indecisive white girl.
[3:54:02.540 --> 3:54:03.540]  Three to five years.
[3:54:03.540 --> 3:54:05.540]  No possibility of parole.
[3:54:05.540 --> 3:54:07.540]  I'm just here to support my family.
[3:54:07.540 --> 3:54:09.540]  You know, I'm living the American dream.
[3:54:09.540 --> 3:54:11.540]  As long as private pr-
[3:54:11.540 --> 3:54:13.540]  Where's the strangler?
[3:54:13.540 --> 3:54:15.540]  You didn't see where the strangler went?
[3:54:15.540 --> 3:54:21.540]  We're going to have to get you to your mom's house.
[3:54:21.540 --> 3:54:22.540]  Good lord.
[3:54:22.540 --> 3:54:25.540]  What have I done?
[3:54:25.540 --> 3:54:26.540]  All right.
[3:54:26.540 --> 3:54:28.540]  So I probably should have preface that with the title of it.
[3:54:28.540 --> 3:54:30.540]  But it was called,
[3:54:30.540 --> 3:54:33.540]  Owen Benjamin starts a private prison.
[3:54:33.540 --> 3:54:34.540]  A mom and pop prison.
[3:54:34.540 --> 3:54:39.540]  Because the whole point was if for some reason you,
[3:54:39.540 --> 3:54:43.540]  if prisons can be private and you want to start your own prison,
[3:54:43.540 --> 3:54:44.540]  what's the first thing you do?
[3:54:44.540 --> 3:54:46.540]  You want more customers,
[3:54:46.540 --> 3:54:48.540]  which would be more people in prison,
[3:54:48.540 --> 3:54:53.540]  which would require you to have either a more unsafe society
[3:54:53.540 --> 3:54:54.540]  or more laws.
[3:54:54.540 --> 3:54:57.540]  Because if you're paid by how many prisoners you have,
[3:54:57.540 --> 3:54:58.540]  that's what you require.
[3:54:58.540 --> 3:55:02.540]  So when you see the state continuing to expand,
[3:55:02.540 --> 3:55:04.540]  that's the point.
[3:55:04.540 --> 3:55:06.540]  And when you think about the Democratic platform,
[3:55:06.540 --> 3:55:10.540]  the Democratic platform is that they help minorities and women.
[3:55:10.540 --> 3:55:12.540]  That's everything they talk about.
[3:55:12.540 --> 3:55:16.540]  It's just we're here because we're not racist
[3:55:16.540 --> 3:55:19.540]  and black people everywhere are like in a lot of pain
[3:55:19.540 --> 3:55:20.540]  and they're suffering.
[3:55:20.540 --> 3:55:23.540]  So if you run a business,
[3:55:23.540 --> 3:55:26.540]  what's the one thing you don't want to happen?
[3:55:26.540 --> 3:55:28.540]  You don't want to lose your brand.
[3:55:28.540 --> 3:55:31.540]  If the Democrats brand is helping women and black people,
[3:55:31.540 --> 3:55:34.540]  the worst possible thing that could happen for them
[3:55:34.540 --> 3:55:37.540]  is black people and women making more money,
[3:55:37.540 --> 3:55:41.540]  being more safe, having more freedoms.
[3:55:41.540 --> 3:55:43.540]  Because at that point,
[3:55:43.540 --> 3:55:44.540]  I'll tell you a quick story.
[3:55:44.540 --> 3:55:47.540]  My mom was in this thing called the Leche League
[3:55:47.540 --> 3:55:49.540]  when I was a little baby about breastfeeding
[3:55:49.540 --> 3:55:51.540]  and women, it all get together
[3:55:51.540 --> 3:55:54.540]  and they breastfeed babies and talk about sore nipples
[3:55:54.540 --> 3:55:56.540]  and pumps and all this stuff.
[3:55:56.540 --> 3:55:59.540]  And back then it was illegal to breastfeed in public
[3:55:59.540 --> 3:56:02.540]  and they were trying to overturn that law.
[3:56:02.540 --> 3:56:04.540]  So long story short, they do.
[3:56:04.540 --> 3:56:05.540]  Everything's awesome.
[3:56:05.540 --> 3:56:07.540]  Leche League doesn't go away though.
[3:56:07.540 --> 3:56:10.540]  I just looked it up recently
[3:56:10.540 --> 3:56:13.540]  and now they call it chestfeeding
[3:56:13.540 --> 3:56:16.540]  because now that they accomplished what their goal was,
[3:56:16.540 --> 3:56:17.540]  they need more customers.
[3:56:17.540 --> 3:56:20.540]  So now they're into trans guys.
[3:56:20.540 --> 3:56:21.540]  Can't make this up.
[3:56:21.540 --> 3:56:23.540]  I sent to my mom,
[3:56:23.540 --> 3:56:26.540]  she was fairly devastated as to what had happened
[3:56:26.540 --> 3:56:27.540]  to Leche League.
[3:56:27.540 --> 3:56:30.540]  So you create this sociopathic organism,
[3:56:30.540 --> 3:56:32.540]  anything like this.
[3:56:32.540 --> 3:56:34.540]  It's the same thing happened to the Defamation League
[3:56:34.540 --> 3:56:35.540]  and all this stuff.
[3:56:35.540 --> 3:56:37.540]  It starts off great.
[3:56:37.540 --> 3:56:39.540]  They have to accomplish a goal.
[3:56:39.540 --> 3:56:40.540]  And then once they do,
[3:56:40.540 --> 3:56:43.540]  they have to just keep going and growing and growing.
[3:56:43.540 --> 3:56:45.540]  That's why we have to keep freedom
[3:56:45.540 --> 3:56:47.540]  to the individual and the family
[3:56:47.540 --> 3:56:50.540]  because we're the failsafe.
[3:56:50.540 --> 3:56:53.540]  We're the off switch to this growth
[3:56:53.540 --> 3:56:56.540]  because these organizations don't have a heartbeat.
[3:56:56.540 --> 3:56:57.540]  They don't have a pulse.
[3:56:57.540 --> 3:57:00.540]  Corporations comes from corpus, which means body,
[3:57:00.540 --> 3:57:01.540]  but there is no body.
[3:57:01.540 --> 3:57:02.540]  It's vampiric, right?
[3:57:02.540 --> 3:57:07.540]  So the only way to survive all this,
[3:57:07.540 --> 3:57:09.540]  the government, corporations,
[3:57:09.540 --> 3:57:12.540]  things with no pulse that have appetites
[3:57:12.540 --> 3:57:16.540]  is with the individual and with the family.
[3:57:16.540 --> 3:57:19.540]  And as long as we keep that in mind,
[3:57:19.540 --> 3:57:22.540]  we can just keep on being American and awesome.
[3:57:22.540 --> 3:57:25.540]  But if we lose that,
[3:57:25.540 --> 3:57:28.540]  I mean, it all just starts falling apart.
[3:57:28.540 --> 3:57:30.540]  But I think that's going to be it for me.
[3:57:30.540 --> 3:57:33.540]  I hear the rock and guitar acts in the background.
[3:57:33.540 --> 3:57:35.540]  So if you want to keep in touch,
[3:57:35.540 --> 3:57:36.540]  youtube.com.
[3:57:36.540 --> 3:57:39.540]  So I'm showing Benjamin Comedy, hugedianist.com.
[3:57:39.540 --> 3:57:41.540]  And again, it's been an honor hosting the show.
[3:57:41.540 --> 3:58:06.540]  I'll see you next time.
[3:58:11.540 --> 3:58:37.540]  Thank you.
[3:58:37.540 --> 3:58:42.540]  Thank you all for your support.
[3:59:07.540 --> 3:59:32.540]  Thank you.
[3:59:32.540 --> 3:59:37.540]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow,
[3:59:37.540 --> 3:59:38.540]  look no further.
[3:59:38.540 --> 4:00:03.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
