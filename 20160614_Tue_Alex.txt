[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, the 14th day of June, 2016.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  Obviously, we're going to be talking about the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history that took place Saturday night.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  We've learned a lot more about this. I've studied Islam. I've studied the jihadist. I've studied the Wahhabist.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  And the more Wahhabist you get, the more you're into having sex with little boys.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  And the more you're also into going to gay nightclubs.
[01:12.000 --> 01:22.000]  And so I said, this is latent homosexual behavior. This is a guy obsessed with it, probably into it, who then is guilty about it.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  So he decides to run his jihad that he's going to launch for ISIS against the gay nightclub, which is exactly what we now learn.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  He frequented the place. He was there quite a bit and hung out with the folks there.
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  And this is just all part of the schizophrenia of Islam, where it talks about having sex with young boys and how that's okay.
[01:44.000 --> 01:53.000]  And young girls, but if an adult doesn't, you've got to be killed. I mean, it should be the opposite. You go after kids. That's when you have the problem.
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  Because they don't have the age of consent. See, that's how it is in the West. Everything is ass backwards.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  Orlando Shooter. Omar and my team was a regular at the Pulse Nightclub.
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  Customers had seen killer there before and several reports getting messages from him on gay dating apps.
[02:14.000 --> 02:23.000]  So he's out there going around the different apps online, reportedly, and it just, it just all fits the MO.
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  And he's got this family, this father, you know, going on the internet saying kill the gays and you've got his E-mom saying it.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  And none of that is really in the news. It's all how gun owners are evil. It's all how gun owners are bad.
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  It's all how we have to pay. In fact, Hillary Clinton has said it's the internet which she wants to censor. That's the problem and guns.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  And the FBI has come out and said he was radicalized on the internet. Okay, he traveled to Saudi Arabia repeatedly.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  That's where he actually went to get the final training.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  But the idea that like, well, the man used a car to run people over. He used the highway. He used a car.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  I saw the different Democrat run website headlines where she the gun that committed the crime.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  No, a gun didn't commit the crime. And I know our audience knows that.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  But Obama's not ruling out coming out the second amendment with more executive action.
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  Hillary says she wants to ban the semi-autos. This is incredible. When she's the lady that came out yesterday.
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  Who ordered the State Department not to investigate his mosque years ago as he was still in the State Department.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  And it just fits the same MO over and over and over again where they are protecting these people.
[03:38.000 --> 03:48.000]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump came out yesterday and said, look, we really have a stupid president. We have a moron president.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  He said, we're led by a fool to give you the actual quote.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  And he went on to say, or there's something else he knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  And the Washington Post came out and said that he was implying that Obama was behind it.
[04:03.000 --> 04:10.000]  No, he implied that Obama knows this stuff's going to happen is going to take our guns once the attacks start.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  That isn't saying Obama's running it, but he is opening the door up and bringing the people in, which is pretty much the same thing.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  So this is the case of Trump having his cake and eating it too and really dragging the media through the mud.
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  I personally love it where he puts it out there. They say what he really wants to say for him.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  He pulls back, doesn't get the heat, but still gets the truth out.
[04:32.000 --> 04:42.000]  A master tactician, the centipede is an incredible predator of other predators and injects its poison with twin fangs.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  All right, ladies, there's an internet meme if you don't know that lichens have to the centipede.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  Maybe we should play some of that today.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  Always cheers buckling up when we're out at brunch or something with the kids.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  We sit there and watch Donald Trump videos together.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  By consolidation of power first and then corruption, it's necessary consequence.
[05:11.000 --> 05:18.000]  It was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.000]  We now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.000]  To put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[05:41.000 --> 05:50.000]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlightened the people generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  This is Kit Daniels with info wars dot com.

[06:29.000 --> 06:33.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[06:33.000 --> 06:41.000]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[07:04.000 --> 07:12.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[07:12.000 --> 07:21.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[07:25.000 --> 07:35.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[07:35.000 --> 07:50.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[07:53.000 --> 08:11.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[08:11.000 --> 08:23.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:23.000 --> 08:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, the 14th of June, 2016, global transmission.
[08:32.000 --> 08:43.000]  Dr. Steve Puchenek, who the Jack Ryan character in Patriot Games is loosely based on, co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books, will be joining us.
[08:43.000 --> 08:57.000]  He, of course, has a psychiatrist, a medical doctor, a graduate of Harvard and MIT, and was the psych warfare head that way back at the Camp David Accords with the only successful peace treaty with the Muslims.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  And, of course, he's one of the founding members of Delta Force. The list just goes on and on.
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  He comes on every few months here. He's going to give us his breakdown on the Orlando event.
[09:08.000 --> 09:20.000]  Now, I wanted to get him on the last few months about a book he wrote about Europe escaping the Holocaust and coming finally to the United States via Cuba and then Canada.
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  And it goes through all the things that his mother went through. I've now read the book online. It's amazing.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  But he, instead of really getting to that, wants to cover Orlando, so that's fine.
[09:30.000 --> 09:37.000]  But it's a really interesting perspective of Puchenek because, I mean, he's somebody who actually had family down in the Holocaust.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  There are a lot of folks out there that claim they did, kind of like folks claiming they, you know, have cancer to raise money on the Internet or whatever.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  And a lot of times it turns out it's not true. But in Puchenek's case, it is true.
[09:47.000 --> 09:58.000]  He has a very interesting perspective on how some of the Jewish leadership blocked Jews getting out of Europe unless they paid money to the Jewish leadership to be able to get out of the country.
[09:58.000 --> 10:08.000]  So he can really break down the truly sickening underbelly of the Jewish mafia and what it basically did to his family and many others.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  And that's not really the full scope of the book, but you need to understand that went on.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  And that was very real. And I don't bring that out to demonize Jews.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  But criticism of Jewish mafia or Jewish organizations is not any semitism.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  So the Jewish mafia has hidden behind that for a long time and gotten away with a lot of its activities.
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  And of course, the Jewish mafia founded the ADL in 1913. You can look that up for yourself as well.
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  I'm going to expose the Saudi mafia, the Chinese Communist mafia, elements of the Jewish mafia.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  I'm going to expose the socialist German mafia, the socialist French mafia.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  I'm going to expose the globalists here in this country.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  I'm just going to expose organized crime across the board.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  Then expose the Russian mafia, the Japanese mafia, the Mexican mafia.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  I'm going to go after Mecha and La Raza.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  I'm going to go after all these groups that operate the same.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  Same with the Patriot mafia.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  And you can say the Patriot family, but see, it's an idea and anyone can be a member of it.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  It transcends how these other mafias base their operations.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  Because they make it about race or religion. They don't have to then actually deliver anything to their family.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  They can just all make it about we're in a group and they end up abusing and feeding on their own group nine times out of ten.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  Your own quote mafia is your worst nightmare.
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  I want a unified culture on the Bill of Rights Constitution, religious freedom, family freedom, incredibly low taxes,
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  based on stewardship, based on ingenuity, based on rugged individualism, based on inventiveness, based on exploration,
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  based on trailblazing, based on free association.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  It's called the Renaissance. I'm into it.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  And America is the great flower of that.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  But because we were so successful, we got infested with organized crime.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  People battling with each other for full control.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  And they've run the nation into the ground and we're going to be exposing it big time.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Got a call last night from Jesse Ventura at about five o'clock.
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.000]  I'd gone home early yesterday and to be with my children and he called me and he said,
[12:22.000 --> 12:32.000]  yeah, I may come on your show first tomorrow and break down the fact that my case that I won in the federal court for defamation against Chris Kyle.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  The sniper, America's most deadly sniper, Navy Seal.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  Then he called this morning and he said, no, I'm going to hold back.
[12:42.000 --> 12:50.000]  My lawyer wants me to hold back, but I'll come on your show first as soon as I decide to speak.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  But he told me some stuff and said, but you're welcome to repeat this on air or put it in an article.
[12:55.000 --> 13:08.000]  And I'll just say this, he's completely blown away because the federal overturn of his case had over 60 major corporations signed on to a lawsuit.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  Big media, the New York Times, CNN, you name it.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  News Corp saying we want to be able to lie.
[13:17.000 --> 13:26.000]  And we don't want there to be, when we're found guilty of lying, we don't want there to be any basically monetary payment for it.
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  And that's actually what the federal court is saying is that the media will be able to lie.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  And even if you win a case, there basically won't be any money.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  And of course, Ventura spent over a million and a half dollars on the suit.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.000]  Most of the money he has.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  And that's what he won.
[13:46.000 --> 14:01.000]  And the reason they overturned it, they said was the jury was allowed to know that Ventura was not suing the family and that there was insurance and that the widow had made over $45 million as of trial time on the book itself.
[14:01.000 --> 14:12.000]  And that the couple million dollars that Ventura was going to get just for basically his court costs and getting his name back was going to be paid by an insurance company.
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.000]  And Ventura was only able to bring that up in trial. They have the transcripts because they brought it up.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  We're like, this poor widow, he's suing her. He wants to make her, you know, basically bankrupt.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  And so Ventura's lawyers could come in who were some of the best in the country and go, oh, actually she's gotten $40 plus million off the book, tens of millions off the movie.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  And she doesn't even pay this. She keeps the money. The insurance company pays it.
[14:39.000 --> 14:47.000]  The publisher on the book alone had $20 million in coverage.
[14:47.000 --> 14:59.000]  Ventura was seeking a million and a half, going, shooting super low for what they'd spent on the trial where they fought them for two years, even getting it to court.
[14:59.000 --> 15:09.000]  So instead, Ventura trying to get his name back. And listen, I don't think Chris Call was a bad guy. People I know that know him say that, you know, the movie's pretty accurate. I think the guy was a patriot.
[15:09.000 --> 15:20.000]  I don't know how he got convinced or confused to say he beat up Ventura. Ventura didn't do it, has the witnesses, would never say things like that, that he's glad Navy Seals are dying.
[15:20.000 --> 15:30.000]  They're trying to destroy his name. And as soon as Chris Call's story started degenerating, magically somebody killed him up in Dallas at a shooting range, if you really believe that.
[15:30.000 --> 15:39.000]  And craft or people dressed in craft uniforms were at the Boston bombing, probably there running security, guys with black backpacks and tan wearing punisher hats.
[15:39.000 --> 15:47.000]  We began to investigate that, not saying they were involved, but saying Obama clearly was protecting the bombers or whoever they were connected to.
[15:47.000 --> 15:56.000]  One of the brothers was on CIA payroll. That came out in the Boston Globe. It was on local Boston radio that morning they were running a drill of a bombing.
[15:56.000 --> 16:06.000]  I don't know exactly what happened, but there's a cover up. Is it to cover up a Saudi connection? I don't know, but there's something going on there.
[16:06.000 --> 16:24.000]  The media misrepresented and says that, you know, I say that Chris Kyle did it. That's not what we ever said. We just said that. That's how Crafts International addresses. They were tan, boots, pants, jackets, black backpacks and punisher hats.
[16:24.000 --> 16:35.000]  He popularized that. Could have been somebody else. We just said, wow, that's a Crafts International contractor outfit. Boom, he's dead right after that.
[16:35.000 --> 16:47.000]  Okay, I mean, it's like Pat Tillman. I've talked to his brother. Pat Tillman was going to come out about government growing the opium, how we were working and not stopping the Taliban in Al Qaeda, which later all came out.
[16:47.000 --> 16:56.000]  They killed him and the army coroner, who was a colonel, would not lie in the autopsy and said he was murdered. He was executed.
[16:56.000 --> 17:09.000]  They shot him and fell behind a rock, his own unit. He said, what are you doing? It's me. It's me. He jumped up going, what is your effing problem? They shot him again and then came up and did a single burst, three shots right across the front of the face.
[17:09.000 --> 17:23.000]  It feet away, powder burns, read the autopsy. They shot him, didn't take him down because of body armor, crept up on him and killed him better than a hammer.
[17:23.000 --> 17:31.000]  Private Lynch was going to be the feminist icon of how the men cowered in fear, but she defeated them all. None of it was true.
[17:31.000 --> 17:46.000]  Her own unit started speaking out. They killed four of them in one week. People B having a barbecue at their house and a guy in a black uniform and a mask would pop up and double tap him in the head at 50 yards and then pop back down.
[17:46.000 --> 17:57.000]  Or you'd get pulled over and then be found dead in a puddle of water. And then Lynch came out and said, it's all fake. It's all fake. I was told to lie. Jerry Bruckheimer was producing it. It was all, yeah, Jerry Bruckheimer.
[17:57.000 --> 18:06.000]  Now I don't bring all this out because I'm against our military. I bring all this out because I'm against it being used in these ways and these type of propaganda pieces.
[18:06.000 --> 18:16.000]  So I don't know what happened with Chris Kyle. Okay. And I'm not even choosing sides here. I know Jesse Ventura. I'm the one that gave him the news. They waited until he drove in his RV to Mexico to announce all this.
[18:16.000 --> 18:27.000]  And he said, you're joking, Alex. That's not true. Come on. And then I told him he was blown away and he spent all this time. And look, I disagree with Ventura on a lot of his politics, but the guy's for real.
[18:27.000 --> 18:41.000]  He means well. And they tried to destroy his good name so he couldn't run for president. That's what all this was about. Kyle got roped in. I guarantee it. News Corps talked him into putting that section in the book as a Psyop.
[18:41.000 --> 18:55.000]  And either that or the Boston bombing is the reason he was executed. I don't buy this story that some guy with PTSD out the shooting range, you know, did this and all the rest of it. I mean, give me a break.
[18:55.000 --> 19:05.000]  So I'm done talking about that because we got so much news on the situation in Orlando. Hillary sanctions coming after our guns, all the rest of it.
[19:05.000 --> 19:18.000]  Briefly, I'm going to do my first ever Reddit Ask Me Anything tonight. 6 to 8 o'clock. There'll be a video feed free for everybody at infowars.com forward slash AMA.

[19:58.000 --> 20:10.000]  This is Ron Paul. I'm a former 22 year congressman and Republican presidential candidate. I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[20:10.000 --> 20:18.000]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious drought. We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[20:18.000 --> 20:28.000]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that. A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared. It's a home freeze dryer.

[21:16.000 --> 21:24.000]  Life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[21:38.000 --> 21:45.000]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for infill-wars listeners.
[21:45.000 --> 21:54.000]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[21:54.000 --> 22:09.000]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.

[23:21.000 --> 23:36.000]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year. Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad.
[23:36.000 --> 23:44.000]  But boy was he stubborn. He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it. He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[23:44.000 --> 23:59.000]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father. Don't wait. Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones. Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[24:14.000 --> 24:32.000]  On a Winner's Day. On a Winner's Day. I'd be safe if I was in LA. If I was in LA. California California dreaming.
[24:32.000 --> 24:52.000]  By the way, the graphic I had up on screen earlier said AMA was tomorrow. Might ask me anything. No, it's today. Okay, so I just wanted everybody to know that. The ask me anything is today, Tuesday, 6 o'clock Central Time, infowars.com forward slash AMA.
[24:52.000 --> 25:07.000]  Now, I know I said that on air too, so that's good. Everybody knows that. Tuesday. Today is Tuesday. That's what we're going to be doing it. So, I want to play this Donald Trump clip here. This is Donald Trump yesterday.
[25:07.000 --> 25:21.000]  And then the Washington Post came out and said that he was implying Obama did it. No, the implication is that Obama just doesn't care and has some other plan like coming after our guns. That's what Donald Trump is saying. Here's the clip.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  What about the military strike? Where would you strike overseas?
[25:24.000 --> 25:35.000]  I'd strike, well, you know, they know. We have generals. And I've been with them and I've talked to them. We have generals that feel we can win this thing so fast and so strong.
[25:35.000 --> 25:46.000]  But we have to be furious for a short period of time. And we're not doing it. I said go after the oil, hit the oil. They announced when they're going to hit the oil because they want the people to leave their trucks.
[25:46.000 --> 25:55.000]  I mean, the whole thing is so ridiculous. Can you imagine General Patton saying, please get out of your trucks because we're going to start dropping bombs in one hour?
[25:55.000 --> 26:11.000]  This is the way we fight. We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind. And there's something else in mind. You know, people can't believe it.
[26:11.000 --> 26:22.000]  People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism.
[26:22.000 --> 26:31.000]  There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on. The man has no clue. He doesn't know what he's doing. And Hillary Clinton is going to be worse than him.
[26:31.000 --> 26:38.000]  She wants to increase people coming into our country from the areas I'm talking about by 500%.
[26:38.000 --> 26:48.000]  All right. And now he's saying, because the Washington Post came out and said that he was saying Obama was behind the Orlando attack, that he's pulled their press credentials.
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.000]  Because that's not what he said. He's kind of having his cake and eating it too, though. What he's saying is we're being soft on Islamic terror.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  We're not going after where they're actually based. We're not going after their funding. And so Obama's the biggest fool in the world or something else is going on.
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  And that is they're letting Islamic State come in and take over Syria. That's been declassified. That's been in the news for over a year.
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  You heard it here first four or five years ago. So that's what's going on. And that's what he's saying.
[27:19.000 --> 27:31.000]  They tailor that, though, to say that he's saying Orlando was basically run by Obama. And that's not what Donald Trump said.
[27:31.000 --> 27:43.000]  Now, I will say that criminal elements of our government opening the borders up, allowing these radicalizers in, allowing these imams in who weren't born here to come in and hype up native born people.
[27:43.000 --> 27:57.000]  First generation like this Afghan clearly is contributing to it. So if Obama and Hillary want to point their finger at the American people and say that it's our fault that all this is going on and that gun owners are to blame
[27:57.000 --> 28:07.000]  and all the rest of this bull, then clearly we can say you are to blame by that yardstick because gun owners have nothing to do with this.
[28:07.000 --> 28:19.000]  You are the people at the State Department and the Justice Department that have been coddling these imams, his very imam at his very mosque saying kill the gays, kill the homosexuals.
[28:19.000 --> 28:29.000]  I mean, it's crazy. You can have this guy running around with his imam and his daddy saying kill the homosexuals. He's hanging around over at the gay bar feeling guilty about it.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  So he decides to go to Saudi Arabia, get radicalized, and then come back and kill people.
[28:35.000 --> 28:51.000]  He's got a psychiatrist joining us, Dr. Steve Puchenick, not just assassin and the whole nine yards, to break all this down and get his take on it coming up in the next hour so you do not want to miss that information.
[28:51.000 --> 29:01.000]  And then Dr. Bill Warner was on with this for the first time ever just last week, but we're having him back on today because he predicted that this Jihad attacks were about to start and about to be increasing.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  So he'll be joining us when we have open phones when both gentlemen are on with us today.
[29:07.000 --> 29:21.000]  Alright, I'm going to settle down now and I'm going to try to come back and because I get really mad about this mass shooting, I get really mad when they're trying to guilt yours truly and all of you out there and blame us
[29:21.000 --> 29:33.000]  and tell us that we collectively are to blame when all of, oh, I forgot the stabbing attack killing people with a Jihadi in France today.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  I mean, there's so much of it, I can't even keep track of it. And it was somebody the guy knew and was friends with. What is it about these guys?
[29:39.000 --> 29:49.000]  They pick people they know that they think are wimpy and Jesus is even more evil though. They kill people they know. This guy's running around on gay apps and he goes and kills them.
[29:49.000 --> 29:59.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.000 --> 30:10.000]  The Bilderberg 2016 public agenda says they won't be talking about the usual items like China, Russia, the Middle East technology, but there's one new item, the precariat.
[30:10.000 --> 30:20.000]  It's a term coined by a UK economist to describe what he sees as the precarious proletariat. He calls him a dangerous class of people who've been harmed by globalism.
[30:20.000 --> 30:27.000]  According to his book, which is one of only 10 subjects to be covered at Bilderberg, he breaks down society into several classes.
[30:27.000 --> 30:41.000]  Under the small number of super rich elite who are meeting at Bilderberg are the salatariat. Then there's the professional technicians. He calls proficient. Then we come to the dangerous ones, the precariat, who work menial, low paying jobs.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  So how do the elite propose to control the precariat that he says are an incipient political monster?
[30:47.000 --> 30:57.000]  Well, he proposes giving every legal resident of a country money without a job to create a permanent dependent class. What HG Wells called the Eloi.
[30:57.000 --> 31:15.000]  For info wars.com, I'm David Knight, not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[31:15.000 --> 31:29.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[31:29.000 --> 31:41.000]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[31:41.000 --> 31:51.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live.com and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body period.

[32:56.000 --> 33:24.000]  Triple eight to five three three one three nine from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[33:24.000 --> 33:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is so hard for me to deal with to watch the evil people in our controlled corporate media and their stupid domesticated camp followers.
[33:51.000 --> 34:10.000]  All over the news, just blaming gun owners, blaming conservatives, blaming American gun culture for a man who's pledged allegiance to ISIS, a man who had a gun license and worked as a contractor for one of the biggest mercenary companies out there.
[34:10.000 --> 34:22.000]  A man who was on gay apps, a guy that trafficked the bar and was there basically stalking his prey.
[34:22.000 --> 34:37.000]  And we have imams on TV lecturing us about don't sensationalize this. And this isn't Islam. Look at what's happening in Islamic countries all over the world. They're running around killing each other 24 seven, even where they have gun bands in some countries.
[34:37.000 --> 34:45.000]  Europe brings in 5 million of the last three years. We bring in massive, massive numbers. Donald Trump says we're going to have more attacks.
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.000]  And then when he's proven right, the media taxi.
[34:51.000 --> 35:10.000]  This is truly the death of common sense. And then his brother is involved in bringing in refugees and as Homeland Security contracts. They're not even vetted. They make all this money off of it. And people at his work said he was making threats that he was going to carry out terror attacks and had connections to terror groups.
[35:10.000 --> 35:24.000]  And the FBI wasn't allowed to go after him by Hillary Clinton and the State Department. WorldNet Daily has the FBI and Secret Service whistleblowers. They're coming on the show in the next few days. They broke the news Sunday. No coverage.
[35:24.000 --> 35:43.000]  They wrote about their article, Kit Daniels did. Hillary Clinton State Department blocked investigation into Orlando Shooters Mosque. Drudge links to it. But still, it gets over a million people that read it the last 24 hours. But no mainstream media coverage because there's a blackout.
[35:43.000 --> 36:01.000]  Just like with Roger Stone. Band on MSNBC. Band on CNN. Band in all these publications. And they say he's banned because he's too effective. And they tell him, even when he is about to go on Newsmax or other channels, don't bring up the rape.
[36:01.000 --> 36:13.000]  But there's one guy they can't censor. That's Donald Trump. When he goes on Fox, he brings up the rape word. They say, oh, be nice, Donald. That's how you're going to beat Hillary. No, taking the gloves off, which he's done is how he's going to do it.
[36:13.000 --> 36:29.000]  So I want to say happy birthday to Donald Trump. 70 years old today, I'm told. Well, that's Roger, if that's accurate. And I want to say congratulations from not backing down for being hardcore and for bringing up the rape and bringing up the abuse and bringing up the narcotics
[36:29.000 --> 36:43.000]  and bringing up all the dead bodies and bringing up Vince Foster and bringing up all the things that are happening. And pointing out that crooked Hillary is a nightmare.
[36:43.000 --> 36:59.000]  Well, let's all tweet happy birthday at real Donald Trump. Hero born on Flag Day. Well, all I know is it's very exciting to know that I bet on the right pony over a year ago. I don't mean that he'll even win. I think he will.
[36:59.000 --> 37:09.000]  That we bet on the right pony for the guy that just gets more hardcore and more stalwart as he goes. So how is the mainstream media going to spin this?
[37:09.000 --> 37:20.000]  Trump says there will be more Bernadinos, San Bernardino's shootings. There will be more Russell's Belgium attacks. And then people congratulate him on being accurate trying to defend America.
[37:20.000 --> 37:29.000]  He says, thank you for congratulating me. And they go, oh, he's congratulating himself as if he was involved in the shooting. See, now it's his fault.
[37:29.000 --> 37:45.000]  Well, Roger Stone joins us to talk about this and also talk about his article from Breitbart.com. It's time America got some answers about Huma Abedin, who a lot of experts we've had on believe is a Saudi Arabian spy.
[37:45.000 --> 37:56.000]  She has all the cutouts, all the backgrounds. Why is the White House standing down on Islamic terror? Trump comes out and says he's the biggest moron, the biggest fool ever, or he knows something we don't know.
[37:56.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's another agenda. That's backing ISIS to take over the Middle East, which has been documented. They spin it and say, oh, Orlando's what he meant. No, that's not what he was talking about.
[38:06.000 --> 38:13.000]  He's talking about bombing the trucks, the oil trucks. Why are you giving them warnings? Why are you letting them get to shelter? Why are you aiding and betting them?
[38:13.000 --> 38:26.000]  You know, Sy Hersh went public six months ago on my show and said, you were correct. Your guests were correct. For five years, our government's been ordered to back al Qaeda and now ISIS in Syria.
[38:26.000 --> 38:36.000]  And our military has told Obama not to be part of it. Obama, folks, is allied with radical Islam. And Roger Stone is here, the consummate, trumpinsiderstonesone.com, to talk about it with us.
[38:36.000 --> 38:54.000]  Roger, thanks for coming on. Obviously, a lot is happening. Obviously, Trump is just surging in the polls, but let's talk all things Trump. But first off, this Hillary's girlfriend, Aberdeen, and this whole Saudi connection and the rest of it, I think ties together.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  Do you think I'm on the trail of the bloodhound here or am I off target?
[38:59.000 --> 39:13.000]  These are entirely related issues. What's happened in the last several days, as you know, has validated the very premise of Donald Trump's campaign, and that being that we need to seal our borders.
[39:13.000 --> 39:23.000]  We need an aggressive plan to destroy ISIS. Hillary Clinton, in truth, created ISIS. It was the policies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[39:23.000 --> 39:34.000]  And yes, George W. Bush, that both created ISIS and have armed ISIS. Now, ISIS is our worst enemy, and the problem has come to our shores.
[39:34.000 --> 39:52.000]  So I think Trump's campaign theme has been entirely validated. And while we're at it, I have written a very provocative piece, which I knew would be provocative, which I lay out the facts regarding the sheik and exotic and well connected Huma Abedin.
[39:52.000 --> 40:08.000]  The right hand henchwoman of Hillary Clinton. She and her family through her academic career, through her parents, various connections are very clearly tied to groups that funded bin Laden.
[40:08.000 --> 40:22.000]  I mean, I pose really three questions. Now, yesterday, Keith Oberman attacked me, David Brock attacked me, a spokesman for Hillary attacked me, and even Huma herself responded.
[40:22.000 --> 40:42.000]  I just would like the American people to hear Hillary answer three simple questions. What is Huma's relationship with Abdul Omar Nasif, who is the radical who employed both of her parents and her brothers, who founded the Muslim World League,
[40:42.000 --> 40:56.000]  and more importantly, founded the Rabitha Trust. The Rabitha Trust was declared by the Bush administration to be a terror organization and a partial funding of the activities of bin Laden.
[40:56.000 --> 41:20.000]  So this is not conjecture. Why after 9 11 wasn't this pointed out radical Muslim connections of Huma Abedin ever got a top security clearance. Now, I understand she's beautiful and I understand she's exotic and I understand she's socially well connected.
[41:20.000 --> 41:35.000]  Now, I understand she is the wife of Congressman Carlos Danger, Anthony Weiner, but she tweeted yesterday in response to my piece, one can be a Muslim and a loyal American. Yes, one can.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  This has nothing to do with being a Muslim. It has to do with being a Philly.
[41:41.000 --> 41:51.000]  And again, we're having a Mr. Stone. Hold on one moment. Your sky is breaking. I'm just a bit. I want you to be able to recalibrate and rejoin with us here. And we're also putting on screen for TV.
[41:51.000 --> 42:00.000]  We're going to need to disconnect him for a moment, please so that that doesn't happen. He's lost his audio feed from us to him. So we need to reconnect with Roger Stone. Thank you.
[42:00.000 --> 42:17.000]  Now, continuing. I'm going to calm down right now. I'm having some anger issues today. OK, but the they're launching the Tet offensive, the globalists are making their move against our guns.
[42:17.000 --> 42:24.000]  There's no doubt they're going to put us into a great depression. There's no doubt their secret weapon is radical jihad. There's no doubt they hate the bitter clingers.
[42:24.000 --> 42:33.000]  There's no doubt that our country is run by Pierce scum. OK, so I'm fundamentally upset about this and I am fundamentally just in general.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  Mad.
[42:36.000 --> 42:51.000]  About the fact that we have traders running our government and running our country that are now saying we're going to come after our guns. It makes me fundamentally want to throw up.
[42:51.000 --> 42:57.000]  Now, I'm going to stop right there.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.000]  I'm going to play some clips. OK, let's go ahead and look at these clips here and tell folks which clips I want to pull up.
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.000]  There's a report here.
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  Where Hillary Clinton says abortions are a constitutional right.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  But the right to bear arms isn't.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  So let's go ahead and play a short clip.
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  Of that.
[43:26.000 --> 43:46.000]  Thank you for being there for every woman in every state who has to miss work, drive hundreds of miles sometimes, endure cruel medically unnecessary waiting periods, walk past angry protesters to exercise her constitutional right
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  to safe and legal abortion.
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.000]  Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?
[43:55.000 --> 44:02.000]  If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulations.
[44:02.000 --> 44:17.000]  And what people have done with that decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the Republic where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms.
[44:17.000 --> 44:29.000]  So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right.
[44:29.000 --> 44:44.000]  They have no objection to that, but the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regulatory responsible actions to protect everyone else.
[44:44.000 --> 44:53.000]  Okay, so this guy had a Homeland Security clearance was doing work bringing refugees in with his uncle had a gun license.
[44:53.000 --> 45:02.000]  And the FBI tried to stop him twice was ordered to stand down by the Justice Department and the State Department that Hillary was running.
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  Hillary State Department blocked investigation to Orlando killer's mosque, further proof.
[45:07.000 --> 45:22.000]  Hillary funded the rise of ISIS and then meanwhile, 20% of her campaign is from the Saudis alone and her foundation got over $100 million from the Gulf States that locked women up and treat them worse than dogs.
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.000]  And then we have another one of these bizarre narcissistic clowns.
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  But when he's not on the gay apps or whatever, he's going into a nightclub and killing 49 people.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  We have Roger Stone back.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  And he's written the articles of Roger Stone.
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  It's time America got some answers about Huma Abedin.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  Roger Stone, again, joining us now be a phone Roger, please continue.
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  You know, Alex, this is disappointing so because I'm so damn handsome.
[45:52.000 --> 46:00.000]  You know, I hate to do it this way, but in any event, to get back to where we were, I think you make exactly the point.
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  Hillary and her husband have taken hundreds of millions of dollars from regimes that not only oppress women.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  It's time to just arrest their asses.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  It's time to just fricking throw them in Irons, man.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  What more do we have to put up from these people?
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  And why are they allied with Islam?
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  What freak show is this that we have these freaks running up?
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  Roger, I'm sorry.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  I'm really getting fed up, okay?
[46:22.000 --> 46:29.000]  But Alex, the answer is an honest attorney general appointed by a president who puts the interests of the United States,
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  not radical Islam and political correctness first.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  You are not going to get an honest government from this administration.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  You are not going to get fair adjudication of the law from Loretta Lynch.
[46:42.000 --> 46:50.000]  I don't know, I feel badly for the FBI director who's known as a man of integrity, a real by the book guy.
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  He works for a president for whom the law does not matter.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  And it is any manner of crime.
[46:57.000 --> 47:03.000]  I mean, why is Huma Abidin allowed to triple dip, getting a full-time salary from the State Department,
[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  a full-time salary from Taneo Strategies, a lobby firm that represents many of those same oppressive regimes we're talking about?
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.000]  Because in the politically correct freak zone of America, as long as you're some stupid protected group,
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  you can commit any crimes you want, including funding ISIS, murdering 300,000 Christians in Syria.
[47:22.000 --> 47:34.000]  Well, and in all honesty, the attacks on gays in Orlando puts a very significant crimp into the far-left Democratic coalition.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  My gay friends are worried about three things.
[47:37.000 --> 47:45.000]  One, their security. They don't want to go to a club or a public place and be killed by some radical Islamic maniac.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  Number two, my gay friends want jobs. They want opportunity.
[47:49.000 --> 47:57.000]  They want a strong country and a vibrant economy so they can do well, so they can adopt children, so they can have families,
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  so they can get married. That's what my gay friends care about.
[48:00.000 --> 48:12.000]  And the number of gay Americans who are telling me they are for Trump because they believe he will protect gays and all Americans from the threat of Islam.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  Well, I mean, here's the bottom line. Explain the calculus to me. They're bringing in all these radicals.
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  They're blocking the FBI from stopping them. The San Bernardino people going back and forth between Saudi Arabia, this freak, all these people.
[48:23.000 --> 48:29.000]  They know they're going to attack. They know that's only going to make Trump more popular. Why are they allowing this to happen?
[48:29.000 --> 48:41.000]  Well, because I don't think they understand that. I think that this is an attempt to going back to Sidney Blumenthal's original strategy to maximize the turnout of the left.
[48:41.000 --> 48:54.000]  They see this as a numbers game, particularly in those instances where they can vote illegals, which they are, they on the left have always been adept at doing through the city machines and the other community organizations.
[48:54.000 --> 49:07.000]  So they aren't trying to appeal to anybody in the center. Unlike Bill Clinton, who tried to at least move the imagery of his party to the center and bring back white working class Democrats in the far west himself.
[49:07.000 --> 49:18.000]  Hillary has adopted the Obama strategy. Get every left-wing whack job and or minority voter out humanly possible and hope that you outnumber the other side.
[49:18.000 --> 49:34.000]  That's the strategy. So she is not going to call Islamic terrorism what it is the fundamental danger of today. Probably the greatest single challenge other than insolvency facing the country today.
[49:34.000 --> 49:48.000]  It really does show their broken coalition strategy that they just want Balkanization. But don't the Democrats get they're going to have the albatross around their neck forever as sleeper cells pop off every month, every week for the next decade.
[49:48.000 --> 50:04.000]  And I don't think you understand how delusional they are. They think by Trump calling for closing our borders, building a wall, stepping up security and crushing ISIS. They think that makes him look like a xenophobic right wing maniac.
[50:04.000 --> 50:19.000]  You're right. They're in their own freak show echo chamber where they're trying to tell people you can't say mother or father because it's hurtful to people that don't have mother or fathers. You can't have dodgeball. You can't have Halloween parties because costumes might be hurtful.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  This is a cult.
[50:21.000 --> 50:37.000]  You know, this is this is this is epic. I mean, yesterday David Brock says in a Twitter feed, Huma Abedin is a fine public servant, which is more than I can say for Roger Stone. Wait a minute. Public servant would imply she was only on the taxpayers payroll.
[50:37.000 --> 50:52.000]  In fact, she was getting paid by the Tanao lobbying group in the Clinton Foundation, triple dipping. So I don't know what he's talking about. And then Keith Oberman said, how does it feel to have worked your whole life in politics and now being a flying monkey for Donald Trump?
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  To which I respond, at least I can keep a job.
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.000]  Well said. I mean, all they do is attack us when we're just saying common sense stuff.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  So here's the point that Alex, they can't refute the facts.
[51:07.000 --> 51:16.000]  Huma's ties to the most radical brand of Islam through her parents, through brothers, through now, now chief are all indisputable.
[51:16.000 --> 51:24.000]  They are indisputable and they have been certified by the US government. So rather than argue with the fact, they attack the person who delivers the facts.
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  Oh, he's a conspiracy theorist. Well, really?
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  The conspiracy sealed the 28 pages of the congressional inquiry into what really happened.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  That's right. Well, bottom line, Hillary Clinton's girlfriend is a Saudi spy. Is that the headline?
[51:37.000 --> 51:44.000]  I don't know whether she is Hillary's handler, whether she's an asset. I mean, you don't know how deep it goes.
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  Well, all I know is they stay in the same bedroom together when they travel.
[51:47.000 --> 51:54.000]  That is, there is evidence that that is accurate. But again, the left wants to say, oh.
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  Why couldn't Hillary get a good looking girlfriend? Why don't you like a Marilyn Monroe or something? This woman looks...
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Looks like bin Laden.
[52:02.000 --> 52:12.000]  I think that Huma is stunning. If you go to my 2015 Stone Zone Best and Worst Dressed list, which I do every January,
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  and that 10-year tradition, which I adopted for Mr. Black, you'll find her on my list.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  She looks great whether she's going to a UN cocktail party or a Muslim brother bombing.
[52:22.000 --> 52:29.000]  Well, I'm not, and I shouldn't be doing low blows against Hillary's girlfriend. I'm just baiting the media into picking this up.
[52:29.000 --> 52:35.000]  But hey, let's shift gears, Roger Stone, for a moment, because they're obviously not going to be able to block this forever.
[52:35.000 --> 52:43.000]  It's coming out. How are things really going for the campaign? I mean, you always give us the straight shot. How is team Trump doing?
[52:43.000 --> 52:54.000]  I think Monday may have been the best day that Trump campaign has today, in the sense that he is back to dominating the dialogue.
[52:54.000 --> 53:04.000]  This election is going to be decided largely on the question of who can deal with domestic terrorists who plan to kill many, many people
[53:04.000 --> 53:12.000]  between now and the election day and after. If you believe Hillary Clinton is better suited to handle that problem, then you should vote for her.
[53:12.000 --> 53:21.000]  On the other hand, Trump is back on his strong suit. This has validated his central argument that we need to secure our borders.
[53:21.000 --> 53:32.000]  So I think he's back on, often, the major, major speech on the Clinton's corruption, which was scheduled for Monday, is still in the work, as I understand it.
[53:32.000 --> 53:43.000]  And it will be a devastating narrative. The foibles of the Clinton Foundation and the epic corruption there in which foreign nations are paying, like Russia, like China, like Saudis,
[53:43.000 --> 53:52.000]  are paying for favors in preferential treatment, while it has gotten some good coverage from the New York Times, largely the mainstream media has sought to ignore it.
[53:52.000 --> 54:02.000]  Sure. So the question is, is the establishment going to let a foreign multinational coup take place in America? Because we will be fully conquered if Hillary,
[54:02.000 --> 54:13.000]  who's totally blackmailed, gets into power, blackmailed by all these disparate interests that have treated her like a vending machine where they put money in and get out of it what they want.
[54:13.000 --> 54:24.000]  It's truly, truly, truly outrageous. And it does show their disconnect. Hillary, whose State Department protected this very person, this monster, now blaming the Second Amendment.
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  I think they've really miscalculated. What do you think, Roger Stone?
[54:29.000 --> 54:38.000]  Well, I mean, what's really amazing is if Al Capone were alive today, he would be in awe at what they had built at the Clinton Foundation.
[54:38.000 --> 54:47.000]  I mean, this is an international pay-for-play scheme. It is the largest single money laundering operation in U.S. history.
[54:47.000 --> 55:02.000]  And the Clintons have taken millions of dollars both through the Foundation and through their phony global initiative and through their phony speeches directly to their pockets, hundreds of millions of dollars of people buying decisions in Washington.
[55:02.000 --> 55:10.000]  And I look forward to a time when, Hillary, who says she is an advocate for women, I'd like to hear from the women of Libya.
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  How have they fared under the regime change there that was fought against?
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  And the same thing in Syria. Roger Stone, I always appreciate your time.
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.000]  In closing, what do you make of this whole Washington Post situation where Trump says they're kicked off the campaign?
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  I mean, that's fine with me because they're obviously globalist operatives in many ways.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  But at the same time, I mean, he's talking about, hey, we should have bombed the trucks. We shouldn't give them an hour's notice.
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.000]  Either Obama's a fool or he's got another agenda. Clearly, he's not talking about the Orlando shooting there.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  He's saying Obama has the gloves on when it comes to fighting ISIS.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  Well, we know that. But what is Trump so mad about? In fact, they tried to misrepresent it as Orlando?
[55:51.000 --> 55:58.000]  The Washington Post is the single most dishonest publication in the history of American journalism.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  They were wrong about Watergate. They were wrong about Iran-Contra.
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.000]  They were wrong about the Iraq War. And they're wrong about the current situation.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  I have a piece that I will be publishing shortly, a 5,000-word piece called The Lies of Bob Woodward.
[56:12.000 --> 56:24.000]  And I traced how he is a pathological liar who has lied about every major historical event in his reputorial career.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  Sure, isn't he really just an able intelligence front?
[56:27.000 --> 56:38.000]  I say Bravo, and some place, believe me, some place, Dick Nixon is giving the thumbs up over Trump's trashing of the Washington Post.
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.000]  Well, what I was about to say, it's clearly a foreign intelligence cut out. I mean, Bilderberg Group basically runs it. They admit that.
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.000]  Well, it has always had a traditional, close ties to the Central Intelligence Agency.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  Socially, the Grams mixed with Angleton and Meyer, and that's their social set.
[56:56.000 --> 57:05.000]  It is interesting that shortly after the death of John F. Kennedy, former President Harry Truman, wrote an op-ed piece in which he said
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.000]  that approving the formation of the CIA was the greatest mistake he made as president, that it had become a rogue government unto itself.
[57:12.000 --> 57:18.000]  That ran for one addition, and then it was spiked by the publishers.
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.000]  That's right. And of course, the CIA itself is basically a foreign intelligence group set up by the British.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  I'm not saying the British run us, but it's like a multinational combine.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  And of course, your books break that down. They're all available at infowarstore.com and stonezone.com.
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.000]  Roger, thank you for the update. I look forward to having you on very soon.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  Alex, great to be with you as always.

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  I see your hair is burning, hills are filled with fire, if they say I never loved you, you know they are a liar.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Oh, the cops and cars.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  We're going to the cops and cars, the topless boss.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Go to Dr. Steve Piccini coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  We just talked to Roger Stone about Hillary Clinton's girlfriend, and look, I'm not even mad she's got a girlfriend that's an operative of the Saudis.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  It's that she's an operative of the Saudis, and then our country is overrun by foreign interest, and the political class has basically legalized by fiat at the top,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  selling us out to anybody and everybody. It's kind of like the big mega banks decided 20 years ago under Clinton to change the laws, the Republicans went along with it,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  to where they could sell the same houses mortgage twice.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  And once they did that, within a few months, they said, how about we sell it three times? How about five times? How about 10 times? How about 20 times?
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  How about 30 times? In some cases, we looked this up, your home mortgage was sold to investors more than 100 times.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  This is the con artist cult that we have running things that used to they cared of nuclear reactors were leaking, they cared.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  They tried to stop them from that.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Used to they closed reactors after about 25, 30 years. Now they just leave them open and just say, we're not even going to do safety upgrades and stuff.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  We're just going to let them leak and blow up.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  And you say, but why they go, we make more money.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And you say, but there won't be any planet left of you.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  It'll be uninhabitable. And they just look at you and just giggle and snicker. And all they care about is going to country clubs and acting rich and flying around on helicopters and wearing the newest, finest French and Italian dresses.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  Seriously.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  They don't care about hypocrisy where.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  Schmidt, the head of Google has his girlfriends wear hoods over their heads, like Michael Jackson would do to his adopted kids.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Because he wants them to have privacy.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  But then he says, you're dumb.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  If you think you have any privacy and shouldn't do anything on the Internet, you don't want to be known publicly.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  This is after decades of them telling us it was all private while they suckered us in.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  You people are delusional, megalomaniacs and something else has happened.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  The attention span of most people has gone down to about seven seconds.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  That of a goldfish.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  And I don't think there'll be any human society left in 10 years.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  I think you're going to start just seeing people.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  Just not even get out of bed soon.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  No one has memories.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Most people don't.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  There are a lot of folks that still are competent and are professional and have brains.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  But I'm telling you people, there's so much stimuli and so much stuff that just in general stuff is breaking down right now.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  Things are breaking down right now.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  And God help us is all I can say.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  God help us.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Because we have crazy people running things.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  I mean, we have top generals all over Fox News and CNN saying, let's just go ahead and attack Russia.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Let's go ahead and kill hundreds of thousands of them and put them in body bags.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  That'll teach them to submit to us when you're up on their border attacking them.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  No, killing hundreds of thousands of people will get us in a giant nuclear war, dumbass.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  It won't teach the Russians anything.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  You stupid moron.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  If you knew any history or common sense, you'd know that.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  But you know that.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  You'd rather sit up there in your suit with a bunch of sycophants and be the national security advisor to Fox News.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Oh general, tell us how to get tough.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Tell us how to end the world, you stupid, stupid, bloated maggot.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  You people don't have souls.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  I'm telling you right now.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  People like that are gone.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  You're gone.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  You're an enemy of humanity.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  You're an enemy of progress.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  You're an enemy of the species and your dog crap.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  The future generations of entrepreneurs can have a solar system as dynamic and interesting and varied as what we see on the Internet today.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  I think you go to space to save Earth.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  Luxury playgrounds for a few ultra-elite who are astronomically wealthy.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  So who would have a monopoly on manufacturing and energy by controlling the most valuable real estate in the galaxy, the Earth and Moon Lagrangian points?
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  That would be the billionaires who own rockets and politicians.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  The ultimate agenda 21.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Discover the secret.

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis. Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days, rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  Guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  We just really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered, that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem. Us.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  Part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  I am inside. I have two words for you. Predator drones.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  You will never see it coming.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  They let them in the area. They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want a commentator.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  Dr. Steve Pacinic is a frequent guest of ours. He's been coming on since 2002.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  He's been exposing the fact that criminal elements of multinational agglomerates are working with radical Islam, Saudi Arabia and others to bring in a police state in the west.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  And of course the payoff to Saudi Arabia is they get to control the Middle East.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  They get to spread their form of Wahhabism across the board.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  Now, Dr. Pacinic is probably one of the leading experts almost really happening in the Middle East.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  He successfully, as the head of Syops for the White House at the Camp David Accords, actually got the only effective peace treaty in the Middle East that held for any amount of time.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  And of course the leader of Egypt was later assassinated by a jihadist to basically unseat all of that.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And he can talk about Arabists, who they are, he can talk about the different players.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And he'll really give you a straight shot on this, but here's what I want to ask him.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  We have this gentleman and others in their families being brought into the country.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  We have 5 million, quote, refugees in Europe. It's in the hundreds of thousands here.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  They're keeping those numbers secret.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  They know there's going to be certain amounts of them that are being radicalized by ISIS propaganda.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  That is just the new name for al-Qaeda. They're going to attack.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And when they do attack, the government that brought them in should get the blame.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  But if there is a victory over common sense, instead they'll just say, we've got to have political correctness laws, hate speech laws that you can't criticize Islam.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  You're causing them to attack. That's what Europe's already done. Civil emergency in Germany and other areas.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  France, you name it. Sweden.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  But I just don't see that flying here in the United States.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  It's really waking up gun owners. Gun sales are now at record levels yet again.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Smith & Wester and others have raised prices today.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  A lot of liberals are going out buying guns.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  The homosexual community is really waking up that they were targeted by this guy, who reportedly didn't shoot black people.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  He said, I have no, quote, problem with blacks. Just bizarre behavior.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Now we learned he was on these gay dating apps, the Guardians reporting, and that he wanted the gay club alive.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  That's how he got in so easily.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Then he worked for this security company with ties to the CIA.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Now I want to be clear, when something's a false flag, we expose it.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  This is more of a stand down in that they brought these folks in.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  The FBI knew they were told to stand down by the State Department of all people.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Whistleblowers have gone public, just like San Bernardino.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  The FBI was ordered to stand down two years before when these people were going back and forth with Saudi Arabia.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  This guy did this too. This is Matan, Matan.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  So why is Obama so paralyzed on radical Islam?
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  Why are they bringing in so many of these people?
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  Who is Huma Abedin? The word is he's like a Saudi operative.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Hillary's girlfriend.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Is the White House blackmailed by Saudi Arabia? Are they just bought off by him?
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  We have video Saturday. General Petraeus walks out of Bilderberg.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Reporters walk up and he runs from them.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And our reporters chase him through the streets of Greslin.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  We're going to play that footage today. It's up on infowars.com.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  Peter Thiel got cornered. Had to answer questions.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  So a lot of big things are happening and Petraeus is getting all this money from the Saudis now.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  The Saudis are making a major move.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  Why is Europe bringing in 5 million people, 80% of military age men?
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  We had a stabbing today by a jihadist pledging allegiance in France to ISIS.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  This guy's brother-in-law is involved with Obama bringing the refugees in.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Suddenly in Austin, Texas, downtown or north or south, all over there are women with burqas, not just Ajibs everywhere.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  I mean, where I live, I'm seeing women in full Saudi Arabian slave outfits.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  It's freaking me out. So I don't want the Dick Cheney class of civilizations,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  but what do I do once they've stirred up the Middle East, made it fail, put radicals in?
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  They're bringing them into attack and they think they're going to blame gun owners and veterans for the deaths?
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  No, we're going to blame Hillary Clinton and Obama and the globalists and the neocons.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  So I only asked Dr. Pachinic where he thinks all this is going.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  I know he was coming on today to talk about a book he wrote about his mother,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  but he wants to do that another time, so we'll do that in a few weeks.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  But it's an interesting story. It's very political as well.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  But Dr. Pachinic obviously has been involved in all the world's special operations.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  One of the guys with General Boykin and others that founded Delta Force.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  I'm not going to go over his whole background. He's a psychiatrist and a medical doctor.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  He can speak of the psychology of all of this, and I don't know his views yet on it.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  We're going to find out. I respect him. I just want to get him on and get his views right now.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Dr. Pachinic, thanks for joining us. In the four minutes until break, what do you think really happened here?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  And what does this signify? And again, as I asked, is Obama blackmailed? Is he a closet Muslim?
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  I mean, I know they're trying to have a clash of civilizations. Are the globalists double-crossing the West?
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  And are they deciding to go Islamic long-term? What's happening?
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  What's really happening is we have a very dysfunctional intelligence system, in particular the FBI and the CIA.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  Let me go over this. Since 9-11, you have to remember that both the CIA, the FBI, military intelligence,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  and an entire group of security apparatus has joined in the stand-down false flight. Nothing has really changed.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  Obama was brought in, as I said to you, and nobody believed it. Obama, Clinton, Bush Jr., Bush Sr. by the CIA.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Then they put into the political arena where they're either Republican or Democrat.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  So really, we're talking about the incompetency of the CIA we've had since 1963?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  Yeah. In this case, it's the FBI. Let me go backwards and give you some basic points that should have been brought up, not by you.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  I always appreciate being on your show, but by people in general, two days ago I wrote a blog which said very clearly
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  that Martin was radicalized in his home. Number one, he was a homosexual.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  It was so obvious to me as a psychiatrist. It was obvious, and it should have been obvious, to the FBI and anybody
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  who interrogated him for seven months or 10 months that he was a closeted homosexual who wasn't closeted.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Now, why is this important? Because he went out for 150 miles, went to that club several times, which I suspect it was true,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  and in fact killed the very people to which he identified.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  Now, what makes that interesting in the Muslim religion is that Islam denies the importance and legitimacy of the gay homosexual.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  But on the other hand, they practice homosexuality. So you have this paradox in all of the Arab world where on the one hand,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  they will stone women and they will stone men who commit homosexual acts. But the very essence of Islam and bonding of the men is homosexual,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  but they don't call it that. They call it attraction and bonding of brotherhood. They use other words for it.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  So in fact, what you've seen is the very paradox of Islam, and it should have been brought out by the intelligence community,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  by the FBI, and it was obvious. Secondly, he was radicalized at home.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  He was radicalized by a father who was a musha hadeen. In fact, his father, who I wrote about, is named Sadiq Mir Matin.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  He's an Afghani musha hadeen who was brought in by the CIA. The FBI knew about it. He has a weekly radio show
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  where he goes in full military gala as a musha hadeen, that means that the Sunni Afghani who bemoans the fact that Pakistan is attacking Afghanistan.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Now, if the FBI didn't know that, this is pathetic, because in fact, the father lied when he said,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  I don't know anything about my son. It never occurred.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  Stay there. I'm going to come back and give you the floor. By the way, you did write this two days ago.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  It's all turned out to be dead on accurate. We're going to take your article, post it to infowars.com and say,
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  headline like psychiatrist accurately predicted that Orlando shooter was a homosexual radicalized at home.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  We're going to push that headline out, pointing out that it was first published actually on Sunday.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  So we're talking basically two and a half, three days ago.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  Dr. McKinnick knows his stuff. Top psych warfare expert.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist, author of 85 books and founder of the National Chain, Meyer Clinics,
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  to tell you about two your health liquid vitamins.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  I've been taking these every day for over a decade now, and I try to encourage every one of my clients to take them every day.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  There's a number of reasons. First of all, it's the best vitamins you can get. It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients in it.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  And then the most important reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients is because it's got brain food in it.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  It's got the essential amino acid. It's got tryptophan, philolamine, tyrosine, choline, vitamin B6,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  and these chemicals that are all natural from food turn into the brain chemicals that make you happy.

[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  Listen to what Dave Ryan says about Andrew 400.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  Andrew 400, I really love it. It's amazing to me that I feel so good. I've lost 50 pounds.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  I was a size 38 waist. I've gone down to a 32 waist. My mood has changed.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  I don't get stressed out. It gave me so much more energy. Energy to walk, energy to play sports.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Everything is starting to work again. It feels like I'm 25. My wife is happy. I'm so happy.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  I'm just a completely different man. I'm taking this stuff to the grave with me.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  Men, have you lost energy and gained belly fat? Are you feeling stressed out?

[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price,
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators,
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for infill-wars listeners.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.

[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  Dr. Steve Pachinick, again, is retired, but he's one of the top former experts for the Pentagon, the State Department, you name it,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  on psychological operations with foreign governments, overthrow of governments, stabilization of governments, you name it.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  And he's seen it all, folks. And the info he's given us over the years has always been so accurate, especially long-term.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  I personally am so upset about all these radical Muslims they're bringing in, they're protecting, they're allowing to attack.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  They bring in the latest groups, they then radicalize the last group that was already here.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And a lot of this, from my own, just lay psychology studying it, they don't feel wanted, they don't feel like they're part of the culture.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  They're very conflicted. You're mixing folks from radical Orthodox Islamic countries with one of the wildest, laissez-faire, decadent societies out there.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  I don't agree with all the decadence. I don't endorse it, but in a free society, you have to let it operate.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  Well, you bring people in where daddy's got a radio show saying kill the gays, and your emom says kill the gays, and you're sneaking off to the gay nightclub.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  And then finally, you have a breakdown and want to commit suicide by cop.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  And plus, Islamic State saying go out and kill, it's a mentally ill mindset.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  I mean, this just all fits, from my own study of Islam, the massive amount of homosexuality and pedophilia.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  That's what I talked about yesterday, and they had a bunch of newspapers attack me.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  But here is US government top psychiatrist that helped write the Camp David Accords.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  Okay? He's telling you the same thing I told you, but I'm just a lay person that's done basic research.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Dr. Pachennick, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, but is my statement there someone accurate that it's a culture shock as well for these people?
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  Well, there's no question of bringing in Muslims in general is a culture shock.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  But we have to differentiate that very important objective here is one of the reasons why we have gone and opened up Iran,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  which was a very important strategic move was to literally neutralize Saudi Arabia, UAE, and the Emirates, and Kuwait.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  Because they had for a long time under the CIA, under our military support, been extruding out all of these terrorist groups.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  So Iran, in effect, which is a Shiite country, does not have the same demonstration or the same profile as you have in the Sunnis.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  The Shiites have been doing the major part of our war in Syria against the Sunnis in Yemen, and they have been taking the bulwark of this entire war.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  But with all due respect, I want to put in perspective number one, which was considered a terrorist group comes out of Lebanon.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  These are the young men who fight literally 10 minutes from their house.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  Imagine going from Austin 10 minutes out and are fighting ISIS hand-to-hand combat without the support that we give them.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  At the same time, the Kurds who have been suppressed by the Sunnis and the Saudis are fighting so you can't make a generalized state.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  No, I totally understand. We're talking about Wahhabist, Saudi Arabia, ISIS.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  I understand, but we have to appreciate that there are forces now in play where our special forces like Kennedy go in and help out our forces in Iraq and Syria.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  And in fact, the intelligence reports, and unfortunately it's not coming forth to the public, it shows that we're degrading ISIS.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  This was not an ISIS-inspired entity because if you give ISIS that credit and let it do legitimacy, we're really putting ISIS up there when in fact it's a pathetic organization that is no longer vital.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  I understand. So is that why Saudi Arabia is freaking out and staging terror?
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Saudi Arabia is freaking out for many reasons.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Number one, the king who's in charge has to put a prince who's 30 years old, totally incompetent, totally untutored, who's starting a war in Yemen, doesn't know what to do.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  They have 50% unemployment among their youth. They can't pump out any oil. They had to do an IPO on their oil that was there.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Namely, they have to commoditize the little oil they have and they have failed as an entity.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  So we're seeing the fall of the House of Saud potentially?
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  Correctly. You're seeing the fall of the House of Saud, of Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, all of those countries created by the British and the French are being destroyed.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  And that's happening as a result of American power.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  And that's why we've seen the French and NATO double-crossing trying to back ISIS?
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  Well, the truth of ISIS is that Syria and Russia, while they're fighting them, is also supplying them. Always remember that in the war of anything, we both supply the people and we fight them.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  It's never one or the other. Remember 9-11, we support these people and then we fought again.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  Sure. Well, that's pretty much what I figured was going on here. But then I want to break down the players, different power blocks with Dr. Pashinik and get more into this whole jihad Saudi Arabia culture.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Do we expect more frequent attacks? What culturally comes out of that, Dr. Pashinik is our guest.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  Despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works, here's five reasons why it won't.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  Number one, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  Number two, Paris, France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world, but those laws also did nothing to stop the November 13th ISIS attacks.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  Number three, it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago, yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who are openly defying Mexico's gun laws to form self-defeats malicious.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  Number five, President Obama has been arming and funding ISIS-linked Syrian rebels for quite some time.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  In fact, Obama approved the re-arming of the so-called moderate rebels on October 1st. The same day, he called for gun control in response to the commuting college shooting up in Oregon.

[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Who is one of the most famous, unfamous soldiers. He's known for the UFC fighting. People think he's even out of the military and he's not out of the military.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  And let's just say we've got some really good reporters on the ground around the world.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  And I'm just amazed at how patriotic and awake the military is.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  I've got to say, it's not a cliche, it just tends to be the army over and over again that exposes 9-11, that exposes Benghazi, that's exposing what's happening in Orlando.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  By the way, Joe Biggs has huge breaking news. Let's try to get Joe Biggs on at about 45 after with that breaking news directly from the groups on the ground in Orlando.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  They're looking at accomplices, all right? Well, they found it. And we're going to break it here, all right?
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  But I'm going to be honest with you, I have pretty good self-control. I'm on the air 300 plus days a year.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  I'm just so upset in general by all the illogic and corruption and things I'm seeing and Hillary Clinton getting away with all these crimes that I physically got so angry last hour I could hardly be on air.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  And I guess I've got to ask Dr. Pachynic, who's a psychiatrist, you know, that phenomenon, how to calm down from that?
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Because I've had one cup of coffee today, I'm flying, I'm speeding right now, like I'm on methamphetamine and I'm not. And it's just the climate.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  And every time I feel like this historically, you know, I have a good spider sense. Everybody has a sixth sense.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  And I just see things lining up politically, economically in a very, very dangerous way.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  And I know that there are actually good forces in our government that are trying to counterman the bad forces.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And I'd always been told those forces were there. And of course, you know, there's good and bad, but organized.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  And then we learned what Dr. Pachynic and Colonel Schaefer and countless others told us on air and off air in the last five, six years that our own military was blocking al-Qaeda and then ISIS.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  That was a term to confuse the public and that we were aiding the Russians to take them out.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  And even Sy Hersh came on a few months ago and thanked our broadcast and said we were accurate and good sources and that we were correct.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  And then of course, Dr. Pachynic came on and talked about it, but I'm not here bragging about this. This is surreal.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  I don't want the responsibility of being this close to the center of all this, but then I sit around and I see a bunch of jellyfish that don't even know which end is up.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  And I mean men that are successful in business and life. They've got high IQs, beautiful wives, great kids, but they don't think it's their responsibility to be involved or care.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  And I just, I've psychoanalyzed myself. I am raging at men who are not being men because, man, I don't want to see us have a nuclear war.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  I don't want to see a great depression. I don't want to see things unravel.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  And let me tell you, it is unraveling and our political class are the ones accelerating that. And there are good people in government corporations and private institutions.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  They're trying to stop it. But I tell you, just, just, I look at the whole continuum of it and it's going in a very frightening direction.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  I know Pachynic's an optimist and, you know, always can give us the incredible inside baseball on what the thinking is of groups that don't want to destroy the country in the world.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  But just at a gut level absorbing it all, I've never been more angry. I'll just be in its controlled anger.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  It's controlled anger, but I am just sick dealing with it. And I'm going to get his view on that here in a moment and then speak of the devil.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  We have a clip shot two weeks ago by Tim Kennedy that wasn't going to be released till tomorrow talking about political correctness will kill you.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  So that's coming up in the next hour. We're going to premiere that here.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Tim Kennedy is working with Info Wars now and a lot of other great folks to be working with Info Wars, you know, taking the globalist on.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  But we're going to go back to Dr. Pachynic in a moment. I didn't plug anything in the first hour, which is crazy and I skipped two ads.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  I got to stop doing that. We need you to buy the products and support this operation.

[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  That's why it's so hard to, we've been sold out for six months because it's hard to get 27 ingredients
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  to pass California standards, and we always shoot for that.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  But we now have it back in stock, but it's about to sell out. The special is over,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  but you can still get Living Defense at InfoWarsLifes.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Now again, Dr. Steve Pachennick is with us.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  I do want to have him back up. If we can get him to come on and talk about it.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  He wanted to talk about terrorism today, about the book about his mother, a voyage of survival,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  living and love, Steve R. Pachennick, MD, PhD, because it will really give you a bird's-eye view
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  on what people have gone through, try to get to America, and why there's so many great people
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  that have come to this nation that actually now are the bedrock of it,
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  but find out about it and get the book at StevePachennick.com.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  He did not want to get into that today. He wanted to talk about the issues that we were just getting into.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  So, shut the table for us. I know I do a disservice.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  If I talk about the horrible pedophile hordes of the Wahhabist and associate that with the Shiites
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  who are a completely different group and are archenemies with the House of Sa'd.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  So, let's spend some time on this. What do you expect the fall of the House of Sa'd to look like?
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  How far into it we are? What do you expect their death rows to be?
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  They're bragging they have nuclear weapons, which we know they've had for a while, according to my sources.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  Where does all this go? How do the Russians tie in with Syria? Dr. Pachennick?
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  Here's what we really have. Let's go back to home.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Number one, we have to ask for the resignation of James Comey and the FBI interrogators.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  He has been a disaster. I have been waiting for his indictment of Hillary, which was not a brain teaser.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  It was obvious it was necessary. He did not perform accordingly.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  Therefore, his performance on this last interview or this last inability to figure out who my team was,
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  which was basically a 101 class in interrogation and intelligence,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  should be the basis on which he resigns, Loretta Lynch resigns, and the FBI has to be reprimanded.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  From the very beginning, when I started the Hanafi Muslim hostage negotiation,
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  the FBI has proven to be a disastrous dysfunctional organization
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  for which we have paid a tremendous amount of dollars who was involved with Mueller in 9-11.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  I ask that the American public send...
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Okay.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Dr. Pachennick, we lost your cell phone there for a moment. Are you there?
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  He dropped me to get him back. He's always only on cell phone. It's a pretty clear cell phone.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  We are allied with radical Islam.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  The globalists are double-crossing us. The radical Islamists have bought off our politicians
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  while the group that has done all this is on the verge of collapse.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  It's admitted that Saudi Arabia is tottering and teetering.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  They had to borrow $10 billion last month to pay their bills.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  I mean, these loons are completely spoiled rotten. They're completely disconnected from reality.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  And then they're out there funding ISIS to run around and tell everybody to go out and jihad and kill.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  And you've got this guy from Afghanistan radicalized by his father, and we did cover that by Sunday,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  and by his family, and by his imam saying kill homosexuals.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  And then Obama says this isn't Islam.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  And notice how Dr. Pachennick points out the bizarreness where homosexuality is generally 2-3% of the population in the West.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  We're talking 20-30% in Islam, in Wahhabist Islam.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  And the slave trading and just all of it, it is just so crazy that it is the most barbarous
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  over-the-top civilization anyone has ever seen other than maybe North Korea.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  And they just execute and kill whoever they want.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  And then all over my Facebook and Twitter, there's rainbow flags getting posted going,
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  Alex, you're a homophobe, you know, you gun owners, you're going to get it and all this stuff.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  It's just the idiocy. It blows my mind completely that this is going on.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  And it really frustrates me. Dr. Pachennick, your phone cut out.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  You were getting into the details here about the situation with Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  FBI has to go down. It has to be reprimanded. It has to be totally reorganized.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  It has to be thrown out. Comey has to leave.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  The other individuals within the FBI and the senior levels must be fired.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Obama cannot do it. He is a weak president.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  I said it from very the day he began that he was a CIA package that came in through his mother,
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  his grandparents, and that's the CIA bringing in.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  The CIA has to be held accountable. It too has to be put in place.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  If Mike Flynn comes in, General Flynn comes in, who might be the DNI,
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  Director of National Intelligence under Trump, we might put it under control.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  But let me get to the issue that you were upset about to betray us.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  General Petraeus has unfortunately been a very poor general and really did not stand out
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  for much of what we thought as Americans, as military officers, and as intelligence officers.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  He was specifically placed in there by me and others as the director of the CIA
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  to have military command and control of a civilian entity that really is out of control.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Unfortunately, Petraeus betrayed us by having given eight of his books to his honey-trapped individual,
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  the woman who did the biography and or and Obama had the information on him.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  So he's weak. He failed and in fact he was discredited.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  I hope nobody really pays any more attention.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  But what happens in the system is they promote him up and they give him the four stars
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  when he's really done very little. He was shot by his own friend in a gun range
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  and he was a terrible general and a terrible DCI.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  That's his legacy. The point of fact is we continued.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  And the reason why your good reviewer or reporter found him scared is that he is a scared individual.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  He went through and went up the political ranks.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  Now we get to the real problem.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  The real problem is we need a leader who can in fact change and redirect our entire government
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  away from what it's been dysfunctional, incapac and capable of really doing anything
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  and really destroying our own people.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  The 9-11 did not go away.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  These are all of the overshoots of what happens when a government destroys its own people.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  In turn, that's why I believe we had the right to arm ourselves. We had the right to form militias.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  We had the right to do what we need to do in order to neutralize an illegal, a totally illegitimate government.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  And I've said it from day one, although you got very angry on me,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  I've said it from the very beginning that we need a political and possibly military solution
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  that comes from the people and possibly our own military.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  Well, clearly we've already had a coup, a foreign special interest in multinationals through the CIA
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  and the National Security Act by the 70s and 80s.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  They were able to take over.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  And then we need a counter coup, my friend.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  What I've been asking for since 9-11 is the Bush family has to be held accountable and the Clintons.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  What came forth?
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  We had the Bush family and their representatives, the Rubios, the Ted Cruz's and all of that.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  We got rid of them through a man called Trump.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  The Clintons have not been rid, and they have.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  Well, let's get your take on Trump, because I've been told by folks very close to Trump,
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  and we've talked to Trump, obviously, on air and off air.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  I'll just leave it at that, that Trump, quote, knows everything, quote, everything.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Trump knows everything, but I'm concerned that he's being co-opted by many of the regular routine Republicans.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  I would not have put in manifold or a whole bunch of these guys who make a living by going around and lobbying other Republicans.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  I don't think Trump needs it.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  I think his own instincts were very good.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  He worked off of his instincts.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  And honestly, many of his advisors are just the retreads of people who worked for Doe, who worked for Ben Carson and others.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Well, I know they do, but they admit they were wrong and part of the CIA takeover, and actually say they want to overthrow that.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  But that's not the issue.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  The issue is, are they effective?
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  And in my mind, they're not really that effective.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Roger Stone is.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  There are others who were close to Trump.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Corey Lengowski was very effective.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  But once you dilute out that ability, once you have to have him control a massive group of Republicans who need to fund him,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  they're getting into trouble again.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  And that's why I'm asking the American people to be prepared for what may be a major confrontation with another corrupt government,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  and that is the Clintons, because I am not sure that Trump can make it through.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Once he has to depend on the good graces of other Republicans and funding from major Republican entities,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  they're going to ask much from him.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  And I had believed that he should have had self-funding, or at least funding from them.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Here's the thing.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  He obviously did self-fund the first phase, but he needs the funding to get there.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  I understand it's a problem, but the bottom line is I've been told that Trump says I'm taking your money,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  but I'm going to do what I want.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  You understand that.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  This money is not buying your support.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  And the problem is, though, they're then saying fine, we're not giving you the money, and he's not getting money.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  So, so far, he's not getting money because he won't play ball.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  Well, that's what has to happen, and then the people have to give him the money through our own donations
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  that are going to be whatever they're going to be.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  But once you hire on board the man of force of this country and the others who demand $20 million for being lobbyists
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  and claim that they put in Bush Sr., when, in fact, he had nothing to do with that,
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  it was Roger Ailes Baker and myself.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  And he had no idea of what he was talking about.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  It's the same issue again of these Republicans who are retread.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  They are retread one way or the other at the other in a calisthenia or whatever's name,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  that the slimy guy goes on Castellana, who lip-goes on television and reprimands Trump.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  All of these guys are being brought in.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  Now, either Trump makes a statement and discards all of them and remains in Cory Landau.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  Well, hold on. We've got Joe Biggs with the breaking news.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  But we'll get back to you, Dr. Piccini, as well. Stay with us.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  From Orlando, straight ahead, Joe Biggs.

[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  To telling only lies, to telling only lies.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  But my dreams, but my dreams, they aren't as empty.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  Dr. Steven Schenick is our guest, StevenSchenick.com. He's coming back with us at the start of the next hour.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  We can't pop in any time right now, but Joe Biggs reporting from the ground in Orlando, Florida, where I know we have sources inside the National Level Terrorism Investigation.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  I'll just leave it at that. And there are reports that they want to target the press.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  But we've got more information now on the investigation into accomplices of the shooter in Orlando that killed at least 49 people.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  Joe Biggs, what do you have?
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Roger that. Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Now, we are in Orlando where we've been investigating this terror attack that took place at the Pulse Nightclub.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  And the FBI has just come out and said that Omar Mateen's wife had knowledge of the attack before.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Now, days ago when she was asked by the FBI if she had any knowledge, she lied and said no.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  She also admitted to going to the stores with him to buy ammunition. Her and Omar also cased out Disney numerous times,
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  and many other times she drove him to the Pulse Nightclub to scope out the place.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  This could be the actual accomplice, or there could be another person as well.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  But we've had these reports of multiple shooters inside. I talked to a survivor of the shooting who was actually inside the club.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  I talked to a guy whose friend was the bartender that night, and each person said they heard multiple guns going off,
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  and it was impossible for one person to do this. So was she part of this?
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  I wonder if they were inspired by the couple in San Bernardino that both went and carried that attack out.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  So this leaves a lot. We know the father was a Taliban sympathizer, so this is really interesting.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  I mean, we have someone like Huma Aberdeen right beside Hillary Clinton that has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood,
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  and we have all these attacks starting to happen, and there's something fishy going on.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Absolutely. I know this. Obama acts like either the Muslim Brotherhood's blackmailing him or something's going on.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  This Huma Aberdeen, Dr. Pachennick, what's your information on her?
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  A lot of folks are saying she's a Saudi operative.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Well, here's where we get into the intelligence community and what I said a long time ago.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  When the CIA recruits an individual, particularly a president of the United States,
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  there has to be a psychological deficit and lacuna in their personality.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  In the case of Bill Clinton, it was the fact his mother was a prostitute.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  She ran a whorehouse in the hope Arkansas, and he was nothing but the bastard child of the John.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  In the case of Obama, he was known to be a homosexual in Chicago with Rami Emanuel,
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  who was trained in ballet dancer, and he was recruited by the CIA repeatedly
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  and basically threatened by them and the Muslim Brotherhood and everything else.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  That's why the political correctness comes in.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  Now in the case of Hillary Clinton, I've known her for years, and I've known her of other family members.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  She is a well-known lesbian. The reason why she's been recruited and can be threatened,
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  she's had a history of lesbian affairs, which is relevant only to the fact that it's a national security problem.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  Aberdeen may be her lover. Aberdeen may be her lesbian lover. I could care less.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  But the point of fact is that not one of our presidents presently or in the future,
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  other than Trump, is a highly compromised candidate.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  And that's why they hate Trump. He's not compromised. He's open about women.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  Let me go into the other element. I have always implicated the secret service.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  They have never served our country. They have always served the person that they were supposed to protect.
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Hold on. Seventy seconds. We're back with you, Anne Big. Stay with us. Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  Tell your friends and family to join in now, folks. Sign up for the free newsletter.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  By the way, I'm going to be on 6-7 tonight. 6-8. Ask me anything at infowars.com.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  I forgot to talk about that.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  Supermail vitality is infowarslife.com's number one selling product for a good reason. It works.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  Go to infowarslife.com today and read the testimonials for yourself. There are thousands of them.

[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimicers
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  Supermail vitality from infowarslife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.

[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  I'm Alex Jones for Supermail Vitality and infowarslife.com, and I salute you, our supporters.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  The Empire, we face, is systems of corruption and crony centralization.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  We're the Renaissance. We're not perfect, but that's what I promote. It's what I push.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  It's what's giving us everything good we've got today.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  In my view, Dr. Steve Pachennick's our guest. Joe Biggs is calling in with the breaking report.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  He's been filing amazing reports, newsmaking reports from Orlando at infowars.com and presidentplanet.com.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  So finishing it with both men, then I'm coming back and covering all the news, video clips, you name it, audio clips.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  Dr. Pachennick, we're finishing a point about the Secret Service being sycophantic.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  They're totally sycophantic. They have been. Their only duty is to protect the person in charge.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  They knew very well what happened in 9-11. They knew very well that the Clintons were compromised,
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  even though there was one book that came out and that was it.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  They knew very well Obama's history of homosexuality before and after and in the future.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  They know very well what the issues are with the Clintons.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  And in fact, we're funding nothing more than the Royal Guard who has no loyalty to America.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  This whole issue of the Treasury bills and the fake dollars, that's nonsense.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  The point of fact is the Secret Service has to be cleaned out, has to be reorganized,
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  and it's only a man like Trump or others like myself who could come in and fire them summarily.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  They're basically drunks, they're hormones, and they really waste our money.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  Dr. Pachennick, I want to briefly come back, this is a short segment.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  I want to finish it with bigs and just ask you, with your sources, but also your trained eye,
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  where the country is now, where the world is briefly, and what you would do if you were Donald Trump.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  I know for a fact, a lot of the info from the show gets correctly to his desk.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  So I'm going to put you on hold, come back to you after the break.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  No problem.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  T minus four and a half minutes.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  Bigs, I know you've got a lot of intel.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  Follow those video reports.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  We'll get some of those there in the fourth hour and up on infowars.com.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  What else can you report on the ground for Orlando?
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  All right, so what we have so far is actually before, I was actually hanging out last night and Billy Corgan ran into me
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  and we were hanging out, but before that happened, something really interesting happened.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  This man walked up to me and he goes, Joe Biggs, and I go, yeah?
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  He goes, I have some information for you.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  He says, one of my really good friends is Louis Burbano, the guy that was holding the door shut at the nightclub.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  And he said, he wanted me to tell you what happened.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  So the guy came up to me and they just called me like an hour ago and told me I could go public and tell this whole story.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  But the kid's nervous.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  He's been getting death threats, but he said what happened was that they were running outside of the nightclub.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  He opened the door and saw that it was a gated, a fenced in area.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  And there was a few people out there and he decided to shut the door so the shooter could not come outside and start killing those people.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  So he held the door shut from what the story is.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  He held the door shut until people were able to pry that fence open and get a hole big enough for people to go through.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  And then that's when he removed himself from that area and let people come out.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  But he was scared that if everyone ran out there and they were caged in like a whole bunch of chickens that they would just get mowed down and killed.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  And that's why he held the door shut and they showed me a video of him soaked in blood, covered in blood from head to toe in a video that they don't want to use it.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  Well, again, I should have thought Megan Kelly such a snake.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  She spends everything.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  So if we were wrong, we apologize for going with her report.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  That makes a lot more sense.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  Tell him, don't be scared.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  Get all this out right now, Joe.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Just really pressure these folks.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  He's going through depression right now.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  His buddy's worried that he might do something bad.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  He's been getting death threats.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  People are coming up to him.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  And he's scared.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  I mean, he's a younger guy.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  He is a homosexual.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  He had no ill intention of anything.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  He was just doing what he thought was best.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  I understand.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  And in the time and all that, and then Megan Kelly misrepresented it, perhaps, and then we took it wrong.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  Now that more of the story's out, part of the problem is he was looking at his phone.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  He seemed confused.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  He made him look guilty.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  He needs to come on here and clarify it, and then that's what will reverse all this.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  So if you can get him to come on via video Skype or tape it, tell him, get it out.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  Explain what happened.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  Don't stumble through it.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  And then he'll be left alone.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  He needs to respond to that.

[03:29:40.000 --> 03:30:08.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:36.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:30:36.000 --> 03:31:00.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:28.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:56.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:31:56.000 --> 03:32:24.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:52.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:32:52.000 --> 03:33:20.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:48.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:40.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:24.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:30.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  We're going to make this better.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  It only took three minutes for Obama to basically blame the American people. What would a real president have said? Take President Eisenhower, for instance. He would have simply told Americans to arm themselves under the Second Amendment. And now Obama has the nerve to call it homegrown terrorism.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:20.000]  As far as we can tell right now, this is certainly an example of the kind of homegrown extremism that all of us have been so concerned about for a very long time.
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  Obama, there is nothing even remotely resembling American values or culture in this attack. Stop using homegrown terror for your soundbites. You're clearly blaming the American people for beliefs that originate in the Middle East. They are not grown here at home.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  This new benchmark of the brutal slaughter of Americans on American soil is a clear indication that the FBI, DHS, and federal government are not only unable to do the job our tax dollars are funding, bottom line, they are growing the radical Islamic invasion. How about that for homegrown Obama?
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:13.000]  Carlos the Jackal wrote forward to an Islamist book recently from prison. Of course, they let him do that. He's got a sweet in prison. And it says that only a coalition of Islamist and socialist forces can defeat the United States.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  And in the Obama administration, we get a twofer. We've got them both covered, raised by Frank Marshall Davis in Hawaii, the Communist, and then trained in Madrasa schools. So we've got both of them in one, folded together in one.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  After the Benghazi attack, there were hearings, the State Department, a State Department official came out with a quote that should be in everybody's mind. The Taliban is inside the building. He was referring to Huma Abedin, Valerie Jarrett, and others who are allied closely with a Muslim brotherhood.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:43:16.000]  When Obama came in, he had all of the law enforcement and intelligence agency doctrines and training methods purged of any mention of Islamic jihad. Imagine trying to fight World War II, but you were not allowed to say Nazi, SS, Gestapo, or Hitler because it would offend all the decent, moderate Germans. That's how crazy it is today.
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:26.000]  Obama and anyone previously responsible are currently protecting this agenda that has breached our national security should immediately be arrested.
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  The transformation of America has been in the full swing ever since 2008. Now, there's no question, we got a hell of a job ahead of us. With the Muslim brotherhood, penetration in every one of our national security agencies, including all our intelligence agencies,
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:44:08.000]  and has been reported by some, our lead intelligence agency headed by a Muslim convert, this is not going to be an easy task.
[03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:26.000]  The longer these Saudi Arabian lackeys are in power, the more Americans will be slaughtered. Stop the madness. Arm yourselves, America. Aggressively protect your first and second amendment rights. The globalists are bringing a war to your backyard.
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  Great report by John Bown. As you heard at the very end, he quoted retired Navy Admiral James Ace Lyons saying, we supposedly have someone running our intelligence community that is a converted Muslim.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  That would be Brennan. Now, John Brennan is somebody who has been a lawyer covering for Obama's policy of assassination and other issues. But I think it was very telling that he went to Saudi Arabia.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:17.000]  Just recently, as I mentioned in the last segment, he said to them on Saudi television, imagine, have you ever heard of a CIA director going to a foreign country that is being accused of assisting a terrorist act in our country?
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  Have you ever heard of the CIA chief going? Of course, they didn't have a CIA at the time we had Hitler and Nazi, but what if we had the CIA during the Cold War?
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:36.000]  What if the CIA chief went to Russian television and said, don't worry, there's an investigation of you spying on us or doing something to us, but they're not going to find anything.
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:42.000]  I guarantee they're not going to find anything. This is what John Brennan did. He went to Saudi Arabia, went on live television.
[03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:54.000]  They translated his comments into Arabic, overdubbed it in Arabic, and he said, I think the 28 pages will be published. I support their publication. Everyone will see the evidence that the Saudi government had nothing to do with it.
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:46:06.000]  He's going to take care of that for them. And this is a guy, and one of the reasons, besides people reporting that they have firsthand knowledge of this, look at the public acts of this man.
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  Besides going to Saudi television this last week, this is a guy who refused to take the oath of office on the Bible. He wouldn't swear on the Bible.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  Now, of course, the Muslim congressman, I think it's Keith Ellison out of Michigan, if my memory serves me correctly, he would not take the oath of office on the Bible.
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  John Brennan did. He didn't want to pull out a Quran. So he said, I'll take it on the Constitution. But of course, then he says, we've got to get rid of the Fourth Amendment, that Constitution that he swore the oath on.
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  So he would not swear the oath of office on a Bible. He has gone to Mecca to places where non-Muslims have never been allowed to go.
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:47:02.000]  And he also, within the intelligence community, has banned the term jihad from being used within the intelligence community. So if John Brennan is not a Muslim convert, he is definitely doing everything he can to support what they are doing.
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  And again, Hillary Clinton, who has gotten 20% of her campaign from the Saudis, is telling us that the only way we're going to stop these terrorist attacks is to stop them from getting the weapons they need.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  She says it's essential we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attacks. So she's using that to argue for gun control.
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  We have to turn this around. We have to say this is not an argument. This is not a situation that's going to be solved by gun control.
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  It's not going to be solved by background checks. The guy was investigated three times by the FBI. He was given statewide licenses by the state.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  He was hired by the largest private security firm in the world. None of these background checks, including the ones where he legally bought weapons at a store, not online, as Hillary Clinton is intimating that he did.
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  No, he bought him at a store. He had all the background checks and he was vetted at every level, federal, state, homeland security, his private employer. Nobody found anything on this guy.
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  More background checks aren't going to do it. If we can't do background checks like that on people coming in that are here, how are we going to do background checks on the people coming across the border?
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:13.000]  How are you going to have gun control if you can't have border control? So they don't want that.
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  As I pointed out, the people who have been responsible for over half of the deadly attacks in the past decade are second generation people like this shooter in Orlando.
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:34.000]  Why is that? Well, think about it. What are they being taught in school? They're being taught that the U.S. is bad. They're being taught that by our federally controlled schools.
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  They're being taught that white privilege is bad. The founders are bad. The principals this country was founded upon are bad. They've got their social justice committees that they're now setting up in schools, which sound like some kind of a Marxist nightmare.
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  But of course, they don't want them to identify with America. They don't want them to join America. We used to talk about how America was the great melting pot.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  Everybody brings something into the country and we all mix it together and we get something that didn't exist before anywhere else, some unique blend of all these backgrounds and cultures.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  They don't want that. They don't want the melting pot. They want the tossed salad. They want people to remain distinct because if they remain distinct and separate from each other in their own little enclaves or in the case of the Muslims
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  in their own self-setup and self-maintained ghettos because they don't want to mix with the outside people. That happens in many cases. They encourage them not to learn the language.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:38.000]  They want us to pay for their education in a different language other than English. So they don't even want them to have a common language with us.
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:46.000]  What was the tower of Babel about? Oh, you separate people by language and they can't work together. They won't work together.
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  It will be the foundation of confusion and conflict and that is what our government is engineering with these people who come in.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:13.000]  That's why the second generation is worse than the first. They have no concept of the places that they came from that even though their parents may not feel comfortable in this culture, they know that what they came from was worse than what they have here.
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  But the kids don't know that. And the kids don't want to be identified as American because that's got too many connotations of being connected to these white males and stuff.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  So let's come up with a separate identity. And that's when you get these Laraza judges that are coming against Trump. That's when you get this shooter in Orlando.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  Okay, these people come in like this judge, heavily pushing Laraza, push everything for the race, for people outside of the race, nothing.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  And he comes against Trump. It was about Laraza just like it's about Islam for this guy. This guy mocked his classmates and celebrated at 9-11.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  He said this is what America deserves and then he shoots 50 people because the second generation hates us the most. We'll be right back.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  My name is Don Wiskin and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  What did I do? I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:04.000]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I'm a former 22 year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:08.000]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious drought.
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:17.000]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:30.000]  It's a home freeze dryer. With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.

[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  I want to talk about the subtle ways that the media and the politicians control us with language.
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  Just a subtle difference will make all the difference in the world.
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  Before I do, we have a special on Alexa Pure Water Filters. All of our filters from the largest filters down to the shower filters are now 20% off at infowarstore.com.
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:44.000]  That's the Alexa Pure filtration system that removes 99.999% of bacteria, disinfectants, volatile, organic contaminants, and hormones all the way down to the shower filter.
[03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  That's for a limited time, only 20% off all the Alexa Pure water filters at infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  Now, how do they subtly do this?
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:55:01.000]  Well, let's take a look at the Washington Post, which has really turned into a master propaganda organization lately when it comes to Donald Trump especially.
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  They put out this story saying the Russian government hackers have penetrated the DNC, the Democrat National Committee.
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  They stole opposition research on Trump.
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  Oh, see, they didn't give anything on the Democrats. It's only on Trump. See how they pivot this?
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:24.000]  It's an amazing spin they put on this thing to say, oh, this wasn't, they don't want you to think about or maybe suddenly, you know, pushing this away from Hillary Clinton.
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  You think that this was on a private server? Do you think that the Russian government had interest in Hillary Clinton's private server when she was Secretary of State?
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  You think if they could hack the DNC's private server that they would have hacked her server? Of course they would have.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  We just reported last week, 50 times now it's come out in a FOIA request, 50 times the Federal Reserve has been hacked into by multiple sources.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  They're looking at their deliberations as to whether or not they're going to raise or lower interest rates because as the people said when the Federal Reserve was being created,
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  Senator Lindbergh said, you're giving people the power to manipulate markets to make them rise, to make them fall, to know the timing of those rises and falls in the marketplace.
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  You're giving them incredible power and wealth to do that and of course people can now hack, if you've got the right tools, you can now hack into the private discussions of the Federal Reserve and get that information.
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  Or you can get all of the federal government's data on all of its employees, that's been done too.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  So why wouldn't we think that they would get Hillary Clinton's private email server?
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  The Washington Post spends it and says, oh, it's about Donald Trump. They're getting opposition research on Donald Trump.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  You think they can't get that elsewhere? You think the Democrats know something about Donald Trump that the Russians don't know?
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  They're just trying to push you away from that. Here's another example of subtle deceit and that's the new gun control group that David Petraeus is putting out there.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  They call it the Veterans Coalition for Common Sense and they're going to be coming after the guns of veterans and David Petraeus says this.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:07.000]  He says, we need to do more to prevent gun tragedies.
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  As service members, each of us swore an oath to protect our Constitution and the homeland.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  Now we're asking leaders to do more to protect our rights and save lives.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  Yes, please protect our rights and take away our guns. Please honor your oath to the Constitution and destroy it.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  We've got Paul Ryan saying a Muslim ban is not in our country's interest coming out and attacking Donald Trump.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  He's never attacked Obama like this, but he attacks Donald Trump and he misstates it.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:39.000]  He says, I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interest.
[03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  Paul Ryan, that is a lie. Donald Trump has never called for a Muslim ban.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:48.000]  The Hill actually got it right. They were actually honest about this.
[03:57:48.000 --> 03:57:54.000]  They say Trump doubled down on his plan to temporarily ban nearly all Muslims.
[03:57:54.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  It's a temporary ban, not to ban everybody. That's the way they're spinning this.
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:02.000]  That's another subtle thing, but then sometimes they're not so subtle.
[03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  This new article from Kit Daniels, Rolling Stone demands a repeal of the Second Amendment.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  This is a constitutional lawyer, so-called constitutional lawyer, says the Second Amendment is a threat to liberty.
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  Sometimes you just have to acknowledge the founders and the Constitution are wrong, said David Cohen in the Rolling Stones magazine.
